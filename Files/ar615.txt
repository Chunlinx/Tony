                    Introduction        Arthritic diseases are characterized by a progressive        loss of extracellular matrix ECM which may ultimately        lead to frank tissue loss and gross joint damage The        conditions under which chondrocytes can be induced to        replenish or repair a depleted matrix and thereby prevent        or slow the disease process remain unclear If these        conditions were known then in principal one could design a        therapeutic strategy that takes into account the capacity        or absence thereof for chondrocytes to repair their        matrix naturally        A number of model systems have provided some insights        For instance ILdegraded cartilage tissues and cell        suspensions are frequently employed as model systems to        study cartilage metabolism under osteoarthritislike        conditions       and to assess the efficacy of        various drug therapies         IL signals cells        via cell surface receptors to upregulate proteases matrix        metalloproteinases and aggrecanase while downregulating        matrix metalloproteinase inhibition and proteoglycan        synthesis      The ultimate effect of these        metabolic changes include damage to the ECM loss of ECM        components especially proteoglycan and alteration of the        normal balance of catabolic and anabolic processes that        regulate cartilage ECM composition        With regard to the repair phase following ILinduced        cartilage damage relatively little is known but partial        to complete recovery appears possible      In studies        of repair investigators focused on glycosaminoglycan GAG         an important and abundant cartilage macromolecule  and        used histologic biochemical andor radiolabel        incorporation methods to measure GAG concentration GAG        andor GAG synthesis rates at selected time points        Although these data suggest that repair might be possible        our understanding is limited because of the uncertainty in        the temporal changes in matrix composition for a given        sample This uncertainty is a direct consequence of the        inherently destructive nature of histologic and biochemical        methods these techniques therefore do not permit        monitoring of the spatial and temporal evolution of matrix        macromolecules within individual samplesanimals Having to        infer temporal spatial information from a crosssection of        samples confounds efforts to conduct a detailed analysis of        responses in these model systems        The delayed GadoliniumEnhanced Magnetic Resonance        Imaging of Cartilage dGEMRIC method overcomes these        problems in that it is nondestructive and can be used to        assess quantitatively the spatial distribution of cartilage        GAG      We and others previously reported on the        use of dGEMRIC to monitor GAG regeneration in living        cartilage tissue over time in trypsindepleted bovine        cartilage    and in cellladen polymer matrices tissue        engineered cartilage     Those studies clearly        demonstrated that dGEMRIC is feasible for longterm GAG        monitoring and that its sensitivity is sufficient to        permit observation of the spatiotemporal evolution of        GAG Each of those studies began with a homogeneously        proteoglycandeficient matrix in which GAG was replenished        over a  to week period to levels considered to be        within the normal range        In young bovine articular cartilage a tissue that many        investigators have used to investigate the impact of        physical and biochemical factors on ECM metabolism                  IL induces a characteristic spatially        heterogeneous depletion of GAG This young tissue still        contains blood vessels and it is in the perivascular        regions that ILinduced GAG depletion is most severe We        know from studies investigating the recovery of        trypsininduced homogeneous GAG depletion in young bovine        cartilage that the inherent ability of chondrocytes to        replenish the matrix is relatively uniform     In the        present study we take advantage of the characteristic        spatial heterogeneity of ILinduced GAG depletion to        study the relative replenishment rates between regions of        varying severity of GAG depletion Accordingly our goal        was to use dGEMRIC to determine whether bovine cartilage        explants briefly exposed to IL would recover GAG at a        uniform rate or at a rate that depended on the degree of        ILinduced GAG depletion Specifically we sought to        examine recovery after relatively mild and modest        degradation  conditions that did not induce a complete        loss of tissue GAG                    Method                  Culture and degradation protocols          Cartilagebone cores of mm or mm in diameter were          harvested from young bovine femoropatellar groove          articular cartilage within  hours of slaughter After          removing the articular surface three or four mmthick          discs were sliced parallel to the articular surface A          flat edge was made on some of the discs to ease          orientation and registration during imaging and analysis          The discs were weighed and then immediately placed in          ml sterile culture media in well culture plates All          explants were incubated at C throughout the study          Culture medium was prepared with lowglucose          Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium with mmoll HEPES          GIBCO BRL Grand Island NY USA mmoll          nonessential amino acids Sigma Chemical St Louis MO          USA  mmoll Lproline Sigma Chemical and mmoll          gadoliniumDTPA Magnevist Berlex Imaging Wayne NJ          USA Supplements including  fetal calf serum GIBCO          BRL Grand Island NY  lglutamine Sigma Chemical           ascorbic acid Sigma Chemical and  penicillin and          streptomycin Sigma Chemical were added immediately          prior to use Media was was collected daily and analyzed          for GAG release by the dimethylmethylene blue DMMB          assay using purified shark chondroitin sulfate Sigma          Chemical as the reference standard          All samples were cultured in basal media for at least           days after harvest To create samples that have          heterogeneouslydegraded ECM samples were exposed to          IL Cistron Biotechnology Pine Brooks NJ USA          which was added each day to the culture medium Two          series of experiments were conducted each with its own          set of controls In the first series samples were          exposed to  ngml IL for  and  days incurring          mild degradation           n  The addition of IL to the          media began at days  and  respectively after harvest          such that all samples began the recovery phase on day           after harvest Control samples were cultured in basal          media for the entire experiment In the second series          samples were exposed to  ngml IL            n  for  and  days and          incurred moderate degradation In this group the          addition of IL addition to the media for all samples          started at  days after harvest and therefore samples          began the recovery phase at day  or  after harvest          Again control samples were cultured in basal media for          the entire experiment Control samples are referred to as          mild controls or moderate controls according to the          IL series with which they were cultured            n  and           Following IL exposure the samples were transferred          to sterile flatbottomed mm nuclear magnetic resonance          NMR tubes Wilbur Scientific Boston MA USA that          were custom cut to a length of cm where they were          cultured in basal media for the duration of the recovery          experiment          In summary the experiment comprised three periods an          initial period before any exposure to IL an exposure          period during which tissue was exposed to IL in          preparation for the recovery phase followed by a          recovery period during which there was no IL          present                          Imaging protocols          For imaging the shortened NMRculture tubes were          joined to fulllength NMR tubes via a sterilized rubber          stopper inserted into the open ends of both tubes          All images were acquired on a Bruker  T magnetic          resonance microimaging system Bruker Instruments          Billerica MA USA with a standard mm radiofrequency          coil Tweighted images in the axial orientation with          respect to explant cylindrical geometry were measured          weekly postIL exposure with either an inversion          recovery sequence mild series or a saturation          recovery sequence moderate series The saturation          recovery protocol consisted of  Tweighted images          measured with timetorepeat times of                   and ms For inversion          recovery measurements images were acquired with nine          inversion delays of                  and ms Both pulse sequences used a timetoecho          of ms section thicknesses of mm inplane          resolutions of m and two averages for a total          imaging time of less than  hour per sample          Analysis of GAG release throughout these experiments          suggested that within the range of sensitivity provided          by our dimethylmethylene blue assay GAG release patterns          were unaffected by removal from incubation at C to          room temperature for  hours of imaging each week          because all the plugs were out of the incubator for the          imaging session          Tissue Ts without contrast agent were determined          spectroscopically using an inversion delay pulse sequence          with  delays ranging from  to s and a mm          broadband radiofrequency probe At the conclusion of each          experimental series two samples one control and one          treated were equilibrated in gadoliniumfree medium          then extracted from media and blotted dry and placed in          an NMR tube As had previously been observed we found          very little difference in T between samples of the same          series  or across series               Therefore the T times in the absence of contrast agent          of samples from the same series were averaged and these          averages used as the reference tissue T for all other          samples within the same experiment series                          Image processing          MATLAB The Math Works Natick MA USA was used to          create a T map by curvefitting each Tweighted image          series on a voxelbyvoxel basis T maps were then          processed into GAG maps with MATLAB using equations          derived from a modified ideal Donnan theory This dGEMRIC          method of relating measured T and cartilage GAG was          previously validated and reported                The mean GAG for a sample at a given time point was          computed as the mean GAG calculated across all          cartilagecontaining pixels of the image The rate of          GAG accumulation ie the tissues recovery rate was          calculated as the difference in the mean GAG values at          specified time points divided by the elapsed time          As expected qualitative assessment of images from          samples exposed to IL exhibited the characteristic          heterogeneity in degree of GAG depletion In order to          quantitate objectively the time course of GAG recovery          relative to the degree of GAG depletion GAG maps were          registered using Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems Inc San          Jose CA USA in order to allow chosen regions of          interest to be automatically analyzed across multiple          images from successive imaging sessions Registered          images were segmented so that tissue regions of          relatively high medium or low GAG were identified in          images taken after  weeks of recovery The GAG and          location of these pixels were tracked in time High          medium and low GAG regions of the week images were          discerned according to the following definitions          Pixel assigned to high GAG region if          GAG           pixel  mean GAG           all pixels    SD           all pixels           Pixel assigned to low GAG region if          GAG           pixel  mean GAG           all pixels    SD           all pixels           Pixel assigned to medium GAG region if not assigned          to high or low region                          Statistical analysis          Magnetic resonance imaging derived group mean GAG          changes were assessed using repeatedmeasures oneway          analysis of variance with a compound symmetry variance          structure using SAS SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA          to test the hypothesis that mean GAG in a given sample          or regions of a given sample did not change with time          This technique analyzed the significance of time as an          effect on weekly GAG measurements or weekly changes in          GAG taken from the same samples or same region of a          sample each week Paired twosample Students           t tests Microsoft Excel were          used to determine the degree of GAG recovery observed          with respect to initial GAG before exposure to          IL                            Results                  Glycosaminoglycan release into media          The release of GAG into the media was measured daily          as a surrogate for monitoring the effect of IL exposure          and of ECM stability following IL withdrawal Control          samples from each series had a small rate of release          throughout    gmg initial wetweightday          except for a slightly higher release rate gmg          initial wetweightday during the first  days after          harvest Assuming an initial GAG of approximately  of          wetweight this steadystate release rate corresponds to          a loss of about day          As expected during the IL exposure period the          exposed samples lost significantly more GAG than did          controls in accordance with the severity of the IL          exposure Those in the mild and moderate groups lost          g and g GAG respectively as compared with          the g and g lost during the same period by          the control samples The GAG release rates never dropped          to negligible levels during the exposure period          indicating that GAG was not totally depleted from the          disks at these exposure levels Turning to the recovery          period within  days after cessation of IL exposure          the GAG release rates dropped to levels comparable with          those of control samples GAG release persisted at this          level  and gmg initial wetweightday          for mild and moderate groups respectively          throughout the remainder of the study                          Tissue glycosaminoglycan concentration over          time          Use of dGEMRIC allowed for the actual GAG in the          tissue to be followed over time The images of the          control samples showed relatively stable GAG over the          culture period Fig ac with the coefficient of          variation SDmean over time for bulk GAG ie GAG          averaged over the entire cartilage image slice ranging          from  to  One can also see that the bulk GAG was          considerably different for the mild and moderate          control samples This is probably a reflection of          differences between the animals used for each series a          conclusion supported by considering measurements made          before IL exposure on a subset of samples mgml          for the mild series and mgml for the moderate          series           n  for each To provide a          relative reference the mean and SD of untreated samples          are represented by the shaded regions in Fig ab          Images of the exposed samples acquired immediately          following cessation of IL revealed a much lower GAG          than the initial values and the GAG in exposed samples          increased with time of recovery Figs and  Over the          week recovery period following IL exposure GAG          increased in all samples exposed to IL Fig bdand          Fig            n             P   In the mild group          the GAG increased by    mgml

 weeks of recovery did not reach the          initial levels The GAG in the mild group reached             of initial GAG            n            P  and the moderate group          reached    of initial GAG            n            P                            Regional analysis of glycosaminoglycan          concentration recovery          The mean rate of GAG recovery increase in          GAGtime averaged across all pixels of ILdegraded          samples remained steady throughout  weeks of          postILexposure culture at a rate of  mgml per day          mgml per day However looking specifically at          the spatial distribution of GAG considerable          differences in weekly GAG recovery are clearly evident          across different regions of the same samples          In both the mild and moderate groups          heterogeneous degradation patterns prevailed with          greatest degradation occurring in perivascular regions          Fig cd although the degradation in the moderate          group was more severe and homogeneous than in the mild          group the control images and abundant experience with          this model system supports the implicit assumption here          that the initial before IL distribution of GAG was          homogeneous          From a qualitative examination of the recovery images          it can also be appreciated that the regions with          relatively low GAG after  weeks are also the regions          that had relatively low GAG at the beginning of the          recovery period immediately after IL exposure Figs          and           To examine this observation more quantitatively and to          assess whether the rates of GAG accumulation were          correspondingly heterogeneous we examined separately the          GAG accumulation in three regions namely those with          high medium and low GAG at week  as specified          above under Image processing which is illustrated for          one sample in Fig a Interestingly regions of low          GAG appeared to recover at the same rate as did regions          of medium or high GAG during the first  weeks of          postILexposure culture In the first  weeks of          recovery all regions recovered at a rate of mgml          per week During the third week the recovery patterns for          the three regions differed significantly            P  with the low          regions showing negligible GAG accumulation and the          high regions the greatest accumulation Fig          ac                            Discussion        The present study clearly demonstrates that bovine        cartilage explants can at least partially recover from        ILinduced degradation by synthesizing new GAG but that        the ultimate rate of recovery may be dependent on the        degree of initial depletion By monitoring the spatially        localized changes in GAG over a week recovery period        we showed that GAG increases significantly with time in        postILexposure culture with the early recovery first         weeks being independent of absolute GAG but the later        recovery third week occurring only in regions with higher        GAG        With respect to the spatial heterogeneity in recovery        rates we are not aware of any histologic or other data        describing the apparent dependence of the rate of GAG        replenishment on the initial state of the ECM We        previously showed that spontaneous recovery from complete        trypsininduced GAG loss occurs uniformly throughout the        tissue showing no significant spatial heterogeneity in        recovery rates and nearly complete recovery to the initial        state in approximately  weeks     Those data suggest        that the capacity for cells to synthesize new matrix is        uniform throughout the tissue Thus the differential        response seen here is presumably due to the state of the        ECM immediately after IL exposure        Here we consider GAG as a surrogate for defining the        ECM state immediately following IL exposure GAG itself        is one direct measure of ECM state In the context of the        present study GAG might also serve as a surrogate for        the state of other ECM macromolecules such as collagen        Given the broad spectrum of ILinduced enzymes we        consider that regions of the tissue where GAG is more        severely affected by IL may also be regions that        experience greater damage to the collagen network as        compared with regions that are more resistant to the        effects of IL Our finding that the regions that        experienced the least recovery were those most severely        affected by IL could be a consequence of these same        regions sustaining more significant damage to the ECM        network This conclusion is consistent with findings        regarding ILinduced degradation in rabbits in which        recovery rates decreased with apparent severity of        degradation            Interestingly it is in the latter phase of recovery        that a discrepancy in recovery rates becomes evident        During the early phases of recovery the rate of GAG        accumulation in the regions with the lowest GAG was        comparable to the rates of recovery in regions with the        highest GAG The mechanism for this heterogeneity is        unclear It could be a manifestation of a corresponding        distribution of ILinduced changes in chondrocyte        metabolism or viability     or it could be a        manifestation of a corresponding distribution of damage to        the collagen scaffold which in turn limits the ability to        replenish GAG Kruijsen         et al     showed that both the        severity and chronicity of antigeninduced inflammation        determined the degree of chondrocyte killing in their         in vivo murine model of arthritis        Their studies showed that chondrocyte death was most highly        correlated with the degree of joint inflammation present         days after arthritis induction That finding suggests that        sustained exposure to IL a proinflammatory agent may        also cause chondrocyte death However the fact that the        early recovery phase in the present study showed no        heterogeneity makes cell death a less likely cause of        limited GAG replenishment        A limitation and obvious next step to this study is        that we do not have independent information about the        integrity of the collagen matrix Magnetic resonance        imaging techniques are actively being developed to image        the collagen component of tissue which can be incorporated        into future studies     Human osteoarthritic tissue        is by histologic measures spatially heterogeneous in both        collagen damage and degree of proteoglycan depletion The        notion that the differential ability to replenish GAG fully        is related to the differential state of the collagen matrix        has been suggested by others based in part on the finding        that GAG depletion corresponds with regions that are        positive for the col epitope which is indicative of        collagen damage      Although we lack specific        information on the state of the collagen matrix the        differences observed in the present study and indeed the        demonstrated ability to evaluate regional differences in        response suggest that dGEMRIC and model systems such as        these may be useful for establishing a better understanding        of the capacity of cartilage to repair osteoarthritislike        degradation        The rate of GAG replenishment observed in this study        compares well with published synthesis data Using sulfate        incorporation over periods of less than  hours we and        others have reported sulfate incorporation ratios between         and nmolmg wetweighthour for young bovine        cartilage       These incorporation rates imply        GAG synthesis rates of  mgml tissue water per week        assuming  sulfate per disaccharide  gmol        disaccaride and ml tissue waterg wetweight By        comparison we observed GAG accumulation rates of mgml        per week as inferred from the change in GAG These        values also compare well with the mgml per week rates        of GAG replenishment seen in young bovine cartilage        explants recovering from trypsininduced GAG depletion            Comparison of these GAG accumulation rates with the        rate of GAG release into the culture medium clearly        suggests that at least  of the newly synthesized GAG is        retained by the tissue By contrast in control tissue the        amount of GAG synthesized is roughly equivalent to the        amount released into the medium        We do not have the ability to determine the regional        variations in synthesis and loss Although we clearly        observed regional variations in GAG accumulation it is        important to appreciate that these differences could arise        by regional differences in synthesis or in loss or        both        Looking more generally at attempts to evaluate GAG        recovery in ILdegraded cartilage our data are        consistent with the temporal progression seen in other        model systems in which recovery occurs and is measurable        within the first few weeks after a GAGdepleting        intervention For example Takegami         et al     reported GAG recovery        in alginate cultures of human intervertebral disc cells        preexposed to ngml IL for  days During the first         weeks of postILexposure culture those investigators        observed GAG recovery rates of approximately day with        very little change in GAG observed during the third week        when GAG levels reached about  of the control level        In an         in vivo rabbit knee joint subjected        to intraarticular injections of IL Page Thomas         et al     used SO          uptake and toluidine blue staining to        observe GAG losses of  in several cartilage sites        within the knee with gradual recovery over the subsequent         weeks Arner    also examined         in vivo GAG synthesis and        accumulation in rabbits following intraarticular        injections of IL Using dimethylmethylene blue assay and        sulfate incorporation Arner found that both single and        multiple injections of IL led to an initial depression in        GAG synthesis rate and a slight drop in tissue GAG for         days after IL exposure These changes were followed by        enhanced synthesis relative to controls with a        commensurate increase in tissue GAG over the subsequent         weeks as the content of GAG in the tissue approached  of        control levels In those         in vivo systems it appears that GAG        loss continues for  days after IL exposure            This is longer than the  days seen in the present study        in which GAG loss into the medium returned to control        levels and is probably a consequence of IL clearing        more quickly from the         in vitro environment        Thus in widely different model systems  including that        reported here  it appears that after an ILinduced        GAGdepleting intervention tissue can reaccumulate GAG and        does so most rapidly during the first few weeks However        unlike the study described here in which both spatial and        temporal changes in GAG were monitored in the studies        described above it was not possible to derive more specific        spatial information because the destructive nature of the        GAG measurements required that time course information be        inferred from averages of separate animalssamples        harvested at different time points        Our data can also be compared with those from other        studies in which magnetic resonance methods were used to        monitor changes in cartilage tissue during culture Our        group previously observed spatially uniform recovery of        explants following trypsininduced GAG depletion using        dGEMRIC with the increases in GAG occurring most rapidly        during the first week and slowing considerably after         weeks     Williams         et al     used the same method        to monitor GAG accumulation in tissue engineered cartilage        over  weeks and observed relatively steady GAG        accumulation over the entire period with the bulk of the        accumulation occurring at the periphery of the explant The        initial state of the cellpolymer construct was presumably        uniform and the heterogeneous GAG accumulation was        attributed to differences in the biophysical environment        Potter         et al     observed the growth of        tissue engineered over a period of  weeks using proton NMR        without any additional contrast agent The relative changes        in T and T times of those studies tracked the histologic        finding that GAG increased for the first  weeks and then        remained relatively constant Collectively those studies        and the present one illustrate spatial and temporal        variations in GAG accumulation in native treated and        tissue engineered cartilage Much work of course remains        if we are to begin to understand the biochemical        biophysical and structural factors that underlie the        differential behavior Furthermore much work remains to        determine the generalizability of the behavior in these        model systems involving young tissue to behavior of        cartilage         in vivo in older humans                    Conclusion        In the present study we demonstrated that chondrocytes        in a matrix degraded by IL exposure partially        replenished the GAG and the most severely degraded regions        replenished less fully than did other regions Future        studies are underway to examine whether heterogeneity in        replenishment rate is seen in human osteoarthritic tissue        The study provides additional evidence that the         in vitro dGEMRIC method is a        practical means for studying GAG homeostasis and events        that disturb it Ultimately such studies provide the        foundation for evaluating the effects of therapeutic        interventions on GAG degradation or regeneration         in vitro or         in vivo                        Competing interests
