              i work for one of the defense contractors out here  actually its its not a defense contractor its uh a federally funded research and development center   uhhuh   kind of like the Mitre Corporation only uh uh we work mainly with the Air Force in terms of satellites   alright and um so um in other words your your bread and butter comes from the federal government   the the government yes uh   right so your your uh your life sort of follows its  flow   thats correct   so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they   uh actually no um it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization so the the benefits are different um   uhhuh   i mean basically you get you know the the health care coverage uh one of the big pluses for this company was you would get um three weeks of vacation to start normally in California when you work for one of the defense contractors they give you three weeks to start but all of the companies shut down between Christmas and New Years so you end up in essence only getting two weeks of voluntary vacation and one week of involuntary vacation is you want to look at it that way   sure i see what youre saying   uh where as in our uh for our company they did not have until very recently a plant shutdown between Christmas and New Years uh the idea is that youve got the three weeks and you can take it whenever you want it   umhum   so that was a big plus benefit for this company   and thats just recently been taken away from you   uh well the past couple of years because of uh cut backs and and whatnot they uh basically have put down and told people that you either take a week of vacation between Christmas and New Years or take a week of no pay   um   uh the its up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between Christmas and New Years i dont believe that this is a long term solution that theyre going to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more   development yeah well um you say now you say you get your health benefits is this a one hundred percent coverage   uh uhhuh no i dont think any of unless of course you go with an HMO   yeah   uh the thing is that they also do not have uh eye glass coverage so if you need eye glasses youre on your own uh they also do not provide uh well they do provide dental if you go with an HMO though you lose the um the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the HMO or you choose the   ability to choose umhum   um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors theyll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent   umhum umhum   so that that  i have to admit i mean when i first started out you were covered completely and it was not a um an HMO type of thing i i when i first started out in engineering i worked for RCA back in the mid seventies and uh they just covered everything   umhum sure     but uh you know ive watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh youre going to have to pay big bucks and theyre only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases   well thats it certainly looks the way things are headed right now if uh something isnt done at the i guess at the federal level or   right yeah   or something i dont know about this but its uh i um worked for a number of years as support staff in law law firms in the Washington Area   uhhuh   and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh law the especially during the seventies and eighties law firms were just rolling in the money   umhum   and uh its a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area but um   uhhuh   the result uh was during that period that not only did we get one hundred percent benefits in terms of health care and so forth but they were rather extravagant plans that we were party to with with uh full dental and   huh   uh you know optical stuff stuff for our eyes and uh and so forth and i have to confess i had a couple of real bad health scares during that time and found that it really came in handy the HMO idea   uhhuh right wow   appeared on the scene i guess in the mid eighties and i tried a couple of them out uh and in fact have eventually settled on one of them ive change jobs now but this the same HMO is still available in my current position and and um   hum   its its uh i the interesting thing theyve done some interesting things with the HMOs in this area where you there are a number of doctors and you can choose amongst the doctors that are available in fact uh one of them thats run by Prudential has essentially signed up a bunch of private physicians in the the Washington Area
