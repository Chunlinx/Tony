Thepapers are filled with stories about the death of Michael Kennedy The storieslist other family occurrences that show the Kennedys as a hardluck family Itis for example listed as a Kennedy tragedy that other people tend to die incars driven by Kennedys If a Kennedy is walking by and a busload of people diein a crash it would make the list of tragedies longer Is this an example ofgood PR                                       Ellsworth MButlerBoonton NJ                        Dear MrButler            I agreethat the word tragedy is used without discrimination in reference to theKennedy family The death of Joseph Kennedy Jr in World War II and theassassinations of Jack and Robert were tragedies As far as I can see most ofthe subsequent problems were the result of their own recklessness or worseSince they are so prominent and have been blessed with so much wealth andpublic adulation they have a responsibility to be role models of sensiblebehavior It is unfortunate that they do not see it that way            Prudence sadly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I havemet a woman whom I am attracted to She is attracted to me and we would like tosee more of each other The problem is we are both married The attraction ismore than plutonic it is also physical What would you recommend                                       Troubled in LasVegas                        DearTroubled in Las Vegas            Your letter is indeedambiguous You say that the attraction between this woman and you is more thanplutonic it is also physical In my old dictionary plutonic means ofPluto infernal I will assume that you mean platonic But then I dont knowwhether you mean that the attraction is physical or that the consummatedrelationship is physical and sexual            I will assume that you wouldlike to have sexual relations but have not done so My advice is not to do itunless you are prepared to leaveie divorceyour present wife One reasonis that your wife will probably learn of it and when she does there will bethe devil to pay A second reason is that even if she doesnt find out youwill know and you will probably go around with a burden of guilt that willsour your life and your relations with both women But there is a third mostimportant reason The relationship you are longing for is wrong The one ofthe Ten Commandments that everyone knows is Thou shalt not commit adulteryIt may be often violated but hardly anyone in our culture denies that it is acommandment If our behavior is to be governed only by costbenefitcalculations and not by moral standards we are in pretty bad shape            Whetheryou should leave your present wife I cannot tell without knowing much more thanyou have revealed I urge you to be very cautious about it It is easy to beattracted to a new woman whose faults you do not know who does not know yourfaults and who has never asked you to take out the garbage or mow the lawnBut you have to think of what the new woman will be like after she has becomethe old woman Also you havent said whether you and your wife have anychildren Their interests deserve a lot of weight            Prudence Mosaically                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have a longdistanceboyfriend of three months Ive only seen him three times and Im beginning todislike him However he constantly phones me and sent me a  Christmaspresent Should I send him a Christmas present or would this encourage him evenmore                                       I wantto break up with him                                       Desperately                        DearDesperately            Theremust be something more here than meets the eye On the facts presented youhave no problem Dont send him a gift Send his gift back            Prudence simply                                             DearPrudence                                                      Ireceived a small Christmas gift from a workmate I thanked her when she handedme the gift My wife thinks that a thankyou note is appropriate but I thinkthat the verbal thank you satisfies my obligation What do you think                                       SincerelyBunsworth                        DearBunsworth            You madean oral expression of gratitude which was of course also verbal That isenough unless the gift was extraordinary If the gift was an item of housewarelike a microwave your wife should write a thankyou note            Prudencesufficiently                                             DearPrudence                                                      I haveread a few of your comments and you do indeed sound like a thoroughlycourteous and sensible person I just have an idea I should like to broadcastvia you In public libraries one finds the childrens section the adultreading section and the young adults section read teenagers Isnt this akind and gentle way of referring to people in the teen years I thought itwould gently help those young people to begin to accept the idea that they aregrowing up and should soon become grownups or adults Thats all                                       Louine King                                       PS Ihate the idea that the word adult so often refers to pornographic thingsThere goes another perfectly good word unless we can recapture it withdignity Thanks for your electronic ear                        DearLouine            I thank you for yourcomment Indeed it is important that teenagers should recognize that they arebecoming adults and that they are not in some playground where they have fullcapabilities and no responsibilities In the Jewish tradition as I understandit boys become adults at the age of  and go through rites intended toimpress that upon them The signs you observe in the library are a small steptoward making teenagers aware of their status            The useof the word adult to rate some movies and I suppose other forms ofentertainment is I agree often inappropriate I think we should have twocategoriesadult and immature
