                                 Trouble in Paradise            Division runs like a seamthrough the biography of the Nobel Prizewinning Caribbeanborn poet DerekWalcotthis task has been to make it more boon than burden He and his twinbrother Roderick were born in  in St Lucia a small link in the Antillesisland chain then part of the British West Indies Walcotts was a Britisheducation The paucity of books in his native St Lucia led paradoxically toan excellent literary education grounded in the heavily accented rhythms ofShakespeare the Anglican hymnal and the King James Bible            Even ashe pursued a college education Walcott absorbed the parallel oral culture ofthe Caribbean particularly audible in his plays some of which adopt hisnative Creole dialect His early poems register both geographical distances andthe divisions within himself In Crusoes Island  he is bothRobinson Crusoe and Fridays progeny The brood of Crusoes slave His morerecent poetry especially the epic Omeros of  wavers between anexiles nostalgia and a cosmopolitans athomeness in the world            The title of The Bounty  Walcotts firstbook of poems since Omeros  is a tangle of associations Walcott isfirst of all acknowledging his  Nobel Prize in literature which quotingthe Irish Nobel Laureate WB Yeats he calls  the bounty of Sweden  Theprize paid for Walcotts retreat on St Lucia this house facing white combersthat stands for hot rutted lanes far from the disease of power SecondWalcott is playing off the celluloid The Bounty of Fletcher Christianand the white God  Captain Bligh which rhymes in his mind with the ebband flow of Caribbean tyranny and freedom The ribbed body with its cargostalls in its doldrums the Godcaptain is cast adrift by a mutinousChristian Finallya major theme of this slim bookthere is the recurringlight of each Antillean day Bounty In the bells of treefrogs with theirsteady clamour in the indigo dark before dawn the fading morse of firefliesand crickets then light on the beetles armour            Despiteits upbeat title The Bounty is a book of elegies a response to themany deaths nothing short of a massacreincluding the deaths of his motherand his close friend the poet Joseph Brodskythat Walcott has endured duringhis seventh decade As he improvises on themes from the Western elegiactradition in which spring consoles for the losses of winter Walcott findsthat certain notes dont sound in the tropics where there is no climate nocalendar except for this bountiful day And he is surprised as elegistsalways are that earth rejoices in the middle of our agony            If Omeros  like its Homeric model was a poem aboutfathers The Bounty is Walcotts mother book an attempt to draw theveiled figure of Mamma entering the standard elegiac The sevenpart titlepoem is both an elegy for her and a poem about her island Walcottsmothercountry Its opening lines attempt to pry the beauty of the Antillesloose from advertising brochures that false paradise in which as Walcottwrote in his Nobel lecture the Caribbean is a blue pool into which therepublic dangles the extended foot of Florida            Between the vision ofthe Tourist Board and the trueParadise lies the desert where Isaiahselationsforce a rose from the sand The thirtythird canto            cores the dawn cloudswith concentric radiancethe breadfruit opens its palms in praise of thebounty boispain  tree of bread slave food the bliss of JohnClare            torn wandering Tomstoatstroker in his county             Inthose seven lines freighted with the layered voice of European cultureDantes vision of paradise is invoked both explicitly in the concentricradiance of the last canto of his Paradiso  and implicitly in hisbraided terza rima threeline stanzas rhymingloosely hereaba bcb etcThat paradise is linked in turn with Isaiahs prophecy of the imminentappearance of God in the desert a promise confirmed in the Christian view byJesus birth            But Walcott also wants an outsiders view onthis exalted material and he finds it in the  th century Englishpeasantpoet John Clare whom he makes into a standin for himself Walcotttwins Clarewho was driven mad by social injustice and consoled by thesmallest beings in naturewith mad Tom Edgars disguise in King Lear who like Clare wanders the English countryside praising frogs and gnats Iam moved like you mad Tom by a line of ants I behold their industry andthey are giants This couplet sends us back to an already famous passage inOmeros  in which women loading coal are compared to a line of antsandso on            In therest of The Bounty  Walcott relinquishes such allusive density for thesimple historyerasing realities of life in the Antilles islands the mangotrees that serenely rust when they are in flower the firefly that keepsstriking matches This culturenature split corresponds in Walcotts personalmythology with a split in himself his European education and Caribbeanchildhood his two homes in Boston and St Lucia the two races white andblack of his ancestry and the two languages I knowone so rich in itsimperial intimacies its echo of privilege the other like the orange words ofa hillside in drought but my love of both wide as the Atlantic islarge            Theres a risk of sentimentality in Walcottspraise of the Caribbean A little pun in his Nobel lecture appears to glossover and even celebrate the privations of underdevelopment In the Antillespoverty is poetry with a v une vie  a condition of life as well as ofimagination Easy for him to say with that Nobelbought bungalow Andagain Visual surprise is natural in the Caribbean it comes with thelandscape and faced with its beauty the sigh of History dissolves Wellmaybe the sigh  but not the fact of history as Walcott knows quitewell            Suchremarks in any case are part of Walcotts own emerging selfdefinition as awriter In recent years he has increasingly aligned himself not with British orAmerican poetry but with a multilingual and multiracial Antillean literaturethat includes such writers as Jean Rhys Lafcadio Hearn SaintJohn Perseanother Nobel winner VS Naipaul and CLR James These writers inWalcotts view have managed to see the islands as they arein all theirvisual surpriseand not as some fragment or fallingoff from Europeanachievements Walcotts faith as expressed in The Bounty  is finally apainters faith that the poets job is to write of the lights bounty onfamiliar things            Walcott trained to be a painterlike hisschoolteacher father who died when Walcott was a babyand The Bountyis his most painterly book in method and theme If The Bounty is low onautobiographical detail or the dailiness of this poets life and travels itis rich in acts of looking Walcotts keen eye is drawn repeatedly to thecomplementary blues and oranges of his native landscape there against theindigoblue Santa Cruz mountains the immortelle ignites its branches withorange blossoms however briefly while the incredible blue is as indifferentas ever                           The Bounty is studdedwith the names of painters especially those with a link to the CaribbeanWillows in Amsterdam bud like crowds in Pissarro along a wet boulevardsbranches Manet in Martinique evokes ghosts of French culture inhabiting theisland Pissarro though Walcott doesnt mention it was a native of the smallJewish community in St Thomas in the Virgin Islands while the yearoldManet traveled the Caribbean as a sailor in training One of the strongestpoems in the book the that begins I cannot remember the name of that seacoastcity evokes Monet as Walcott reconstitutes with the help of one of his ownwatercolors a dimly remembered stippled seascape in northern France            Wistful wry at timesvaledictory the Monet poem playfully offers the poets own epitaph TheBounty is one of Walcotts most inviting volumes incorporating some of hisbest work since The StarApple Kingdom of  In his pleasure in thesheer variousness of paradises found and lost Walcott glories in what the poetGerard Manley Hopkins called dappled things
