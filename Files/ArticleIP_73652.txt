French and Italian ones as wellLe Figaro of Paris splashed acrossfive columns an allegation aired on French and German television that one ofexChancellor Helmut Kohls secret financial benefactors was late FrenchPresident Franois Mitterrand Mitterrand was said to have used Francesstateowned Elf energy group in  to channel millions of dollars to KohlsChristian Democratic Union in order to get him reelectedan odd idea becauseMitterrand was a socialist and Kohl the leader of Europes most powerfulconservative party But several European papers noted that their personalfriendship and shared commitment to the European ideal overrode ideologicalconsiderations The Frankfurter AllgemeineZeitung reminded readers of the leaders intimacy by republishing afamous  photograph of Kohl and Mitterrand standing hand in hand at the siteof the bloody battle of Verdun during a FrancoGerman reconciliation ceremonyto commemorate World War I                           Die Welt led on growing fears withinthe CDU that the scandal could split the party and even destroy it This asLe Figaro noted was what Italys corruption scandal did to the ItalianChristian Democrat Party after it had been in power  years and like the CDUseemed unassailable as a major political force The Sunday Times of London exposed aBritish dimension to the German crisis when it fronted allegations that StuartIddles a British former vice president of Airbus Industrie had arrangedkickbacks worth millions of dollars to Karlheinz Schreiber the Germanbusinessman at the heart of the scandal who then passed at least some of themoney on to Kohl Schreiber allegedly got the kickbacks for helping sell Airbusplanes to Canadian and Thai airlines Everyone named in the scandal has deniedallegations of this kind            EzerWeizmans TV address to the nation announcing his refusal to resign aspresident of Israel despite the launch of a criminal investigation into hisadmitted receipt of cash gifts from a French former business associate wasbadly received by the Israeli press Writing Monday in Maariv commentator Amnon Dankner attacked Weizman for revealing nothing except hisdetermination to stay in office The presidency is mainly a symbol he wroteA presidency under criminal investigation that keeps its mouth shut in theface of serious public accusations tramples the symbol into the mud and has nomore value  To use a metaphor from the world of flying of which Weizman isso fond he should have operated his ejection seat three weeks ago He didntdo so and now he hovers over us with two burntout engines and a broken wingshortly to crash on the heads of us all                           Yediot Aharonot was more indulgent It described Weizman as acourageous fighter and a courageous statesman  a warm man among cold people asensitive man among the insensitive a brave man among cowards But it saidhis TV appearance did not bear witness to public courage or sensitivity topublic discomfort It went on Weizman seemed to sense this That may be whywhen he said I look you in the eye his eyes were searching the paper infront of him Yediot Aharonot said that after  years of publicservice it was implausible for Weizman to claim that he acted innocently onthe advice of his lawyer The correct conclusion from Weizmans appearancelast night may be that he is too naive to be president            InHaaretz  military editorZeev Schiff reported that variouscircles in the United States had been stunned by the huge sums requested byIsrael in security aid to follow its eventual withdrawal from the GolanHeights After American protests the demand was trimmed from  billion to billion partly through cuts in requested intelligence funding ThenIsrael surprised the United States again by almost doubling the number ofTomahawk cruise missiles it said it needed            As thegovernment stood accused by a Russian TV network of claiming less than a tenthof the real number of Russian troops killed in Chechnya the latest issue ofthe weekly military newspaper Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye said theofficial numbers game about casualties is losing any relation to realityBoth the Russians and the Chechens are wildly exaggerating each others lossesIf Russian figures of Chechen losses were to be believed there would be almostno resistance to the Russian attempts to take Grozny            In anoped article Monday in the London Evening Standard  Vanity Faircolumnist Christopher Hitchens said that the US presidential electioncampaign owed its dreariness in part to manipulation by the professionals Thevoters of Iowa and New Hampshire are microscopic populations on the margin ofAmerican society as it actually is he wrote Nobody can remember how theygot to take the first whack at weeding the field of candidates and no sanesystem would ever have granted them the permission But this time not eventheir rural cussedness can impart any drama to a race in which dollars andpolls have done their work before any real vote is counted
