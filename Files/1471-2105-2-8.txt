                    Introduction        Some genes produce functional noncoding RNAs ncRNAs        instead of coding for proteins      For proteincoding        genes we have computational genefinding tools    that        predict novel genes in genome sequence data with reasonable        efficiency     For ncRNA genes there are as yet no        general genefinding algorithms The number and diversity of        ncRNA genes remains poorly understood despite the        availability of many complete genome sequences Gene        discovery methods whether experimental or computational        typically assume that the target is a protein coding gene        that produces a messenger RNA        New noncoding RNA genes continue to be discovered by        less systematic means which makes it seem likely that a        systematic RNA genefinding algorithm would be of use        Recent discoveries have included RNAs involved in dosage        compensation and imprinting     numerous small        nucleolar RNAs involved in RNA modification and processing              and small riboregulatory RNAs controlling        translation andor stability of target mRNAs             Mutations in the gene for RNase MRP are associated with        cartilagehair hypoplasia CHH a recessive pleiotropic        human genetic disorder     The CHH locus eluded        positional cloning for some time the RNase MRP gene was        only detected in the completely sequenced CHH critical        region because the RNase MRP sequence was already in the        databases        We have previously explored one RNA genefinding approach        with very limited success     Maizel and coworkers             had hypothesized that biologically functional        RNA structures may have more stable predicted secondary        structures than would be expected for a random sequence of        the same base composition Though we could confirm some        anecdotal results where this was true we were forced to        the conclusion that in general the predicted stability of        structural RNAs is not sufficiently distinguishable from        the predicted stability of random sequences to use as the        basis for a reliable ncRNA genefinding algorithm        Nonetheless conserved RNA secondary structure remained our        best hope for an exploitable statistical signal in ncRNA        genes We decided to consider ways of incorporating        additional statistical signal using comparative sequence        analysis        We were motivated by the work of Badger  Olsen           for bacterial codingregion identification Badger         Olsen use the BLASTN program    to locate genomic        regions with significant sequence similarity between two        related bacterial species Their program CRITICA then        analyzes the pattern of mutation in these ungapped aligned        conserved regions for evidence of coding structure For        example mutations to synonymous codons get positive        scores while aligned triplets that translate to dissimilar        amino acids get negative scores CRITICA then subsequently        extends any codingassigned ungapped seed alignments into        complete open reading frames        Here we extend the central idea of the Badger         Olsen approach to identify structural RNA regions Our        extensions include  using fully probabilistic models         adding a third model of pairwise alignments constrained        by structural RNA evolution  allowing gapped        alignments and  allowing for the possibility that only        part of the pairwise alignment may represent a coding        region or structural RNA because a primary sequence        alignment may extend into flanking noncoding or        nonstructural conserved sequence These extensions add        complexity to the approach We use probabilistic modeling        methods and formal languages to guide our construction We        use pair hidden Markov models pairHMMs introduced in            and a pair stochastic context free grammar        pairSCFG a natural extension of the pairHMM idea to        RNA structure to produce three evolutionary models for        coding structural RNA or something else a null        hypothesis Given three probabilistic models and a        pairwise sequence alignment to be tested we can calculate        the Bayesian posterior probability that an alignment should        be classified as coding structural RNA or something        else        Our approach is designed to detect conserved         structural RNAs Some ncRNA genes do        not have wellconserved intramolecular secondary        structures and some conserved RNA secondary structures        function as cisregulatory regions in mRNAs rather than as        independent RNA genes We will be using the term ncRNA        gene to refer to our prediction targets but it must be        understood that this really means a conserved RNA secondary        structure that may or may not turn out to be an independent        functional ncRNA gene upon further analysis                    Algorithm                  Overview of the approach simple ungapped global          case          The key idea is to produce three probabilistic models          RNA COD and OTH describing different evolutionary          constraints on the pattern of mutations observed in a          pairwise sequence alignment We will first introduce toy          versions of these models for clarity          All three models use the pairgrammar formalism          described in     A standard hidden Markov model          HMM generates a single observable sequence by emitting          single residues whereas a pairHMM generates two aligned          sequences           X Y by emitting a pair of aligned          residues at a time or single residues in either sequence          to deal with insertion and deletion          The OTH model assumes mutations occur in a simple          positionindependent fashion OTH has    core          parameters which are the pairwise alignment          probabilities           P OTH           a b   that is the joint          probabilities of emitting an alignment of a nucleotide           a in sequence           X and a nucleotide           b in sequence           Y Table  OTH represents our          null hypothesis The probability of the alignment given          the OTH model is just the product of the probabilities of          the individual aligned positions          The COD model assumes that the aligned sequences          encode homologous proteins In a coding region we          intuitively expect to see mutations that make          conservative amino acid substitutions in particular we          expect an abundance of synonymous mutations To capture          this COD has    core parameters which are           P COD           a                      a                      a                       b                      b                      b             the probabilities of the          correlated emission of two codons  that is three          nucleotides           a                      a                      a            in sequence           X  aligned to three nucleotides           b                      b                      b            in sequence           Y  See Table for an example of          pair codon probabilities The probability of the          alignment given the COD model for a particular reading          frame is the product of the probabilities of the          individual aligned codons in that frame Since we dont          know the correct frame           a priori  the overall probability          of an alignment is a sum over all six frames           f                     and we assume that all frames are a priori          equiprobable in the alignment            P            f COD            The RNA model assumes that the pattern of mutation          significantly conserves a homologous RNA secondary          structure Intuitively we expect a significant abundance          of pairwisecorrelated mutations that preserve          WatsonCrick complementarity in an as yet unknown          structure To capture this the core parameters in RNA          are the    probabilities           P RNA           a                       L                      a                       R                       b                       L                      b                       R              that is the probabilities associated with the          correlated emission of one basepair            a                       L                      a                       R             in sequence           X aligned to a homologous basepair                     b                       L                      b                       R             in sequence           Y Table  Single stranded          positions in the alignment are modeled by           P RNA           a b  the same functional form as          in the OTH model For a given alignment of known          structure           s  the probability           P             s  RNA is a product of terms           P RNA           x                       i                      x                       j                       y                       i                      y                       j             for all base paired positions           i j and           P RNA           x                       k                       y                       k             for all single stranded positions           k in the alignment Since we dont          know the correct structure           a priori  the overall probability          of an alignment given by the RNA model is a sum over all          structures           s                     But here we cannot assume equiprobability for the          various structures           s as we did for coding frames           f above in fact calculating           P            s RNA implies a full          probabilistic model describing favorable and unfavorable          RNA secondary structures The necessary machinery for          calculating this weighted sum is exactly what we          developed previously for searching for significant          structure in single sequences     In that paper we          parameterized a stochastic contextfree grammar SCFG          that incorporates a model of hairpin loops stems          bulges and internal loops including stacking and          looplength distributions making a probabilistic          counterpart for the widely used MFOLD program for RNA          structure prediction The SCFG we use here is almost the          same with the difference that now we generate two          aligned sequences simultaneously ie a pairSCFG The          summation over all possible structures can be done          efficiently using an SCFG Inside algorithm a dynamic          programming algorithm          In Figure we present an example of three different          alignments with different mutation patterns and how they          would be scored with the three different models          Finally in order to classify the input alignment as          RNA COD or OTH we use the three likelihoods to          calculate a Bayesian posterior probability under the          simple assumption that the three models are           a priori equiprobable Alignments          with high RNA posterior probabilities are interpreted as          candidate ncRNA genes          For scoring purposes it will also be useful to          calculate logodds scores in the standard manner             relative to a fourth model which we will call IID In          IID we assume the two sequences are nonhomologous          independent identically distributed sequences The IID          model has  parameters corresponding to the expected base          compositions ofthe two sequences           P           X            a  and           P           Y            b                           Parameter estimation in the simple case          Parameter estimation is crucial for our approach The          three models have to be calibrated to an overall similar          evolutionary divergence time and to similar base          compositions Else one model might be artifactually          favored over the others because of the degree of          conservation or the base composition in an input          alignment not because of the pattern of mutation          In an ideal world we could empirically estimate the          parameters of each model using training sets of pairwise          alignments culled from real RNAs coding regions and          other conserved noncoding regions using pairwise          alignments that were all about the same percent identity          Unfortunately it is unlikely that we can amass suitably          large training sets Instead we take a somewhat           ad hoc approach that ties the          parameters of all three models as much as possible to a          particular choice of a standard amino acid substitution          matrix such as BLOSUM We will derive joint codon          probabilities from the chosen scoring matrix then use          these codon probabilities to calculate the average single          nucleotide substitution probabilities in OTH then          combine these OTH substitution parameters with basepair          frequencies to obtain the parameters of the RNA model          This procedure is as follows          First the    codon emission probabilities           P COD           a                      a                      a                      b                      b                      b                       t  for some divergence time           t  are derived from the chosen          substitution matrix ie the choice of matrix defines           t  We make an independence          assumption that the conditional probability of each codon          depends only on its own encoded amino acid  ie it          does not depend on the the other codon  so we can use          the approximation                    for           a                       a                       a                       b                       b                       b                        A C G U  and           A B  amino acids An example          of where this independence assumption is violated for          equiprobable codon bias our parameters will say that          aligning TCA to AGT is as likely as aligning TCA to TCG          because all three are Ser codons despite the fact that          the first case requires three transversions           P            A            B            t  are the joint target          probabilities of aligned amino acids obtained from the          amino acid score matrix such as BLOSUM     as          described by     The terms           P            a                      a                      a                       A  are the probabilities of          observing a particular codon given a particular amino          acid these terms can include a codonbias model             and if desired a substitution error model to deal with          errorprone sequence data The sum over all possible          amino acids in equation  is relevant only when a          substitution error model applies since otherwise each          observed codon can only mean one possible amino acid          The  mutation probabilities for the OTH model are          then obtained by marginalizing the corresponding          codoncodon emission probabilities in equation  in          the following way                    The    core parameters of the RNA model are          calculated by combining the OTH model which sets the          average divergence of the two sequences with some          additional parameters that specify the probability of          base pairs This involves making an independence          assumption                    Alternatively we can symmetrically derive a equation          in which the divergence is controlled by the mutation          probability of the right position instead of the left          position We calculate the overall joint probability of          the aligned base pairs as the average of these two          equations                    Here           P pair

                     t  are just the probabilities of          the various sorts of base pairs GC AU GU in a single          RNA structure                          Extension of the models to gapped local          alignments                      The OTH Model            The complete OTH model a pair hidden Markov model            is diagrammed in Figure  The flanking doublecircled            states             F                           L                           F                           R               and             F                           J              are a shorthand for a full IID model of the type            in Figure  which allow the alignment to be flanked or            interrupted by runs of unassigned independent            residues In general we will use the convention that            singlecircled states are single states and            doublecircled states represent some composite state            of some kind previously defined This differs from a            convention in formal languages in which doublecircled            states are terminal states of a finitestate automaton                           The OTH model requires us to specify emission            probabilities for the state XY that emits two aligned            nucleotides and also for the X and Y states that            emit one nucleotide aligned to a gap character in the            other sequence The emission probabilities for state            XY             P             XY              a              b              t  are simply the mutation            probabilities

of            the             P             XY s                                            The COD Model            The complete COD model a pair hidden Markov model            is diagrammed in Figure  A new degree of locality            is introduced In addition to regions of the alignment            that are better left unaligned ie generated by the            flanking states of an IID model we want to model            regions of the alignment that are not coding but still            wellconserved To model this we add three full copies            of OTH models to the core of the COD model indicated            by the symbols             O                           B                           O                           E               and             O                           J               We represent a full OTH model with                        with the understanding that any arrow that goes into                         O  indicates a transition into            the              S                           FL               state of the             F                           L              flanking model and any arrow leaving              O  emerges from the              T                           FR               state of the             F                           R              flanking model In this way the COD model can            score a codingaligned region that is nested between            other independentlyaligned regions            The different COD states described in Figure emit            correlated codon pairs possibly with indels To deal            with BLASTN misalignments of codons and possible            applications to errorprone sequence data expressed            sequence tags or lowpass genome shotgun we model             or  frameshifts by having a probability of emitting            abnormal codons of  or  nucleotides in addition to            the more expected indels of multiples of three            nucleotides No

the joint codon            probabilities             P CODgiven in equation  for            the toy case For incomplete codons we do the            convenient marginalizations For example                        Notice that there are three different             C   states of which we have            only described one in equation  Similarly there are            four different             C   states and six            different             C   states depending on the            position of the gaps We will represent these            codonemission probabilities in general by             P

The complete RNA model a pair stochastic context            free grammar pairSCFG is crudely diagrammed in            Figure  The crucial SCFG machinery of the model is            encapsulated in the RNA state of the diagram This            pairSCFG similar to the SCFG described in                has three states labeled             W              W                           B                           V  They correspond to the             V and             W dynamic programming matrices in                and to the matrices             wx              wbx and             vx of the diagrammatic            representation in      We use the diagrams as a            convenient visual representation to enumerate the            configurations which we take into account in the model            State             V represents a substring            sequence fragment in which the ends are definitely            basepaired States             W and             W                           B              represent a substring in which the ends are either            paired or unpaired            To extend these more or less standard RNA folding            algorithm conventions from a single sequence to an            aligned pair of sequences let us introduce some            vectorial notation In this notation stands for the            corresponding positions             i in sequence             X and             i in sequence             Y  Similarly stands for the pair            of nucleotides in positions             i and             i of sequences             X and             Y respectively With this            notation we also define and  We are going to assume            that for two aligned columns and              x                           i              is basepaired to             x                           j              if and only if             x                         i  is basepaired to             y             j which is a reasonable assumption            if we are trying to find commonly occurring secondary            structures within an alignment of two sequences                        W acts as the starting state             W and             W                           B              are essentially equivalent but             W                           B              is used exclusively for starting multiloops The            production rules for             W are for             W                           B               replace             W by             W                           B              everywhere in the recursion                        The vector provides us with a compact notation to            represent the three possible situations in which one            nucleotide is emitted in at least one of the two            sequences in the alignment The components             e             x and             e             y take values  or  with at            least one of the two being different from zero If             e             x   or             e             y   we place a gap in the            corresponding position in the alignment            The symbol             V represents the paired state            that is the state we are in after emitting one pair in            each sequence The recursion for state             V is                        Here the first transition corresponds to hairpin            loops and is equivalent to function             FH              i j  in     the second            transition corresponds to stems bulges and internal            loops and is equivalent to function             FL              i j k l  in     the last            transition corresponds to multiloops that is loops            closed by more than two hydrogen bonds The length of            the alignments generated for those hairpin loops and            bulges and internal loops is variable and depends on            the number of gaps introduced The only condition is            that all nucleotides in that segment have to be used             for instance and for the hairpin loops            The full description of the algorithms associated to            this grammar is given in the Additional file The            algorithms requires two kind of emission            probabilities              the concurrent emission of two paired nucleotide            in both sequences already introduced in equation                          the concurrent emission of one unpaired            nucleotide in both sequences which are taken as the            mutation probabilities in equation             Both types of emission probabilities have been            extended to also emit gaps For any position  we also            introduce a penalty for mutating to a gap and            another one for pairing to a gap This is a linear            gap cost and is more convenient than implementing the            additional extra states that an affine gap cost would            require            The vectorial notation becomes particularly            important if we realigned the input sequences to the            RNA model In this paper though we will only be            working with a special case where we hold an input            BLASTN pairwise alignment fixed and simply score it            with the RNA model in this case for any given vector                                                Transition Probabilities          In all three models one of the prices we pay for          introducing realistic flexibility is that we have          introduced a number of transition probability parameters          in addition to the emission probabilities presented in          the ungapped case Section  Now we have to determine          the transition probabilities of the different models          Again we want the models tuned to the same level of          gappiness else alignments may be artifactually          classified based on how gappy they are Whereas we were          able to construct divergencematched emission          probabilities for the three models in a somewhat          justified fashion we have no guiding theory for          constructing divergencematched transition          probabilities          Instead we have estimated all new transition          probabilities by hand The number of additional          parameters in the most complete models is  for the OTH          model and  for the COD model and RNA models These          parameters have been optimized by studying the          algorithms discrimination ability on model generated          data and random sequence alignments More details on the          type of simulated data used to set the transition          probabilities of the models is given in Section  This          approach to estimating the transition parameters of the          models is very arbitrary but we do not currently see a          plausible alternative          The RNA model also has additional SCFGrelated          probability parameters to take into account length          distributions of hairpin loops bulges and internal          loops Those parameters have been determined from a          training set of aligned tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs as          described previously                                Alignment and scoring algorithms          We are given a pairwise sequence alignment  composed          of           L aligned columns We will hold the          input alignment fixed Thus globally aligning and          scoring the alignment with each of the three models could          be done by straightforward extensions of standard HMM          Viterbi andor Forward algorithms and SCFG CYK andor          Inside algorithms The OTH and COD pairHMM alignment          algorithm would cost O           L  in storage and time the RNA          pairSCFG algorithm would cost O           L  in storage and O           L  in time               We are interested however in a combination of the          standard algorithms Consider the RNA model Recall that          we need to obtain           P  RNA by a summation over all          possible structures which will require the Inside          algorithm rather than the CYK algorithm which like          Viterbi for HMMs recovers the maximum likelihood parse          ie structure But we will also be interested in          obtaining a maximum likelihood location of a predicted          RNA within the input alignment  that is we would like          to identify the maximum likelihood position of the          starting and ending nucleotides that are aligned to          states in the core of the RNA model as opposed to          flanking states that are accounting for flanking          nonconserved IID and conserved but nonRNA OTH          nucleotides in the input alignment This would require          the CYK maximum likelihood parse algorithm for the RNA          model outside of the core RNA pairSCFG state          To combine the desired features of the two algorithms          we use a trick introduced by Stormo and Haussler              perhaps most widely known for its application in the          semiMarkov model of the protein genefinding program          GENSCAN     The basic idea is that we start with a          model organized into metastates such as the           O                       B                       O                       E                       O                       J             and RNA states of the RNA model in Figure  Each          metastate contains its own possibly complex and          arbitrary model of a feature such as the pairSCFG          represented by the RNA state The metastates are          connected to each other by transition probabilities as in          an HMM To parse and score a sequence feature scores          are first precomputed for the score of all possible          subsequences           ij being generated by each          metastate then a dynamic programming algorithm is used          to assemble a maximum likelihood parse of the sequence          into a series of component features Thus we can for          instance use a pairSCFG Inside algorithm to precompute          scores           W                       ij            for the core RNA metastate of the RNA model          generating the part of the alignment from           ij summed over all possible          structures then use the StormoHaussler parsing          algorithm to determine the optimal           ij segment that should be          assigned as structural RNA versus assigning flanking          sequence to the           O                       B                       O                       E            or           O                       J            metastates describing nonRNA conserved residues          and nonconserved residues          StormoHaussler parsing algorithms add one order of          complexity both in storage and time to the underlying          dynamic programming problem to which they are applied          The Forward algorithm for scoring a pairHMM against a           fixed pairwise alignment is           O            L  but since HMM dynamic          programming algorithms work by iteratively calculating          scores of prefixes            j of increasing length whereas we          need scores of subsections           ij  we have to run the algorithm                    L times once from each possible          start point           i  making the feature scoring          phase           O            L  in storage and time for both          the OTH and the COD pairHMM The COD pairHMM would be           O            L  in memory but the actual          implementation uses a simplified           O            L  version for the OTH metastates          included in the COD model that keeps the whole COD          parsing algorithm           O            L  The Inside algorithm for          scoring a pairSCFG against a fixed pairwise alignment is                    O            L  space and           O            L  time and conveniently yields          the matrix of scores we need for all subsections           ij  Therefore the computational          complexity of our complete algorithm is dominated by the          Inside algorithm for scoring the core RNA state of the          RNA model See Additional filefor more details          In principle we could forget about the input pairwise          alignment and allow our three models to optimally          realign the input sequences This would be desirable it          is dangerous for example to rely on the external          sequence alignment program eg BLASTN to produce a          correct secondary structural alignment of two homologous          RNAs whereas the RNA pairSCFG which models          basepairing correlation would potentially produce          better structural alignments However such an algorithm          would be expensive for two input sequences of length           m and           n respectively scoring the RNA          pairSCFG would cost           O            m            n  in storage and           O            m            n  in time See the Additional          filefor a detailed description of all the different          algorithms and their complexity Since this realignment          approach is prohibitive we rely on an assumption that          the external pairwise alignment algorithm will produce          alignments that are close enough to being correct for          coding regions and structural RNAs even though the          external alignment program has no notion of these          constraints                          Bayesian score evaluation          Once we have calculated the probabilities that a          pairwise alignment has been generated by any one of the          three models we can classify the alignment into one of          three using a posterior probability calculation                    where                    We assume a uniform distribution for the prior          probabilities           P Model                       i                      In some figures we use a phase diagram representation          of the same information in the three posterior          probabilities We plot logodds scores of the COD and RNA          models with respect to the OTH model in an            x y  plane                    We can then separate the plane into three different          regions phases dominated by any of the three models          for example see Figure  Those three phases          correspond to the conditions                    Points deep in one of the phases represent a higher          posterior probability for a particular model whereas          points falling next to phasetransition boundaries          represent situations in which the method can not clearly          decide for one model or the other                          Implementation          This approach was implemented in ANSI C in a program          called QRNA The source code and the full set of          probability parameters used in QRNA are freely available          from

input alignment is given in a modified aligned          FASTA file format For instance the following file          contains the two homologous nematode sequences shown in          the BLASTN alignment

gap characters preserving the pairwise          alignment In many cases there would be more gap          characters than in this particular example Multiple          pairs of sequences can be added to a single fasta file          and will be scored sequentially one pair at a time          Typing the following command line          qrna fastafile          we obtain the output in the following form

length           is scored The window slides across the alignment and          each window is scored independently from the others This          option is useful when the input alignment is long or

implementing the three probabilistic models components          of our comparative method QRNA We give the most general          description of the scoringparsing algorithms We also          indicate how to obtain some simplifications that are part          of the software implementation          Click here for file                            Results                  Tests on simulated data          Because all three models are fully probabilistic we          can use them in a generative mode to sample synthetic          pairwise alignments These simulations allow us to assess          the sensitivity and specificity of the approach on          idealized data to get a sense of the best that the          algorithm can do We generated   pairwise alignments          of  nucleotides in length from each of the three          models Each of these   alignments was then scored          and classified by the program Results are shown in          Figure  showing that simulated alignments are almost          always classified correctly          We wanted to test that the classification is based on          the pattern of mutation in the alignments not on a          spurious artifact of differing base composition sequence          identity or gap frequency To do this we randomly          shuffled each alignment by columns  preserving the          sequence identity in the alignment while destroying any          correlations in the pattern of mutation Figure shows          that shuffled alignments are classified in the OTH phase          as expected          These simulation experiments were iterated during the          development of the approach They were important guide in          setting the           ad hoc transition probabilities in          each model          We used these simulation results from RNAgenerated          and shuffled data to set crude but reasonable score          thresholds for classification of alignments as RNA A          threshold of  bits for the RNA posterior logodds          scores would determine a minimum error rate area with a          frequency of  false positives and  false          negatives In wholegenome scans we want to push the          rate of false positives down even at the expense of          increasing the number of false negatives To reduce the          false positive frequency to  we would need a cutoff          of  bits which increases the false negative frequency          to  We set a cutoff of  bits for the remainder of          the results in this paper These error rates are probably          somewhat pessimistic Figure shows that the rate of          false positive RNA classifications of COD or          OTHgenerated data is lower about  at the bit          cutoff that we set based on finding false positives in          shuffled RNAgenerated alignments                          Tests on simulated genomes          To get a better idea of the false positive rate in          whole genome screens where the background is dominated          by sequences other than RNAs we used the COD and OTH          models to simulate two aligned complete pseudobacterial          genomes with no structural RNA genes present The aligned          pseudogenomes have the following characteristics                megabases in total length with coding regions          generated from the COD model with length distributions          distributed normally around a mean length of           nucleotides and intergenic regions generated using the          OTH model with length distributions distributed normally          around the mean length of  nucleotides thus an          overall coding density of           Because the parameters of the models are ultimately          dependent upon the BLOSUM amino acid scoring matrix          the average percent identity of the aligned genomes was          only  in coding regions and  in intergenic          regions This is a weakness in the simulation because in          a real genome screen we would be looking at alignments          in the  nucleotide identity range as we discuss          later in the paper          The parameters also gave a simulated pair of genomes          with an overall GC content of  From previous          experience     we expected that genomic sequences          with high GC content might tend to be misclassified as          RNAs We therefore devised a crude way of modifying the          parameters of the models to correspond to different base          compositions by expressing various joint probabilities          instead as a function of conditional probabilities ie          for two aligned codons           c c                     P            c c             P            cc            P            c             where the           P            c  are codon frequencies obtained          by marginalization of the joint probabilities and the          information about the mutation rate is in the conditional          probabilities           P            cc  We then can modify overall          frequencies to a different set while keeping the same          conditional probabilities The joint probabilities are          then recalculated as                    where is obtained as the product of the single          nucleotide frequencies for the new GC composition This          approximation for the codon probabilities could be          refined to better reflect the actual codon bias of the          genome          This correction of probabilities can be performed for          both codoncodon probabilities and independent mutation          probabilities Using this modification to the COD and OTH          models we generated two more pairs of genomes which had          overall GC contents of  and  We then ran QRNA          using its default parameters ie uncorrected for GC          composition across these three aligned simulated genomes          in scanning mode using a window  nucleotides wide          moving  nucleotides at a time and counted the number          of times a window was called RNA with a score of            bits All such windows are false positives because the          simulated genomes have no RNA component          The observed false positive numbers for the  Mb          lowGC averageGC and highGC simulated genomes were            and  respectively or about  per megabase of          pairwise alignment analyzed This indicates that          specificity degrades with higher GC compositions We          reanalyzed the highGC genome using the highGC parameter          set that generated it ie parameters corrected for GC          composition and saw one false positive This indicates          that setting the parameters of the three models to be          appropriate for the GC composition of the input alignment          should improve the effectiveness of the approach          however our current method for doing this may be too          crude                          Tests on known RNAs          To test the sensitivity and specificity of our method          on real RNAs we analyzed pairwise alignments taken from          a multiple alignment of  eukaryotic SRPRNAs             also known as SL RNA and a multiple alignment of           eukaryotic RNaseP RNAs     These RNA genes were          chosen because they are independent from the set of tRNAs          and rRNAs used to train the RNA model          We did two different types of experiments In the          first we used the pairwise alignments as given in the          curated multiple sequence alignment These pairwise          alignments are an ideal case for QRNA because they are          structurally aligned In the second set of experiments          we took each known RNA in turn and used it as a BLASTN          query against the rest of the RNAs then classified all          significant alignments with QRNA This is a more          realistic scenario for QRNA a BLASTN primary sequence          alignment may be fragmentary andor not entirely          structurally correct All alignments were scored with          QRNA using default parameters          For the first experiment we used QRNA to score in          full ie not with a scanning window the            different structural pairwise alignments for SRPRNAs          and the   structural pairwise alignments for RNaseP          RNAs The manually curated RNA structural alignments have          a wide range of sequence diversity that extends from           to  pairwise identity The number of pairwise          alignments that were classified as RNA with a score of            bits was counted and these counts were binned by          ranges of percent identity The fraction of alignments          classified as RNA is a measure of the sensitivity of          QRNA To measure specificity we randomly shuffled each          pairwise alignment by columns which destroys the nested          RNA structure correlations but retains the percentage          identity of the alignments Shuffled alignments that are          classified by QRNA as RNA are false positives The          results in Table show that QRNA can detect about half of          the alignments as RNAs at a wide range of percent          identities however specificity seriously degrades for          alignments over  identity          In the second set of experiments we have taken each          single RNA gene in a given family both for the SRPRNA          and the RNaseP RNA families and used it as a BLASTN          query against all genes in the same family including          itself We used WUBLASTN MPWashU  Feb           version default parameters and scoring matrix and          retained those alignments that were longer than           nucleotides with an Evalue of   and with an          overall similarity of   Of the   possible          comparisons this produced   alignments  for SRP          RNAs and  for RNaseP RNAs These were then scored by          QRNA to measure sensitivity and then shuffled by columns          and rescored to measure specificity Table shows that          specificity follows the same trend we saw in the          structural alignments with a sharp degradation in          specificity over  identity Sensitivity however          drops off steeply in the other direction as percent          identity declines sensitivity decreases          We also analyzed the dependency of sensitivity and          specificity with the GC content of the alignments both          for structural and BLASTNtype alignments We observe a          similar trend for both types of alignments both          sensitivity and specificity reach their best values for          GC contents ranging from  to  Specificity drops          faster for high GC content alignments which is          consistent with the fact that unstructured sequences with          high GC content tend to produce more spurious secondary          structure predictions than low GC content sequences                       These results show two competing forces at play In          order to be detected by QRNA two RNA sequences must be          similar enough to produce a BLASTN alignment that is          reasonably correct and extensive but they also must be          dissimilar enough to show compensatory mutations in          basepaired positions of the RNA secondary structure          There is therefore a sweet spot of percent identity in          which QRNA performance is optimal Based on these          results we choose to analyze only BLASTN pairwise          alignments of between  and  nucleotide identity          with QRNA However we do not fully understand the          degradation of specificity at high percentage identities          see Discussion                          Tests on a whole genome          To test QRNA performance in a realistic whole genome          screen we used it to analyze the           Escherichia coli genome by          comparisons to the related genome of           Salmonella typhi  We compared QRNA          annotation to the curated annotation of known coding          genes ncRNAs and intergenic regions     The          feature tables for version M of the           E coli genome includes  known          RNA genes and   known coding genes ORFs The known          RNA genes include  rRNAs  tRNAs and  miscellaneous          RNAs RNase P for example At least  other known RNA          genes       csrB oxyS micF and rprA  were not          present in the M feature table          We split the           E coli genome in three different          components  RNA features a total of  kb  of the          genome  ORF features  kb  of the genome          and  intergenic sequences of length   nt  kb           of the genome Each sequence was compared against          the complete           Salmonella typhi genome Sanger          Centre unpublished genome data          httpwwwsangeracukProjectsStyphi using WUBLASTN          and all alignments of   nt with an Evalue of            and a percent identity of   and   were kept This          resulted in  alignments to RNAs   alignments to          ORFs and   alignments to intergenic regions The          large number of alignments in intergenic regions is due          to repetitive sequence families These alignments were          then classified by QRNA in scanning mode scoring          overlapping windows of  nucleotides sliding           nucleotides at a time and all windows with scores of            bits for one of the three models were annotated as RNA          COD or OTH correspondingly          We then looked at these data in two ways First how          many of the known features ncRNAs and ORFs were          detected correctly We counted a known feature as          detected as RNA or COD if it had one or more          overlapping QRNA annotations of that type It is possible          for different parts of a long feature especially the          ORFs to be detected with different annotations For the           known ncRNAs  have one or more BLASTN alignments          to           S typhi in the right range and          all  were annotated as RNA by QRNA none were called          COD For the  known ORFs  had BLASTN alignments          in the right range  were called COD  were called          RNA and  were called both COD and RNA          These results indicate that the sensitivity of the          program is largely dependent upon the availability of          appropriate comparative sequence data  only  of the           known RNAs were detected but invariably in this          case a failure to detect an RNA resulted from the lack          of an appropriate BLASTN alignment to analyze of           identity Therefore sensitivity could presumably be          improved by using multiple comparative genome sequences          at different evolutionary distances          A second way to look at the data is from the          perspective of how many of QRNAs annotations are          correct In a postprocessing step any overlapping          windows with the same QRNA annotation were merged into a          longer annotated region A total of  regions are          annotated in the ncRNA sequence fraction  as RNA none          as COD and  as OTH  regions are annotated in the          ORF sequence fraction  as RNA  as COD and           as OTH  regions are annotated in the intergenic          sequence fraction  as RNA  as COD and  as          OTH Therefore QRNA annotated a total of  sequence          regions as OTH of which   are actually in known          ORFsthis means we must interpret an OTH annotation as a          catchall dont know category rather than as a          conserved noncoding sequence of potential interest QRNA          annotated a total of  regions as COD of which            are in known ORFs The other  COD annotated          regions could either be false positive calls or could be          previously undetected small coding genes          Most interestingly QRNA annotated a total of           regions of           E coli as RNA of which only            are in known RNAs It is not possible to          definitively accept or reject the rest of these          annotations without additional experimental data The           RNA annotations that overlap known ORFs may be false          positives or may indicate cisregulatory RNA structures          that overlap coding regions It is intriguing that a          disproportionate number of QRNAs RNA annotations            were in the intergenic data fraction which is          only  of the genome  which is what we would expect to          see if there were a fair number of undetected RNA          features in the genome          We examined many of these  regions by eye Four of          them are the four ncRNA genes csrB oxyS micF and          rprA that were not included in the M feature table for                    E coli  Others are repetitive          sequence families with conserved palindromic sequence          such as BIMEs     Some correspond to known          cisregulatory RNA structures such as independent          terminators which have an RNA stem loop structure and          transcriptional attenuators For about half of these          regions we cannot exclude the possibility that they          correspond to novel RNAs and we cannot assign a known          biological role to them without additional computational          or experimental evidence A more indepth QRNA screen of           E coli for novel ncRNAs using          multiple comparative genomes from proteobacteria          accompanied by experimental evidence that many of the          predicted RNAs are indeed novel ncRNA genes is presented          elsewhere ER RJ Klein TA Jones and SRE          manuscript submitted                            Discussion        There are a number of ways in which we could improve        QRNA The three probabilistic models are calibrated to a        fixed evolutionary distance We used the BLOSUM        substitution matrix to define the fixed evolutionary        distance of our three models and it is now quite clear        that this is the wrong distance Our models generate        pairwise alignments of about  sequence identity We        expect on theoretical grounds that this is where the models        would perform optimally on real input alignments However        BLASTN cannot detect RNA sequences that are this diverged        Our evaluations indicated a sweet spot of  identity        for QRNA to work best in its current formulation We        suspect that we could obtain some improvement by choosing a        substitution matrix corresponding to more closely related        nucleotide sequences        In principle QRNA may also be useful as a codingregion        genefinder The coding model is a fully probabilistic        formalization of comparative analysis ideas used by the        genefinder CRITICA     and by comparative exon finding        approaches such as the EXOFISH vertebrate         Tetraodon comparison    and the        humanmouse comparison in     In the         E coli whole genome screen the        sensitivity and specificity of QRNA coding annotations seem        quite high We have not yet attempted to optimize the        performance of QRNA for this purpose        In terms of other QRNA improvements it should be        advantageous to make the emission and transition parameters        of the models conditional on a parametric evolutionary        distance We could then optimize a maximum likelihood        distance separately for each input alignment or        marginalize over all distances in a more Bayesian        approach This should widen the  alignment identity        window that QRNA works best in  in particular by        constructing models more appropriate for nearly identical        sequences where we currently have high false positive        rates        It would be good to have more theory to guide how we        produce divergencematched transition probability        parameters for the three models We suspect our         ad hoc estimation may be causing the        RNA model to be favored artifactually in certain cases        less gappy alignments and longer alignments elevating        our false positive rate        We also made a number of simplifying independence        assumptions in trying to calculate QRNAs parameters all        from a single chosen amino acid substitution matrix Some        of these assumptions probably reduce our performance It        would be desirable to move towards estimating parameters        based on real datasets of aligned nucleotide sequences if        large enough datasets could be amassed        We are relying on BLASTN to produce approximately        correct pairwise alignments of coding regions or RNA        structures even though BLASTN is purely a        positionindependent primary sequence alignment program We        could instead realign the two input sequences using the        pairgrammars In principle this should increase the        performance of QRNA particularly for more dissimilar        sequences Unfortunately alignment of two sequences to a        pairSCFG is effectively the Sankoff algorithm    with        time and memory complexity of         O          L  and         O          L  respectively so we will need a        more clever algorithmic strategy than straightforward        dynamic programming if indeed dynamic programming RNA        structure alignment in a fourdimensional hypercube can be        called straightforward        Because QRNA detects conserved RNA secondary structure        it is not expected to detect ncRNAs that apparently lack        significant intramolecular secondary structure such as CD        box small nucleolar RNAs     Identifying novel        unstructured ncRNAs remains an entirely open problem A        pure computational approach will probably have to identify        transcriptional signals  promoters enhancers and        terminators  and this remains a difficult problem        particularly in complex genomes Experimental screens for        novel ncRNAs may prove more fruitful for unstructured        ncRNAs Expression arrays that pave the entire target        genome with probes can detect novel transcripts            and cDNA libraries that enrich for small nonpolyadenylated        RNAs can be constructed and EST sequenced            QRNA is also expected to identify         cis regulatory RNA structures in        mRNAs in addition to structured ncRNA genes        Distinguishing an ncRNA gene from a         cis regulatory RNA structure in an        mRNA is nontrivial in absence of experimental evidence        This cautions against using QRNA for fully automated genome        annotation and gene counting exercises in the way that        protein genefinders like GENSCAN are used        Instead QRNA is best used as a computational screen for        candidate ncRNA genes after which candidate loci are        further characterized both computationally and        experimentally before considering them to be genes Both        the data presented here and in a second paper detailing a        careful         E coli genome screen with        experimental verification of many novel ncRNA genes ER        RJ Klein TA Jones and SRE manuscript submitted        indicate that QRNA can be successfully used in this role        Although we have much we can do to improve its performance        we believe QRNA is the first example of a generally        applicable computational genefinder for noncoding RNA        genes We expect to be able to apply QRNA  based screens        for ncRNAs to a number of organisms as comparative sequence        data become available  including yeast         Caenorhabditis          Drosophila  human and several        microbial systems                    Conclusions        We have described an algorithm that uses three different        probabilistic models for RNAstructureconstrained        codingconstrained and positionindependent evolution to        examine the pattern of mutations in a pairwise sequence        alignment The alignment is classified as RNA coding or        other according to the Bayesian posterior probability of        each model We have implemented this algorithm as a        program QRNA which we consider to be a prototype        structural ncRNA genefinding program
