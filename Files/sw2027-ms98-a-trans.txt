        okay um i dont know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next   were   its pretty bad but its true  you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we dont want to smush their creativity you know we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next   well im kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what were doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents   yeah   and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like im doing that and i cant see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around so if im just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if were going to have a meeting where were having the attorneys come in or people from uh other partys attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up yeah and ill wear a dress and hose and stuff   yeah yeah you know were kind of that way too i try to im the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and   umhum   and you know if i know that theyre gonna be there you know you you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know theyre not you know i ive been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and its just so its just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is so   umhum thats right thats right a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at TI the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasnt air conditioned   uh   and if we were there like in the middle of the summer its unairconditioned it was dusty and dirty um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didnt really know we werent supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didnt know that was a big no no   uhhuh oh no   and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is theres only a few people that work there and he should he knew who worked there he should have realized that we werent regulars in the warehouse there   uhhuh   and he came up to us and he just said whos your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisors supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts   oh no   he didnt at least say to us did you know youre not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it   oh how awful sounds like Mister Power Hungry  but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts   yeah uhhuh   and i dont care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts is all they were i mean i i dont care what else you call them you know if theyre below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts if theyre above the knee they turn into shorts you know and these werent even really         full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and because these werent even those these were like   umhum   pretty short black and they were very dressy they were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice   hum   but you dont wear shorts to work you know i mean  as far as im concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them its always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime you know if they just you know the management doesnt ever seem to want to take an   um hum   cut off you know that yeah no this is where were going to draw the line this is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know   yeah hum   so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but   well ive seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no   yeah uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesnt make them not shorts anymore you know   yeah   i mean ive never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still its theyre shorts i dont care what you say theyre shorts you know well i think TIs dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i     i know i didnt know that EDS has a very strict dress code i had a friend oh   oh do they really   definitely i had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out for men its particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing wing tipped shoes oh it is definitely lined out   oh my God   women are not allowed to wear slacks she wears coordinated suits   i could i couldnt afford to work there   and a and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is   oh no   spelled out when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said   uhhuh   these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and  hair just this way yeah   TI says no shorts and no halters you know thats it   and EDS is very particular about this hair cuts i mean it was like you cant have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed   wow i dont know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i i see i i am more i dont know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say im nuts but i am more productive when im in pants       i i am i work faster i get things done faster than when im in a dress and heels you know i it and its weird but i its i do i i can i can get so much more done if im dressed comfortable you know   well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didnt get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse   right   and she came with skirts just like shed be going into the office   yeah   and wed try wed try to say didnt you bring any pants or anything were were out here in the warehouse you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and youre gonna have to unload unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid   uhhuh you cant do that in a skirt  poor thing   and she and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her   oh yuck yeah thats terrible thats terrible gosh       well i dont know i just figure you know yeah sometimes i worry about you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know but ill go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you dont dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if   umhum   you know if upper management doesnt notice that and remember that later on but you know i dont know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and theyre in jeans so you know   some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and its funny because theres one that always wears a suit a matter of fact hes never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned   really wow   and then theres another one whos whos a little younger and a little more yuppyish and hes always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it   uhhuh yeah   and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so thats just you   isnt that funny   you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we   thats great   weve kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times its its mainly who theyre going to meet with theyre theyre meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then thats how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers     yeah   like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the theyre engineers that theyre talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and theyre usually casual   thats the way to do it i mean thats the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when theyre meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit   yeah   its gonna make the people theyre meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know  or it would me you know   its its one of those slippery attorneys coming in here   yeah yeah look at this slick guy i wonder what kind of money does he make uhhuh  i can see it now  well it was good to talk to you it was really enjoyable   yeah this is this is kind of a fun project ive done ive done some of the other speech programs but weve never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different   it really is oh yuck yeah well its kind of enjoyable im really looking forward to it  well thanks a lot byebye   yeah okay bye
