                okay   so i guess youre a Cowboy fan   oh yeah i guess were sort of were stuck with that down here Brad we have to be  but uh been its been difficult suffering with them through the past few years but it looks like they could be   thats true   you know on their way back a little bit   yeah whats whats the story with uh your quarterback though   our quarterbacks hurt right now hes gonna be out for a couple more weeks at the very least and may miss the rest of the season       course if theyre lucky enough to make the playoffs he may be ready for then   oh thats good   were were fortunate to have a you know a a fairly good back up quarterback thats come in but i tell you what the people of Dallas uh they love their Cowboys im a ive been here since seventy four and uh theyre quite easy to easily to get attached to and uh weve got our new coach now Jimmy Johnson which i we like we like what hes doing theyve forgotten about Tom Landry  hes a great coach in his day but theyve forgotten about him   yeah   so who   yeah isnt the Cowboys were the tradition you know   oh yes who whos your favorite team   uh well its kind of weird for me ill tell you why first of all i used to be a Jet fan when i grew up   right   i grew up on Long Island where the Jets play uh i mean theyre in New York City but its closer to Long Island   sure   uh then the Giants which were up in the Bronx uh but then around eighty five the Giants started playing really good defense and they started you know really not that im a fair weather fan but they really started looking good you know so now i root for both teams Jets and the Giants but im involved in this uh rotisserie league i dont know if youre familiar with those   no   well you draft players from different teams so its kind of you get points based on how many how many touch downs and and and and stuff like that that players on all different teams uh make   well ill be darned   so you get kind of caught up um  and now i got like you know players  players on on like Buffalo and and Washington and and i i happened to have uh your kicker   why sure umhum   and uh Micheal Irvin who was a great hes a great wide receiver and uh   right so how hows your team doing   so my teams doing pretty good for for those guys i have i do have a couple of Giants um but theyre not doing that much and uh i also have   well good the Giants are having a sad year   one Jet yeah theyre not theyre not looking too good um but you know its always tough after you win a Super Bowl i guess and   i know maybe were maybe were both teams of the future huh   yeah and they they um they um i mean last year was just fantastic with the Giants winning the Super Bowl it was just   oh were well it was fantastic they had a hell of a season   yeah and it was such a i dont know maybe because im a Giants fan but but uh it was such a unbelievable run you know all the games were like won by field goals and stuff like that so it was   oh i know they had a great coach i think theyre theyre missing their coach but   um   most of all theyre just theyre in a rebuilding type of thing theyve got theyre quarterbacks down too right now so   yeah   the big thing  oops   im here hello   big big Phils trying to come back hold just a second thats thats my other line   okay       sorry Brad okay   thats all right     so anyway Phils trying to bring them back right now i guess   yeah they got a big game this weekend i think if they win it they got a shot at getting into the playoffs but i dont think theyre gonna win   who they play this weekend   theyre playing the Eagles   oh its a big game yeah they play at up in Philadelphia   uh no they play in New York   play in New York well yeah good chance there hope so   but i i dont know  first of all they dont they havent done too well against the Eagles lately   i think we right and we just hope we just hope Dallas makes it and of course all that depends on what Philadelphia and New York does too so i dont know   and   yeah i guess you got to pipe it off having the Giants uh win this weekend to knock out Philadelphia   thats true because both our teams are like eight and five you guys are up what seven and six i guess   you know umhum but uh yeah i think i think i think Dallas will make it i think that i think theyre theyre uh theyre doing pretty well and i think that like if the season ended now theyd be in the playoffs so you just have to like win two out of the next three or something   yeah i hope so their first playoff games travel to Detroit i believe and thats thatll be a tough one on   really oh you never know i mean whats to you know Detroits only one game up maybe theyll oh well they lost to Detroit already though didnt they this year yes so they can   right yeah it was there but they lost them playing there but uh still a tough game   well maybe theyll get lucky and not have to go to Detroit because thats a tough place to play lately   they but you got Emmett Smith versus Barry Sanders it ought to be a little exciting be a good game anyway   yeah i guess their quarterback on uh Detroit was hurt too theyre all getting knocked down so maybe they have a better shot against this new quarterback because they havent Detroit hasnt played as well with this guy as with   you bet   um i dont know i think i think his names Kramer   yes   and uh they used to have uh Rodney Pete who was doing really well for them and then he got hurt so   yeah he was doing well and the kid from Houston they drafted from Houston uh they gave all that money to   right yeah hes doing a lot   theyve got a lot of high dollar players i tell you   yeah well uh   what do you this is off the subject a little bit but what do you feel about the amount of money these guys that are are making and uh the amount of time
