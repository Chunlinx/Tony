                oh have you ever thought about joining the Peace Corps   uh for not for any longer than about ten seconds   yeah was that was pretty much my thought too   no i have no  i have no real desire to do that   i ive ive ive actually ive talked to people that uh have have joined the Peace Corps and uh the idea of like you know spending spending like two years in a village in Uganda is you know teaching people how to like you know plow a straight furrow is just not my idea of something i want to do with my life   yeah yeah i dont doesnt appeal to me either       where i work uh theres a guy who actually joined the Peace Corps he worked here for a couple years and then he went to Ghana   uhhuh   in Africa       and uh   what did he say about it   well he hasnt come back yet   oh you mean he he i he did this just recently     yeah he went just recently   i you know i i thought that joining the Peace Corps was something that everybody did like in the sixties you know in   well theres yeah but theres actually been a resurgence of people getting into it i guess part partly for economic times   uhhuh   and uh i dont know any other reason but lot of people are been getting back into it i think   i yeah i i i talked to i was talking to somebody uh the other day and they they said i think they went they were in the Peace Corps and they ended up going to like Central America or something and uh   umhum   they ended up in this place where they hadnt seen a white face in like you know seventy five years   uhhuh   and uh they had to go on the its like they had typical it its the typical third world story you know they they had to every every once a week they had to get on the bus and then like drive up into and take drive up into the mountains and stop at each village you know and and have like give lectures on like public health and stuff   uhhuh   you know its like dont piss in the wells  that that type of stuff  and uh he said that they would get on the bus      uhhuh   and its like the children would come up and like touch him because you know they had never seen somebody that light you know a gringo and that it was it was pretty it was really pretty strange   sure   i it was it would seem to me like if joining the Peace Corps is like you know going to another signing up to go to another planet you know   yeah yeah i dont im not sure i mean i guess the motivation is partly you want to help these people but i think its a lot of people join it just to go to another country and kind of for the adventure of it i guess   i would really be afraid of i i dont know when i i went to school i i uh i took a course in Parasitology and stuff like that i would really be afraid of like you know of all the diseases and stuff that i could catch and like and man it it seems like a hell of a way to lose weight   um oh yeah yeah seems a little rough for that   you know  oh i dont know   but uh i dont know i kind of you know i dont mind going to Europe you know traveling and seeing the sights but i dont want to  have to go to Africa to   uhhuh i   no the maybe they theyll theyll fly you over there and back for free but doesnt seem worth it     no it it doesnt seem like the kind of job that i id really be interested im really interested in either   what type of work do you do now   oh im a im an engineer yeah   okay for who do you work for you work for   uh uh Lockheed   oh really i didnt know they had an office up there   yeah uh we uh they have a we work for some uh Lockheed Sanders we we dont build the aircraft per se we work on the uh like the avionics yeah we work we put the   Sanders avionics okay yeah ive heard of Sanders Corporation were they bought out by Lockheed and all of that okay   yeah yeah they they were bought out by Lockheed and its a they were they were involved like in in radars and thing and uh and things like that   right thats thats kind of the work that i do so thats why ive heard of Sanders i work for i work for Georgia Tech     uhhuh who do you work for oh okay uhhuh   in research   yeah we it its its not bad its not bad work although ill tell you its like uh i being in the defense industry is not is not really the thing to to be in right now   right thats right   it its sort of like being in steel like ten years ago   yeah youre just kind of biding your time   right you you know that uh  i was just talking to somebody about this the other day is that uh i i havent seen a a a new hire uh somebody you know just fresh out of college brought into the company in like a year and a half   uhhuh   and uh whats happening is that you know were just like kind of getting grayer and grayer and grayer you know the the theres no growth here   yeah uhhuh yeah it were essentially the same although some some laboratories are hiring if if they can find new technology uh you know or make an efforts to get into the commercial markets   umhum   so were kind of getting smaller through attrition but there in some cases were hiring also   yeah  this the this attrition thing though i that that thats like death itself in my mind
