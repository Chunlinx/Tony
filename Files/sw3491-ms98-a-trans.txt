              well lets see what have you seen lately   well uh City Slickers and Star Trek Five   five   yeah uh   yeah you only only five   yeah i thought id better see that one before i go and see six   well nah didnt need to   no i found that out   i just saw the latest one   how about yourself how is it   it was fantastic   oh i cant wait   yeah its the the lines in there were just perfect i mean it was classic Trek   now does the old Star Trek guys meet the new guys   no huhuh   no its just the old guys still     yeah it was just a rumor that that would happen this time however the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time so   you know that i read in People or somewhere no it was USA Today   umhum   that they said they werent gonna do anymore that was it   umhum yeah uh   but   except that the rumor is is that they still might but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation     huh im not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the the old guys was   so i think its a hundred years   huh   somewhere in that range considering that Spock was on an uh you know couple weeks ago and and that the the very first episode of Next Generation they had McCoy   oh thats right is that right he was a doctor still   and umhum yeah well you know he it was like a rear admiral whatever you know and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow Vulcans age a lot better   well yeah he didnt look too bad did he   huh no huhuh matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the uh Next Generation as he does in the latest Star Trek  imagine that   yes yeah thats amazing uh did they have some pretty good special effects   oh excellent excellent special effects but i think the script was you know just incredible compared to the last one   yeah Five was the script was bad bad bad  no i dont why   well you know why uh William Shatner wrote it   oh is that right   and even worse he directed it   uh       Leonard Leonard it its Nimoy he does a lot better   oh yeah he in fact uh he didnt direct this one he produced this one but he directed the one before uh i think Star Trek Four something like that   In Search of Spock or no Journey Home i think that   yeah umhum   are youre a real life Trekkie   well i think so   i really like them i i wouldnt go so far as being a Trekkie but   umhum   uhhuh   well ive gone to you know one for real live Trek Convention but   oh really   yeah i saw James Doohan you know the guy that plays uh Scotty   huh did you get to talk to him   no  not in a crowd like that huhuh it was like uh want an autograph wanna stand in line for about four hours   it was a pretty crowded place   it was crowded no yeah wow huh they have some good management principals in this New Generation   oh yeah yeah i its its kind of funny i uh was reading in uh a book uh trying to think i cant quite remember the name of the book but it was it was saying dont do Star Trek management style and they were referring to you know Captain Kirk every time he left the Enterprise everything went to hell   oh   and and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship   right and he kind of was a cowboy type too   umhum   he made all the decisions but uh Jean Luke does more of a a committee type of management     umhum yeah um its definitely a lot better  a lot more realistic really   what other movies have you seen   uh saw The Addams Family last week   oh how was that   it was pretty good uh there were a few things different than the old series but on the on the whole it was pretty similar and  a lot of fun   lots of little funny spots huh   oh yeah yeah   did they have Thing and   oh yes in fact Thing has a big much bigger role than he does in the series i mean you know there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day   really   and he runs around a lot   how did ive always wondered how he gets around   uh you know just finger hopping   but hes in a box right   no no no in fact its funny he never did does come in out of a box i dont think and hes just kind of walking around   didnt he used to   not really he was always in the box before   oh well thats yeah thats  okay yeah thats what i was thinking   yeah
