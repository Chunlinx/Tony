Accounting and Information ManagementDivisionApril EXECUTIVE GUIDECreating Value Through Worldclass Financial ManagementGAOAIMDPrefaceTo help promote effective implementation of federal financialmanagement reform we studied the financial management practicesand improvement efforts of nine leading public and private sectorfinance organizations to identify the success factors practicesand outcomes associated with worldclass financial management Thisexecutive guide is intended to assist federal agencies in achievingthe objectives of the Chief Financial Officers CFO Act of and subsequent related legislation by providing case studies of practices critical for establishing and maintaining sound financialoperationsThe reforms laid out by the CFO Act and subsequent relatedlegislation when effectively implemented will place the federalgovernment on par with private sector corporations and state andlocal governments that have already made the necessary investmentin financial management While many agencies have made greatstrides toward generating more accurate and reliable annualfinancial statements the process of preparing financial statementsand subjecting them to independent audit is only the first steptoward satisfying the requirements of the legislation To reap thefull benefits of financial reform federal finance organizationsmust go beyond the audit opinion toward establishing seamless systems and processes  routinelygenerating reliable cost and performance information and analysis undertaking other valueadded activities that support strategicdecisionmaking and mission performance and  building a financeteam that supports the agencys mission and goalsThis executive guide was prepared under the direction of Lisa GJacobson

OrganizationsBackgroundCreating a government that runs more efficiently and effectivelyhas been a public concern for decades In recent years howeverthe push towards creating a smaller more results orientedgovernment has intensified the urgency to find ways to do more withless To effectively evaluate and improve the value derived fromgovernment programs and spending the Congress and otherdecisionmakers must have accurate and reliable financialinformation on program cost and performance Further they must beable to rely on federal finance organizations to provide analysisand insight about the financial implications of program decisionsand the impact of those decisions on agency performance goals andobjectives Currently financial data are not always usefulrelevant timely and reliable enough to be used for federaldecisionmaking and many federal finance organizations are not yetwell equipped enough to routinely provide analysis or advicerelated to this informationIn the private sector the role of the finance organizationhistorically has centered on oversight and control focusing on itsfiduciary responsibilities and paying less attention to increasingthe effectiveness of operating divisions However over the pastdecade dramatic changes in the business environment have drivenfinance organizations to reevaluate this role Increasedcompetition resulting from an emerging global market has putpressure on finance organizations to find new ways to reduceadministrative costs add value and provide a competitiveadvantage At the same time advances in information technologyhave made it possible for the finance function to shift from apaperdriven labor intensive clerical role to a more consultativerole as advisor strategist analyst and business partnerAccording to a  study performed by a major public accountingfirm most CFOs in  were spending  to  percent of theirtime on fiduciary issues essentially external reporting Todaythe goal of many leading finance organizations is to spend about percent of their time on fiduciary issues and the remaining timeperforming strategic support activities such as cost analysis orbusiness performance analysis Also a  report by the Instituteof Management Accountants found that over the previous  to years management accountants were increasingly being asked tosupplement their traditional accounting role with more financialanalysis and management consultingDramatic changes also have occurred in federal financialmanagement in response to the most comprehensive management reformlegislation of the past  years The combination of reformsushered in by  the CFO Act of   the GovernmentManagement Reform Act GMRA of   the Federal FinancialManagement Improvement Act FFMIA of   the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act GPRA of  and  theClingerCohen Act of  will if successfully implemented providethe necessary foundation to run an effective resultsorientedgovernmentReinventing the CFO Moving from Financial Management toStrategic Management Coopers and Lybrand New York New YorkThe Practice Analysis of Management Accounting Institute ofManagement Accountants Montvale New Jersey The CFO Act and GMRA spelled out a long overdue and ambitiousagenda to help the government remedy its lack of useful relevanttimely and reliable financial information For the governmentsmajor departments and agencies this legislation  establishedchief financial officer positions required audited financial statements annually and  setexpectations for agencies to develop and deploy more modernfinancial management systems produce sound cost and operatingperformance information and design results oriented reports on thegovernments financial condition by integrating budget accountingand program information FFMIA built on the CFO Act and GMRA byrequiring financial statement auditors to report whether agenciesfinancial systems comply with federal financial management systemsrequirements federal accounting standards and the US GovernmentStandard General LedgerThe Government Performance and Results Act of commonly knowas GPRA or the Results Actwas enacted to hold federal agenciesaccountable for achieving program results It requires thatagencies  set multiyear strategic goals and corresponding annualgoals  measure performance toward the achievement of thosegoals and  report on their progress Effective implementationof the Results Act however hinges on agencies ability toroutinely produce meaningful budget accounting and programinformation needed to manage performance and measure results TheCFO Act and other related financial reform legislation ifsuccessfully implemented will provide the basis for producing thisinformationTo help insure that agencies effectively use informationtechnology to achieve program results the Congress passed theClingerCohen Act of  The ClingerCohen Act builds on the bestpractices of leading public and private sector organizations byrequiring agencies to better link their information technologyplanning and investment decisions to program missions and goalsThe ClingerCohen Act contains critical provisions requiring federalagencies to use investment and capital planning processes to managetheir information management technology portfolios Further itrequires that agencies modernize inefficient administrative andmissionrelated work processes before making significant technologyinvestments to support themImplemented together these measures provide a basis forimproving accountability over government operations and routinelyproducing sound cost and operating performance information therebymaking it possible to better assess and improve the governmentsfinancial condition and operating performanceLearning From Leading OrganizationsTo help promote effective implementation of federal financialmanagement reform we studied the financial management practicesand improvement efforts of nine leading private and public sectorfinance organizations to identify the success factors practicesand outcomes associated with worldclass financial management Thesix private sector and three state organizations we studied havebeen recognized by their peers and other independent researchersfor their outstanding financial management practices and successfulfinance reengineering efforts For more information on the criteriawe used to select these organizations see appendix I As federalagencies continue to improve their management and financialaccountability they will be able to draw upon the expertise andexperience of these private sector and state governmentorganizationsLeading Finance OrganizationsAt one time all of these organizations found themselves in anenvironment similar to the one confronting federal agenciestodayone in which they were called upon to improve financialmanagement while simultaneously reducing costs The key practicesdrawn from the organizations we examined can provide a usefulframework for federal agencies working to improve their financialmanagement This guide discusses the goals success factors andpractices associated with building a worldclass financeorganization Specifically we have identified  overall goalscommon to these leading organizations along with  practices thatwere critical to their ability to meet these goals In additionthis guide includes examples from our case study work that bestillustrate how each practice enabled the selected organization toachieve the desired outcomesWe preceded our case study work with an extensive review offinancial management literature guides and reports We alsoconsulted with leading public and private sector experts infinancial management Case study data were collected throughinterviews and analysis of documentation Further the case studyorganizations reviewed all case study information included in thisguide for accuracy and completeness Appendix I provides a moredetailed description of our research objectives scope andmethodologyCharacteristics of a Worldclass Finance OrganizationA worldclass finance organization can best be defined in termsof the business outcomes it producesoutcomes such as improvedbusiness analysis innovative solutions to business problemsreduced operating costs increased capability to perform adhocanalysis and improved overall business performance To build aworldclass finance organization and help achieve better businessoutcomes each of the organizations we examined set an agenda fortransforming the finance organization by defining a  sharedvision ie a mission a vision for the future core valuesgoals and strategies geared toward making the financeorganization a valuecreating customerfocused partner in businessresults Although the techniques used varied depending on theorganizations size and culture and some efforts were more maturethan others the goals practices and success factors outlined inthe following illustration were instrumental in the organizationachieving its visionGoals Practices and Strategies To ConsiderThis section summarizes the results of our research and casestudy work Specifically it contains the  overall goals and practices we identified as critical for building a worldclassfinance organization To facilitate the practical use of thisguide information is organized into four sectionseach summarizingone of the four goals as well as those practices that have enabledleading organizations to achieve these goals Further for each ofthe  practices we provided  a summary of key characteristics illustrative case study examples and  strategies forfederal agencies to consider when implementing the practiceMake Financial Management an Entitywide PriorityThe quality and image of federal financial management hassuffered from decades of neglect and an organizational culture thathas not fully recognized the value of good financial managementnoteven at its most basic levelas a means of ensuring accountabilityMaking financial management a priority throughout the federalgovernment involves changing the organizational culture of federalagencies Although the views about how an organization can changeits culture vary considerably the organizations we studiedidentified leadership as the most important factor in successfullymaking cultural changes Top management must be totally committedin both words and actions to changing the culture and thiscommitment must be sustained and demonstrated to staffThe leading organizations we studied made financial managementimprovement an entitywide priority by building a foundation ofcontrol and accountability that supports external reporting andperformance management providing clear strong executiveleadership and using training to change the organizational cultureand engage line managementPractice Build a Foundation of Control and Accountability That SupportsExternal Reporting and Performance ManagementKey characteristicsThe financial reporting and audit process is a basicmanagement and oversight toolAccountability is part of the organizational culture andgoes well beyond receiving an unqualified audit opinionInternal controls meet both external financial reportingand performance management control objectives without significantlyimpacting efficiencyA solid foundation of control and accountability requires asystem of checks and balances that provides reasonable assurancethat the entitys transactions are appropriately recorded andreported its assets protected its established policies followedand its resources used economically and efficiently for thepurposes intended The private sector and state organizations wevisited built and maintained this foundation largely through thediscipline of preparing routine periodic financial statements andannually subjecting them to an independent audit However seniorexecutives at leading organizations recognize that the financialinformation demanded by decisionmakers to measure and manageperformance requires greater precision and more timely access thanthat required to receive an unqualified opinion on the entitysfinancial statements To ensure that decisionmakers have usefulrelevant timely and reliable information leading financeorganizations establish accountability goals that extend wellbeyond receiving an unqualified audit opinion In addition theinternal controls at these organizations are designed toefficiently meet the control objectives necessary for performancemeasurement and management as well as external financialreportingSimilarly according to a  survey of federal CFOs federalfinance organizations continue to expand their focus from auditedfinancial statements to include performance measurement andstrategic planning For example the CFO Council and the Office ofManagement and Budget OMB are aggressively working on eightpriority initiatives outlined in the Federal FinancialManagement Status Report and FiveYear Plan Although one of theeight priorities focused on obtaining an unqualified opinion onagency financial statements the eight priorities taken as a wholeaim at improving the financial and performance information neededto make and implement effective policy management stewardshipand program decisionsCFO Survey Preparing for Tomorrows Way of Doing BusinessGrant Thornton LLP and the Association of Government AccountantsAlexandria Virginia March GAOAIMD  Executive Guide Creating Value ThroughWorldclass Financial ManagementGoals Practices and Strategies to Consider  Make FinancialManagement an Entitywide Priority  Practice Case StudiesAccountability goals and an effective control structure providethe basis for a more resultsoriented governmentCommonwealth of VirginiaTo build a foundation of control and accountability seniorgovernment leaders in the Commonwealth of Virginia had clear goalsand objectives that went beyond receiving an unqualified auditopinion With the passage of the Single Audit Act in  theCommonwealth of Virginia had to produce and have auditedComprehensive Annual Financial Reports CAFR for the first timeAlthough not required by the act the state Comptroller had eachstate agency also produce audited financial statements therebyensuring accountability at every level of government rather thansolely at those levels considered material to CAFR The goal was toensure that managers and lawmakers would have useful relevant andtimely information for assessing and managing programperformanceNow that Virginia routinely receives an unqualified opinion onits CAFR only those state agencies with a specific need egagencies operating trust enterprise and internal service fundsare required to produce auditable financial statements Theremaining agencies now are required to certify the accuracy offinancial information that feeds CAFR By subjecting all stateagencies to the rigorous discipline of preparing financial reportsand having them audited the Comptroller increased accountabilityfor data accuracy beyond that required to receive an unqualifiedaudit opinion State officials continue to raise the bar and seeknew ways to increase accountability and improve the statesperformance For example the Department of Planning and Budgetcurrently performs trend analysis and prepares fiscal impactstatements for the states legislature using useful relevant andtimely financial information from the states integrated budget andaccounting systems Also to ensure that performance data andlongrange plans drive budget decisions the state has set goalsincluding implementing an activitybased accounting and budgetingsystem for enhancing its performance budgeting processTexasSimilarly in Texas the performance management system is anintegral part of agency and statewide planning structuresevaluation and decisionmaking processes and accountabilitysystems Creating and maintaining a performance management systemrequired close consistent and coordinated attention above andbeyond that required for external financial reporting purposes InTexas the ability to produce fairly stated external financialreports was only the first step in building a more effectiveresultsoriented government An unqualified opinion on the statesCAFR provided assurance that financial information was accurateand reliable for evaluating its overall financial positionHowever an unqualified audit opinion by itself does not ensurethat the information needed to measure and manage performance isuseful relevant timely or reliable The internal controls thatwere considered adequate for external financial reporting were notalways sufficient for performance management For example internalcontrols over expenditure data met the control objectives foraggregating and reporting this information on the financialstatements however they did not meet the objectives forcalculating perunitcost efficiency measures required forperformance managementTherefore state agencies with the help of the State AuditorsOffice reevaluated and redesigned agency internal controls to meetboth external financial reporting and performance managementcontrol objectives Because the state routinely receives anunqualified opinion on its CAFR the State Auditors Office andagency internal auditors no longer spend the bulk of their time oncontrol issues related to external financial reporting Insteadtheir focus is on improving the reliability of performancemanagement informationStrategies to ConsiderTo build a foundation of control and accountability seniorexecutives couldLeverage audit resources and the financial statementaudit process to improve data reliability and increaseaccountabilityIncrease accountability by establishing goals for producing financial and performance reports for major programsandor business segments and  moving the organization towardmore frequent financial reporting eg quarterlymonthlyAs part of the agencys GPRA performance planningprocess  establish efficiency criteria that measure the costassociated with program outcomes and  develop an approach forassessing and improving agency internal controls overfinancerelated efficiency measuresUse accounting and operational performance data tosupport budget formulation and strategic planningPractice Provide Clear Strong Executive LeadershipKey characteristicsThe chief executive recognizes the important role thefinance organization can play in improving overall businessperformance and involves key businessline managers in financialmanagement improvement initiativesThe CFO is a member of the top managementteamTop executives sustained commitment to improvingfinancial management is reinforced through both their words andactionsA powerful visionary leader can change the direction cultureand perceptions of the finance organization The chief executiveofficers CEO of leading organizations understand the importantrole the CFO and the finance organization play in improving theentitys overall business performance Consequently the CFO is acentral figure on the top management team and heavily involved instrategic planning and decisionmaking In addition the seniorexecutives at these organizations demonstrated their sustainedcommitment to financerelated improvement initiatives by using keybusinessline managers to drive improvement efforts attending keymeetings ensuring that the necessary resources are made availableand creating a system of rewards and incentives to recognize thosewho support improvement initiatives In fact the committed supportof the CEO and line management are critical to the success offinancerelated improvement initiativesIn the same way federal financial management reform hasrecently gained momentum through the committed support of topfederal leaders For example the President has made financialmanagement improvement a top priority and established a goal toobtain an unqualified opinion on the governments financialstatements To achieve this goal he directed the head of eachagency without an unqualified audit opinion to submit to the OMB an initial plan for resolving financial reporting deficienciesand  quarterly progress reports for achieving the goal FurtherOMB is required to periodically report to the Vice President on theagency submissions and governmentwide progress In addition manyfederal CFOs have primary leadership responsibility forimplementing the Results Act at the department or agency level TheCFO Council has played a key leadership role in establishingfinancial and performance improvement goals and priorities forchanging the way federal agencies plan budget manage evaluateand account for federal programsTo ensure that federal financial management improvement effortssucceed and that the Presidents and the CFO Councils prioritiesare achieved the support and involvement of key nonfinancialexecutives and managers is critical This commitment starts withthe heads of agencies establishing priorities and settingexpectations and continues with the active involvement ofprogramline managers and executives in driving financialimprovement initiativesStrategies to ConsiderTo demonstrate and reinforce commitment to improving financialmanagement heads of agencies and senior executives couldForm an executive management team heads of componentorganizations and those reporting directly to the agency head toestablish a vision and fundamental goals and provide sponsorshipfor each major financial management improvement projectInvolve key program business

Legislation starting with the CFOAct of  has been directed at enhancing the financeorganizations responsibilities in supporting the management offederal activities Although acceptance by the program offices hassometimes been slow according to a recent survey of federal CFOsprogram directors are starting to look to the finance organizationfor help They attribute the change to a joint effort by programand finance offices to implement the Results Act and developstrategic plans In addition the CFO Councils numerous outreachefforts and GPRArelated education events have helped to win theacceptance of program managersThe key to successfully managing change and changingorganizational culture is gaining the support of line managementTo change the organizational culture and enlist the support of linemanagers many organizations utilize training programs Some aregeneric in nature and are intended to help people anticipate andcope with change and ensure that every person in the organizationunderstands the need for change Others are specifically gearedtowards providing line managers with a greater appreciation of thefinancial implications of their business decisions Through theseinteractions financial managers gain a better understanding ofbusiness problems and nonfinancial managers gain an appreciation ofthe value of financial information This not only produces bettermanagers it also helps break down functional barriers that canaffect productivity and impede improvement effortsIn addition these organizations provide tools to facilitate andaccelerate the pace of the change initiative According to oneexecutive we met with change initiatives that are implementedslowly generally fail because staff have too much time tocontemplate the potential negative effects that change might bringand rally opposition that ultimately undermines the effortCFO Survey Preparing for Tomorrows Way of Doing BusinessGrant Thornton LLP and the Association of Government

of the most successful programs is the ChangeAcceleration Process CAP workshop During the CAP workshop GEmanagers and professional staff are given tools and taughtstrategies for removing cultural barriers to change GEs financeorganization has used these tools and strategies to facilitateimprovement initiatives ranging from organizational restructuringto changing the role of the internal audit functionTo be successful the project teams spearheading theseinitiatives had to achieve each of the following objectives lead change  create a shared needshape a vision  mobilize commitmentmake change last  monitor progress andchange systems and structures To ensure that eachobjective would be accomplished the team used a survey to profilethe change process and measures its progress Staff and managerswere surveyed periodically and asked to score each of the fivedimensions from  percent to  percent based on how well theythink each is being accomplished For change to be successful mostdimensions must be rated highThe profile directed the teams efforts so that they coulddevelop a strategy to address the areas that needed the mostattention For example mobilizing commitment especially fromthose outside the finance organization was often one of the moredifficult objectives to accomplish However the team used amethod learned in the CAP workshop for analyzing and increasingstakeholder commitment levels First the team listed the names ofthose individuals whose support was critical for the success of theproject Then they assessed each stakeholders level of commitmentbased on their perceived level of agreementto what degree does theindividual agree that change is needed If the team perceived aperson did not agree it developed an individual plan to get thispersons support Plans were developed by addressing questions suchas Why are they resisting this change Do they have a vestedinterest in the status quo What new opportunities will they havewhen the change is implemented and Who influences this person andwhat is their level of acceptanceStrategies to ConsiderTo engage line management and create a culture that values goodfinancial management heads

of the finance organizationhistorically has centered on oversight and control focusing on itsfiduciary responsibilities and external financial reportingrequirements However over the past decade dramatic changes in thebusiness environment have forced finance organizations toreevaluate this role The pressure to reduce administrative costsresulting from competition in an emerging global market drove manyfinance organizations to find more efficient ways to deliver theirservices Nonetheless becoming more efficient is not enough toremain competitive Today leading finance organizations arefocusing more on internal customer requirements by providingproducts and services that directly support strategicdecisionmaking and ultimately improve overall businessperformanceSimilarly competition has changed the environment in whichfederal agencies operate Shrinking budgets have increasedcompetition for scarce resources requiring managers to make toughresource allocation decisions that may affect program deliveryWithout the support of federal finance organizations programmanagers may not be able to determine or defend the cost associatedwith or benefits derived from government activities We found theleading finance organizations we visited had redefined the role offinance to better support mission objectives by assessing thefinance organizations current role in meeting mission objectivesmaximizing the efficiency of daytoday accounting activities andorganizing finance to add valuePractice Assess the Finance Organizations Current Role in MeetingMission ObjectivesKey characteristicsThe percentage of resources spent on strategic supportactivities is used as an indicator of how well finance issupporting mission objectivesBenchmarking and customer feedback is used to identifyperformance gaps and best practicesMany leading finance organizations assess their current role insupporting mission objectives by comparing the percentage of stafftime spent on strategic support activities such as businessperformance analysis or cost analysis with the percentage ofresources spent on transaction processing and other routineaccounting activities According to a  Financial ExecutivesResearch Foundation report transaction processing and otherroutine accounting activities such as accounts payable payrolland external reporting consume about  percent of costs withinfinance Other studies indicate that these activities consume asmuch as  percent of finances resources While transactionprocessing will always exist it does not have to drain the financeorganizations resources Therefore many leading financeorganizations have calculated and compared these percentages as ageneral indication of how well they supported the organizationsbusiness objectives A goal for many leading organizations is toreduce the time spent on transaction processing activities to percentTo further assess the efficiency and effectiveness of specificproducts and services many of the leading finance organizations westudied relied on benchmarking and customer feedback For examplecomparisons against worldclass benchmarks such as closing thebooks in less than  days or processing payroll at  pertransaction were used to identify activities or processes in needof improvement See appendix III Worldclass Performance MetricsIn addition these organizations used feedback from their internalcustomers to gather specific information related to quality andcustomer expectations For example HewlettPackards financeorganization conducted a detailed survey of about  internalcustomers worldwide in which customers were asked to rank certaincomponents or services as either high or low in terms of bothimportance and satisfaction The survey results were then used

control and compliance to one that isintegral to making strategic business decisions About  years agounder the leadership of Pfizers CEO and CFO Pfizers corporatefinance organization embarked on a reengineering initiative totransform its charter processes products and services The CEOand CFOs vision was to make Pfizer  the preeminent corporatefinance organization in the industry At the heart of this visionwas the concept that the finance organization should activelysupport the strategic imperatives of Pfizer IncUnlike many finance organizations going through this type oftransformation Pfizers change effort was not in reaction to acrisis In fact given the companys long history of profitablegrowth there seemed to be little reason to change Pfizers CFOon the other hand saw an opportunity to do things more effectivelyand efficiently and thereby redeploy resources from transactionalactivities eg closing the books preparing tax returns payinginvoices to value added activities eg operations treasury andtax planning The finance organization for example was producingtoo much data and not enough information To build a case forchange Pfizers CFO initiated a benchmarking survey to determineexactly how his organization stacked up against the other leadingfinance organizations The results dramatized the magnitude of theopportunityFor example Pfizer took  days to close its books versus the to  day worldclass standard Further it cost Pfizer twice as muchas the benchmark average to pay an invoice This sobering newsserved a vital purposeit created a sense of urgency surrounding theneed to change and helped the CFO rally the organizational supportneeded to institute a comprehensive reengineering initiativeTo facilitate change within the finance organization severalcrossfunctional process improvement teams were established Throughcomprehensive revisions to its charter processes organization andsystems Pfizer has reduced the cost associated with transactionprocessing activities by up to  percent in certain functions andshifted its focus to activities that directly support Pfizersbusiness objectivesThe shift in focus and resources has allowed

outsourcing routine accountingactivities are consideredAs part of an overall strategy to reduce the cost of finance andbetter support business objectives many leading organizations havereduced the number of staff required to perform routine transactionprocessing activities by eliminating or streamlining inefficientprocesses andor consolidating these activities at shared servicescenters Similarly some federal agencies are aggressivelyexpanding their use of Electronic Funds Transfer to includecontract payments and travel payments as a means of increasing theefficiency of their routine accounting activitiesEach of the six private sector finance organizations we visitedconsolidated standardized and reengineered routine processessuch as accounts payable fixed asset accounting and payroll atshared service centers The primary objective for moving to sharedservices is to reduce operating costs However other benefitsincluded better control and standardization of processes morecosteffective technology deployment and an enhanced position forcontinual improvement and customer serviceAlthough their approach varied depending on the size cultureand industry leading organizations have realized the benefits ofshared services by completing each of the following stages Thefirst stage is consolidation and includes changing theorganizational structure and gaining control over processes Thesecond stage is standardization and entails changing processesadopting a common technology platform and continuous improvementThe final stage is reengineering and involves changing workflow andleveraging technology through the use of electronic commerce datawarehousing and document imagingSimilar to the findings in our previous report on outsourcingthe finance function we found that although outsourcing isconsidered an option for reducing costs and improving efficiencynone of the leading organizations we visited were currentlyoutsourcing any significant aspect of their finance organizationsThe primary reason for not outsourcing is due to the limitedcapacity of outsourcing vendors to perform larger more complexfinance and accounting operations However these organizationsindicated that they are continually evaluating opportunities toreduce costs and improve quality therefore as the outsourcingmarket evolves and the capacity and quality of outsourcing

business objectives The organizational structure and human capital strategiessupport strategic business unit needs as well as traditionalcontrollership and transaction processing needsAccording to a recent survey of federal CFOs the federalfinance organization of the future will have fewer people with agreater percentage of analysts than clerks Currently howevermost functions within finance organizations are focused primarilyon  establishing and administering policy tracking monitoring and reconciling account balances or ensuring compliance with laws and regulations While theyrecognize the need for change according to the CFOs surveyed manyquestions remain unanswered regarding how best to scope defineand organize finance office responsibilitiesWhen it comes to organizational design we found that leadingfinance organizations often had the same or similar core functionsie budgeting treasury management general accountingpayroll However the way these functions were organized varieddepending on individual entity needs In practice  of this guidewe discussed how leading organizations reduced the number ofresources required to perform financial management activities by consolidating activities at a shared service center and eliminating or streamlining duplicative or inefficient processesTheir goal was not only to reduce the cost of finance but also toorganize finance to add value by reallocating finance resources tomore productive strategic support activitiesTo accomplish this leading finance organizations have realignedtheir mission and organizational structure to better support theentitys business objectives Specifically many leadingorganizations have  organized around core business processes tosimplify work and flatten hierarchies consolidated certain transaction processing activities togain economies of scale and  moved functions such as costaccounting and financial analysis to the business units to supportbusiness units strategic planning

provide adequate timely cost or performance informationneeded to manage cost measure performance make program fundingdecisions and analyze outsourcing or privatization optionsSimilarly many private sector and state organizations havestruggled to overcome some of the same management informationissues that now face federal agenciesOver the past decade global competition and advances ininformation technology have changed information requirements andusers expectations regarding the availability and usefulness offinancial information Financial information that in the past wasconsidered adequate for decisionmaking is now consideredoveraggregated and too late to be useful The leading financeorganizations we visited enhanced their capabilities for providingmeaningful information to decisionmakers by developing managementinformation systems that support the partnership between financeand operations reengineering processes in conjunction withimplementing new technology and translating financial data intomeaningful informationPractice Develop Systems That Support the Partnership Between Financeand OperationsKey characteristicsThe general ledger system is integrated into businessprocesses and is adequate for financial reporting andcontrolAutomated systems are designed and deployed that accurately measure the costs of activities processes productsand services and  provide line managers with timely accuratefinancial and nonfinancial information on the quality andefficiency of business processes and performanceAn enterprisewide system integrates operating financialand management information and allows decisionmakers to accessrelevant information easily and perform adhoc dataanalysisAs federal agencies develop plans for acquiring and installingfinancial systems the ClingerCohen Act of  and relatedexecutive branch guidance will provide a framework for designingand deploying information technology The ClingerCohen Act requiresagencies to better link their information technology planning andinvestment decisions to program missions and goals If implementedeffectively this legislation will provide a foundation that willhelp federal agencies improve the interoperability of financialoperating and management systemsThe leading finance organizations we visited have long hadgeneral ledger systems capable of generating auditable financialstatements efficiently and routinely thereby providing informationon stewardship and accountability at a high level Further theyhistorically have had adequate systems for measuring and managingcost and performance However over the last decade new technologyhas made it possible for these organizations to integrate thesesystems and provide more relevant accessible information thatmeets the changing needs of decisionmakers Many leadingorganizations have already implemented or are in the process ofimplementing an enterprisewide system to integrate financial andoperating data to support both management decisionmaking andexternal reporting requirements Some abandoned their legacysystems all together and turned to stateoftheart integratedarchitectures while others used wellfunctioning legacy systems andtied them together with a data warehouse Regardless of theapproach these systems provided financial analysts accountantsand business unit managers access to the same cost performanceand profitability informationSimilarly the CFO Council JFMIP OMB Treasury and individualagencies are working to improve the integration of budgetaccounting and program information and systems To support thisprocess a Program Management Office was recently established todevelop financial systems requirements address system integrationissues and generally facilitate the system selection andprocurement process This and other measures are important toensure that federal systems provide meaningful information formanaging and measuring cost and performance as well as preparingexternal financial reportsStrategies to ConsiderTo develop systems that support the partnership between financeand operations senior executives couldAcquire and install a general ledger system adequate forexternal financial reporting purposesDevelop managerially relevant cost information systemsand strategic performance management systems that access data fromfinancial transaction

Ledgerbyestablishing the goal of using a single general ledgerchart of accounts the US Government Standard General Ledgeranddeveloping an interim approach to convert general ledgeraccounts not consistent with the US Government Standard GeneralLedger This approach should use automated crosswalks performed bythose business segments responsible for the dataPractice Reengineer Processes in Conjunction With Implementing NewTechnologyKey characteristicsCommercial offtheshelf software packages implemented withlimited modificationProcesses and controls adapted to fit commercialofftheshelf softwareProcesses are reengineered across functionallinesAt many of the leading finance organizations we visited thevast majority of financial applications were commercial offtheshelfCOTS packages that were implemented with limited modification tothe basic application package itself The advantages of using COTSsoftware include  COTS software is less costly than developinginhouse applications  software upgrades are affordable and areregularly available and  COTS software is designed to includebest practicesThe key to successfully implementing COTS systems and bestpractice processes according to leading finance organizations isreengineering business processes to fit the new softwareapplications In fact productivity gains typically result frommore efficient processes not from simply automating old onesEffectively reengineering business processes however requiresmoving from a functionalbased organization to a processbasedorganization For example the procurement process in aprocessbased federal organization would start when a solicitationis issued continue through contract award and signature as wellas the issuance of purchasework orders and receipt of goods andend when the vendor properly received payment The businessprocesses would be designed to maximize the efficiency and accuracyof the entire processThe ClingerCohen Act contains provisions requiring federalagencies to modernize inefficient administrative and missionrelatedwork processes before making significant technology investments tosupport them As a result federal agencies are beginning toconsider the merits of information technology approaches thatinvolve reengineering business processes in conjunction withimplementing COTS software without significant modificationAccording to a report by the Financial Systems Committee of the CFOCouncil most agencies favor an approach that uses COTS softwarefor core financial systems and other financial managementapplications However agency efforts to use COTS products havebeen hampered by the governments failure to communicaterequirements and functionality effectively to the vendors and aproclivity on the part of agencies to modify software to meetexisting business processes and to replicate previous systemfunctionality To encourage the use of COTS OMB and JFMIP areworking to improve  the testing and certification of COTSsystems  existing procurement schedules and  processes toobtain COTS systemsCase StudyReengineering core business processes across functional lines isthe key to successful COTS implementationWhen implementing its new financial management system ratherthan fitting new technology to outofdate processes Owens Corningredesigned its business processes to fit the new technology Theobjective was to improve customer service and at the same timecut logistical costs related to various business processes Toachieve these objectives Owens Corning formed crossfunctionalprocess improvement teams for each major business process toimprove or replace longstanding and often ineffective businessprocessesDuring this effort the improvement teams used many commonreengineering tools such as process mapping and process modelingHowever successfully reengineering its business processes had moreto do with the parameters Owens Corning placed on its processimprovement teams For example the teams were given compressedschedules for completing  as is modeling to prevent overanalysisand to force decisions Documenting current processes should beaccomplished in a matter of a week or two The bulk of time shouldbe spent on defining user requirements and designing new processesAnother important aspect of Owens Corning process improvementeffort was its use of a process reengineering management councilThe council was made up of key process and business unit executivesthat acted as arbitrators when conflicts developedBy reengineering business processes in conjunction withimplementing new technology Owens Corning increased its ability tomeet customer needs In the past for example many of thecompanys computers were not linked making it impossible for salespeople to check on the availability of products or address problemson a customer invoice Now all activities that occur from the timea customer places an order to the time Owens Corning receivespayment are part of the Customer Fulfillment Process In additionnew technology has integrated functions related to the CustomerFulfillment Process such as sales ordering production shippingbilling and accounts receivable providing users with greateraccess to data As a result Owens Cornings salesforce not onlyhas access to uptodate information but more efficient processesallow sales staff to respond immediately to customer inquiriesinstead of handing the problem off to another departmentOther outcomes related to process improvement included reducing the time it takes to close the books from  days to dayswith a target of  day  reducing the chart of accounts from to  and  standardizing reporting which allowscomparisons to be made between operating divisionsStrategies to ConsiderTo reengineer processes that support new technology seniorexecutives couldForm crossfunctional teams to  examine existing corebusiness processes and  define user requirementsCompare COTS products against the agencys requirementsand identify the COTS packages that most closely match the agencysneedsReevaluate user requirements not supported by COTSsoftware and determine before customizing software whether eachrequirement is still valid or whether alternatives exist that maybe more costeffectiveWhere software modifications are required implement aneffective configuration management system that includes  clearlydefining and assessing the effects of modifications on futureproduct upgrades before the modification is approved  clearlydocumenting software products that are placed under configurationmanagement and  maintaining the integrity and traceability ofthe configuration throughout the system life cycleImplement a quality assurance process that ensures thatproject activities and software products adhere to managementsestablished plans standards and procedures This includesensuring that the configuration management process is effectivelyimplemented and that product changes are clearly documented andtested before being placed into productionImplement an effective risk management strategy to ensurethat project risks such as customization and vendors ability todeliver a given system are adequately identified and effectivemitigation strategies are implementedKey characteristicsTranslate Financial Data  Reports are designed around keydrivers into Meaningful Information such as markets products andcustomers Relevant financial information is presented in anunderstandable simple format with suitable amounts of detail andexplanationWhile new technology has made financial data more availablewithout the ability to translate that data into relevantunderstandable information decisionmakers are left powerlessTraditionally finance organizations have used voluminous paperreports based primarily on the prior months activity tocommunicate financial information Further management reports wereoften designed around current organizational structuresConsequently as organizational structures changed over time manymanagement reports became irrelevantToday leading finance organizations have eliminated reducedandor redesigned much of their old management reporting formats tobetter meet the needs of the user These organizations havedesigned new reporting formats around key business drivers ratherthan organizational structures to provide executives and managerswith relevant forwardlooking information on business unitperformance During this process one company we visited actuallystopped distributing selected management reports to determinewhether anyone would miss them They used the subsequent lack ofreaction as an indicator that the information in the report was nolonger relevantFurther standardized reports are designed to presentinformation that is analyzed to bring out pertinent and fundamentalpoints with suitable amounts of detail and explanation Forexample Owens Cornings executives and managers access astandardized monthly financial report via the companys internalarea network The reports executive summary is  pages long andcontains executivelevel reporting forecasting and budgetinginformation However multiple levels of detail are available anddecisionmakers can drill down to the desired level of detailSimilarly efforts are currently underway across government todevelop a meaningful userfriendly accountability report onindividual departments and agencies These reports consolidate andintegrate audited financial statements and reporting under theResults Act and other related laws to  show the degree to whichan agency met its goals and at what cost and  aid the reader indetermining whether the agency was well runStrategies to ConsiderTo improve management reporting of financial information seniorfinance executives as part of the top management team couldMeet with

right mix of skills and competencies starts by defining a setof skills and competencies that will enable the finance team tomeet the current and future technical management and leadershipneeds of the business The resulting competency profile is used toassess gaps in individual or group competency levels and develophuman capital strategies to address current or expected futuredeficiencies In this practice we discuss the training careerdevelopment and successionplanning strategies leading financeorganizations use to develop a team with the right mix of skillsand competenciesThe training and career development programs of the leadingfinance organizations we visited provided intensive to year entrylevel programs as well as midcareer and executivelevel programsthat used both classroom instruction and rotational assignments todevelop technical management and leadership skills andcompetencies The programs course work focuses initially on thetools and techniques of advanced accounting and finance as well asgeneral business skills Then the focus shifts to the strategicapplication of these tools within businessspecific environmentsHowever the key to implementing a successful career developmentprogram is to complement course work with reallife businessexperience through the use of planned rotational assignments Theleading finance organizations we visited provided opportunities forstaff to rotate through various positions throughout the financeorganization as well as the operating divisions Such opportunitiesare critical not only in developing employees that understand thewhole business and in turn provide greater value to theircustomers in the operating divisions but also as a way of ensuringthat an adequate supply of wellprepared financial professionals isavailable to fill key positionsSimilarly federal finance organizations are recognizing theneed to provide a broad range of experience to its financialprofessionals For example as a way to develop a cadre ofexperienced and diverse leaders the CFO Council Fellows Programwas initiated in April of  with the selection of nine fellowsto serve year appointments at host organizationsStrategies to

career path opportunities are offeredand staff development programs are used as a means of exposingstaff to different career opportunitiesCompetitive compensation and benefits packages areavailableAs discussed in practice  sound training and careerdevelopment strategies are needed for the finance organization tomeet the current and future human capital needs of the businessEqually important however are recruitment retention and rewardstrategies that enable the finance organization to attract andretain talented financial professionals at all levels Althoughtheir styles and strategies varied the leading organizations wevisited agreed that several key factors were important inattracting and retaining talentFirst recruiting a talented workforce requires the commitmentof top leadership The CFOs at these organizations are oftenheavily involved talent assessment and senior executive leaders areactively involved in oncampus recruiting This sends a powerfulmessage to potential new recruits that the position is importantenough to the organization that it warrants senior executiveattentionSecond attracting and ultimately keeping a highly qualified andmotivated workforce involves providing meaningful careeropportunities such as the opportunity to participate in exciting groundbreaking projects  build aportfolio of new skills and  choose a variety of career pathsThese organizations often used their staff development programs toprovide these opportunities For example as discussed in practice career development programs often include rotationalassignments and not only provide excellent growth opportunities butalso expose staff to a variety of career path opportunitiesThird compensation is a key factor in any career decisionWhile according to employee compensation surveys compensation isfairly comparable between the private and public sectors for entrylevel and middle management positions executive compensation inthe private sector far exceeds that of federal executives therebylimiting federal agencies ability to attract and retain federalexecutives See appendix IV for compensation survey resultsHowever other factors such as the desire to effect change and makea difference may attract senior executives to public service Inaddition opportunities may exist that will enhance agenciesability to attract and retain talent at all levels For examplethe revolutionary changes that are taking place as a result of theCFO and Results Acts provide an ideal occasion to revamp theopportunities available to federal financial professionals and tomarket the possibilities offered by a career in federal financialmanagementStrategies to ConsiderTo build an organization that attracts and retains talent theCFO and senior executives couldActively work with colleges and universities to market the opportunities available for financial professionals and include a federal accounting and financial managementcurriculum that will not only prepare students for careers infederal accounting but will also help promote federal careerpossibilitiesContinue to work with the Office of Personnel Managementto provide more flexible career paths that
