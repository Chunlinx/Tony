              hello   hello my name is uh Donna Donahue and im calling from Plano Texas   yes how you doing did you uh press one   hi yes i did   oh guess we ought to get started im Phil   okay um lets see um i enjoy watching the Today Show early in the morning with my first cup of coffee because everyone is still sleeping i have three children  and i enjoy watching the news because i probably dont have as much time as id like to read sit and read the paper  um         what about yourself   i like uh i would like probably like i think i like the Today Show on the rare occasions i get to watch it i uh   uhhuh   uh first one comes to mind uh without a lot of thought is uh Thirty Something which course is not on the air any more unfortunately  it was one of my favorite shows   um right i yeah i enjoyed that too i guess too also that was a nice one because it was  at a time when the kids are already in bed  um i     uh yeah and i was gonna say uh Ill Fly Away which uh i think it was supposed to uh catch some of the same viewers as uh   uh i havent had a chance to   weve been trying to watch that its uh not quite as good i guess you got to get into it   uhhuh is it isnt it it set in a different era is it um was was it the fifties in the fifties or in in the sixties   yeah its uh its about uh the civil rights struggle in the fifties   okay i didnt ive ive seen the commercials for it but its not uh seem to be on at a good time for me  i try to stay away from horror movies i just dislike them totally   totally agree   yeah i i dont um  uh one   well i say violence and horror i just kind of lump them together   yeah yeah thats thats thats right and um with young kids in the house we just really try to screen a lot of the things that they they watch um we watch a lot of Sesame Street  and a lot of PBS and the uh Discover channel or Lifetime   yeah oh yeah thats fantastic isnt it that Discovery Channel its   yes it is it is it is wonderful and especially my  eleven year old is just fascinated by some of the the things they have on there um what else i my husband enjoys watching a lot of sports which i really um dont particularly enjoy but  theyre theyre on you know i tolerate it     well i uh i like watching the Oilers and the uh   uhhuh   thats about it i guess ill watch thats about the only sports i really like to get into on TV   okay and um what else is theres a lot of things that i just cant believe is even on TV you watch it for two minutes and think this is so ridiculously stupid   yeah well one of the good things is having cable they uh they uh now uh you know the choices are so so  good and so uh variety variety there that you can really   you you can change it  you know what is a good station too we uh subscribe to the Disney Channel   oh yeah i think if my kids were small small again wed probably would too but uh   yeah its its a really nice and it they have um you know movies that sometimes well sit and enjoy and its its really a very nice uh that was we dropped um       HBO because there was just never anything appropriate on for the kids and now with renting videos so readily i mean you can just rent it if you really want to see it that badly   umhum yeah   but   uh its kind of a toss up there whether the inconvenience of renting the video versus uh  there never seemed to be anything good on when we wanna watch it you know   thats right and then and then they repeat everything so often too and or if its on at ten at night well i im asleep by ten at night i dont think i could stay up that late any more  um not to start a movie anyway     yeah yeah well thats true and uh then course they have the PayPerView but our our channel uh system here in Houston is uh is not noted for being the greatest you know i think we kind of got the short end of the stick when uh   uhhuh   programming came around so   i see i see   they charge a lot thats four dollars and a half or something like that per per view it seems a little high   yeah it that does that does seem high but um what other theres a i guess one or two sitcoms and the kids of course like to watch that new dinosaur show thats uh  which is pretty silly but but they   oh yeah we used to watch uh when my kids would watch when the teenage kids would watch that uh Bart Simpson that was pretty good   yeah yeah once in a while Bryan watch that but that is more for an older kid than than the younger ones   yeah they were teenagers huh   you know so that that seems okay for them   i i like Roseanne thats uh  Coach   i do too i had to try to tell my kids that you know we dont really talk to each other like that i hope we dont anyway to make sure they dont think well gee mom     yeah   look what their kid just said said well but um       and and the kids like to watch that Doogie Howsner but that even that sometimes i have to shut it off and say and say its an adult theme we dont need to watch that tonight well well get out the Clue game or     yeah huhuh   or ill suffer Parcheesi or something with them   at least youre exercising a little control
