                                 DAmatoing DAmato            NEW ROCHELLE NY OCTDepending on which highminded pundit you listen to you know that theSenate race between incumbent Republican Al DAmato and Rep Chuck Schumer iseither  the dirtiest or  the ugliest campaign in New Yorks history Itis a campaign after all in which the challengers slogan is Too many liesfor too long where each candidate blithely runs ads accusing his opponent ofcoddling child pornographers and where virtually the only intelligiblesentences of the socalled debates were Stop being rude and Let me finishRightthinking New Yorkers and there are far too many of them agree ThisSenate race is a perversion of democracy            Thegoogoos have it wrong This race has done exactly what a campaign shouldexpose the candidates in all their nakedness Newspapers and commentatorssolemnly observe that this riot of negative ads and namecalling has cost million roughly  million from DAmato and the Republican Party the balancefrom Schumer and the Democrats Thats about  for every New Yorker A fewweeks ago                   Slate               s Steven E Landsburg wrote a column arguing thatevery American has got  cents worth of entertainment from the  million KenStarr investigation Well if there are any New Yorkers who havent got worth of diversion out of the SchumerDAmato race I havent met them            Schumer is stumping today with Hillary Clinton This isfitting because Schumer would like everyone to believe that Clintonism is thecore of his campaign The Brooklyn representative has spent the last few yearsdoing what Bill Clinton did before his presidential run shaking off a mostlyliberal record and repositioning himself as a moderate who understands suburbanvoters Schumer abandoned his opposition to the death penalty voted for theDefense of Marriage Act and signed on to every crime bill he could find Atall his campaign appearances Schumer emphasizes that I am a toughoncrimemoderate Like Clinton he is counting on liberals to vote for him becausethey have nowhere else to go            Schumer resembles Clinton inanother way He takes credit for everything Schumer I learned from his pastfew days of campaign appearances is responsible for the national drop incrime the protection of Social Security and Medicare and the budget dealThank you congressman His New York Democratic colleagues have coined thephrase to Schume It means to take credit for something that others havedone            But ifSchumer is a Clinton on paper he certainly isnt in the flesh Todaysappearance with the first lady at a New Rochelle senior center makes thisglaringly obvious When Bill and Hillary Clinton appear together heradiates the warmth When Schumer and Hillary appear together shedoes            Hillary is chatty and informal Schumer has allthe charm of a lawnmower To a crowd of genial upbeat seniors Schumer servesvicious attacks on DAmato He fires off some good lines DAmato votes like asenator from Mississippi not a senator from New York and When the choicewas between Newt Gingrich and seniors Al DAmato chose Newt Gingrich But thevitriol doesnt fit the mood When hes not flamethrowing he lectures Heresponds to one question from an yearold with an endless learned andcringingly dull discourse on health care financing Schumer is no fun Hes agrind If he were a salesman youd buy the car just to get him to leave youalone Even his loyalists dont seem to like him much The halfdozen elderlywomen I spoke to after the event all said the same thing Of course they wouldvote for Schumerbut mostly because they hate DAmato            Briefinterruption for speculation about Hillarys peculiar behavior She clearlyloathes DAmato and she makes a point of never referring to him byname She calls him only Chuck Schumers opponent Heres the peculiarityShe also never refers to Bill Clinton by name She calls him myhusband or the president never Bill Does this have psychologicalsignificance Is she so angry that she wont say his name            The lesson of the Schumer campaign is not that you need tobe Clinton to beat DAmato given that the overbearing Schumer will never beClinton The lesson of the Schumer campaign is that you need to be DAmato tobeat DAmato Clintonism is relentlessness plus charm DAmatoism which is nowSchumerism is just relentlessness and to hell with the charm            Mymotherinlaw who lives in Schumers congressional district and always votesfor him says shes thinking of supporting DAmato this year Hes a sleazeBut hes good for the Jews Substitute gays or Irish or farmers orcancer victims or bankers for Jews and you begin to see Schumersstruggle Sen Pothole is the master of the ethnic pork barrel He shows up atJewish gatherings wearing a yarmulke with Alfonse stitched on it He relieson We owe him to override voters distaste for his viciousness and basicamorality and for  years it has            Schumer doesnt yet have the pull to imitateDAmatos porkbarreling though he would if he couldSchumer for examplehappily obeys Wall Streets bidding on the House Banking Committee in order toraise campaign funds So Schumer has done the next best thing which is tosteal DAmatos campaign style            InSchumer DAmato finally faces an opponent whos as hardheaded shameless andeffective as he is Usually DAmato dictates a campaign and his opponentdesperately plays defense Schumer has turned the tables on DAmato The firstday after the Democratic primary Schumer unleashed Too many lies for toolong ads More recently DAmato stupidly but innocently I think calledSchumer a putzhead then denied having said it Putz is a Yiddish insultthat literally means penis but in common usage means fool Schumer hasmanaged to gin this into an ongoing controversy about DAmatos trustworthinessand to score major points with Jewish voters Since last weeks murder of a NewYork abortion doctor Schumers people have subtly tried to connect theantiabortion DAmato with the extremist righttolifers            And every time DAmato has attacked Schumer has fired itback in his face DAmato tried to exploit the ill feelings between New YorkCity and upstate He ran an ad upstate depicting Schumer as a New YorkCity shark swimming up the Hudson Schumer immediately countered by running theDAmato commercial in New York City labeling it the ad Al DAmato doesntwant you to see DAmatos latest strategyto tar Schumer as a lazyparttime congressman who skips votesseems to be backfiring as wellNewspaper after newspaper has berated DAmato for this patently dishoneststrategy noting that Schumer is probably the hardestworking member ofCongress            Schumerlike DAmato is aggressive opportunistic and unpleasant in more ways that Icare to discover But there is a fundamental difference between themDAmato is the minence grise or perhaps the minence noire  ofthe corrupt Nassau County Republican machine He believes that politics isabout bending the rules for cronies and campaign contributors and he has beenimplicated in more gross behavior than almost any politician around Schumer isclean He doesnt cheat He may have moderated his views to win but he ismostly principled and mostly honest            Even so outDAmatoing DAmato on the campaigntrail may not be enough Some signs are promising for Schumer A week out thepolls are dead even and actually seem to be trending slightly in Schumersfavor DAmato has been distracted by Putzgate and Schumer is getting sweet PRoff Hillarys visit and the presidents planned campaign appearance Friday            But its hard to imaginethat DAmato will lose He has saved his war chest He and the GOP will spend million on an ad blitz during the five days leading up to the electionSchumer has saved only a small fraction of that You can be sure that theDAmato ads will be cheap and distorted but that at least something from themwill stick to Schumer            Everyarticle about Schumer notes that he has never lost an election But neither hasDAmato                           RecentCampaign  Dispatches                        The GamblingGamble South Carolinas
