                what type of news media do you prefer for keeping up with current events   okay normally i watch uh TV   okay   uh usually twice a day   the news shows themselves or uh like network news or national or uh   oh basically network news   okay how about shows like uh Sixty Minutes or or Twenty Twenty   was it once in a while depending what i thinks going to come on when they put on the previews   yeah i kind of watch for uh what what theyre going to cover on Sixty Minutes if its not if it doesnt look interesting uh pass on that   yeah thats about what i do but uh usually i hit the headlines when i walk by book stores or anything else on papers but i normally dont buy newspapers   yeah ill only get the newspaper a couple of days a week but uh i get a lot of calls from uh the Morning News and the Times Herald where they want to sell me the paper at a special rate  but uh no ill only read it on on Fridays and Sundays typically   Fridays and Sundays why Friday   Friday because they have a house and garden section in the paper   oh okay Sundays usually my big one   yeah i get the Sunday paper because of the TV schedule       but ill flip through and see what read the headlines see whats new   yeah i enjoy just point blank reading basically the headlines and i go especially if ive seen something one way or the other and i hit the TV to find out actually whats going on around here   yeah i i dont listen to the radio for news thats strictly for entertainment while im driving to and from work   oh its same way here   and for waking up in the morning have to set the alarm whatever news they cover they usually read out of the newspaper that day   what about when um Desert Storm was on   oh i thought CNN was great       but uh i was glued to the TV all during that time watching CNN but after after it was over i havent even tuned in to CNN since   yeah well see i had the radio going on that almost all the time especially between jobs on that and thats when i hit the radio but   uhhuh   when they stopped i stopped   yeah there has to be absolutely nothing else on TV before i turn on CNN usually   but uh now i like see i usually i hit the six oclock and usually the ten but uh sometimes i have to search on ten because they get boring they pick up the same thing on six so i usually have to search to see if anything is come up or not   yeah uh ill catch uh some of these news briefs that they have say at the top of the hour in the evening   right   and theyll mention the subject and say they have details at ten i hate it when they do that because i usually dont catch the news at ten oclock and they dont fill you in at that time on uh whats going on even though its something interesting that you may want to watch   do you ever discuss at work   um yeah usually with the people i work with uh uh we dont talk too much about the news but if something comes up uh yeah its a topic for discussion at the lunch table   now see usually when i was working at TI we hit about eight oclock in the morning we all just  what was news and coming up and all so we just hack it out between all of us one way or the other   uhhuh no we dont discuss too much uh too much news except for at lunch unless there are rumors  for pertaining to layoffs or company business things of that nature   but uh well ours was kind of strange because wed hit um since we were all females and uh wed hit either the blacks because two of us were black one one two three four of us are white   uhhuh   and so it would be a cross between all of it going in together and uh i really enjoyed that i really enjoyed that because we got a cross section of viewpoints   yeah   and it was fascinating in the morning so we ended up getting there well we were all there usually by seven thirty   you get a lot of different perspectives that way   it was it was fascinating it really was i really enjoyed it and i think everyone else did otherwise we wouldnt keep doing it every morning   uhhuh do you get any news magazines   but no   okay i dont get any news magazines but i do get a uh a photography magazine that does have a lot of photo journalism in it which is interesting   oh that would be interesting   instead of reading about the news you get to look at the pictures   im not uh i dont seem to find time to read too much except of the stuff im studying right now   uhhuh   but uh news wise that way no but i have realized most of mine uh from the TV i think has increased watching the news   okay   since the since the war   yeah yeah i think the coverage has gotten better are are you real satisfied with the TV news coverage   um   are there other things that youd like them to to spend more time on theyre theyre very limited they have half hour to provide provide all the news weather sports and what not and uh most of the major stories are the same across all the network major networks but uh they do have uh uh scoops and specific stories that um ill say one network that another one wont cover   well see im like as i said i pick up on Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty usually my favorite is Sixty Minutes   uhhuh   and ill pick up on them and find out what theyre going to see and then ill pick up the rest of the stories stories like that and get into like that but   yeah   not uh most of the time if a really interesting one thing or another ill go a little bit further but usually its i just dont have the time     yeah i think its good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage although uh TV networks and uh there are radio stations that uh specifically cater to the news   but i can understand now why some of the newspapers circulation has gone down because its so much easier to watch the TV and keep at least ninety percent abreast and watching you know reading the newspaper and forget it   yeah well its like i read a lot at work and i really have to make an effort to read anything when i get home i think thats why uh uh reading newspaper suffers to watching TV and TV is more entertaining uh it uh  usually have it on all the time when im at home whether im watching it or not   well i got tired with newspapers because i seem to stack them up without reading them   yeah um   thats why i stopped   thats uh thats a weekly chore get rid of the old newspapers that havent been read   i found out when i got the newspaper that it id read the headlines front page and maybe through a couple other sections and then i start packing them up and im going i never read this what am i you know why even subscribe to it when im not reading it   yeah well i get the Sunday paper tomorrow and ill pull out the TV section and put that aside and i get out the sports section and read that and then i start clipping coupons and if i have any time uh later in the week to read the rest of it i may pick it up and uh glance at it but u h i usually dont scan it cover to cover   well see like when they have that recycle program on was it Save the Earth Save America i think what it was   yeah   i watched that twice i recorded that because there were some things in there i wanted   huh   that i hadnt written down so i had recorded that but you cant find that in the newspaper   thats interesting no   but see i take that as far as my concern thats news to me   uhhuh   because i enjoy something like that but uh i wonder about the rest of the world in itself how much they get or how much i talk to people that i work with at night now and the younger group they dont watch too much   right   they dont even see it but i think theyre being raised watching TV more than newspapers   yeah i believe thats true   so i wish theyd put a little bit more depth in some of their stories   uhhuh yeah well think thats that gets back to what i was saying before about uh the say the network news coverage they only have so much time to provide so much uh coverage of the news and they cant get very in depth in the with the within the limitations of the time that they have to present it   i think they could use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a little more positive in some of their stories than complete negative all the time   well sure but uh youre talking about uh sensationalism here that you have to report the news and typically news is is uh or types the types of events that uh shock people or uh uh major crimes uh court cases things of that nature and most uh its just a fact that most things that make news are are bad types of occurrences they arent uh positive in nature   well thats too true to a degree if they can put a complete half hour TV program on of what police have done to um or fireman you know off handed when they go in and find people or going down all all sorts of things you know what im talking about   yeah there is a show on   sorry about that   there is a show on in fact it was on tonight at eight oclock called Cops have you ever seen that   right ive seen parts of it thats one of them   thats very very interesting gives you a whole new perspective of the police department      um there there is lots of stories out there about people what theyve done out of you know stop on the highway and stop someone uh just because there was an accident one way or the other   right   to me thats positive   yeah well i think they actually came up with that to show not just to to fill in on Saturday night but to promote the image of the police department because it does show uh what positive impact the police have in the society not just that theyre always there when bad things happen   see so you wouldnt see like thats a cop show fine but theres positive in many different areas   oh yeah   that they could push a little bit more on TV   well like environmentalist and uh
