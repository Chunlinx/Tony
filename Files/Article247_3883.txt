                                 King of the Valley                        Jim Clark as Dennis Rodman I like that analogy of yours but I also thinkthat in using it youve stumbled across the biggest problem with The NewNew Thing  See There I go again Dennis Rodman is or rather was themost colorful bizarre and interesting player in professional basketballandhe was also a helluva talent You could undoubtedly write a more interestingbook about Rodman than you could about say Michael Jordanwho despite beingthe greatest player of all time is bland as toast off the court and a toughernut to crack in any case It takes a lot of work to write about Jordan EvenDavid Halberstam who wrote a book about Jordans exploits during his lastseason couldnt wrest an interview from him But if you were to decide thatRodman was your subjectand why not since hes so much more fun to writeabout and since hes also much more accessible than Jordancould you thensay that your book was about The Man Who Singlehandedly Changed ProfessionalBasketball Nobody would dare make such a claim would they            Yet isnt that what Michael Lewis has done here His main characternayhis only characteris truly fascinating Hes deeply eccentric Heboils over with absurd resentments He bubbles over with interesting ideas Hespends half the book building the biggest yacht in the world He must have beena ton of fun to write about And he was accessible to the author But can ittruly be claimedas Lewis in fact claimsthat Jim Clark more than anyother single person shaped the current ethos of Silicon Valley Or is it morelikely that having landed his subject Lewis created a thesis to justify hischoice            My own suspicion is that the truth is closer to the latter than the formerThis is not to say that Clark isnt a big deal but there are others who arebigger deals and have done more to change the Valley than Clark The venturecapitalist John Doerr springs instantly to mind In addition there are a tonof forces at play that conspired to create modern Silicon Valley My guess isthat the various changes Lewis documents would have happened with or withoutJim Clark            Of course the biggest force was and is the Internet Here Lewis wouldprobably point out that as the cofounder of Netscape Clark played asingularly important role in making the Internet a massmarket medium which iswhat changed everything And oh how I longed for a detailed inside history ofNetscape in The New New Thing  But alas it was nowhere to be found Asyou correctly pointed out once Clark loses interest so does Lewis ButMosaic the first browser had already been invented by Marc AndreessenClarks cofounder And as Lewis himself points out Clarks greatestcontribution with Netscapethe actual thing he did that made the biggestchange in the way Silicon Valley workswas to take it public before it wasprofitable Once that offering took off it was as if a light bulb went off allover the Valley YOU DIDNT HAVE TO HAVE A PROFITABLE COMPANY TO GET RICH Whatan insight What caused Clark to have this insight Here Im afraid is whereLewis loses me completely He says that Clark pushed for a Netscape IPO becausehe wanted to build a new boat and this was the only way he could think to payfor it Im sorry I just couldnt buy that one Could you            Clark in fact is such a oneofakind character that he doesnt reallystand in for any Silicon Valley type I cant be a venture capitalistbecause Im not that kind of person Clark tells Lewis at one point And Icant be a manager because Im not that kind of person All I can do is startthem Thats the claim Clark makes for himself But then Lewis goes on towrite His role in the Valley was suddenly clear he was the author of thestory He was the man with the nerve to invent the tale in which all thecharactersthe engineers the VCs the managers the bankersagreed to playthe role he assigned to them Jim Clark Maybe you could say that about JPMorgan once upon a time Or is that journalistic mythmaking too But thatkind of claim for Clark just doesnt hold up at least not to my mind            There is one way Clark is representative of the Valley In his open lust formoney Clark is willing to say out loud what everyone else there thinksbutdoesnt dare say And Lewis captures that exquisitely There is another ofthose wonderful Lewis scenes in which Clark is saying that if only he can bericher than Larry Ellison whos worth  billion hell stop Lewis remindshim that not long ago Clark had said he would be satisfied with  billionafter taxes Clark just shrugs When Lewis asks him if he wants more than BillGates Clark laughs off the suggestion as ludicrous But a few minutes later headds You know just for one moment I would kind of like to have the mostJust for one tiny moment Beautiful            I wind up thinking that to really enjoy The New New Thing  you haveto forget about the claim the author is making for his subject and simply revelin scenes like that one But for me at least thats awfully hard to do Ikeep seeing Dennis Rodman being described as Michael Jordan            PS I realize that we havent yet talked about MyCFO and I promise to getto that tommorrow In the meantime though I couldnt help noticing that justlast week Clark brought on a senior guy from Charles Schwab to be the CEOBetcha theyre already planning the IPO
