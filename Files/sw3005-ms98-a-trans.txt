        okay uh could you give me your thoughts on uh on any trends     well uh longer term trends i think that uh like past oh ten or fifteen years uh there there there seems to be a a trend and maybe its longer than that of of politics is is strictly a what can i get for me or what can i get for my group and not whats best for the whole uh kind of a thing uh does that make any sense or   yeah um youre talking about the uh political action committees and uh   i mean the yeah political action committees that and i think it i think it ties in with the the budget deficit that uh the Congress and and uh is is they get they get reelected by what they do for their districts uh in terms of bringing in and bringing in money and and uh   right   in order to bring in money for their district theyve got to vote to spend it in other districts and and uh the heck with the overall uh deficit and it   yeah   districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms of of uh whether its Social Security or or anything that that uh its its what what you get for your constituents one way or another not what whats necessarily good overall   yeah were uh  we feel it up here in New England because were small states so we dont have the represent and representatives that   yeah   that the larger states have you know like like Texas and California um but weve got we have political clout only because of the tenure of the people that are in there like for uh uh the sub   yeah like Texas yeah yeah   building you know Gratin and theyre building down in Newport now   yeah okay but you   but once uh somebodys got to do it somebodys got to build the subs and i guess Virginia can do it also in fact ive got a a   yeah   the latest contract that was awarded Virginia sued or has got a lawsuit against uh Gratin to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained or something like that you know   yeah and uh yeah but lets see you you do have uh long time uh long time power people there in terms of i mean Rhode Islands got uh   right this um   Powell and Chaffey and and and been in the senate forever and uh   Powell yep yep yep but when those when those people leave uh the powers going to go um there isnt really anything here because were not really big enough so the economy is going to going to suffer i think because the the   yeah yeah   the base that New England always had the textile base the uh the uh costume jewelry base most of that now has moved out here to overseas to overseas or down south so were prone to   yep yep   um uh recessions like the rest of the country were before we were kind of stable uh the political power is the only thing that can stabilize it at least i think up up this neck of the woods   yeah yeah yeah   but theres too many now uh political action committees and where the money is coming from is coming from those states that have the big industries that can afford to contribute to those   yeah   so those are going to get uh uh the squeaky wheel gets the oil theyre going to theyre going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like Boeing or General Dynamics or wherever wherever they happen to be you know youve youve only got a few plane factories or   yeah well well i guess i guess im a little more cynical than that im not im not sure that it that all of it has to be done even but uh   well i i think they should be outlawed myself the the the packs i dont think they should be   uh but well in it well i but i i mean in terms of of not necessarily all the planes that the government buys they really need or not necessarily well in in in in particular uh planes and i   true   you know i see this here in in Texas that that uh got uh oh i cant even remember which of the companies it is but theyve theyve got a theyve got a tilt rotor uh plane that theyve developed and they want to sell but developed for the defense department department and defense department is saying well no we we dont we dont really need it its going to be too expensive and its not going to do what we need and   oh like the yeah yep yep   the the Texas people are fighting to have it built for just to just to keep and create jobs here   right yep   rather than because its uh you know they they they certainly use the words well its needed but but uh   yeah look at look at the tanks now look at that New Abrams tank   yeah   and i have no idea what the cost is uh five million ten million   no   for each one now you can make you can make a a missile or or a hand held rocket that can take one of those out pretty effectively   yep   what what do we need all the tanks for i mean you can make you make you can make probably a thousand rockets for each tank   right yeah yeah   and you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively uninvolved uninvolved untrained uh person and he can take he can take one of those tanks out   yep   but yet im not sure who is it Chrysler that makes the tanks or one of one of the   i think i i think maybe so and i think that or   and i dont think we really need all that hardware and again and again like the Stealth bombers and and some of these things they they put on their drawing boards and they never fly or they never they never run right   yeah yeah yeah yeah   um is it because of of political clout   yeah   rather than need i think in a lot of cases yes   yeah yeah   but we dont have a watchdog agency to the military overlooks their own testing   yeah   which is good for us i mean it creates you know we generate a lot of income at TI because of the military contacts   right right right you know thats true too but do you see any other trends or particularly interesting events that come to your mind   um the savings and loans crisis   yeah   the political trends there are are most most of these people are lawyers that are now in in uh the government whether its state or local most of them i guess youve been reading about the problems weve had in Rhode Island where the governor closed down a lot of the the uh credit unions and banks   yeah   because of uh it was privately insured but but stated   well it certainly did certainly did when he first did it but i havent heard about it for a while i was at are there   yeah theres still a lot of people that uh still cant get their money out   cant yeah   um they still have to pay their their bills like their mortgages and things they slip them under the door to the bank and but yet they cant get any of their savings so its its its a little bit difficult but most of the people there the trend was that on almost every single board of the institutions that were closed they were state legislators   huh yeah   so they had a conflict of interest because they tried to get through uh a bill stating that they had to have federal insurance rather than private insurance and it was squashed   yep yeah
