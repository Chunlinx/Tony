Akstspiece PassiveAggressive Here at Morningstar we spend most of our days thinking about investmentstrategies and rarely does the word evil come to mind Of course there isvice in the mutualfund business Fund companies greedinspired pursuit ofassets occasionally leads them to lie cheat and virtually steal from theirshareholders through deceptive advertising or outrageous fees and expensesBut index funds rarely commit such sinsthey are surely the choirboys of theindustry            Thus I was surprised to seeindex funds tarred as evil in your article You allege that greedy indexfundinvestors take advantage of noble souls doing their own research and therebythreaten to erode the quality of information and research that is thefoundation of our efficient stock markets In fact this view is almostcompletely opposite to the truth The rise of index funds should be seen astriumphant proof that our financial markets are robustly efficient And it willbe impossible for index funds to destroy the efficiency of markets as long asthose markets remain free and ruled by greed            You beguile us with theimage of a pastoral commons in which index investors are selfish free ridersgrazing on the fruits of hardworking financial analysts Having talked tohundreds of mutual fund managers Id suggest that this is not the appropriatevision of the workings of the stock market Instead imagine a huge ocean ofinformation populated by vicious hungry sharks These sharks patrol the waterslooking for juicy tidbits to grow fat on After they have had their fill of theprey its carcass falls to the bottom of the sea There bottom feeders waitpatiently to scavenge the remaining scraps They dont get fat but they have anice easy life waiting for their dinner to fall to them In this metaphor thesharks are the active investors and the indexers are the bottom feeders Thefinal crucial detail that ensures that this world and our financial marketswill always function smoothly is that the sharks can become bottom feeders andvice versa            If this were a truebiological world competition between the species and the drive for survivalwould ensure that there is equilibrium between the sharks and the bottomfeeders If the lazy bottom feeders become too numerous there wont be enoughcarcasses floating down to the bottom In this case the illfed bottom feederswill decide to join the sharks and will hunt their own kills In the alternatecase when sharks swarm the waters there will be little reward to theirhunting and some of the sharks will retire to the easy life of bottomfeeding            There isa similar equilibrium in the financial world Only in the stock market theequilibrating force is unfettered greed Today aided by an explosion ininformation technology there are thousands and thousands of active aggressiveinvestors pouncing on every nugget of information thereby making the marketshighly efficient In this world it makes eminent sense for some investors togive up the hunt and be satisfied with the quiet life of indexing It is truethat the indexers are freeriding on the sharks But dont cry for thesharksthey are just as selfish as the bottom feeders The sharks are free tohang up their fins any time and pursue the lazy life And they surely willwhenever it pays to do so As the profits from active investing diminish therewill automatically be fewer active investors and more indexers And wheneverthe profits from an active strategy become evident a feeding frenzy of sharkswill appear It is this freedom that investors haveto follow any strategyfrom fundamental analysis to astrologycombined with the powerful drive ofhuman greed that guarantees that our financial markets will always be highlyefficient and that indexing or any other investing strategy will never pose athreat to market efficiency As long as at least a few sharks patrol thewaters we will all be safe                           Todd Porter mutualfund analyst Morningstar                           Akst MeNo Questions                        Although his criticisms inPassiveAggressive are right on the mark Daniel Akst need have no fear of thefreeriding index investors who strive for mediocrity by investing passivelyIf  percent of new mutual fund money is now going into indexed funds asopposed to  percent in  we can have some confidence that the indexers areplanting the seeds of their own destruction As more people drop out of thecompetition to outperform the marginal research and trading value of thedecreasing number of active investors will become significant and they willbegin to beat the market            Take the argument for passiveinvesting to its extreme Suppose that tomorrow morning all funds were investedsolely in index funds By definition that would be the last trade in the stockmarket That is no one would be able to react to new information Clearlysome investors would break from the pack as new information became public andothers were not reacting Thus the number of passive vs active investors willalways fluctuate around an equilibrium            By theway the tragedy of the commons is not a theoretical construct from a senvironmentalist It was coined almost  years ago I think perhaps by DavidRicardo to describe the preindustrial landtenure system in Britain whereinpeasants would destructively graze their livestock on commonly held landFurthermore the traditional response to the observation is not in favor ofgreens social critics and other worrywarts who fret over issues such aspopulation growth but rather supports the capitalist argument that land tendsto be used more efficiently under private ownership in that the owner isinterested in supporting the longterm value of the property

ad hominem attacks to criticizea recent article of mine on US trade with emerging economies like ChinaRather than join Krugman in the gutter I will deal with his few substantivepoints            First Krugman belittlesconcerns about Americas huge and growing merchandise trade deficits with Chinabecause the US government figures I cited have kept Hong Kong and thePeoples Republic of China separate Combine them he claims and Chinas bigglobal merchandise trade surplus shrinks to insignificance            What Krugman does notexplain is how if the macroeconomic forces he emphasizes truly explain Chinastrade flows the PRC can be growing at roughly doubledigit rates and running aglobal surplus In fact at one point he insists that it is an arithmeticalnecessity for big capital importers like China to run trade deficitsEvidently the Politburo at MIT needs some math lessons            Further Chinas tradebalance with the United States was my focus not Chinas global balance Andfor  combining the Hong Kong and China figures reduced Americas Chinadeficit only from  billion to  billion            Moreover the annual exportfigures for the PRC are considered by the US government to be understated byat least  billionthe amount of Chinese textiles and apparel fraudulentlyshipped to the United States through third countries Industry estimates placethe figure at some  billion But of course what could matters like customsfraud possibly have to do with trade policy            Krugman also criticizes myexpectation that emerging economies will continue developing as worldclassexporters but remain small consumer goods markets After all he arguesalthough countries that produce more than they consume must run tradesurpluses these surpluses will guarantee high consumption because theresulting national income increase has to show up somewhere  Moreoverhe observes most emerging economies are running global trade deficitsieconsuming even more than they produceprecisely because they importconsiderable foreign capital            Yet many countries becomemajor importers but not major consumer markets How By concentrating theirimports in capital goods intermediate goods and industrial inputsthe veryproducts needed to maintain exportled growth Such growth may indeed one daycreate big consumer markets But one day may be a long time coming            For governments in thesecountries have aims other than enriching domestic consumers Indeed many denyindividuals and businesses broad freedom to consume precisely because their toppriority is building national economic powerespecially productivecapacityover the long haul As the examples of Japan and South Korea showfor strategic reasons they are willing to interfere with Krugmans vauntedmarketequilibrating forces for decades by mandating high savings andsuppressing domestic consumption in other ways and pushing exports And whenthey do consume they often focus on purchases whose economic benefits do nottrickle down or abroadlike weapons Indeed most of east and southeast Asiais in the midst of a big prolonged military buildup            Finally numerous statisticsbelie Krugmans claim that real wages inevitably rise with productivity Thatscertainly not the case in the United States Nor is it the case in MexicoThere manufacturing productivity rose by an annual average of  percentbetween  and  the Salinas years But just before the  pesocollapse real hourly wages stood nearly  percent below  levels One mainreason Some  million Mexicans enter the countrys workforce every yeargreatly increasing the labor surplus in a land where unemployment andunderemployment were estimated by the US Embassy in Mexico City at a stunning percent in late             Indeed labor surpluses andfalling wages plague most lowincome countries outside east Asia And eventhere anecdotal evidence indicates that once labor costs take off so doesforeign investmentfor muchlowerwage laborrich countries like China            Finally Krugmans numberson Asian wages catching up to US wages ignore one big factor contributing tothat narrowing a decline in US wages Although he calls this trendPanglossian few other Americans will            Ianxiously await the bucket of mud Krugman is undoubtedly preparing to sling inresponse             Alan Tonelson USBusiness and Industrial Council Educational Foundation                           PaulKrugman replies Im sorry that Alan Tonelsons offended dignity hasprevented him from actually taking on board the substantive arguments that Imade in my article Let me try however to make four points             Tonelson seems to thinkthat the proposition that a country which attracts large capital inflows mustalso be running a trade deficit is merely my opinion It isnt It is a matterof sheer accountingit is exactly as I said an arithmetical necessity AndI believe that whatever asperity I may have shown in the column is justified bythe astonishing fact that he really doesnt understand that            The pointwhich I thought Imade clearly in the column but then what do I knowis that Chinas tradesurplus and actual rough balance on current account shows that the country isnot in fact a net recipient of capital Capital account plus current accountequals zero that is a fact not a theory whatever the Politburo may say Anyattempt to make sense of the countrys trade must include an explanation of howthe money brought in by foreign investors goes out again             Tonelson accuses me ofsuperficial research then says that in his article Chinas trade balancewith the United States was my focus not Chinas global balance I have nowdone a little more research by rereading his review of Jeffrey Gartens TheBig Ten  which was clearly cited as the source of my quotations  NewYork Times Book Review  June  Page  If there is any mention ofChinas trade balance with the United States in there I cant find itinfact the article seems to say quite clearly that emerging economies will notoffer large markets to anyone Maybe Tonelson has some other article inmind            Doing a bit more research Idiscover that in my own column I included a long sidebar which acknowledgedthat while the precise numbers are in dispute China certainly does run alarge bilateral surplus visvis the United States and tried to discuss theeconomic meaning of that surplus But maybe Tonelson had stopped reading bythen             Tonelsons letter makes abig point of the likelihood that advanced countries will export mainly capitalequipment rather than consumer goods to the emerging economies Why exactlyis this a problem Is selling tractors and forklifts somehow a less soundbusiness than selling soft drinks What fools the Japanese are selling us allthose numerically controlled machine tools As the saying goes Give a man afish and you feed him for a day Teach a man to fish and you can sell himequipment             Finally Tonelson deniesthat productivity increases lead to higher wages insisting that the dramaticconvergence in hourly compensation between the United States and the Asiantigers has been achieved through a fall in the US level Funny When I checkout the real hourly compensation number in the back of the  EconomicReport of the President Page  a book which I assume Tonelson has onhis desk I find that it went up about  percent between  and We could go on at length about whether workers should have received even moreor what adjustments one might make to that number to move it down or up abit but by any calculation I can make the overwhelming picture is one ofconvergence between wages in the tigers and in the West through a process ofleveling up not leveling down            I shouldperhaps say that I have nothing personal against Alan Tonelson I quoted himonly because I often find it hard to convince people that the views of thefaction he represents are as crude and naive as they really are Surelypeople say they cant really believe that countries can attract massivecapital inflows and run big trade surpluses at the same time They must havesome more sophisticated point in mind The only answer to suchrationalizations is to catch somebody with his hand in the cookie jar Andwhatever Tonelson may say I caught him redhanded                           The Rapeof the Lockheed                        In JamesSurowieckis article The Lockheed Redemption he stated that Lockheed wascurrently building the FA Stealth fighter and the thoroughly unnecessaryF for the Air Force Given that the skies are filling up with planes likethe Eurofighter the Dassault Rafale the J the JAS Gripen the MiG and and the Sukoi Su and  all of which are comparable or superior to anyUS fighter how can the F be thoroughly unnecessary Those other planesare being built by countries which are all pushing hard for foreign sales soit is not inconceivable that our Air Force might confront some of thesehightech planes in the future The question is will they do it with adecadesold plane designed to fight the battles of the past or one designed tofight the battles of the future             BrianShibayama

citizens other than theproperty owner it should be encouraged Research indicates that liberalshallissue concealed carry gun permit laws not leftwing ideologyfirearms laws result in a reduction of crimes against persons Since citizenslegally carrying firearms make those areas safer firearms restrictions arecounterproductive Thank you for the encouragement             FredNiziol Columbia Md                           Steven ELandsburg replies Fred Niziol is correct in his facts but mistaken in hisreasoning Recent research does indicate that liberal firearms lawsreduce crime against persons But it does not follow that liberal firearms lawsreduce crime against persons who do not carry firearms  Therein lies acritical distinction            Consider three hypothesesHypothesis  says that when I buy a gun I discourage people from becomingcriminals and so reduce crime against my neighbors In that case according tothe costbenefit criterion that economists like to employ my gun ownershipshould be subsidized            Hypothesis  says that when Ibuy a gun I prevent crimes against myself while having no effect on crimesagainst my neighbors criminals who choose me as a victim end up wasting theirtime but criminals who choose you as a victim are as successful asever In that case I have ample incentive to arm myself and there is noreason to encourage me with a subsidy            Hypothesis  says that when Ibuy a  gun I protect myself from say  worth of property loss whileinflicting say  worth of property loss on my neighborsbecause half thecriminals who try unsuccessfully to rob me go on to rob someone else insteadIn that caseagain according to the usual costbenefit criterionmy gun is abad thing it costs  and only reduces total crime by  Thats anargument for discouraging gun ownership through taxation            I do not know which of thesehypotheses is closest to the truth and am not aware of any research thatsettles that question Therefore I do not know whether gun ownership should besubsidized taxed or neither            Whatsremarkable about the Lojack research is that it does do a careful job ofdistinguishing among the analogues of Hypotheses   and  That takes a lotof hard work and ingenuity It will take harder work and more ingenuity beforewe know whether Niziol has jumped to the right or the wrong conclusion                           BrissingLink                        I foundSo Arethe Neanderthals Still Jews by Charles Paul Freund to be inappropriatefor a publication from Microsoft While it may be that Freund was attemptingsatire in his review
