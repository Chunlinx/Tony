                                 The Next Intellectuals            Should there be a PhD program for public intellectuals The response tothe news that one has been created has been kneejerk and mockingPlayboy called it a Hot Air Doctorate Camille Paglia declared in lastweeks Chronicle of Higher Education  Theyre going to groompeoplewhat To be me Thats not the way to do it Its true that the PublicIntellectuals Programdidnt anyone notice that the acronym is PIPoffersits own butt up for the kicking The courses for its  students could havebeen ripped out of a Modern Language Association catalog circa  There areclasses on feminism new spiritualities environmentalism postcolonialismgender race media dissidence and of course pop culture The hostinstitution is Florida Atlantic University an undistinguished university inBoca Raton evidently looking for an excuse to lure namebrand talent to itscampusand who would refuse a Florida gig especially if they make it in sayFebruary            The talent is namebrandamong the stars scheduled to shine therebriefly at some point in the future are Harvard theologian Cornel West Harvardphilosopher Anthony Appiah Parisian semiotician Julia Kristeva feministpsychoanalytic critic Juliet Mitchell and even interestingly that elegist ofpublic intellectualism lost Russell Jacoby author of The LastIntellectuals but all of them are of a political inclination leftishthat has been losing the culture wars on campus of late You cant helpwondering whether its graduates trained in such ephemera as Rhetoric andPrinciple as one of the core courses is called will be able to hold theirown in the substantially more conservativeand possibly moresubstantivepublic arena If we roll our eyes wrote the PhiladelphiaInquirer s book critic Carlin Romano in an essay in theChronicle                            its because we suspect that FAUs freshly minted publicintellectuals will find themselves cerebrally all dressed up with no place togo Can you imagine the Boca Raton intellectuals exercising cultural clout inthe national media with profiles about them to follow in the Times Dont hold your breath                        But its not as if theres anything wrong per se with a doctoraltraining program for public intellectuals At its best it would be aninteresting graduate program of general studies            The main problem with the FAU program it strikes Culturebox is thename Its pretty presumptuous for any professor to declare his studentspublic intellectuals you would much rather they got their certification assuch from someone else Otherwise the whole thing sounds harmless For onething contrary to the popular wisdom FAU does not intend to turn out babyPaglias The program director Max Kirsch claims at least that its studentsarent looking for fame They are looking for some engagement with thepublic Kirsch is using code but what he means is that what hes training hisstudents to be are behindthescenes activists and organizerswhat ItalianMarxist Antonio Gramsci called organic intellectuals Gramsci believed thateverybody no matter what he does participates in some kind of intellectualactivityis a philosopher or artist or person of taste has a uniqueconception of the world and line of moral conduct and therefore generates newways of thinking The job of people who actually call themselves intellectualsis to articulate such situational thought and put it to use for change AsEdward Saidput it in some  lectures on the subject                           Todays advertising or public relations expert  would beconsidered an organic intellectual according to Gramsci someone who in ademocratic society tries to gain the consent of potential customers winapproval marshal consumer or voter opinion Gramsci believed that organicintellectuals are actively involved in society that is they constantlystruggle to change minds and expand markets  are always on the move on themake                        In short you could view the Florida Atlantic program as a version ofHarvards Kennedy School of Government except its for leftwing activistsrather than centrist politicians            Moreover the ideal of the public intellectual is no newfangled fadOrganic intellectual is not strictly identical with public intellectual ofcourse and one wonders whether Russell Jacoby understands who exactly hessigned up to teach given his understanding of the term public intellectualin The Last Intellectuals he defines it as one who writes with vigorand clarity not as an activist or leftwing scholar But the notion of thepublic intellectual is much older than that of say the gentlemenscholarwhom no one sneers at except perhaps organic intellectuals Almost everyphilosophy or political tendency worth mentioning from Plato on has held inspecial esteem its version of the active thinker who puts his principles acrosswell and thereby commands a wider public We might think the idea is newerbecause of the phrase which gained currency in recent years mainly because ofJacoby In his book Jacoby deplores what he characterizes as a sort of fallfrom the Edenic condition of what he calls classical American intellectualsborn at the turn of the centuryLewis Mumford Dwight Macdonald andinevitably Edmund Wilsonto the generation born after World War II whoseintellectuals he claims have all retreated into academia where they havelost themselves in a thicket of specialized professional jargon            Culturebox doesnt exactly buy Jacobys argument that there are no publicintellectuals left If anything there are too manyevery bright young thinggraduating from college these days feels compelled to publish his or herparticular social critique whether readable or not and there is a smallplatoon of quasisubsidized publishing companies Free Press Basic BooksPublic Affairs Press etc ready to print them On the other hand why shouldthere be any limit to the number of baby public intellectuals out there Andwhy shouldnt they be leftwing Quite a few of the aforementioned juniorpundits get money and support from rightwing think tanks which are the moraland intellectual equivalent of the Florida Atlantic Public IntellectualsProgram if that So Culturebox says Let a thousand flowers bloom
