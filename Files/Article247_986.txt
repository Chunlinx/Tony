                                 Cold War and Coffee                        Dear Katha            No I dont think Russia is heading for elysium or that the free marketsolves every problem it just bypasses some of the more avoidable ones Butnor do I think some wrenching social and economic difficulties in astillnascent constitutional democracy are comparable to forced starvationsreigns of terror and the Gulag Theyre a necessary evil like a detoxtremor not like an arbitrary jackboot in the head            Nor do I think there is or was any faint comparison between the evils theUS sponsored during the Cold War and the US undoubtedly sponsored someand what the Soviets did Sorry but what the West imposed on Western Europewas nothing compared to what the Soviets did in Eastern Europe or the entireEurasian continent I thought given what we now know that this wasuncontroversial Im interested to see you still dont think so            As to my winwin situation I dont get your point My view is thatThatcherism largely worked and was therefore all but coopted by New LabourYes the Tories had been in power too long and got kicked out for sleaze andexhaustion But the difference between what another Major government would havedone and what Blair has done is I think infinitesimal So Im disappointedthe Tories didnt go on for ever but hardly worried And so far Blair hasbeen terrific on most of the important issues            Maybe I should apologize for my distemper this morning I didnt mean torefight the Cold War over coffee Something just came over me I certainlythink the Right has plenty of postideological problems of its own and Safireis as cranky about Russia as many on the Left But I think the Left has someeven more thorough accounting to perform than the Right It seems to me that inFrance and Britain that process is underway But in America it still lagsMeanwhile nihilist Clintonism rules and populist Gingrichism yaps Could itbe that the Lefts refusal to pore over its often shameful and mistaken pasthas something to do with this political impasse            Andrew
