        uh so Jack what type of music do you like   well i like uh classical and uh sort of uh popular rock type music um   uhhuh yeah i enjoy classical too i never really had listened to it till i i got married and and my wife um enjoys it   oh uhhuh   so i i had never listened to it before till then but now i listen to it well whenever she does and every once in a while id put it on myself you know um  what   yep yep so i yeah i used to play the piano and i like uh Bach and   oh yeah   uh sort of the baroque music Handel and   uhhuh   Vivaldi and those kind of   oh yeah see those are those are really nice i like those though i i couldnt tell you anything about them other than what my wife says this is Bach you know   yep yep oh yeah yeah well i you know i dont i dont know all that much myself i just i just know when i hear it that i like it   umhum yeah that you what you like how about popular music   yeah uh whatevers on the radio is is usually okay with me but um   hm   sometimes have a hard time understanding you know hearing the words clearly if im in the car and theres noise and stuff so its mostly just the tune   yeah yeah im pretty much the same way you know people always say wow the the meanings of those words and im always meaning theres words well you know i just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know     yeah i know yeah i know i know about the only thing i can remember after the song is over is the refrain   right yeah that whenever they say it two or three times   yeah yeah   im the same way  yeah its funny um  depending on where you live i i i commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is   yeah   uhhuh   two and a half hours away and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different you know when yeah because Baltimorell play more um what might be considered more little bit more progressive   uhhuh uhhuh oh really umhum   and as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town thats you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in the real rural Baltimore uh Maryland they it turns into  basically classic rock   yeah yeah   and they dont you know yeah mostly oldies but classic rock you know with if you know like when the Doors movie came out you know Doors was really on the radio there   oldies or what yeah uhhuh   you know where you know youd hear whats one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore but in Salisbury you would thats all you would hear was this is the Doors you know so was sort of a funny thing   oh yeah yeah yeah yeah theres a big variation among the country i mean if you go down south and country music and   you you yes thats im starting to realize that i never really thought about that much but there is   yeah yeah yeah   yeah i never   so   i never i didnt i i lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore and i didnt i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area   uhhuh   i really didnt notice at all it just seemed the same but when i went more rural you know that it really changed so   yeah yeah yeah Chicago has a lot of good stations um yeah um fact they have a they have a continuous news station which is nice if youre driving and you wanna hear   oh does it yeah yeah   now you dont have to wait till the hour mark its its its sort of constant you just turn there and um you get the latest news and everything its uh its sort of like CNN you know you turn on your TV its on   umhum right yeah boy that would really be beneficial because you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio i never get it   so yeah yeah yeah   you know and if you dont if you dont read the paper you sort of fall behind if youre in the car all the time   hm yep yep yep   yeah thats pretty good   so yeah i like to listen to tapes uh of music or or um stuff on a long trip and um now you can even get books on tape um   umhum umhum yeah yeah in fact my my uh my grandmother does that a lot because shes blind or what shes losing her sight or whatever but yeah that of in i can imagine you know if youre driving cross country   uhhuh yeah yeah umhum   you know uh listening to a story  lot of the classics are really on tape yeah   right yep yep so thats a lot of fun but   yeah that that would be good   yep   well we strayed a lot from music but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening so as long as youre listening so   yeah i guess so well right right right yep   but if you do if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off   yep okay   well Jack it was nice to talk to you and and good luck and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls  bye   yep nice talking to you Tom all right good thank you bye bye
