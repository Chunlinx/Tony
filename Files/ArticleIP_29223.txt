                                 Driving While Flossing                           Please send your questions for publication to  prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudence                                                      My yearold daughter is friends with a girlwhose singleparent mother is rarely at home While I understand that she hasto work I cannot understand why she chooses to spend most of her free timewith her boyfriend who lives an hour away The result is that her daughter isat my house most days after school well into the evening as well as mostweekends Her mother calls to check on her but this is no substitute for thetime and attention her daughter needs                                       Both my daughter andI feel very sorry for her friend and understand her unwillingness to be aloneso much but I am concerned by her mothers neglect and resent the freechildcare I have considered sending the mother a note but am convinced itwould only result in hurting the daughter and making her feel unwelcome in myhouse I do not want to be ungenerous to a child in need How should I handlethis                                       Concerned Mother                        Dear Con            Sending a note to thisneglectful mother you correctly imagine will not change the situation for thebetter The notsohot mother will become defensive and one way or another thekid will pay the price It sounds to Prudie as though you and your daughterlike this child so why dont you redo your thinking privately and come tosee this de facto member of your household as a kind of foster child Think ofyour opendoor policy as an act of charity a chance to make an importantcontribution to a youngsters life Your kind approach will also serve as amodel for your own daughter If you think it useful discuss your new approachwith your daughter It can only help her if she knows her own mom isconsciously trying to make a difference It can only be a wonderful lesson byexample for her to see generosity put into practice            Prudie inclusively                                             DearPrudie                                                      Recently my wife wrote to you concerning my Your answer was predictable Its unsafe tell him to do this in private Wellmy wife nearly fainted to see me castigated in public no less on theInternet                                       However I feel constrained to respond I neverdo this in an unsafe driving situationie curves crowded lanes etc Ivedone this all over the United States in New England mostly on the turnpikewith never a mishap My wife cannot say the same  and she doesnt flosswhile driving I guess what Im trying to say is if a person can maintaincontrol of the situation he shouldnt be found guilty of not operatingaccording to the manual                                       Thanks for lettingme vent                                       Flossers mate                        Dear Floss            One might surmise thatyour driving record while flossing is better than the beloveds with both herhands free Perhaps this is a tug of war where the rope is symbolicallydental floss Prudie hopes you two can settle this matter amicably so that thenext step is not clenched teeth            Prudie prophylactically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Some weeks ago I made the acquaintance of a newcoworker of the opposite sex We hit it off well and I asked him to lunchAfter some scheduling problems we managed the meal and had I thought acharming time After that he was quite pleasant when we ran into each otherRecently I asked him to join me again for lunch He pleaded the press of workand asked for a raincheck After letting a week tactfully pass I asked againHe again declined mentioning the proverbial raincheck His manner hasdefinitely changed and I know hes going to some lengths to avoid me                                       Needless to say I am disappointed but Imcertainly not planing to press my attentions on him Unfortunately theatmosphere now feels strained Should I speak to him or just let matters restIm puzzled                                       Thanks for yourassistance                                       Lunchless                        Dear Lunch            To pass on a wise nuggetfrom Prudies favorite Dorothy Parker Its not the tragedies of life thatdefeat you its the messes What has happened is that the object of yourattention began to feel crowded  for whatever reason It could be that hefound you more aggressive than was comfortable since the first andsecond invitations were yours It could be that while he behaved politely theinitial lunch was not as charming as you thought It could be that he intuitedmore of an interest on your part than he was prepared to deal with He couldvery well be neurotic or you may not be aware of your own firepower Whateverthe actuality he is definitely ducking you and your next move should be thisBehave in a cordial correct and distant manner When you encounter himsimply nod smile and keep going This approach is the best thing for both ofyou            Prudie plainly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I just
