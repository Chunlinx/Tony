                                 No Left Turn            A regular feature of theClinton years has been the unfulfilled prophecy that the president isanysecond nowabout to make a sharp turn to the left Through most of  and the refrain of disenchanted New Democrats was that although Clinton hadbeen elected on a centrist platform of welfare reform and deficit reductionhis administration was being captured by oldschool libs In the  campaignBob Dole warned voters that a reelected Clinton would drop his guise ofmoderation his liberalism unrestrained by the need to face the Americanpeople in a second election as Dole put it            Thesepredictions failure appears to be no deterrent to their regular renewal Onlythe rationale for Clintons rebirth as LBJ changes The latest version is thatClinton is finally showing his true color pale pink because of MonicaLewinsky The politics of scandal is doing what mere policy hasnt done sinceRepublicans took Congress in forcing the Great Triangulator back into theprotective custody of his partys liberals Paul Gigot wrote last week in theWall Street Journal             There are actually several versions of this theoryConservatives such as Gigot believe Clinton is a liberal at heart They see himlying in wait for an opportunity to expand government and raise taxes Avariation on this casts the first lady as the closet liberal Conservativespoint to Dick Morris recent assertion that the scandal has given Hillary thewhip hand at the White House There are also nonconservatives who think Clintonmay turn left for practical if not ideological reasons Hes going to have tokeep an eye on his basethe very people who elected him Richard Cohen wrotein the Washington Post a few days ago Significantly that means womenespecially feminists and organized labor The theory here is that ifthreatened with impeachment Clinton will need his Democratic diehards forprotection            Theproblem with these forecasts is that they are once again wrong It is veryprobable the sex scandal will have some effect on Clintons politics Thoughits hard to make out the precise effect at this point the fear of a meltdownin his popularity and the distant threat of impeachment are likely to make thepresident more riskaverse Hes less liable to do anything dicey or bold At amoment in his presidency when Clinton might otherwise be thinking about how tospend some of his accumulated political capital thats a damned shame Insteadof leading the way on entitlement reform Clinton may return to the sort ofmiddleclass populism he expressed during his last campaignwith perhaps anextra dollop of pandering An embattled Clinton is prone not just to play thedemagogue on Medicare but also to promote dubious IRS reforms and climb aboarda new Communications Decency Act            Much of the new suspicion about Clintonlurching left stems from the surprising entente between Clinton andcongressional Democrats who are more liberal than he is After quarreling forthe better part of five years they now seem to be getting along But theresan explanation for this which has nothing to do with the scandal After theHouse voted not to renew the administrations fasttrack trade negotiatingauthority last fall the White House became preoccupied with fostering a moreproductive relationship with Hill Democrats according to White Houseofficials Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles authorized three seniorofficialsJohn Podesta Rahm Emanuel and Doug Sosnikto try to draw up acommon agenda with the House and Senate minority leaders Dick Gephardt and TomDaschle            Clintonfirst revealed the fruits of these negotiations in remarks at a DemocraticUnity rally Jan  The main items he focused on in that speech were makingpeople as young as  eligible to buy Medicare coverage and regulating managedcare with a Patients Bill of Rights Clinton revealed two other proposalsjointly supported by the congressional Dems in his State of the Union addresswhich was delivered after the scandal broke reserving future budget surplusesuntil some fix has been found for Social Security and raising the minimumwage These are hardly radical proposalsoldstyle liberals would prefer tospend a budget surplus on social programs and they want to increase theminimum wage by more than the  Clinton has offered But in any case thecommon platform was negotiated long before anyone had heard of MonicaLewinsky            In embracing Clintons agenda congressional Democrats havemoved toward the center more than Clinton has moved left Liberals who used tospend most of their time being annoyed at Clinton have rallied around him inthe face of a common enemy realizing that a crumbling presidency would leavethem in the worst possible shape to face the  election Is it possible thatthe threat of impeachment will force Clinton deeper into the embrace of liberalinterest groups This is largely uncharted terrain but theres little reasonto think so Looking to the only comparisons available Watergate andIranContra didnt make Nixon or Reagan more ideological They just took thewind out of their sails and undermined the possibility of any second termagenda            Conservatives continue tofall prey to the fallacy of an impending left turn because they misunderstandClinton They think that because his political consciousness was formed duringthe s he must be a secret liberal But Clinton is above all a pragmatistOne lesson he has learned is that being too far to the left is a politicalhazard Clinton lost his job as governor of Arkansas in  as a result ofliberal crusading during his first term He regained it in  byrepositioning himself as a moderate The same thing happened again after hebecame president Clinton thought he was safe supporting universal health careif he rejected the singlepayer system supported by old liberals But even hishybrid scheme was too much for a public mistrustful of expanding governmentClinton regained his footing and won reelection in  through a calculatedcentrism that is likely to remain his approach to politics for what remains ofhis elective career            Of course it doesnt takemuch to make someone a lefty these days Liberals used to call for cutbacks indefense spending higher welfare benefits and a federal full employmentprogram Now they want a tiny bit more social spending within the context of abalanced budget To conservatives a liberal these days is someone who doesntsupport cutting taxes They should give Clinton a few more months If thingsget hot enough he may come out for a tax cut too
