                    Background        The majority of studies of indoor environmental quality        and health outcomes focus primarily on the office        environment and sick building syndrome symptoms or rare        illnesses such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis Very few        studies have attempted to determine the effects of        ventilation on shortterm sick leave absences caused by        respiratory infections        Several studies have however made links between        ventilation and respiratory illness        Two of        these studies were conducted in military settings In a        study at Army training centers Brundage and colleagues        detected significantly higher rates of febrile respiratory        illness among building occupants housed in modern barracks        with low outdoor air ventilation rates as compared to        soldiers housed in older barracks with higher ventilation        rates     In a study conducted during the Gulf War        Richards and his colleagues concluded that upper        respiratory symptoms were more frequent in troops housed in        airconditioned barracks when compared to those that were        housed in nonairconditioned barracks open warehouses or        tents     In a hospitalbased study an outbreak of        varicella virus was explained by airflow studies which        demonstrated the spread of airborne virus from an infected        patient housed in an isolation room to  other patients            In a study conducted during a pneumococcal disease        epidemic in a crowded jail it was shown that attack rates        were  higher in cells with the lowest volume of air        supply per person            Two studies have suggested a relationship between        respiratory infections and office environments In a study        first published in  Gwaltney and his colleagues        conducted an extensive study at a large insurance company        Their results suggested that working adults were        responsible for introducing  of the colds their families        contracted       More recently a study of Finnish        office workers suggested that workers who share offices are        at increased risk of colds although this study failed to        conclude if the infections were transmitted as airborne        infections or were transmitted by either large droplets or        direct contact            An underutilized method of evaluating building occupant        health which is particularly useful in office settings is        sick leave data Sick leave data has been used for a        variety of purposes such as to evaluate health promotion        programs      and to assess the efficacy of influenza        vaccination     In general a large fraction of sick        leave is caused by respiratory illness       In a        study conducted by Nichol et al upper respiratory        infections accounted for approximately  of sick leave        days among working adults     In a study of military        aircrews respiratory infections accounted for  of the        total number of days the crews were grounded     In a        study conducted on government employees in the United        Kingdom respiratory infections and gastroenteritis        accounted for over half of all absences     Milton et        al    used sick leave data to identify an association        between outdoor air supply levels and sick leave among        office workers The results indicated that lower levels of        outdoor air supply in office buildings were associated with        increased sick leave This association was seen in both        crude analyses of annual total absence and in an analysis        of shortterm absences This association between        ventilation and absences occurred at ventilation levels        that have not often been associated with nonspecific        symptoms or with building related complaints            Because of this the authors speculated that the observed        association between indoor carbon dioxide CO           levels and sick leave might have        been due to the increased spread of respiratory illness        from either airborne spread of infection or increased        susceptibility            To determine whether a causal association could be        confirmed we conducted an experimental intervention study        of indoor CO          levels used as a surrogate for the        concentration of viable airborne microorganisms capable of        causing a respiratory infection and sick leave among hourly        office workers at Polaroid Corporation                    Methods                  Study design          We conducted a blinded experimental intervention study          to determine the effect indoor CO            concentrations on sick leave          absences among hourly office workers in selected areas of          two office buildings To increase the range of CO            concentrations the outdoor air          supply dampers were adjusted to fixed positions that          alternately reduced or increased the outdoor air supply          We attempted to increase the outdoor air supply only          during periods in which the economizer function of the          heating ventilation and airconditioning HVAC units          would generally decrease the amount of outdoor air such          as during the heating and cooling seasons of summer and          winter In general we tried to obtain CO            concentrations in the range of           ppm above background levels during high          ventilation intervention cycles and  ppm above          background in low ventilation intervention cycles All CO                     concentrations were less than the          American Society of Heating Refrigerating and          AirConditioning Engineers ASHRAE guidelines Each          intervention cycle lasted approximately three months The          study design was reviewed and approved by the Harvard          School of Public Health Human Subjects Committee                          Office buildings and study population          The office buildings used for the study were owned and          occupied by Polaroid Corporation All were located in          suburban Boston Massachusetts were openplan offices          with cubicles and were mechanically ventilated without          humidification Building  was ventilated with a variable          air volume system while Building  had a constant air          volume system The variable air volume system in Building           was overridden during the study thereby effectively          running the system as a constant air volume system The          study buildings had a high outside air ventilation          capacity either by design or because they were remodeled          from manufacturing spaces Building  was studied from          November  to June  and Building  was studied          from November  to June  Two other buildings were          studied but eventually proved unsuitable Building  was          withdrawn because few of the occupants were hourly          workers and other means of acquiring accurate attendance          data proved to be inadequate Building was  dropped          because outdoor air supply rates could not be adequately          controlled To determine the number of occupants in the          buildings headcounts were taken either at  am or           pm on randomly selected days throughout the study          Table describes specific information regarding the study          buildings and study population                          Ventilation and CO measurements          To alter the levels of fresh air entering the          buildings the dampers on the air intakes were locked          into fixed positions at each cycle of the intervention          To determine the air changes per hour in the buildings          we conducted tracer gas tests periodically Sulfur          hexafluoride SF             was used to generate a tracer gas          decay curve We injected SF            into the fresh air plenum followed          by measurements in work areas and in the main return air          duct with photoacoustic gas monitors Bruel  Kjaer          Naerum Denmark with a SF            filter Model           Carbon dioxide concentrations in the study areas were          measured once every  min with Vaisala monitors model          GMD Woburn Massachusetts attached to data loggers          HOBO H Onset Computer Corp Bourne MA We          calibrated each monitor with three known CO            concentrations covering the range of           ppm at least once per intervention cycle We          placed at least two centrally located monitors in each          study area approximately   m above the floor In          addition we located monitors out of doors on the roofs          of study buildings          Our primary exposure measure was the CO            concentration above background in          each building This CO            differential is used as a marker for          the amount of air that has been previously breathed by          building occupants Rebreathed air potentially contains          respiratory pathogens from infectious occupants To          determine the differential we first averaged the workday           am to  pm CO            concentration and subtracted the          average CO            concentration  am   am          measured on the same date by the same monitor The  am            am concentration measured by the same monitor was          used rather than the outdoor CO            concentration because the CO            monitors tend to exhibit baseline          drift The average CO            differential for the day was          computed as the average across all monitors in the study          area We then averaged the daily CO            differentials to compute a weekly          average CO            concentration differential                          Bioaerosol and particulate sampling          We sampled for airborne endotoxin and particulate in          each building during each intervention cycle Samples          were collected on  mm diameter m pore diameter          polycarbonate membrane filters Whatman Nucleopore          Filtration Products Clifton New Jersey in closed face

     Pall Gelman Ann Arbor Michigan at  lmin Both          endotoxin and PM            samples were collected for three          consecutive days during working hours  am to  pm          from the breathing zone of seated building occupants in          the same location during each sampling period Sampling          took place over two weeks In addition we inspected each          building for possible bioaerosol sources prior to its          entry into the study and again periodically throughout          the study We conducted a thorough building walkthrough          looking at the building exterior and surroundings air          intakes HVAC system mechanical rooms occupied space          storage areas and any other areas which might contain          bioaerosol reservoirs Special attention was given to air          handling units and any other areas where excessive          moisture is likely to accumulate                          Attendance data          Hourly attendance and demographic data for the study          were collected using corporate databases The Information          Technology Department provided attendance data from the          payroll records for hourly employees Workers in the          hourly payroll system completed weekly time cards that          contained information on hours worked and time claimed          for various leave categories including sick time          vacation and personal leave Demographic data was          provided from the Human Resources Department          allemployees database Available demographic variables          included employee ID number seniority information          start termination retirement dates etc race          gender age disability and various job and departmental          classifications Final analytic data sets were produced          with one record per week per hourly employee with          demographic data appended to each record                          Data analysis          We analyzed the relationship between CO            exposure in the previous week and          absence in the current week using a generalized additive          mixed model    with a logit link A model employing          continuous exposure was chosen a priori over a simple          model categorizing intervention intervals as high and low          outdoor air supply because a continuous model with          appropriate lags does not require elimination of data          from washout periods at the start of each interval and          allows for differences between successive high or low          interventions The model used extends multiple logistic          regression with an estimated overdispersion parameter          in two ways     First it allows the relationship          between the covariates and input to the logit link to          follow a smooth not necessarily linear curve The          specific shape of the curve is modeled with a spline a          flexible model that essentially allows the data to          determine the shape of the relationship This feature of          the model is necessary in our study since there is a          markedly nonlinear relationship between CO            exposure and the logit of absence          probability The second way this model extends multiple          logistic regression is that it accounts for the          correlation within the repeated measures on individuals          using individual specific random effects     As          discussed in Ruppert           et al    we estimate the          parameters in this model using the pseudolikelihood          method implemented by the SAS macro GLIMMIX                                Results        A total of  hourly workers whose characteristics are        shown in Table  worked in the two buildings and were        included in the final analysis Although each study area        had both salaried and hourly employees only hourly        employees were considered in the data analysis because of        the accuracy of records of their attendance data and        because they spend the majority of their work hours in        their assigned offices The hourly workforce was very        transient which accounts for the large number of study        subjects compared to the average number of occupants in the        buildings The majority of the study subjects did not        reside in the study buildings for the entire study period        The study included a total of approximately  scheduled        workdays and a total of  hours of sick leave        The CO          data over the course of the study is        summarized in Table  Outdoor CO          measurements confirmed that the indoor        CO          concentrations returned to outdoor        background concentrations each evening The average weekly        outdoor CO          concentration for Building  was         ppm Range  ppm and  ppm Range  ppm        for Building  Figure displays the weekly CO          concentration differential and the        weekly sick leave rates for the two buildings included in        the final analysis Data gaps in Figure represent time        periods when CO          data was unavailable or HVAC dampers        were being reset        The average CO          differential air exchange rate and        sick leave rates for each intervention cycle are displayed        in Table  The CO          differential is well correlated with        the outdoor ventilation rates indicating that CO          differential is an adequate surrogate        of outdoor ventilation rates We were unable to achieve the        desired CO          differentials of  ppm during        low ventilation periods Although we attempted to alter the        CO          concentrations by locking the outdoor        air dampers to fixed positions in some cases the dampers        did not remain in position This resulted in less control        over the air supply rates than we had hoped Additionally        during December  the chiller unit in Building  was        turned off and as a result the outdoor dampers were set        to open automatically when the outdoor temperature was over        C The loss of control over the damper settings resulted        in uncontrolled rates of outdoor air supply in Building         after December  The measured air exchange rates Table         support this conclusion During the first two high        ventilation cycles in Building  the air exchange rates        were measured at above  per hour while during the first        low ventilation cycle the outdoor air supply was measured        at less than  air change per hour ACH After the dampers        were adjusted in December  the ACH and CO          differentials were uncorrelated with        the desired intervention throughout the remainder of the        study Although we were able to manipulate the HVAC system        in Building  it appears that we were never able to alter        the CO          concentrations in the building        To determine if the number of occupants was driving the        levels of CO          in the buildings random headcounts        were taken throughout the study to approximate the total        population of the buildings The number of occupants was        weakly correlated with the average CO          differential from same day in each        building Building  r   Building  r   Air        sampling for endotoxin and PM          was conducted on four occasions in        Building  and once in Building  Table  the levels        were well below those thought to be associated with        symptoms Samples were collected only once in Building         because we were unable to alter the CO          concentrations and therefore we        considered the entire time period that Building  was under        study as one cycle        Generalized additive mixed models with logit links were        fit for the individual buildings We modeled the        probability of an occupant having any absences during a        week dependent on the CO          differential from the previous week        oneweek lag Models with no lag and twoweek lags were        also fit CO          differential was modeled as a        continuous predictor because merely comparing the        intervention periods would not have allowed for differences        between intervals assigned to the high ventilation        condition and similarly each low ventilation interval        Poisson models were also constructed with days of absence        during the week as the dependent variable The Poisson        models gave fits similar to those obtained from the        logistic models Final models contained covariates for        gender race age and individual random effects which        allow for correlation of absence rates within individuals        Table  A smooth term for time was included to control        for unexplained trends in absence and the seasonality of        absence When the smooth term for time was not included        the shape of the curves did not change considerably        although the pointwise standard errors around the estimated        curve increased substantially Age which was modeled as a        continuous variable was not significant in the models        while gender was significant in the Building  model and        race was significant in the Building  model        We did not observe a consistent association between CO          differential and absence at the levels        of CO          under study Figure  In general        portions of the fitted smooth curves are significantly        different from zero if the curve and the confidence        interval curves are all above or below zero When data from        the two buildings were combined no association was        observed between CO          concentrations above background and        sick leave                    Discussion        In this intervention study of sick leave absences among        hourly employees at Polaroid Corporation offices in        suburban Boston Massachusetts we did not find a        consistent positive relationship between indoor CO          concentrations and sick leave This        result is in contrast to the results of our earlier        observational study at Polaroid which found a significant        association of outdoor air supply rates and sick leave            In the earlier study we used a larger number of work        areas  including areas with lower ventilation and        higher CO          concentrations than were available for        this intervention study However the previous study relied        on a small number of CO          measurements and primarily used expert        judgment of an industrial hygienist blinded to absence        rates to assign outdoor air supply rates to buildings        Thus the intervention study was undertaken to confirm and        extend the earlier findings        In the earlier study estimated outdoor air supply rates        ranged from  liters per second ls per person In        the current study we can calculate the outdoor air supply        rates if we assume a steady state CO          concentration in the study buildings        although this assumption is questionable Using the steady        state equation relating CO          levels and outdoor air supply rates        we calculate outdoor air supply rates that are nearly        double that of the previous study with the average daily        outdoor supply rate of approximately  ls per person for        Building  and approximately  ls per person for Building         as estimated from average CO          concentrations We attempted to        control indoor CO          concentrations by adjusting the supply        of outside air supply but the buildings available for the        intervention study had an excess of ventilation capacity        relative to the volume of office space and number of office        workers While these characteristics were advantageous for        obtaining low CO          concentrations relative to background        it was difficult to increase the concentrations of CO          substantially above background ASHRAE        standards allow for up to  ppm CO          above background in office buildings            while the maximum CO          concentration above background in our        buildings was  ppm the average was less than half        that        This study showed that at high outdoor air supply rates        sufficient to give weekly average indoor CO          concentrations in the range of  to         ppm above background sick leave is not associated with        outdoor air supply rates However this study does not        address the question of whether outdoor air supply rates        resulting in CO          concentrations between  and  ppm        above background can be experimentally shown to drive        changes in sick leave rates as suggested by observational        data While this result is of interest to large highly        ventilated corporate offices it cannot be extrapolated to        buildings with lower rates of outdoor air supply                    Abbreviations        ACH Air changes per hour        ASHRAE American Society of Heating Refrigeration and        AirConditioning
