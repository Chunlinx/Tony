              well you go first you called   okay uh lets see um well im about forty years old so i was um right at draft age back back when uh when that was all going on   right right   and uh so that pretty it very much affected me as you know as far as being very impressionable right at that time um i i didnt think i was kind of kind of a caught up in the in the hippie movement back then and i didnt think it was uh worthwhile or or right then and im not any im not like you know im not a not that way anymore but i still dont think it was uh   yes   uh i still have a lot of questions about why we were there and and uh the way it was conducted and all kinds of things     right   yeah how about yourself   well im im ill be forty two in February in fact my husband was in the first lottery you know he he was in the first   so you   first lottery and uh he got a high draft number thank goodness so he didnt have to go but i never was for it either i um   uhhuh umhum   i dont know i just felt it was a real political thing that i dont really think ever got us anywhere you know i dont i dont feel that we   yeah   that we accomplished much i think maybe i i dont know i i want to say well maybe if wed gone into really win it but then i i im much more of dove than that so i dont know that i would have even liked that i just felt that it it drug on so long and   yeah     at such tremendous cost um and i think it was hard for people to keep up good morale in a situation like that i mean i i cant imagine what it was like for the men fighting over there i think that must have been a really hard thing to um   yeah   you know to to keep their morale up uh when they knew that we werent really trying to win and and all of that so i never was really for it i mean uh   yeah yeah umhum well i was in the uh last lottery   oh you were   yep and i was i came out number two hundred and fifty one   oh   and i had been and they and uh they only took up two hundred that year   uhhuh   and i had been uh in in ROTC too uh so i would at least have a choice about what i was going to do   uhhuh   and when i came up two hundred and fifty one i went thats it  i dropped out of ROTC and and uh   yeah yeah   uh yeah i i dont uh i guess uh i i kind of do the same thing i kind of think well you know i mean if if at least if we had werent going all out to win it maybe it would have been worth something but then again i i uh probably too much of a dub my self to really   well right i i dont necessarily like that philosophy but i think i would have liked that better than what we did   yeah what we did yeah because all we had is uh what ten thirteen years and fifty six thousand people and and and we uh i dont know that we did we accomplish anything at all   exactly i i i dont think so i mean uh   i mean the communists got it anyway   and and its still such a mess in that part of the country today you know its not like you know i think if things had been resolved and that was in a better situation but i dont think thats true   and uh yeah yeah   so uh you know im not sure that we really accomplished much of anything   yeah   so i dont know and and i still think were paying for that i think that there are you know a lot of the men just suffered so terribly in that situation um   umhum   so i i dont know i im glad i never i didnt have anybody well i had one person close to me that went but thats all i didnt know a lot of people that went did you did you   yeah i didnt know anyone that that i can recall that went that which is uh now ive met some ive met some after the fact you know people that i worked with and stuff that had been several actually that i worked with that had been but i didnt know i no one that i grew up with   well i had one person and he was in the infantry and he was little and what he did was he went into the tunnels   uh no youre kidding   no and he came back he he lived through it which is just amazing and he would not talk um talk about it much at all   huh yeah   he he just would not discuss it um he did tell us one time about seeing someone a a a kid about his age you know he was probably twenty i think and he came up upon a a Vietnamese and they both had their guns on each other and they just looked at each other and put their guns down and walked away   hm very sensible   i i thought so too and uh   yeah what what part of the country were you in when all that was going on   im from Phoenix Arizona   okay   so i was in Phoenix where were you   i was in uh im from New York but i was in uh uh Fort Worth   oh you came out here to go to school   yeah so i was kind of in and i was you know there were there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus i went to TCU and there were there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus and we we were   yeah yeah   we were very much minority  so it was kind of it wasnt like being up in uh Kent State with uh with uh ten thousand protestors that were that were   oh well i was in Arizona State and i can remember um coming out i had gone into a restaurant to eat and coming out and there were about oh i dont know how many thousands of students coming down the the street they had completely cordoned off the street and you know there was lots of protesting going on there at the time so i   umhum
