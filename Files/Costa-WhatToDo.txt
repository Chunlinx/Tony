largest and the town also has a coinandstamp and small animal market on the same dayWhere to ShopThe larger cities offer lower prices and a better selection of goods than resorts like Torremolinos or Fuengirola The El Corte Ingls department store in Mlaga Sevilla and other places is also well worth looking forFor more sophisticated shopping nothing can compare with Marbella or Puerto Bans where dozens of attractive harborfront boutiques offer a stunning selection of merchandise at equally stunning pricesYou can make a considerable saving on luxury goods like jewelry watches perfumes and Havana cigars in dutyfree Gibraltar where the dreaded VAT does not existCeuta the Spanish protectorate on the North African coast has special tax status and alcohol for example is vastly cheaper there than mainland Spain The same applies to electrical goods etc but these will not seem like much of a bargain for AmericansWhat to BuyTraditional Spanish handicrafts are high on any souvenirhunters shopping listCeramics Everyday glazed terracotta pottery can be bought all along the coast Theres also a wide selection of tiles azulejos vases bowls and jugs with floral or geometric decorations in bright colorsFoodstuffs Take home a taste of Spain with some olives olive oil almonds cheese or mouthwatering candies and cookiesJewelry Silver rings bracelets and necklaces in modern designs make good buys as do the artificial Majorica pearls of Spain Look too for fine filigree jewelry from Crdoba and smooth polished olive wood beadsLeather and Suede Choose from a wide selection of handbags belts wallets trousers skirts and coats Leather goods while no longer the bargain they once were compare favorably in price with Italian and French made articles and the local factories do turn out stylish highquality leather clothing Crdoba which has been producing leather goods since Roman times is famous for its embossed leatherBeware though many of the leather goods you will see have been imported from Morocco and are sold at vastly inflated prices Its actually cheaper and much more interesting to take a day trip to Tangier and buy such goods thereSouvenirs Often delightfully tacky from plastic castanets and flamenco dolls to imitation wineskins and even bullfight posters printed with your own nameWine and Spirits Sweet Mlaga wine sherry brandy and Spanish wines provide some of the best bargains in Spain and are generally cheaper when bought in a supermarket than at the last minute at the dutyfree shop in the airportEntertainmentTour operators offer any number of excursions some more esoteric than others with brochures and booking facilities available through your hotel or a local travel agent Another form of organized entertainment amusement parks are discussed below in the section for families with young childrenBullfights Andaluca is famed for its bullfighting traditions and has two Sevilla and Crdoba of the seven firstclass Plaza de Toros bullrings in Spain The provincial capitals of Almera Granada Huelva Jan and Mlaga as well as Algeciras and El Puerto de Santa Mara are secondclass rings All others including those of the resort towns along the Costa del Sol come into the third class category The two main events are a Corrida de Toros where fully qualified matadors fight fullygrownat least  year oldtoros bulls and Novilladas where novilleros novice matadors fight novillos immature bullsAs a rule of thumb the better events are held in the better plazas particularly during the feras holiday fairs held in the major cities Equally true is the fact that most of the events held in the resort towns are mainly for the benefit of tourists and are of lesser quality They are not generally less expensive though small rings mean fewer seats which often equates to higher prices Contrary to popular opinion bullfights are not held every Sunday in each city In fact outside of the feraswhen they are held dailyonly Sevilla has them on a regular basis throughout the season In other places with the exception of Easter Sunday and August important national holidaysthey are held sporadically and advertised by way of the ubiquitous carteles posters stuck on every wall Be warned though these events are never less than bloodyand can be much worse They are however enthralling spectacles and whatever your reaction youll gain a valuable insight into the country and the peopleFlamenco All the coastal resorts offer flamenco shows for tourists These shows can be entertaining but the performances are more show business than the true spirit of flamenco To experience flamenco at its most authentic you will have to search out bars and small clubs in Mlaga or Sevilla Ask the local tourist office for advice on where to goFlamenco is an ancient art form combining elements of Visigothic Moorish and gypsy music There are two distinct types the cante jondo deep song an intense outpouring of emotion and the animated cante chico light song There are also different varieties of flamenco dance the tango fandango farruca and zambra performed to the staccato rhythms and counterrhythms of the castanets hand clapping palmadas and finger snapping pitos as well as furious heeldrumming zapateado There is no need to speak Spanish to enjoy the spectacleyou simply have to feel the musicDiscotheques and Nightclubs Some discos open as early as pm but most dont gear up for business until pm or midnight They close late too around am or even later Nightclubs salas de fiesta usually stage two shows an evening one at about midnight or am and the other

much sun Take along plenty of highfactor sunscreen and sun hats and make sure theyre covered up during the middle of the day a siesta during the hottest part of the day may be a good idea to avoid sunburn
