                hi Pat   hi one of the interesting things that i have considered about the role change for women is that women of my age my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the Leave It to Beaver housewives but we are not living in that world   uhhuh uhhuh we are certainly not our families have changed   uhhuh families uhhuh oh yeah sure   society has changed everything has changed yeah yeah   uhhuh thats one of the and it makes you really concerned i am glad i raised guys you know let the world train them what to do   uhhuh     but characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home   uhhuh   and i really would be at a loss to to raise and train a girl i think i would   yeah its well even even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to you know used to be they would just go off to work and come home and you know everything was done and it its a different world   oh sure uhhuh uhhuh   its some good some bad uh   oh sure uhhuh   its nice that theres a choice i i have chosen to stay at home and raise my children and i have a ten year old and a twelve year old   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and i was a single parent for awhile and worked   uhhuh   and that was great i was able to and i was able to provide for my children and and you know that was wonderful   uhhuh uhhuh   but i um i thank God everyday now that i have that choice and that i am able to do things at home and and uh i volunteer a whole lot   sure uhhuh   and uh thats my job right now and i i love it i really love it   uhhuh oh yeah i did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said mom please do not be involved   right right   then i went back to work   right and that will come i know that day will come and i am looking forward to that too but thats a different phase in my life and i am i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now   yeah sure right right well you know theres a lot of things that have happened actually and and its its its like the its like oil on top of water it changes but its never different in a lot of ways   uhhuh uhhuh   uh women at one time did very heavy physical labor   uhhuh   and were expected to maintain a household   uhhuh   then as times changed uh as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor even in house even in housekeeping and homemaking theres not a lot of physical labor because there are   uhhuh right right right you are not beating rugs you are not right doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing   uhhuh right and in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion or we really do develop some health problems   uhhuh uhhuh   so in in that in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit   yeah yeah   and uh   but dont you think its that way with men too i mean you know men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more   oh absolutely true its thats true with society in general   than they used to yeah yeah   but specifically the womans role in society has changed and you know medical medical reports tell us that women are developing   uhhuh   diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases heart disease was characteristic of men now theres almost equally predominant in women   right right right right   and i   and stress disorders and things like that uhhuh uhhuh   uhhuh uhhuh right and i think that thats a thats a symptom of our society its a symptom that theres theres a general illness that needs to be healed   uhhuh   i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem i am not i am not God   yeah yeah   but i i do know that in raising my boys i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons you need to get them into sports you need to get them into this they need to be busy and they need to be active   uhhuh uhhuh   and i fought all of those things i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me and they will say mom this is important to me i want to do it otherwise i will guard  their ability to have quiet time   right right you know its funny   i refused to cram their lives full and thats the way it is with a woman too   yeah yeah its funny its funny i was really i was really looking forward to summer thinking oh we are going to have some time off and its been real busy and actually today is really the first as far as i am concerned the first day of summer   uhhuh uhhuh   because we have had so much going on the past few weeks   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh you are right uh well thats how society has changed uh you know uh   uhhuh uhhuh   the family has changed we you know we find ourselves doing things that we never did as kids   uhhuh uhhuh well   you know i do not remember being involved in things like this its its different its just   uhhuh uhhuh   its just i do not know only time will tell whether its better or worse than the way we grew up but uh its its just very different um   uhhuh of course uhhuh well i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time if you do not have the time to talk to yourself who are you going to talk to right   yeah yeah yeah   and i guarded my childrens rights for that and i think that thats one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do   uhhuh   they are sacrificing their time with themselves theres nothing wrong with sitting and being bored if you thinking internally and you are working on your own self you are finding out who you are     right right r ight but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and get homework done and you know where do you find the time   well i think um well in the first place its not your homework its your childrens homework   uhhuh   and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help i helped them with exactly what they asked for and thats all   uhhuh yeah   thats a part of the problem that women have always had and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other peoples responsibilities   thats very true and then that way we have not changed in hundreds of years have we yeah   they they thats right that way husbands are crippled   yeah   they are intellectual cripples and so are children they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   for themselves i do not know why God made women brilliant  i   didnt he though   yes but i do not know they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems they are all things to all people and thats never changed   thats very true thats thats very true i as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday who said she has a new policy in her home and when her her family comes to her and says fix this you know i am having a problem with you know another member of the family she said i have taken a new stance and i say no i will not you know you work it out for yourself   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and she said its amazing she said you know every single person in this family expects me to get and they drain suck me into these arguments and these conversations and i have i am supposed to be   uhhuh thats right   the one who is going to fix it all and and soothe everybody and she said i am not doing it anymore i i just   uhhuh you know i think thats one of the things that we have today that is very useful and i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it and that is mediation training   um uhhuh   uh we are not talking about strikes or things we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises parents and children husbands and wives uh you know boss and employee those kinds of things   uhhuh uhhuh   interpersonal mediation because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who   yeah yeah
