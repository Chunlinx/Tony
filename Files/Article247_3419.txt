                                 Why Isnt There a Soccer Network                        One of the more perplexingactually Ill say its the mostperplexingfacts about television today is that there is essentially nowhereother than payperview where you can watch international soccer such as theEuropean or FA Cups let alone regularseason matches from Englands PremierLeague or Italys Serie A            This depressing fact has already prompted a welcome cri de coeur from                  Slate                contributor Michael Hirschorn in the newest BrillsContent  where he points out how odd it is that in the wasteland that isthe upper reaches of the cable box theres no room for true internationalstars like David Beckham Ronaldo or Davor Suker But the paradoxicalsituation is that something that is incredibly valuable abroadRupert Murdochyou might remember was willing to shell out  billion to acquire theManchester United franchiseis thought to have little or no value in theUnited States And while we might well ask ESPN Wouldnt it make more senseto show three great international matches a week instead of six hours ofSportsCenter reruns it costs ESPN nothing to run theSportsCenter reruns while buying the rights to internationalmatcheswhich are in any case mostly controlled by Murdochwouldntnecessarily come cheap            The key words here though are thought to have little or no valueDespite the ascendance of soccer moms into American political iconographydespite the fact that a generation of kids has now grown up playing soccer anddespite the success of successive World Cups men and women here in  andin  the essential operating assumption of television programmers for allthe major networksbroadcast and cableis that no real audience forinternational soccer exists But more and more this seems to be a clear casewhere one of the reasons that audience has failed to materialize is because theopportunity for it to materialize has never existed            Its not after all as if the networks had given international soccer theold college try found that it failed and then abandoned its plans On thecontrary if you want to watch international soccer you usually have to pay or  for payperview which no matter how much you love soccer is alot of money And even then the publicity for the games is essentiallynonexistent A few weeks ago two of the best European teams played a match inthe Meadowlands which is a halfhour away from where I live I didnt hearabout it until the day after the match was played            Whats odd about this is that in certain respects soccer seems to be anatural Not to replace football or baseball but maybe to replace womensboxing on ESPN There are more people of Latin American descent in the UnitedStates than ever before who you would think might be interested in watchingRonaldo play for Inter Milan More than that millions of kids play the gamewhich presumably must make them curious about the people who play it betterthan anyone else            And then theres this interesting fact which was actually noted in afrontpage article in the business section of todays New York Times The most popular video game made by Electronic Arts the largest videogamemaker in the world is FIFA  a soccer game featuring all the greatinternational teams Is it really plausible that theres a huge market for aninternational soccer video game and no market at all for international socceron television As it happens Im a devoted fan of FIFA  and its sistergame World Cup  And everyone Ive met who plays these games cares aboutinternational soccer and would be ecstatic were some network to take a flyerand show some of these games            In theory if an opportunity to make money by showing international soccerexists someone would have already taken advantage of it But its almostcertainly true that none of the executives in charge of programming grew upplaying or watching soccer which is why you always hear the same criticisms ofthe gametoo slow too boring not enough scoring At the same time thecontinuing woes of the MLSthe American soccer leaguehave made it seem as ifthere is no American audience for the game But although the MLS is much betterthan it was its still vastly inferior to the European game so the popularityof one is a poor measure of the potential popularity of the other            The point isnt that soccer will ever become a huge cash cow for an Americannetwork But it has all the makings of a perfect niche market The problem isthat until someone gives that market a real chance to show itself we cantprove it exists Until then Electronic Arts will keep raking in the profits ofwhich some television network might otherwise claim a nice share
