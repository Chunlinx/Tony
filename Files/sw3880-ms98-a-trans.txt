        tell me whats the last movie you saw     the last movie i saw in a theater was Hook   Hook   and uh it was very enjoyable um im trying to think theres a lot of movies i want to see   oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around Christmas but we were kind of busy and didnt really get out to see any of them   but it but what the last one you saw   uh the last one i went to the theater to see was uh The Doctors   hum   and i thought that was real good but i rent movies all the time   yeah we do too   yeah the last that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw Dying Young over the weekend   is that good thats with um im trying to think whos in that   and last week uh whats her name Julia Roberts   oh okay okay   and uh it was just really good i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying   yeah   but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it   um we want to go see JFK   yeah trying to   i mean i have heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to   i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too   and uh   it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater   yeah it is and Plano has grown so much that um you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and its just not that way any more   yeah   so we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw well no i take that back it wasnt rented i think it was just on HBO at my inlaws house or something but it was Hunt for Red October   oh yeah i   and i love that movie   yeah i went uh i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too   yeah oh that wouldve been a good one that wouldve been a good one to see   yeah   yeah but renting them just doesnt do them justice sometimes   sometimes youre right it doesnt uh but it beats watching what ever is on television   yeah thats true i mean i think like uh Dances with Wolves just you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen   yeah we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that weve been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies   oh really     so we did that and   all of them did you   it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff   oh wow in one night   no it took us about three days but   okay i was going to say thats a long movie   yeah well it was still lots im telling you when that that the last hour you know uh number three we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop   how many are there   theres three   three okay   yeah its almost something around fourteen hours   well thats not as bad as as uh Friday the th or Planet of the Apes  or     uh but my i think my favorite though are old movies black and white   yeah   uh i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that its just i dont know theres just something about them i think it reminds me of my childhood   really   not  i just remember when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and thats what was on   umhum umhum   so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so   we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the um Alfred Hitchcock the you know like North by Northwest and Rear Window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and   yeah i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just i thing about her and different movies shed been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies   yeah oh yeah   they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater   hum   and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere ill want to watch it so   umhum yeah oh theyre those are some movies and they come on uh every now and then are you still there   yeah i am still here yes   okay it got real quiet i didnt know   yeah i was just kind of   there was no static or anything i thought no   i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking someone went by there i   i thought id lost you so you are headed up to Tennessee   yeah uh to Tennessee its my mothers eighty fifth birthday   where about   uh Kingsport   oh okay thats right yeah um i work for TI and i have traveled to Johnson City before and i   you know where that is oh yeah are they still there   um most of it was sold off to Simons but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are TI   yeah yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at Univac and uh just down the road and boy all the everybody just   oh
