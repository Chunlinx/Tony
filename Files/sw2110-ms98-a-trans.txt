       okay    well go ahead ill let you start   uh i was thinking about whether or not we should have people uh be required to do service public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family   uhhuh   or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to i mean you cant make it everybody   right yeah   but then you need to make it sure that the rich people cant buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their place or or get out of it some other way        too   umhum or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they take you you get a physical anyway so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical and if theres nothing physically wrong with you then youre drafted it doesnt matter how rich you are   and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right   that would be good whatd you say   give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass   oh yeah      uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money   uh uhhuh   and uh if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they could could subsist   thats true umhum well thats true the Americas paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time   yeah   because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually thats thats really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that so youre really learning a skill   yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what could we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country im just teasing   whatd you say umhum              yeah i i think well thats probably the idea i dont know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country   well i thought itd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too        a trade off   yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program uhhuh   yeah and other than that i cant think of any other ideas   yeah thatd be sort of neat yeah well i like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare course thats what um thats sort of like what Truman had or or was it Roosevelt i cant remember um with the big   oh with WPA   yeah   yeah   uhhuh getting people or the work the work program and all the all the make work jobs that was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building   and were still using those things too   whatd you say   were still using those things   yeah thats true a lot of them still out there like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why      they built lodges before too like at Caddo Lake   lake what   Caddo Lake   Caddo Lake   its between Texas and Louisiana   no never heard of it   it crosses into both of them well its real pretty its like a swamp you know with all the Spanish moss on the trees its really its eerie  yeah   oh    oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah yeah oh okay yeah i been uh i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh a Texan but i guess thats uh thats what were going to have this is uh a TI experiment to see how talk Texans talk to other people   i dont know where are you from   uh Virginia   Virginia oh thats neat i talked to somebody from Ohio the other night   oh yeah it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people uh how people react to things and stuff especially when it comes to um social services uh im im im glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services because   umhum   like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didnt even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh itd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service   there is somebody and i read uh i cant remember who it is but theres a really famous        of dang i cant remember his name yeah  that proposed it i read something in People about it huh Mitch Snider i dont know who Mitch Snider is   politician is pushing it or uh or Mitch Snider or Mitch Snider oh okay well see thats a DC thing Mitch Snider is the the advocate for the homeless that uh he he said said said it out here in Washington uh Washington but he started the um uh  the movement for creative nonviolence   yeah   yeah he started that and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless but uh   so what have your other topics been   excuse uh the other topic was like i said uh  something about politicians i cant remember exactly what it was it was a real general statement   i had one that i hated it was what meal would you cook for uh a special dinner  i mean how far can you go with that one right and another one though that was good was uh   gee whiz yeah   what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years and what do you think has caused some of the social problems that have been its probably the best one   uhhuh  that would be neat id have to basically say my birth yeah   and we had to talk about air pollution too what do you thinks causing it and what should we do about it   umhum well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know of course Pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know  yeah   uhhuh right   cleaner ways of burning coal and people in the south would say dont burn coal you know   its because we dont have much coal   oh we have a lot of coal  but uh its uh its a dirty fuel thats for sure   in Virginia yeah well howd you get into this program      excuse me   howd you get into this program   how did i get into it oh im uh electrical enginee r uh here in Virginia      for TI   no   no   uh no they im in telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know   so does your company have something to do with TI   uh not really i mean no more than any other company you know we buy their parts just as much as anybody else but uh no no real association with TI other than being in the same industry   hum umhum   electronics industry    they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they does do business with saying that you know if youre interested were doing a study and and since   and do you know how much how long this is supposed to go on   i dont know no i dont   thats i dont either i mean it says just keep on until and theyll notify you at first i was thinking it was just a week because thats all it shows        you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week   umhum right   so what do you think were going to get   what  what do you think what   what do you think were going to get for this      get   yeah money prizes   oh i dont know   do you know anybody thats ever done this   get your own yeah get your own T I seven four L S thirty two or something what was it      i know TI gets prizes   a little chip oh yeah i didnt hear about that probably for TI employees yeah   and i was led to believe that if you werent TI that you get money im not TI   oh oh youre not you dont work for Texas Instruments oh okay   huhuh lets see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing   oh oh   and i just signed up for it   oh thats a neat idea uhhuh   yeah   yeah well hes gotten a good mix i i was saying because ive like i said i heard some other people talking theyve talked to different people in different states and stuff   uhhuh   thats good especially since you call that one eight hundred number so so probably knock TIs profits margin way down   and it shouldnt be too good right now anyway because theyve been laying off so many people   yeah right this is probably some government study program   yeah really  so were footing the bill on our taxes   okay okay well i enjoyed talking with you   okay well thanks a bunch well talk to you later bye   i got to save my two year old from a pile of grapes shes diving into   well im going to try to please clean up the house after my two children for about an hour  see if we can walk around okay bye      okay well ill talk to you byebye
