        okay capital punishment oh i honestly dont feel like its strict enough in my opinion   in the way that its applied or that its applied at all   uhhuh applied at all   so i how do you feel that it should be applied   well i just i just feel like theres a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know   and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced   yes yes not getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years   yes thats i agree with that completely i know we dont have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people   there has thats right   because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and   uhhuh yeah yeah uhhuh   how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars   thats right thats honestly right   and its   they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know   well they certainly are living off our expense at our expense   but they sure are just because some innocent person can really it seems like really serve a rough time you know im not saying innocent person lets say someone wrote a hot check for instance   i didnt yes   you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like its a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh hes just there to serve his time and get back out on the street   umhum and and be paroled and and have served the sentence thats what thats what people face with that choice one thing i really hate is they dont explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in   yes   cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to you know theyll sentence them to ninety years and say that its you know that its going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life theyll give them ninety years in prison or something   uhhuh   and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less theyre out   uhhuh   even if if theyre even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something   time uhhuh yes i just i would just be i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole   yeah   you know   id like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent i think people know that nobody that it doesnt you know it its not a deterrent right now because its not really effective   uhhuh   theres  should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever this is whats going to happen   umhum yeah you get it back yeah yeah   and i mean it sounds horrible it i i hear myself saying this and but i dont know what else to do with some of these people that are because they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed   but its i i know yeah same thing yes yes uhhuh   and these guys just are on the endless merrygoround in the legal system   uhhuh   and its like i said at our expense   uh a lot of people really doesnt think that much about it because it hasnt happened to them which it hasnt to me either you know thank goodness but still it it could   yes i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody whos done this or that   yes   something really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens   uhhuh and as far as the other states i honestly dont know what their capital punishment is you know i i havent kept up you know anything like that   yeah i think i think Texas is what Texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know California had it for a long time and then they um took it off the books they repealed it   uhhuh   and people like Charles Manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison       and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like Manson whos come up     umhum   you know its been denied fortunately but   but yes but still it came up though didnt it i mean you know   yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death   uhhuh   and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California reverked revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didnt go back you know   uhhuh   it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isnt protecting the rest of the people   yes the victim is really seems like left out in the cold more or less doesnt it in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness   umhum yeah and the the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior  criminal history you know where hes raped ten women   uhhuh   and then he gets up for this one trial and they dont find anything out about the facts that hes done this over and over and over again   uhhuh   and so they say well this is you know i i dont know if they say its the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking hes not a habitual criminal   or you know plead insanity   yeah well   you know  and a lots of things   to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too   oh yes i think yeah uhhuh   they plead insanity and then three years later theyre cured and let loose on society again   yes i it just just doesnt make sense i just   i mean its a its a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out i know in in the Dallas metroplex area i dont go out hardly if i dont have to at night by myself   uhhuh   and i i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in Texas and it wasnt that way when i was younger   uhhuh well like i said i live in a small place you know   we could go around and boy   but uh even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid but now im raising children it just it really is   yes ever you cant even when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time and now i dont let my kids out of the front yard that i cant see them   uhhuh see them yep yeah  it really is well were probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon but ive enjoyed talking to you   umhum well good talking to you too bye bye   bye okay byebye
