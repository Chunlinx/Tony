                                 Alice in Watergate            Washington like I supposethe rest of the country is alive with echoes of Watergate these daysforobvious reasons How do President Clintons offenses compare with PresidentNixons What light does the Nixon case throw on the definition of high crimesand misdemeanors What precedent does Congress procedure in the Watergatecase establish for the procedure in the Lewinsky case            I do notpropose to add to the volume of punditry on such questions But I can add afootnote on the question of what it was like being an innocent in the WhiteHouse during the Watergate affair I use the word innocent of course tomean not just not guilty but also unaware or naive            Iwas chairman of Nixons Council of Economic Advisersduring the whole business I was at the Homestead in Hot Springs Va Sundaymorning June   when I read in the Washington Post  of thebreakin at the Watergate Office Building The previous evening I had given aspeech to the Virginia Bankers Association about the wonders of the economicsituation Only a little before that I had held a press conference announcingthat the economic statistics of the first quarter were the best in recordedhistoryor I cautiously added at least in the Christian era We seemed tobe on our way to an orderly dismantling of price and wage controls Nixonsreelection in November seemed assured the only question being whichDemocratic candidate would be defeated most decisively The Watergate breakindid not look like a cloud on our or my horizon            For thenext two years up almost to the last days I could see the cloud gettingdarker and darker but did not believe the Nixon presidency would come to apremature end For one thing I had my own experience with the extent of biasand animosity in the press against anything having to do with Nixon Duringmany years in Washington before I entered the Nixon administration I had hadfriendly relations with many reporters I was then associated with theCommittee for Economic Development the least conservative of the businessorganizations and we were the good guys to the liberal press But these samereporters became my enemies and I felt misrepresented me as soon as it becameapparent I was devoted to Nixon As it happened one of the presidents chiefpursuers in the press Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post  had beenmy neighbor in Silver Spring Md and a friend of my childrens He had been alikable boy but I put no great stock in his professionalism or objectivity SoI did not believe the press was giving an accurate account of what hadhappened            At  am each day I participated in a meetingof the White House staff presided over by the chief of stafffirst BobHaldeman and later Al Haig Almost every morning in  and  we weregiven a status report on the Watergate case the constant refrain of which wasthat everything was going to come out all right I dont believe anyone waslying to us But no one told usand perhaps didnt knowhow the legal andpolitical process was going to unfold            Still Idont underestimate the importance of my own unwillingness to believe Nixonhad honored me by making me member and then chairman of his Council of EconomicAdvisers He had treated me with respect and offered me his friendship I wasunwilling to believe that he had behaved in a way that a committee of Congresseven one composed mainly of his political enemies would consider deserving ofimpeachment            Ican think of only one economic policy decision that wasprobably influenced by the presidents concern with Watergate By the beginningof  after the election the wageprice control system began to comeunglued The world food supply had fallen because of bad weather in Russia andEl Nio in the Pacific food prices were rising beyond our control and withfood prices rising it was hard to restrain wages When I spoke with LeonardGarment then the presidents counsel he said the president was in trouble andasked whether we couldnt have some kind of economic spectacular to helpbolster his public support Perhaps because I didnt have enough imagination Ihad no comfort to give him            In Marchthe president suggested to me that we might have another wageprice freezelike the one we had imposed in August  that had been so popular I repliedsmartalecky that you cant step in the same river twice He came back withthe wittiest words I ever heard from him Yes you can if its frozen            That was not the end of the matter Theeconomic situation continued to deteriorate and as I now see so did thepolitical one Nixon brought back as counselor John Connally who in  and as secretary of the Treasury had been his specialist in longballeconomic policy The president wanted his economic team thus fortified toproduce a dramatic economic policy that would improve the nations economy andhis political standing A new wageprice freeze was one of the options to beconsidered But none of us not even Connally wanted that The presidentrepeatedly asked us to reconsider After several uncomfortable weeks hedecided without the benefit of his economists to impose the freeze anyway Itwas an immediate flop and did not last long Then we reverted to unspectaculareven painful economics            As I lookback at those days I am impressed by the way in which President Nixon continuedto perform his duties in what was surely a time of great stress for him Ofcourse I was not an intimate and I did not see him in his private momentsBut still I had many meetings with him and he showed no signs of distractionor impatience He would take notes on his yellow pad and sum up the sense ofour meetings in an orderly manner as he had always done            Near the end in July  I went out to San Clemente todraft what was to be although we didnt know it at the time Nixons lastaddress as president before his resignation message The speech was long and Ican now see rather platitudinous But Nixon read all the drafts He discussedthem with me and Roy Ash who was then the budget director and he deliveredthe final speech with vigor on July  in Los Angeles            It was on the plane flyingback to Washington that we got news of votes in the House committee that madeimpeachment extremely likely Two weeks later my wife my son and I were inthe East Room of the White House tears streaming down our cheeks as RichardNixon said farewell to his staff
