                                 Go Ahead            Every night thousands ofparents following standard childcare advice engage in a bloodcurdlingritual They put their severalmonthsold infant in a crib leave the room andstudiously ignore its crying The crying may go on for  or  minutes beforea parent is allowed to return The baby may then be patted but not picked upand the parent must quickly leave after which the crying typically resumesEventually sleep comes but the ritual recurs when the child awakes during thenight The same thing happens the next night except that the parent must waitfive minutes longer before the designated patting This goes on for a week twoweeks maybe even a month If all goes well the day finally arrives when thechild can fall asleep without fuss and go the whole night without being fedFor Mommy and Daddy its Miller time            This isknown as Ferberizing a child after Richard Ferber Americas bestknownexpert on infant sleep Many parents find his prescribed boot camp for babiesagonizing but they persist because theyve been assured its harmless Ferberdepicts the ritual as the childs natural progress toward nocturnalselfreliance What sounds to the untrained ear like a baby wailing indesperate protest of abandonment is described by Ferber as a child learningthe new associations            At this point I should own up to my bias My wife and I arefailed Ferberizers When our first daughter proved capable of crying for minutes without reloading we gave up and let her sleep in our bed When oursecond daughter showed up three years later we didnt even bother to set upthe crib She wasnt too vocal and seemed a better candidate for Ferberizationbut wed found we liked sleeping with a baby            How did wehave the hubris to defy the mainstream of current childcare wisdom Thatbrings me to my second bias hauntingly familiar to regular readersDarwinism For our species the natural nighttime arrangement is for kids tosleep alongside their mothers for the first few years At least thats thenorm in huntergatherer societies the closest things we have to a model of thesocial environment in which humans evolved Mothers nurse their children tosleep and then nurse on demand through the night Sounds taxing but its notWhen the baby cries the mother starts nursing reflexively often withoutreally waking up If she does reach consciousness she soon fades back to sleepwith the child And the father as I can personally attest never leavesZtown            So Ferberization I submit is unnatural Thatdoesnt necessarily mean its bad The technique may well be harmless thoughmaybe not as well see below I dont begrudge Ferber the right to preachFerberization or parents who prefer sleeping sans child the right to practiceit Live and let live Whats annoying is the refusal of Ferber and otherexperts to reciprocate my magnanimity They act as if parents like me arederelict as if children need to fall asleep in a room alone Even ifyou and your child seem happy about his sharing your bed at night writesFerber and even if he seems to sleep well there in the long run this habitwill probably not be good for either of you On television Ive seen a fathersheepishly admit to famous childcare guru T Berry Brazelton that he likessleeping with his toddler Youd think the poor man had committed             Whyexactly is it bad to sleep with your kids Learning to sleep alone saysFerber lets your child see himself as an independent individual Impuzzled It isnt obvious to me how a baby would develop a robust sense ofautonomy while being confined to a small cubicle with bars on the side andrendered powerless to influence its environment Nor is it obvious these dayswhen many kids spend  hours a week in day care that they need extra autonomytraining Id be willing to look at the evidence behind this claim but thereisnt any Comparing Ferberized with nonFerberized kids as they grow up wouldtell us nothingFerberizing and nonFerberizing parents no doubt tend to havebroadly different approaches to childrearing and they probably have differentcultural milieus We cant control our variables            Lacking data people like Ferber and Brazelton makecreative assertions about whats going on inside the childs head Ferber saysthat if you let a toddler sleep between you and your spouse in a senseseparating the two of you he may feel too powerful and become worried Wellhe may I guess Or he may just feel cozy Hard to say though they certainlylook cozy Brazelton tells us that when a child wakes up at night andyou refuse to retrieve her from the crib she wont like it but shellunderstand Oh            Accordingto Ferber the trouble with letting a child who fears sleeping alone into yourbed is that you are not really solving the problem There must be a reason whyhe is so fearful Yes there must Heres one candidate Maybe your childsbrain was designed by natural selection over millions of years during whichmothers slept with their babies Maybe back then if babies found themselvescompletely alone at night it often meant something horrific had happenedthemother had been eaten by a beast say Maybe the young brain is designed torespond to this situation by screaming frantically so that any relatives withinearshot will discover the child Maybe in short the reason that kids leftalone sound terrified is that kids left alone naturally get terrified Just atheory            Afew weeks of nightly terror presumably wontscar a child for life Humans are resilient by design If Ferbers gospelharms kids its more likely doing so via a second route the denial ofmothers milk to the child at night Breast milk researchers are finding is akind of external placenta loaded with hormones masterfully engineered toassist development One study found that it boosts IQ            Presumably most breastfeeding benefits can be delivered via daytime nursingStill we certainly dont know that an hour nightly gap in thefeeding schedule isnt doing harm And we do know that such a gap isnt part ofnatures plan for a fivemonthold childat least to judge by huntergatherersocieties Or to judge by the milk itself It is thin and waterytypical ofspecies that nurse frequently Or to judge by the mothers Failing to nurse atnight can lead to painful engorgement or even breast infection Meanwhile asall available evidence suggests that nighttime feeding is natural Ferberasserts the opposite If after three months of age your baby wakes at night andwants to be fed she is developing a sleep problem            Idont generally complain about oppressive patriarchalsocial structures but Ferberism is a good example of one As family bedboosters have noted male physicians who have no idea what motherhood is likehave cowed women for decades into doing unnatural and destructive things For awhile doctors said mothers shouldnt feed more than once every four hours Nowthey admit they were wrong For a while they pushed bottle feeding Now theyadmit this was wrong For a while they told pregnant women to keep weight gainsminimal and some women did so by smoking more cigarettes Wrong again Nowtheyre telling mothers to deny food to infants all night long once the kidsare a few months old            There are signs that yetanother welladvised retreat is underway Though Ferber hasnt put out thewhite flag Brazelton is sounding less and less dismissive of parents who sleepwith their kids Not surprisingly the least dismissive bigname childcareexpert is a woman Penelope Leach Better late than never But in child careas in the behavioral sciences generally we could have saved ourselves a lot oftime and trouble by recognizing at the outset that people are animals andpondering the implications of that fact
