                 well what do do you think in terms of uh benefits   well personally you know i think you know of course im sure were familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that uh weve probably got one of the best around you know besides they tend to offer adequate adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and uh one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so i dont know if you participate in that or not but   absolutely   isnt it great its just a its just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know   well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent   uhhuh uhhuh   and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that thats probably true for everyone   yeah   when i was much younger it was uh less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important   i had never really thought of it that way but i guess thats true i guess thats true im still young enough that that uh the vacations real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing but uh you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at TI the end of last month and uh kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know now that im a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and you know when youre when youre you know in your im only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but uh its i guess now is the time to think about it so does TI have a pretty good retirement package do you think   i think they have um a one that we need to recognize that were going to have to supplement ourselves and thats certainly one of the reasons that im sure that theyve begun the   yeah   uh CODA Plan its   uhhuh uhhuh   certainly a a supplemental way uh and i suppose if but maybe in in your instance if if youre started with TI in your early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until youre sixty five then youll have a very good retirement plan   right   but i had another career first and then came to TI a little later   uhhuh   so its not uh all by itself it wont be adequate for for my situation   something to build up quite enough yeah   so i have to find a way to supplement that   yeah well they just they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that were doing which is probably the worst investment in the world but ive got money coming out  to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check and its probably not a great investment but if i wasnt doing that the money wouldnt be being saved anyway you know i kind of have to trade off you know if you never see it you dont spend it so  and its   i understand understand though it uh believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i dont think its the worst investment in the world   yeah do you yeah do you really not i i  you know i i debate about whether its really good or not you know   well its in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you dont start looking for that word guaranteed until later   yeah yeah   uh its shown a history that uh sure beats anything else   yeah thats true thats very true   over many many years   we went uh and did a a thing through IBS which is a like a financial consultant  type thing here in Dallas and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that every all the things that you need to work on and you need to do and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our sons education we have a two year old you know and and you know we cant start saving for college when hes sixteen you know we have to do that now and and uh they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and hes two now in sixteen years when hes ready to go to college this is how much itll cost you know and its just really scary the thought of how much its going to its what it costs now is ridiculous what its going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fifteen between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have you know money for his college and thats exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that thats taken care of you know we we can worry about other things so   i understand that approach thats what thats exactly whats happening in my family   yeah yeah is it really yeah   except that mine are a little bit older and and ive shown them the numbers and said this is whats going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while youre there you better make sure that youve got a scholarship   uhhuh thats right thats right well thats what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college and       and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just cant do it you know so i dont know its its i dont uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just dont know how anybodys going to do it   i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them um i have a an eleven year old daughter now whos saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said thats wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that   oh goodness yeah yeah exactly exactly   and then her little brothers only two years behind and he says well i dont know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said thats great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that   thats right thats right       well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think theres i mean i think theres some negatives but theres going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have you know all this is the first really large company ive worked for ive always been involved in little small you know individual privately owned  owned firms and so ive never had the the big benefit package so i really dont know how to compare it to other big companies you know it when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so ive been real pleased   well thats fantastic and on whole on i would say that theyre   yeah   equal to uh most of our competitors   think so   uh i can see some some potential changes that probably are are would not cost very much but might uh make things a little easier such as offering a a smorgasbord   umhum   having a larger variety of benefits but heres the amount that that TI is going to pay for it now its up to you its menu selection so to speak   yeah    yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah right that sounds really good i read a thing i dont even remember if it was in the Da llas Site or the Inside one about uh companies allowing you and they said that TI was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea you know if youve been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but thats really not enough and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay im going to want an extra five days this year and theyll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know and theyre deducting it all along so you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know youre youre really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but its coming out a little bit a t a time instead of all at once you know so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so   well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime   umhum umhum   and i dont believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that   well true true   uh and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one   umhum   uh as as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day   yeah yeah yeah   but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate thats uh thats running in each department   umhum well and yeah and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesnt get it you know but thats and thats that way with a lot of things you know there it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what youre going to get and what youre not going to get so   well thats for sure   which is the same but but then its probably that way anywhere you know thats   oh im sure personalities always come into play uh just in this size of organization   umhum
