                                  Thinking Outside the Box Office            Except in Japan the world economic crisis seems tohave gone into at least temporary remission and those who have been obsessingabout the subject are turning their attention back to other matters In mycase that means making a big push on my introductory economicstextbookinprogress And so a little while ago I found myself redrafting thechapters on yes supply and demand            Now my textbook is alabor of love but it is also a commercial venture or at least I and mypublisher hope it is So the first draft was tested on a focus group peoplewho are successful teachers of introductory economics at the sort of schools wehope will adopt the book I learned a lot from the focus group Among otherthings I learned that what a middleaged college professor thinks of asdowntoearth examples of economics in action might not always sound quite sodown to earth to the ordinary college freshman and that I had to have moreexamples the clientele could relate towhich means in particularsports  One focus group member suggested that the market for scalpedsports tickets was a good example of supply and demand in action So I didsome background research and found some very interesting stuff But perhaps itis an indicator of my state of mind that what I saw during that research mademe think once again about             Ticket scalping is nothing new though it continues to posesomething of an economic puzzle The fact is that there are a number of publiceventsmost notably sports but also concerts plays museum shows etcforwhich tickets are consistently sold below the price that would limit demand tothe available supply Exactly why the owners of stadiums and theaters do thisis a matter of some dispute One theory due to Chicago economist Gary Beckeris that tickets are underpriced because those who sell them believe that it iscrucial to their image to have soldout houses Beyond this many stadium andtheater owners seem to believe that as an overall marketing strategy it isimportant that access to their most popular events be available to enthusiastsat moderate prices For example why doesnt George Lucas allow theaters tooffer special preview showings of The Phantom Menace at astronomicalgalactic prices when surely they could find tens or even hundreds ofthousands of people able and willing to pay Presumably because so blatant astatement that wealth hath its privileges would alienate the tens of millionsof nonwealthy moviegoers he counts on to turn the film into a megahit Whateverthe precise reasoning what is clear is that when it comes to big games and bigshows private sector entrepreneurs themselves often feel that it is a bad ideato let market forces rule            Enter the scalpers Ifthey can scalpers will buy up large numbers of tickets directly from the boxoffice and resell them at a profit If the box office refuses to sell in bulkthey will offer to buy spare tickets from people who have come by themlegitimately and perhaps hire people to stand in line Whats wrong with thatWell the people who run the box office are attempting to pursue socialgoalsalbeit in the ultimate name of profitwhich require that tickets go notonly to those who can afford to pay a lot but also to those who really care andare willing to book early andor stand in line If tickets sell out long inadvance not to enthusiasts but to speculators or if the long lines consist notof dedicated fans but of hired proxies this attempt to pursue a longtermagenda is defeated And so there is a running conflict between the longrunthinking represented by the box offices and the shortrun market forcesrepresented by scalpersa conflict that seems increasingly to be running inthe scalpers favor            Why does scalping seem ever harder to control One reasonis that because of the rising inequality of income and wealth there are morepeople out there able and willing to pay extraordinary sums This is above alltrue in New York where there are thousands of people who will not blanch atpaying  to see and be seen at a Knicks game But scalping is also on therise because of an interaction between technology and ideology            Its clear that technology has made scalping muchmore efficient than in the past Once upon a time it was a handson businessShady characters would hang around stadiums offering to buy tickets at apremium or to sell them at an even larger premium Those shady characters arestill there but you can also look up bigticket brokers on the Web call their numbers and comfortably conduct your transaction from home or office Thismakes it easy for the outoftown visitor to line up tickets for that specialevening or for the harddriving executive to impress his clients It also meansthat everyone who has bought a ticket at the box office knows that the truecost of going to the show is not the sum he actually paid but the much largersum he could make by reselling that ticket            Still the technologywould not be as effective as it is were it not for a favorable ideologicalclimate While there are antiscalping laws in many placessuch as New YorkCitythere are also a growing number of places such as New Jersey thatbelieve in letting the market rip and therefore allow tickets to be freelyresold at any price And given modern communications technology New Yorkersneed not physically visit New Jersey to do an end run around the localregulations            And so the pressure on box offices steadily intensifiesBox offices do fight back A couple years ago Madison Square Gardendiscovering that many of its season ticket holders were reselling them tobrokers revoked thousands of tickets in a stroke And the people spendingweeks in line to see The Phantom Menace are as far as anyone knowsgenuine fanatics rather than hirelings Still it is hard to escape the feelingthat these are rearguard actions We seem to be heading for a future in whichthe crowd at a Knicks game will consist mainly of businessmen on expenseaccountsand so the management of Madison Square Garden fears a longertermfuture in which serious Knicks fans finding that they cant afford ticketslose interest and therefore so do the businessmen Shortrun market pressuresmay eventually leave everyone worse off and yet they seem to be getting harderand harder to defywhich brings me to global finance            To my mind at least there is a sort of familyresemblance between the phenomenon of ticket scalping and the problem ofhotmoney flows in the world economy In both cases there is some efficiencycase to be made in their favor Ticket scalping does allow some people whobadly want to see a game or show to do so Shortterm capital flows dosometimes provide badly needed finance or liquidity In both cases howeverthere are also costswhether to the social mix that sustains a teams fan baseor to the macroeconomic stability that sustains longterm economic growthStadium owners have judged these costs to be large enough to warrant seriousattempts to limit scalping and given the experience of the last two years youdont have to be an antimarket fanatic to argue that some limits on hot moneywould also be a good thing if feasible            But the trouble is that between technology thatmakes it easier for markets to run rings around local regulations and thereluctance of governments to agree on the sort of crossborder enforcement thatmight let them keep up with that technology efforts to limit the market  Ohmavericks such as George Lucas or Malaysias Prime Minister Mahathir binMuhammad may try to fight the trend and even achieve some limited success butthey are swimming against the tide Indeed as this article was being writtenLucasunder intense pressure from theater ownersgave in to the dark side ofmarket forces Some tickets to The Phantom Menace will indeed be soldin advanceand no doubt be snapped up by scalpers
