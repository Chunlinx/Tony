        um     do you want to start   yes on uh taking care of the elderly do you have an older relative that you are concerned with right now   i just have one grandmother thats thats alive and im shes i think in her low eighties but she lives by herself and takes care of herself and stuff and shes healthy   i see thats very important   uhhuh   i tell you i have uh faced this whole subject myself because my mother is not quite that old but   umhum   she uh has Parkinsons and uh   hm   we tried taking care of her in the house and it got to where it wasnt safe and then uh   umhum umhum   we had to to uh try different things and finally shes in a nursing home   hm did you hear theyre coming closer to a cure for Parkinsons   um i hope so   uhhuh   because it really is a bad disease   because a lot of people in uh i think a country like Guam or something have it so   umhum   um theyre studying those people and coming closer to a cure   well they know what causes it uh and you know its a an insufficiency in the brain   what umhum i think it was it was on the news and they mentioned something like that some chemical   yeah but uh so far they havent uh that i know of they havent figured out why theres a deficiency and   umhum   the medicine they give them is supposed to replace it but it it doesnt   umhum   it also has side affects   umhum   how do you feel about having to place someone in a nursing home     well i hope i can take care of my parents someday i hope i can afford to   umhum   um um i guess it depends on what the nursing homes like because theres some very nice ones that i wouldnt mind checking into it myself   hm well well   and   i think another part of it it depends on whether you are uh physically able to do it   uhhuh   to give them the care they need   uhhuh thats true if you have to work you know you dont have a choice   well and then too uh i found that even if i didnt work   uhhuh   i couldnt hold up to taking care of mother twenty four hours a day   uhhuh uhhuh   because   its hard work   it just uh uh you know she couldnt do anything by herself and uh   umhum   her mind wonders and she wonders   umhum   and uh ive tried it on weekends and stuff and i my feeling on it   umhum   is that the nursing home is there if you need it   umhum   but you hope you dont need it   umhum   and i think your health is important as important as theirs   umhum   um have you ever thought about what uh kind of things you would look for in a nursing home if you ever had to choose   well i guess just a nice caring environment for one thing   umhum   and just cheery atmosphere um ive gone to this nursing home over on um Forest Lane and Greenville out there   um yes   um just for like field trips im a teacher and i take my students to nursing homes because um   yeah good   we study old age and stuff and um theres this one particular one over there that ive visited that was really nice and the director would hug the   umhum   elderly people you know hello and um we the days we were there we played games with them and just real nice atmosphere real cheerful atmosphere and its a gorgeous nursing home too   umhum umhum thats good   um   they love the the older people love to be around children too   umhum and the kids i have to like drag them out of there too so   isnt that great   uhhuh i think its mutual   yeah thats great   so like a grandparent or something   uhhuh   so um i dont know if i could   course theres a   um put my parents in a place like that i wouldnt feel bad   umhum   you know   well i think the worst worst thing about having to do it is the guilt you do feel   umhum   and i think the first thing is you have to be absolutely sure thats what you need to do   umhum   and uh i know in in my situation we had to consider nursing care and uh   umhum thats another thing medical   the doctor available and the fact that its clean and you also have to you have to uh pay attention to how much it costs too   umhum um yeah i bet because it can probably cost a fortune   umhum it it can and it costs more than most people make in a year   hm   but uh   does insurance help cover it at all or   there is a special insurance you can buy   umhum   for nursing home insurance in fact my husband and i take it   hm     because we hope we never have to use it   umhum   but uh it would uh take care of an interim period until you know if it was a longterm care until Medicaid would kick in   umhum do you have children or   because Medicaid uh pardon   do you have children   yes i have four   umhum   umhum but uh   so you have um plenty of people to take care of you some day   well um
