          okay my views it asked for my views so my views on that are yes i do still consider them a threat   uhhuh really   and yes i do and the reason i do is because um ive with uh Gorbachev was raised and his mentor was i because it was Nikita Khrushchev i believe i know it was one of the old old school Russian and uh he he is a definite he is a Marxist Leninist communist through and through   uhhuh uhhuh   and Marxist Leninist communism is a threat to the United States because um the whole nature of it is to control the world the the whole goal of the Marxist Leninist theology is world domination   uhhuh   and i do not believe that it has not theyve never stated that their goal is not to you know take over the world and theyve never repented of all the massacres all the just the you know the hundreds of thousands of uh massacres theyve killed more Jews   oh yeah   and all this and so no i dont trust them a bit i think its a big scam   think so   yes i do i yes i would all but say i know its a scam you cant trust him he was the head of the KGB for years   was he   yes he was for many many years he was trained in the old school of Lenin theology and he hes never changed any of his any of the he he deals in that kind of theology hes you know he might say one thing but what he does is Marxist and Leninist in nature and so   uhhuh   and so thats why the Russians are so angry with him right now is because theyve they know its a scam and so you know i thats what i feel i dont know what do you feel do you agree with me or disagree   uhhuh yeah um you know its its hard to say uh if if things change uh change there so       rapidly but uh Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev is i dont know i think i think you youre right hes a chameleon hes just a hes he hes just he seems to have flip flopped on you know uh uh you know when they first came into power when uh President Reagan was in he was this real nice guy and he was   uhhuh   trying to uh win everybody in the West over about what oh what a great reformer he was and all this other stuff but then you know now hes uh know now hes uh you know crushing the  uh demonstrations and and and trying to close close it off again so i i i cant figure i cant figure him out i dont know if hes being pressured from   right   uh above or around or uh from other places in in   well if he got out of line too much from the old school theyd just knock him off i mean theyre not going theyre not going to permit anyone in that Russian Parliament to get in power thats going to change anything too much so   yeah that their people are starving i mean they cannot   right   theyve got to know that somethings got to give because theyre in their society youre not at you know its supposed to be all for one and one for all but that aint how it works baby i mean thats you know theyre not going to do something unless theyve got incentives and they dont have any incentives to work   uhhuh no because theyve taken them from the people because the Marxist Leninist theology is to i mean it really is its own religion it it could be classified in theological terms as a religion because it is   uhhuh   but they deny God self is everything self you know everything is um for me for me for me and therefore   or for the for the people for the people which means everybody else except you   right but thats not what they really do they say that but thats not the reality of it even the Bolshevik revolution the whole thing was uh   yeah   an attempt to uh gain authority without you know having to be risen up in authority the best way to get Godly authority is to you know work and and work your way to the you know work your way up not being promoted by man because promotion comes from God   uhhuh yeah   but when you anytime you see a nation go in and just overtake it and its take it take authority take control its a i believe its a spiritual   yeah   thing that happens and its like a spirit of witchcraft its like a a bad spirit goes over that nation because you have these people that want theyre power hungry   uhhuh   and they want all this power and they want to control all these people and its not for the people its for themselves and the way you know that is because they didnt work their way up from the bottom up they went in and they took power and they took authority and they   uhhuh   took authority and they cut and they stab and and our nation does that a lot too i know its not necessarily i dont think this is the greatest system either but i just feel like theres just a lot of oppression over the Soviet Union because of that the authority is there to exalt self thats the whole Leninist theology they deny God they deny any creator theyve   yeah   forbade religion for years and years and Gods the one that opened the doors for their religion for for Christianity to go in Russia its not its not Gorbachev he will not receive the credit for that because one man   uhhuh   saying that could not have done anything God had to open those doors and i believe that the the pressure just got so great from the people   yeah uhhuh   because that they you know they God just honored their prayers and did a miracle because i dont know we our pastor went to Russia and we work with a lot of churches in Minsk and in Belev Russia and some other places and so i dont know i have a real heart for Russia thats why i think its funny we got this call because i have a good friend my one of my best friends is going into into the underground church cause it   uhhuh   basically its still underground it   oh yeah   and so theyre going in a mission trip into Latvia in about six months and so theyre preparing for the trip you know and and it was i sat behind her Sunday and they had their Russia team folder so i thought oh thats cool so anyway so this is kind of one of my little pet babies but       anyway i dont know i just   yeah   i think they want a one world order thats what i think i think Gorbachev would like to see a one world order a one world economic community and a one world government with him in charge of it and Bush is going around talking about it too   yeah   and its like all these pawns on this chess big all these players on this big chess game you know and its a world championship and who is ultimately going to get the power whos going to get put in checkmate and whos going to be ruled out of the game   yeah   and whos going to have the power over what they want to establish in this one world you know community theyre always talking about it all the time   oh yeah you hear a lot about it   yeah   but it its all that its its all that uh the new age philosophy and um   uhhuh are you a Christian you must be to know new age   yes oh yes oh yes i know all about the new age philosophy yeah and uh its   yeah    right      but they are in such disarray over there theyre not in any position to exalt exert themselves over anybody right now like they were   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean with Eastern Europe falling apart and their whole economic system falling apart they can that that we need to take real advantage of that   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   to to pull their satellites away from them   but yeah i think that they still are a threat but yet maybe a different ki nd of a threat than a military threat but i do believe that theyre a military threat i think   yeah   just look what we did to Iraq   well it was with Russian were they fought us with Russian weapons and theyve they found out the hard way how bad badly put together the Russian weapons are   right uhhuh thats true yeah thats true they did didnt they i know its its interesting i still wouldnt want to take them on though i still wouldnt want to take them i still think we need to be very careful but i believe that their economic or an economic threat more than anything at this point because they want control over the i know they want control over the European economic community and that you know thats why i see them diversifying their their power and their control that they have   oh yeah oh yeah uhhuh   and like for you know instead of just being oh big tough Russia but i still believe theyve uh theyve probably got weapons we can i mean they they never would sell to anybody else   yeah oh of course   you know so i guess i feel like yeah they probably i wouldnt want to mess with them but i dont trust them im not all like oh yeah theyre just like us i i have a heart for the people of Russia no   no no no not not not for the leaders definitely not for the leaders   no i wouldnt be surprised if Gorbachev wasnt a satanist wasnt a satanist im not kidding   well theyre theyre theyre a secret theyre a secret society theyre a secretive society   right even yeah   you know and theyre not going to let you see what they dont want you to see   exactly even you know in our own country i mean Bush was in the scull and bones the Trilateral Commission and all these groups with ulterior motives and so its like what on earth is you know are these people ever here and involved in   um   in the high ranking things i mean when you look at their history and what theyve done to their own people what theyve done its like   yeah yeah   man can we trust them have they repented for what they did have they made a world apology   no they havent   we we repented this was wrong were going to start seeking God and were going to start seeing God to do for our nation what needs to be done and even Bush will call a national day of prayer is Bush saved i dont know God knows he says he is and im going to trust that with him but i mean its just no i dont trust them   yeah no   youd be crazy if you trust them but anyway call it what is it McCarthyism no  im not like that i just got enough common sense that nope to you come repent make a world apology for all the wrongs that youve done and yeah weve done wrongs but weve not done near the atrocities theyve done and we need to maybe do that also you know   uhhuh   you know im saying im not saying like oh America were so were perfect over here im not saying that either but thats not what the question asked so  boy i could preach   uhhuh
