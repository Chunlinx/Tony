Many predicted the sects political power andmembership would burgeon after the march Has this happened What sort ofcultural and political influence does Farrakhan currently wield            Thenation was founded in the late s by traveling salesman Wallace D Fardwhose preachings combined Islam with an Afrocentric cosmology He taught thatblacks are descended from Shabbaz a tribe that came from the moon trillion years ago  and that whites were the laboratory concoction ofYakub an evil scientist Elijah Muhammad assumed leadership of the sectafter Fards death in  proclaiming Fard an incarnation of Allah andhimself Fards prophet The nation headquartered in Chicago grew rapidlyduring the late s and early s thanks largely to proselytizing by MalcolmX Temples appeared in major US cities drawing

WorldCommunity of alIslam  Soon after Farrakhan  a Nation of Islamstalwart and former calypso singer reestablished the nation in line with itsoriginal tenets With his provocative speeches Farrakhan receives moreattention than Wallace Deenmost notably his reference to Judaism as a gutterreligion and his declaration that Hitler was a great man Most members ofthe former nation remain loyal to Wallace Deens organization The two groupssquabble over the legitimacy of Farrakhans claim to be Muhammads trueheir            The nationclosely guards the scale of its operations Estimates fix

and sparking confrontations between blackand Jewish students The strident defense of Farrakhan by middleclass studentsbespoke Farrakhans growing popularity with the black bourgeoisie            Interestin the nation seems to correlate with the negative media it generatesFollowing Mike Wallaces  television documentary on the nation The HateThat Hate Produced  and denunciations of  presidential candidateJesse Jackson for failing to repudiate Farrakhan membership in thenation rose            Upon recreating the nation Farrakhan repealed ElijahMuhammads prohibition on the groups participation in electoral politicsAside from maintaining relationships with black politicians like Jackson andperennial New York candidate Al Sharpton  he has announced granderdesigns Farrakhan says he is interested in becoming a presidential adviser andthat the nation will begin fielding its own candidates            A paucity of charismaticblack leaders has helped focus attention on Farrakhan and the nations brandof black nationalism which emphasizes selfhelp jibed with growing blackfrustration with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party Yet the nationfailed to parlay its biggest publicrelations successthe October Million Man March into greater influence and membership The march iscredited with having boosted black selfesteem but Farrakhans threehourmeandering speech at the march alienated potential followers Especiallydisconcerting was said to be his lengthy disquisition on numerology Manyaccounts of the march downplayed the nations presence For evidence seeSpike Lee s docudrama about the march Get on the Bus  whichcontains few references to Farrakhan            Arecurring battle with prostate cancer has debilitated the yearoldFarrakhan He markets his own remedies which include a controversialdevelopedinAfrica AIDS medication through Nation of Islam grocers Thoughhe continues to tour regularly his speeches are said to have become lesscharismatic and less appealing Rally attendance is much scantier todaythan in  and  and he wins far fewer headlines than he did then            Farrakhans foreignpolicy adventures inthe months following the march also discredited him Especially damning isFarrakhans close relationship with Libyan dictator Muammar alQaddafi InJanuary  Qaddafi promised the nation a billion gift which has not beenreceived because of US sanctions against Libya Black newspapers haveeditorialized against Farrakhans visits with African dictators            Thenation has recently considered leaning toward the mainstream right toexpand
