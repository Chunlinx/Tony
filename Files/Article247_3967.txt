                                 The Winnable War                        Hi Jim            Maybe the sting is finally out of the Vietnam War debate Your comments wereso reasonable its hard to believe the subject was Vietnam When I look backnow at the Vietnam era and recall what people including me thought and saidI think a dark cloud must have passed over the country Passions were so greaton both sides of the debate in the United StatesI was antiwar at thetimethat few people have honestly reconsidered their views or taken a freshlook at the war and its results            With all the Vietnam books pouring out Id been looking for months for arevisionist take one that didnt accept either of the liberal explanationsthe United States missed opportunities for a settlement the war wasunwinnable or the conservative one politicians tied the hands of themilitary But serious Vietnam revisionism barely existeduntil Michael Lindsbook came along I know Mike but only slightly and I havent read any of hisearlier books I was excited when I read Vietnam The Necessary War  andI think its an enormously important book            Let me start with three points             Yes I basically agree with your characterization of the theme of thebook And I agree with Lind that even an ultimately unsuccessful interventionwas better than none at all Im not the first to make the point that Asiawould probably be quite different today and far worse off if the UnitedStates had pulled out in say  or  Then the dominoes might reallyhave fallen two did anyway Laos and Cambodia Peter Kann of the WallStreet Journal has written that a breathing spell was needed in Asia toallow free markets and political freedoms to grow And boy did they growduring that year period from  to  while the United States staved offthe North Vietnamese Would Thailand be a free country today absent that Idoubt it Would Indonesia or Malaysia or Taiwan be independent             Lind may overstate the bandwagon effect in world affairs but therescertainly something to it The proof is what happened post after theUnited States did bug out Then the Soviet Union was emboldened and Americawas demoralized The Soviets were soon on the move in Asia Africa and LatinAmerica And at least two administrations Ford Carter were all butparalyzed and Congress was dead set against intervening anywhere The defeatin Vietnam gave the Soviet Union and the rest of the world the message that theUnited States was out of the game for a while And this was an accuratemessage Linds contention is that things would have even worse if the UnitedStates had simply taken a pass on Vietnam A more damaging message would havebeen sent and a bigger bandwagon effect touched off As for minimal realismits an excuse for neoisolationism for an evershrinking United States rolein international affairs It could have been invoked to let the North Koreanstake the South the Chinese Communists seize Taiwan and Communist guerillasconquer Malaysia Im glad it wasnt             Theres one area where I think Lind comes up short He thinks the UnitedStates given the way the war was being fought should have pulled out in if only to avert the subsequent casualties that he argues wound up weakeningAmericas determination to combat Soviet and Chinese communism Hes rightabout the way the war was fought under Gen William Westmoreland from  to Wrongheaded is a mild way of characterizing it Westmoreland tried tolure the enemy into big battles and stressed body counts Meanwhile most ofSouth Vietnam was falling under Communist control But everything changed whenWestmoreland left His replacement Gen Creighton Abrams adopted a newstrategy stopped fighting major battles and began piecemeal seizure of landfrom the Communists His pacification program brought security and a bettereconomy to rural areas The Phoenix program wiped out the Viet Congsinfrastructure By  the war was won militarilyor almost won The SouthVietnamese army had become a capable force All that was needed to save SouthVietnam was what the United States did in South Korea leave a couple Americandivisions and provide military and other support for the government The truthis the war in Vietnam was winnable
