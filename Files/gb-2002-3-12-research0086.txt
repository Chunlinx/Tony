                    Background        The functional annotation of metazoan genome sequences        represents one of the greatest challenges in modern        biological research For example even with structural        constraints imposed by the genetic code to guide algorithm        design the identification of all proteincoding genes in a        metazoan genome remains an unsolved computational problem        The identification of functional noncoding sequences such        as untranslated regions UTRs genes for        nonproteincoding RNAs and         cis regulatory elements poses an        even more difficult problem for comprehensive genome        annotation as the rules governing their structure and        function remain more elusive Despite these difficulties        it is increasingly clear that comparative genomic        approaches will substantially aid efforts to annotate these        and other important sequence features With wholegenome        sequence data quickly becoming available for several        organisms it is important to determine which species        comparisons and features of genome evolution will be most        useful for comparative genome annotation        The genus         Drosophila offers a        wellcharacterized evolutionary genetic system for        developing and testing methods for comparative genome        annotation From the seminal populationgenetic and        phylogenetic studies of Dobzhansky and coworkers   and        the classification of taxonomic relationships in the genus        by Patterson Stone and others           Drosophila has long served as a model        system for developing and testing evolutionary principles        at the morphological and cytological levels The genus         Drosophila has also served as a        proving ground for developing and testing evolutionary        principles at the protein   and DNA sequence levels          In addition for over a decade and a half comparative        sequence analysis has had an important role in the        functional analysis of genes and         cis regulatory sequences in         Drosophila see for example           This history of research has culminated in a rich        understanding of the pattern and process of molecular        evolution in the genus         Drosophila   With the complete        sequencing of the euchromatic portion of the         Drosophila melanogaster genome           this prior knowledge can be applied to the task of        comparative genome annotation        We have undertaken a pilot study to assess the        contribution of largescale comparative genomic sequence        data on the functional annotation of the         Drosophila genome Our goals are to        identify the species whose genome sequences would be most        useful in annotating the         D melanogaster genome and to        identify features of genome evolution that can assist the        annotation of proteincoding genes and the noncoding         cis regulatory sequences controlling        their transcription The lessons learned from this study        have implications for efforts to annotate the entire         D melanogaster genome using        comparative sequence data from the forthcoming         D pseudoobscura genome   as well        as the recently completed         Anopheles gambiae genome          Beyond the initial analyses presented here these data also        serve as materials for the further study of molecular        evolutionary processes in         Drosophila and the calibration of        comparative sequence analysis tools        Here we report the isolation and analysis of genomic        sequences from eight candidate regions representing both        generich and genepoor regions of the         Drosophila genome totaling over         megabases Mb of DNA sequence These regions were isolated        from fosmid libraries of four divergent         Drosophila species          D erecta D pseudoobscura D        willistoni  and         D littoralis  chosen to cover a        range of divergence times    and  million        years respectively from the reference species         D melanogaster   Using the        annotation pipeline and curation tools described in        accompanying papers     we predicted the coding        sequence content of these sequences for subsequent        comparative analyses Our results indicate that the        majority of coding sequences predicted in         D melanogaster can be identified in        divergent         Drosophila species and show evidence        of functional constraint Microsynteny is generally        maintained at the scale of individual fosmid clones and        the few rearrangement breakpoints transposable elements        and gene transpositions can readily be identified Analysis        of coding sequence evolution suggests that uncharacterized        genes which we will refer to as predicted genes tend to        have a higher rate of protein evolution than known genes         those genes that have been selected for experimental        study and thus are more likely to have easily discerned        functions Analysis of noncoding sequence evolution        reveals that levels of conservation vary with divergence        time and that conserved noncoding sequences CNCSs        exhibit a striking pattern of spatial clustering in         Drosophila  Using transgenic        reporter assays we show that CNCS clusters can be used to        accurately predict a developmentally regulated enhancer in        the         apterous          ap  region We discuss the        implications of our results for comparative approaches to        proteincoding and         cis regulatory sequence prediction        in the genus         Drosophila                     Results                  Isolation and sequencing of genomic regions from          divergent Drosophilaspecies          On the basis of genome size considerations and the          desire to investigate a range of divergence times in the          genus           Drosophila  we constructed fosmid          libraries approximately kb inserts for           D erecta D pseudoobscura D          willistoni and           D littoralis Figure            D littoralis is closely related to          the wellstudied species           D virilis  but has been reported          to have less dispersed repetitive DNA than           D virilis Kevin White personal          communication We designed degenerate PCR primers for a          set of eight wellcharacterized genes            apterous ap evenskipped eve          fushitarazu ftz twist twi  and           Rhodopsins    and                       Rh Rh Rh and           Rh  to obtain speciesspecific          sequencetagged sites STSs that were subsequently used          for hybridization to gridded fosmid filters see          Materials and methods Positive clones from the library          screen were verified by PCR and restriction mapped to          choose the longest clone containing the candidate gene          and its regulatory regions          In the initial design of this project comparative          sequence data was to be collected from a           D virilis P library   Using          a PCRbased platepool screening strategy we isolated a          P clone from this library containing an kb insert          from the           ap region of           D virilis Sequencing of this          clone revealed long stretches of repetitive DNA which          complicated both assembly and comparative analyses In          addition the insert size of the           D virilis P library          approximately  kb was greater than necessary for          comparative analysis of single gene regions This clone          was used to guide transgenic reporter analysis see          below but has not been included in the other analyses          reported here          In total  fosmid clones were isolated and sequenced          using methods described in   which sum to           bp All clones were finished to an estimated error rate          of fewer than  errors per  kb with an average          estimated error rate of  errors per  kb The          lengths of fosmids sequenced for the eight candidate          regions are shown in Table  Though we were able to          obtain speciesspecific STSs for the           D willistoni twi gene we were not          able to obtain clones for this region from the           D willistoni fosmid library We          were also not able to obtain a speciesspecific probe for                    D willistoni ftz  nor could we          obtain any           D willistoni ftz clones using          probes from other nonmelanogaster species Also shown in          Table are the lengths and locations of           D melanogaster genomic regions          corresponding to the union of the Release  sequences          homologous to all four nonmelanogaster species The          union of sequences from all nonmelanogaster species for          the eight candidate regions covers  kb of the           D melanogaster genome an          additional  kb of           D melanogaster genomic sequence          was sampled owing to rearrangements in nonmelanogaster          species Thus the  Mb of comparative data presented          here span over  Mb of coding and noncoding sequences          of the           D melanogaster genome                          Comparative annotation of coding sequences          The  nonmelanogaster fosmid and the           D virilis ap P sequences were          computationally processed using the pipeline used to          reannotate the           D melanogaster genome   The          only major modification to this pipeline was to add an          additional tier of evidence containing the results of          TBLASTN searches of all Release            D melanogaster peptides            against nonmelanogaster sequences Predicted coding          sequences were manually verified and refined using the          Apollo annotation tool   As no expressed sequence          tag EST information exists to annotate transcribed          noncoding sequences such as UTRs for the four          nonmelanogaster species we annotated only          proteincoding gene and exon models Thus in keeping          with other geneprediction studies for example            we use the terms gene and exon to refer to the translated          components of genes and exons          In the  fosmids we predict a total of           proteincoding genes in nonmelanogaster species  in           D erecta   in           D pseudoobscura   in           D willistoni   in           D littoralis  that form          orthologous clusters with            D melanogaster genes Of the           genes  are known genes that have been functionally          characterized in some way by the community of           Drosophila researchers the          remaining  genes are predicted genes based only on          the evidence in the Release  annotations   and see          Supplementary Table  in the Additional data files          section Of the  genes predicted in nonmelanogaster          species   are full length the remaining            are partial coding sequences that span the edge of          the sequenced genomic clone In nonmelanogaster species          we predict  coding exons  in           D erecta   in           D pseudoobscura   in           D willistoni   in           D littoralis  that form          orthologous clusters with            D melanogaster coding exons On          average there are approximately two nonmelanogaster          species sampled per orthologous gene and coding exon          cluster Fifteen genes  complete and  coding exons          were sequenced in all four nonmelanogaster species          Qualitatively our data reveal that the majority of           D melanogaster Release  gene          models are highly conserved in divergent           Drosophila species This made it          possible to automatically identify orthologous genes in          nonmelanogaster species using TBLASTN results in          conjunction with Genie   andor GENSCAN            predictions to improve intronexon boundaries and          identify smalldivergent exons in Apollo In the few          discrepant cases where no clear ortholog could be          unambiguously identified such as the four closely          related members of the           Rhodopsin gene family we used the          conserved microsyntenic gene orders maintained in these          species to resolve orthologs see below With the          exception of the retrotransposition events discussed          below the intronexon structure of gene models is highly          conserved as well only one case of intron gain was          observed in the           D littoralis Rh  as has been          reported previously for           Rh in the closely related species                    D virilis   For a small class          of genes            BcDNALD Gra Grb CG          CG CG CG  orthologs could be          identified in divergent species but aminoacid sequences          could not be reliably aligned with the           D melanogaster gene model In          addition orthologs of four genes            CG CG CG          CG  could not be identified in nonmelanogaster          species except in           D erecta  the species most          closely related to           D melanogaster  The absence of          these genes is not simply due to insufficient sampling          since in these cases both  and  neighboring genes          could be identified in more divergent species see Figure           for example These may represent genes overpredicted          in both           D erecta and           D melanogaster  lineagespecific          genes which evolved before the divergence of           D melanogaster from           D erecta  or genes which have          transposed from or to other locations in the genomes of          the more divergent species          We used an evolutionary genetic approach the K           a K           s test to assess the accuracy of          these gene and exon predictions   This test relies          on the assumption that functionally constrained          proteincoding sequences should exhibit significantly          lower rates of evolution in aminoacidencoding          nucleotide sites typically first and second positions in          a codon relative to silent sites typically third          positions in a codon Quantitatively this leads to the          prediction that the ratio of the average rate of          aminoacid substitution per site K           a  relative to the average rate of          silent substitution per site K           s  for functionally constrained          coding sequences should be significantly less than             Genes or exons which have a K           a K           s   are inferred to evolve in the          absence of functional constraint genes or exons which          have a K           a K           s   are inferred to evolve under          the influence of positive selection The significance of          a K           a K           s ratio can be determined by a          likelihood ratio test of the probabilities of the data          under the alternative hypotheses of functional constraint          relative to no constraint   Genes or coding exons          with a K           a K           s ratio significantly less than           pass the K           a K           s test genes or coding exons with a K                    a K           s ratio not significantly less than           fail the K           a K           s test The power of this test to          detect functional constraint is influenced both by          evolutionary distance and sequence length   thus we          analyzed both genes and coding exons in pairwise          comparison with all four nonmelanogaster species          All pairwise genelevel comparisons studied here          exhibited K           a K           s ratios less than one see          Supplementary Table  in the Additional data files          section One hundred and fiftyfive of   of          these K           a K           s ratios were significantly less than           indicating that the vast majority of genes in our          sample show evidence of functional constraint All nine          pairwise comparisons that fail the K           a K           s test at the gene level were           D melanogasterD          erecta comparisons and eight out of nine involved          predicted genes Supplementary Table  Genomic          sequences for six of the nine genes which fail the K           a K           s test at the gene level were sampled          in more divergent species four of these six genes could          be identified in more divergent species            Lmpt CG CG  and           CG  whereas two could not            CG and           CG  indicating that genes          conserved in divergent species can fail genelevel K           a K           s tests in comparisons among closely          related species like           D erecta  Of the four genes          identified only in           D melanogaster and           D erecta and not in more distantly          related species two pass           CG and           CG  and two fail            CG and           CG  the genelevel K           a K           s test We note that of these four          genes the two genes that pass            CG and           CG  have multiple exons          whereas the two genes that fail            CG and           CG  have only a single exon          This result indicates that at least some of the genes          found only in           D melanogaster and           D erecta are likely to be real          genes under functional constraint          Though the majority of pairwise exon level comparisons          have K           a K           s ratios less than one Figure  a          much lower proportion of pairwise comparisons at the exon          level pass the K           a K           s test In total   of          pairwise comparisons at the exon level pass the K           a K           s test   for           D erecta    for           D pseudoobscura             for           D willistoni  and            for           D littoralis  Coding exons from          known and predicted genes pass the K           a K           s test at similar rates overall           known versus  predicted           D erecta  known versus           predicted           D pseudoobscura  known          versus  predicted           D willistoni  known versus           predicted           D littoralis  known versus           predicted The majority of exons that fail the K           a K           s test still have K           a K           s ratios less than  only six          nonsignificant pairwise exon comparisons one in           D erecta  one in           D pseudoobscura  two in           D willistoni  and two in           D littoralis  have K           a K           s ratios greater than  Figure  As          with genelevel comparisons the most closely related          species           D erecta  fails the highest          proportion of exonlevel K           a K           s tests In contrast to genelevel          comparisons there is no tendency for exons from          predicted genes to fail K           a K           s tests relative to exons from known          genes          Pairwise comparisons that do not pass the K           a K           s test could result from misannotated          exons or an insufficient amount of divergence to resolve          differential rates of amino acid and silent site          evolution Failure to pass exonlevel K           a K           s tests because of insufficient          divergence is a function of divergence time and exon          length   Our results suggest that both factors          contribute to nonsignificant exonlevel K           a K           s tests between species in the genus           Drosophila  The fact that the most          closely related species           D erecta  fails the highest          proportion of geneand exonlevel K           a K           s tests indicates that insufficient          divergence time contributes to nonsignificant          comparisons Exon length is also a factor as there is a          tendency for shorter exons to fail K           a K           s tests in our data For example the          average length of all exons failing the K           a K           s test in comparisons between           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura is  codons          and the average length of all exons passing the K           a K           s test is  codons Similar          results are obtained for pairwise comparisons involving           D melanogaster and           D erecta D willistoni or           D littoralis  and for both known          and predicted genes data not shown          To determine if insufficient divergence time is the          major cause of nonsignificant exonlevel K           a K           s tests we performed multispecies          exonlevel K           a K           s tests that capitalize on a greater          total amount of divergence for a given exon   The          question addressed by this analysis is does the addition          of a third species to           D melanogasterD          pseudoobscura pairwise comparisons increase the          proportion of exons that pass exonlevel K           a K           s tests For this analysis we          analyzed exons that failed pairwise tests between           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura using triplets          involving           D melanogaster D          pseudoobscura and one other nonmelanogaster species          Using the same cutoffs for the pairwise exonlevel          analyses and a guide tree based on Figure  we tested            and  exons which did not show evidence of          functional constraint between           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura  for which we          have sequence data available in           D erecta D willistoni and           D littoralis  respectively Only           of the   nonsignificant exonlevel           D melanogasterD          pseudoobscura comparisons pass the K           a K           s test when           D erecta is included as a third          species whereas  of   and  of   pass          when           D willistoni and           D littoralis are included as a          third species respectively These results demonstrate          that multiple comparisons among divergent species can          reveal functional constraint acting on coding exons that          cannot otherwise be detected in pairwise comparisons          Finally as a preliminary assessment of the relative          utility of           A gambiae genome sequences for          comparative gene prediction in           Drosophila  we attempted to          identify homologs in           A gambiae of the  genes for          which we have comparative sequence data in           Drosophila  For  of the  genes          in our study  we were not able to obtain a clear          homolog defined as a highscoring pair HSP with an          expected E value less than  and greater than or          equal to  identity over  amino acids using default          parameters of TBLASTN in the           A gambiae mapped scaffold          sequences  of these  genes did not yield any HSPs at          all These results are compatible with a recent          wholegenome analysis showing that  of           D melanogaster genes have no clear          homolog in           A gambiae   No clear homolog          could be identified in the           A gambiae genome sequences for          three of   known genes in our dataset whereas a          greater than three times higher proportion of predicted          genes  of   had no clear homolog in           A gambiae  Five           D melanogaster genes  the four          members of the           Rhodopsin gene family and           CG  have multiple HSPs in the           A gambiae genome sequences We          were able to resolve orthology for           Rh only as the           sina gene in           A gambiae is contained within the           Rh gene as in           D melanogaster and other species          in the subgenus           Sophophora                           Rearrangement and transposition of genomic          sequences          Using the gene predictions discussed above as          orthologous markers we addressed the question of whether          the microsyntenic relationships in the           D melanogaster genomic sequence          surveyed are conserved in nonmelanogaster species In          general our data indicate that the microsyntenic order          of coding and noncoding sequences is highly conserved in          the genus           Drosophila at the scale of          individual fosmids approximately  kb Our data          provide evidence for only six genomic rearrangements in          these sequences occurring in the phylogeny of these five          species one each in the lineages leading to the           D littoralis ftz D pseudoobscura          Rh D willistoni eve Rh  and           Rh regions as well as in the          ancestor of the           D melanogasterD erecta          eve region see Figure  All of these unique events          occurred in noncoding intergenic regions and none of the          rearrangement breakpoints is associated with detectable          transposable element sequences see also   Although          it is difficult to estimate the length distribution of          microsyntenic regions in           Drosophila from our data it is          clear that very small microsyntenic regions can be          delimited in the           Drosophila genome through multiple          species comparisons For example the two independent          rearrangements in the vicinity of the           eve locus reduce this microsyntenic          region to a approximately kb interval of the           D melanogaster genome containing          only three neighboring genes            Adam CG and           eve  and their flanking noncoding          sequences Figure           We can directly confirm the nature of one          rearrangement            D littoralis ftz  as a          paracentric microinversion since both breakpoints are          contained within a single fosmid clone In this case a          small approximately  kb region containing the           ftz coding sequence and flanking          noncoding DNA is inverted between the           Antp and           Scr genes relative to           D melanogaster  Maier           et al    provide hybrization          data for a similar rearrangement in the           ftz locus of           D hydei  another member of the          subgenus           Drosophila  It is likely that the          other rearrangement breakpoints we observe also result          from paracentric inversions the predominant form of          genome rearrangement in           Drosophila   Consistent with          this is the fact that rearranged sequences can be          inferred to come from the same chromosome arm At least          two other breakpoints in the           D willistoni Rh and           Rh regions also have probably          arisen from microinversions as in both cases only two          genes are inferred to have switched order locally on the          chromosome          We also identified eight examples of novel genetic          elements in nonmelanogaster species seven of which          occur in intergenic regions Figure  Four of these          cases involve the insertion of novel transposable element          sequences full length           Bari like elements in both the           D pseudoobscura Rh region and the                    D willistoni Rh regions a          partial           I like element in the           D willistoni Rh region and a          partial           blastopia like element in the           D littoralis Rh region          Identification of           Bari like transposon sequences          in           D pseudoobscura and           D willistoni is consistent with          previous observations             I like elements have been shown to          exist in the melanogaster and obscura species   but          this is the first report of           I like elements in the willistoni          group The other four cases arise from gene transposition          including a homolog of the           D melanogaster Xchromosome gene           CG in the           D willistoni eve region a homolog          of the           D melanogaster Rchromosome gene           CG in the           D pseudoobscura Rh region a          homolog of the           D melanogaster Rchromosome gene           CG in the           D willistoni Rh region and the           Rh gene in           D littoralis see below The           CG like gene in           D pseudoobscura and the           CG like gene in           D willistoni both are located in          the same intergenic region between the           Arc and           PKB genes but result from          independent events since they involve different ancestral          sequences and occur on opposite strands in this          intergenic region This result suggests the possibility          of hotspots for gene transposition in the           Drosophila genome          At least one novel gene the           CG like gene           D willistoni  is likely to have          originated from a retrotransposition event as this gene          lacks introns while its closest homolog found on a          different chromosome arm in the           D melanogaster genome has two          introns Another striking example of retrotransposition          involves the           D littoralis Rh gene and          illustrates the fact that functionally important genes          can undergo dramatic changes in location and gene          structure during genome evolution   This gene          maintains its microsyntenic relationship with neighboring          genes in the D region of the           D melanogaster genome in          Sophophoran species but has retrotransposed into the          intron of another gene           CG  in a region of the           D littoralis genome that          corresponds to the E region of the           D melanogaster genome As a          result genes contained in the intron of the Sophophoran           Rh            sina            CG and           CG  have been lost in the          process Cytological evidence for transposition of           Rh exists for the closely related          species           D virilis and the more distantly          related species           D repleta             In contrast to the stability of microsyntenic gene          order in the genus           Drosophila  we found that the          sample of genes studied here are scattered widely          throughout the           Anopheles genome For example of          the            Drosophila genes that had a single          clear homolog in           Anopheles   are located on           D melanogaster chromosome arm R          Of these  genes ten five six and six are located on           A gambiae chromosome arms L R          L and R These results are consistent with previous          reports comparing the locations of genes in           D melanogaster with           A gambiae  which indicate that          extensive genome rearrangement has occurred since the          divergence of these two lineages     Some           D melanogaster genes in our sample          do maintain microsyntenic relationships in           A gambiae  such as the           Rh and           sina genes In this case          conservation of microsynteny is most probably maintained          because of the nested relationship of these genes and          this configuration in the outgroup           Anopheles supports the scenario          that transposition of           Rh occurred at some point in the          lineage leading to the           Drosophila subgenus see above and                                      Patterns of coding sequence evolution          In addition to providing a useful resource for          studying comparative gene prediction and genome          rearrangements our data confirm and extend emerging          trends in           Drosophila coding sequence          evolution Table summarizes the average rates of          aminoacid and silent site substitution for all known          and predicted genes in our dataset These data show that          predicted genes tend to have a higher rate of aminoacid          substitution than known genes in the genus           Drosophila  This trend is          significant for the three most closely related pairwise          comparisons            D melanogaster versus           D erecta D pseudoobscura or           D willistoni  but nonsignificant          in the comparison involving the most distantly related          species            D melanogaster versus           D littoralis  No significant          differences were detected in the rates of silent site          substitution between known and predicted genes in any          pairwise comparison although predicted genes in           D pseudoobscura D willistoni and                    D littoralis tend to show elevated          rates of silent site substitution          In contrast to expectation average rates of          aminoacid substitution are highest in comparisons          between           D melanogaster and           D willistoni  not           D melanogaster and           D littoralis Table  Figure           The overall increased rate of aminoacid substitution for          genes in the           D willistoni lineage is caused by          an increased rate of aminoacid substitution in predicted          genes For known genes average rates of aminoacid          substitution are consistent with the accepted          phylogenetic relationships of these species           D erecta is most closely related          to           D melanogaster  followed by           D pseudoobscura D willistoni and                    D littoralis  respectively          Average rates of silent site substitution also do not          show a pattern consistent with the accepted phylogeny of          these species Table  Figure  This is a consequence          of the fact that for comparisons between           D melanogaster and either           D pseudoobscura D willistoni or           D littoralis  average rates of          silent site substitution exceed an expectation of one          substitution per site indicating that silent sites are          saturated in these comparisons Even so it is apparent          that there may be an increased rate of silent site          substitution as well in the           D willistoni lineage It is          unlikely that these results are simply a consequence of          an incorrect phylogeny since the phylogenetic          relationships of these species are well established                     Our estimate of the average rate of aminoacid          substitution per site in known genes between           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura  is nearly          the same as previous estimates  using a different          sample of known genes and estimation procedure   In          addition our estimate of the average rate of aminoacid          substitution for predicted genes between           D melanogaster and           D erecta  is similar to          that estimated using different methods for a sample of          rapidly evolving genes between           D melanogaster and           D yakuba    a species          approximately as divergent from           D melanogaster as           D erecta   Thus the          categorical and lineage effects we detect are unlikely to          be artifacts of our data or methods The causes of the          increased rate of aminoacid substitution in predicted          genes in the           D willistoni lineage remain to be          clarified but are most probably related to increased          rates of protein evolution detected previously in the           D saltans lineage   which          have been explained by a shift in base composition in the          common ancestor of the           D saltans and           D willistoni groups see below          and            In           D melanogaster  it is well          established that coding sequences have a higher GC          content relative to genomic averages due to the          preferential use of codons ending in C or G             This pattern holds in the closely related species           D erecta  as well as in the more          distantly related species           D pseudoobscura and           D littoralis Table  In          contrast our data show that           D willistoni coding sequences have          a higher frequency of AT  basepairs than GC           basepairs This shift in base usage in           D willistoni coding sequences is          apparent at the dinucelotide level as well predominantly          affecting those dinucleotides that exclusively contain AT          or GC Noncoding sequences of all nonmelanogaster          species are ATrich as in           D melanogaster   slight          shifts towards higher AT frequency are observed in the          noncoding sequences of the           D willistoni lineage Table                    The shift in base usage in the           D willistoni lineage is also          detected in the pattern of synonymous codon usage see          Supplementary Table  in the additional data files          Previous analyses of a limited number of coding sequences          revealed a shift away from preferred Cending codons used          in the           D melanogaster lineage towards          Tending codons in the           D willistoni lineage    Our          data indicate that this trend holds for a much larger          sample of genes see Supplementary Table  in additional          data files For  of the  amino acids with more than          one codon Arg Asn His Ile Leu Lys Phe Pro Thr          Tyr the most frequently used codon in           D willistoni differs from that in           D melanogaster  All  of these          changes in synonymous codon usage involve           D willistoni most frequently using          an A or Tending or beginning for example Leu codon          with           D melanogaster using a G or          Cending or beginning codon supporting a trend          identified originally using only the           Adh coding sequence   The most          frequently used codon differs between           D melanogaster and           D erecta D pseudoobscura and           D littoralis for only two Asp          Ser one Asn and four Asn Ile Pro Thr amino          acids respectively                          Patterns of noncoding sequence evolution          Our data also provide an opportunity to study basic          features of noncoding conservation in           Drosophila  which remain largely          unexplored As shown in Figures and  a substantial          proportion of noncoding sequences are conserved in           Drosophila  especially in pairwise          comparisons between           D melanogaster and           D erecta  Levels of conservation          appear to plateau in more divergent comparisons with a          tendency for           D pseudoobscura to show higher          levels of noncoding conservation relative to           D willistoni or           D littoralis in pairwise          comparisons with           D melanogaster  Few if any          noncoding sequences are conserved between           D melanogaster and           A gambiae Figure  see also            There is also regional variation in levels of          noncoding conservation in the           Drosophila genome as illustrated          by contrasting conservation between           D melanogaster and           D erecta  for example in the           eve Figure  and           ap Figure  regions          To estimate levels of sequence conservation in          noncoding regions and to contrast patterns of coding          with noncoding conservation we aligned genomic          sequences using the AVID alignment tool   AVID is a          global alignment tool that works by recursively finding          colinear anchors of maximal sequence identity          therefore locally inverted or transposed sequences that          might be conserved will not be included in our analysis          Conserved noncoding sequences CNCSs defined as          windows of  bp or greater with  or greater          nucleotide identity were identified in pairwise          alignments using the VISTA program   These          parameters were chosen to identify short highly          conserved sequences found in           Drosophila noncoding regions            We used           D melanogaster as the reference          species in pairwise comparisons with nonmelanogaster          species and Release  annotations   exported from          Gadfly in VISTA format to classify conserved segments as          either coding or noncoding Transcribed and          nontranscribed noncoding sequences were analyzed          together since previous results showed similar patterns          of conservation for intergenic and intronic sequences in           Drosophila            The results of this analysis are shown in Table           which contrasts features of conservation in both coding          and noncoding sequences by species For all species          analyzed coding regions have a higher proportion of          sequences that meet our definition of conservation          relative to noncoding sequences In addition the median          segment length surpassing our criterion for conservation          is longer for coding sequences relative to noncoding          sequences for all species analyzed These results are          expected as coding sequences are on average thought to          experience more intense purifying selection than          noncoding sequences   In contrast the average          percent identity of conserved segments is higher for          noncoding sequences than coding sequences This is          probably a result of silent site substitution in          otherwise functionally constrained coding sequences          Analysis of levels of conservation by species shows          that the increased rate of aminoacid sequence evolution          in the           D willistoni lineage detected          above may reflect a more widespread phenomenon in the          genome of this species As shown in Table            D willistoni shows unexpectedly          low levels of both noncoding and coding conservation          given the accepted phylogeny of the species These data          show that the increased rate of evolution in the           D willistoni lineage is not          restricted to coding sequences rendering          codingsequencebased interpretations of the unusual          patterns of molecular evolution in this lineage less          tenable see for example    Together with the          changes in base composition in both coding and noncoding          sequences noted above the increased rate of evolution in          both coding and noncoding sequences detected in the           D willistoni suggests a          genomewide effect possibly resulting from a change in          mutation pressure or a change in population size at some          time during the history of this lineage see also                     Despite the lineage effect in levels of conservation          in the           D willistoni genome the median          length of conserved coding or noncoding segments          generally decreases with increasing divergence time as          expected Table  However the average percent identity          of conserved coding or noncoding segments identified          does not decrease with increasing divergence time          Finally the ratio of conserved sequences that are coding          relative to noncoding increases with increasing          divergence time The ratio of conserved sequences that          are coding relative to noncoding is  for comparisons          with           D erecta  but increases to           for comparisons involving           D pseudoobscura and approximately           for comparisons involving           D willistoni or           D littoralis           Changes in the median CNCS length reflect changes in          the overall distribution of CNCS lengths in pairwise          comparisons between           D melanogaster and either           D erecta D pseudoobscura D          willistoni  or           D littoralis Figure  These          data quantitatively describe the pattern of noncoding          conservation shown in Figures and  CNCS lengths become          shorter with increasing divergence but plateau to          approximately the same length in the most distant          comparisons The stability of this distribution at more          extreme evolutionary distances is apparently insensitive          to changes in the proportion of noncoding DNA that is          conserved compare           D willistoni and           D littoralis  Shown for          comparison is the distribution of CNCS lengths between           D melanogaster and           D virilis from   as well as a          reanalysis of this data using the current methods          Differences between the present and previous results for          the           D virilis data show the effect of          different methods for detecting CNCSs The differences          observed in the distribution of CNCS lengths between the          closely related species           D virilis and           D littoralis using the AVIDVISTA          method reflect the fact that the           D virilis data were obtained from          noncoding regions with known or suspected           cis regulatory function whereas          the data here represent a more random sampling of          noncoding regions in the           Drosophila genome          Conservation of noncoding sequences is typically          interpreted as evidence of functional constraint and this          assumption underlies most phylogenetic footprinting          methods This assumption was questioned by Clark            who proposed an alternative hypothesis for noncoding          conservation based on heterogeneity in mutation rates          that is mutational cold spots To resolve these          alternatives we studied the spatial distribution and          conservation of spacing between CNCSs in the           Drosophila genome Under a simple          mutational coldspot hypothesis CNCSs should occur          randomly in noncoding DNA and the lengths of spacer          intervals between CNCSs should be exponentially          distributed    In addition there should be no          tendency for the spacing between mutational cold spots to          remain conserved between divergent           Drosophila species given the rapid          rate of DNA loss in unconstrained sequences in the           Drosophila genome             As shown in Figure for noncoding comparisons between                    D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura  the frequency          spacer interval lengths between CNCSs in the           D melanogaster genome differ          significantly from the exponential distribution The          deviation from expected results from an excess of short          and long spacer intervals indicating that CNCSs are          clustered in the           Drosophila genome Nonrandom          spacing of CNCSs is also observed in other pairwise          species comparisons in the genus           Drosophila   and data not          shown In addition the lengths of homologous spacer          intervals are highly correlated across species Figure           This correlation is unlikely to be an artifact of          alignment as the AVID method first aligns regions of          local similarity before generating a global alignment          Moreover similar results have been obtained using          nonglobal alignment methods   These results suggest          that spacer interval sequences between CNCSs and          therefore CNCSs themselves are functionally constrained          and provide evidence against the hypothesis that CNCSs          are simply mutational cold spots          Clusters of CNCSs are readily apparent in VISTA plots          of complex gene regions with known           cis regulatory function Figures          and  In addition there is a strong tendency for          known           cis regulatory elements to overlap          clusters of CNCSs For example discrete enhancers that          control embryonic expression of           eve are contained within discrete          CNCS clusters in the region  to           eve Figure  In contrast          discrete CNCSs clusters are not observed in the region           to           eve where enhancers overlap one          another    The correspondence of CNCS clusters          and functional enhancers is observed in other regions of          the           Drosophila genome such as the          discrete musclespecific enhancer in the fourth intron of                    ap Figure  The inexact          correspondence between enhancer sequences and CNCS          clusters is perhaps not unexpected as enhancers are          typically defined as the minimal sequence sufficient to          recapitulate native expression in a reporter gene assay          Nevertheless this pattern suggests a functional          relationship between           cis regulatory elements and          discrete CNCS clusters          To test the hypothesis that CNCS clusters can predict          the location of           cis regulatory elements in the           Drosophila genome we carried out           P elementmediated reporter gene          analysis of genomic sequences corresponding to a CNCS          cluster in the fourth intron of           ap  This CNCS cluster is apparent          in pairwise comparisons between           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura as well as between                    D melanogaster and           D virilis Figure            ap is a LIMhomeobox transcription          factor expressed in many tissues in           Drosophila  including embryonic          expression in the developing brain    As shown in          Figure  the           D melanogaster genomic sequences          corresponding to the CNCS cluster in the           ap intron  drives reporter gene          expression in the           Drosophila embryo in a specific          pattern that recapitulates native           ap expression in the developing          brain In addition when introduced into the genome of           D melanogaster  the homologous          fragment from the           D virilis genome also drives          reporter gene expression in the same pattern indicating          that the expression pattern resulting from this enhancer          has been conserved since the divergence of these two          species Experiments to test the function of CNCS          clusters   and  in the           ap region are currently          underway                            Discussion                  Prospects for comparative gene prediction in          Drosophila          Although great progress has been made towards          understanding the proteincoding component of eukaryotic          genome sequences      comprehensive genome          annotation is far from complete in any metazoan          Stateoftheart statistical and remotehomology          geneprediction methods are successful at identifying the          location of exons in unannotated genomic DNA but are          often quite poor at predicting the details of gene          structure necessitating human curation   One of the          most useful sources of information for accurately          predicting complex gene structures is ESTcDNA data            Predicting the structure of genes for which no          ESTcDNA data exists will require alternative approaches          such as comparative gene modeling among divergent species          with conserved proteomes in the same group of          organisms          The results of our K           a K           s analyses presented here give          preliminary insight into the prospects of comparative          gene modeling using largescale sequence data in the          genus           Drosophila  From our findings we          expect that structural details of most Release  coding          sequences can be verified and improved using pairwise          sequence data between divergent species like           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura  Our results also          indicate that although it may not be necessary for many          genes in the           D melanogaster genome           de novo comparative gene prediction          between these species will find the vast majority of          asyet unidentified genes lacking ESTcDNA data It is          important to note that we do not expect to detect all          coding exons especially short exons   in pairwise          comparisons highlighting the added value of multiple          species data for comparative exon prediction In          addition important details of gene models will prove          difficult to predict using only comparative data as          aminoacid divergence especially insertions or          deletions can obscure intronexon boundaries and other          details of gene structure Moreover there is inherent          uncertainty in the correct gene structure developed          from comparative data alone since two divergent          sequences are simultaneously being modeled Finally the          comparative annotation of UTR sequences awaits the          development of methods that accurately predict the          noncoding components of gene models          The patterns of proteincoding sequence evolution          detected in our data have important implications for          comparative gene prediction Most notably the trend we          detect for predicted genes to show an increased rate of          aminoacid substitution relative to known genes is          important as it may reflect differences in functional          constraint or quality of gene models between the two          classes of genes For at least three reasons we believe          that the elevated rate of aminoacid substitution in          predicted genes is not a result of poorquality gene          models in this class of genes First many of the genes          in the predicted class have ESTcDNA data see          Supplementary Table  so the details of these gene          models are likely to be correct Second estimates of K           a and K           s  are based on aligned sequences          thus gross inaccuracies in gene models that would create          gaps in the alignment are excluded from estimates of          evolutionary rates Third differential rates in these          two classes of genes maybe expected as a high proportion          of known genes were selected for study because their          mutational inactivation resulted in an obvious phenotype          Thus we favor the interpretation that increased rates of          aminoacid substitution in predicted genes results from          lower levels of functional constraint          If this interpretation is correct our results confirm          those of Schmid and coworkers    who have shown          that a large fraction of randomly sampled coding          sequences and orphan genes are rapidly evolving in the          genus           Drosophila  Our results are also          consistent with those of Ashburner           et al    who show that genes          with known mutant phenotypes in           D melanogaster are more likely to          have a conserved homolog in GenBank relative to predicted          genes with no known phenotype Similarly Zdobnov           et al    show that           D melanogaster orphan genes tend          to exhibit lower levels of conservation in pairwise          comparison with           A gambiae   Finally the          interpretation that known and predicted genes differ in          their levels of functional constraint is supported by the          fact that increased rates of protein evolution in           D willistoni affect predicted          genes more strongly than known genes Table  Together          these results suggest that there is a large class of          functional proteincoding sequences evolving under weak          selective constraint in the           Drosophila genome   Rates of          evolution for this class of genes may be too fast to          allow the identification of homologs from extremely          divergent species such as           Anopheles  for comparative gene          prediction but slow enough to use comparative data          within the genus           Drosophila                           Rearrangement transposition and genome          annotation          Genome rearrangement in           Drosophila typically occurs through          paracentric inversion allowing the homology of          chromosome arms to be maintained over millions of years          Homologous chromosome arms in the genus           Drosophila are referred to as          Mullers elements and represent a clearly established          level of synteny between species   The homology of          Mullers elements can be extended to           A gambiae    however it is          clear that a substantial fraction of rearrangements          between these species must occur by other mechanisms than          paracentric inversion Levels of synteny below the          chromosome arm are more difficult to establish and the          description of these levels of conserved gene order is          currently arbitrary   Thus it is important to point          out that the strictly colinear microsynteny we detect          between           Drosophila species differs from the          hyphenated microsynteny with multiple gene losses and          gains between           Drosophila and           Anopheles            Rates of genome rearrangement between species in the          genus           Drosophila based on cytological          evidence are thought to be among the highest for any          metazoan   Before this study only a single fixed          inversion breakpoint had been characterized at the          sequence level in           Drosophila   Unfortunately          the limited number of events in our data makes it          difficult to estimate the absolute rate of genome          rearrangement at the sequence level in           Drosophila  More extensive          analysis of genome rearrangement at the sequence level in                    Caenorhabditis by Coghlan and Wolfe            suggests that rates of genome rearrangement are          fourfold higher in nematodes than in flies As          microinversions such as that seen in the           D littoralis ftz region are not          expected to be included in cytological estimates this          claim will have to be reevaluated using largescale          comparative sequence data in           Drosophila           There is mounting evidence for the role of          transposable elements in the origin of inversion          breakpoints in           D melanogaster and other species              In contrast our data provide no evidence          that rearrangement breakpoints fixed between           Drosophila species are associated          with transposable element sequences see also            Together these observations suggest a hitandrun          scenario in which transposable elements may play a part          in the origin of chromosome rearrangements but are lost          either through deletion or transposition by the time          rearrangements reach high frequency or fixation between          species   Consistent with this scenario is the fact          that transposable element sequences are not conserved          between species within unrearranged microsyntenic regions          for example the           HB element in the           ap region Figure           The maintenance of microsyntenic regions we observe at          the scale of multigene fosmidsized regions          approximately  kb should improve identification of          orthologs for comparative gene modeling On the other          hand           de novo comparative gene          identification can be complicated if for example nested          genes maintain microsyntenic relationships   In          addition as the few rearrangement breakpoints we          observed occur exclusively in intergenic regions see          also   rearrangement breakpoints may also help          define the boundaries of complex genetic loci          Conservation of microsynteny between genes and flanking          intergenic regions may reveal structural and functional          connections in the genome and thus it may be possible to          associate functional noncoding sequences with the          appropriate flanking gene through genome rearrangements          see also   Proof of this principle can be seen for          the intergenic region  to           eve and  to           TER  which maintains association          with           eve  but not           TER  in nonmelanogaster group          species Figure  This conservation of microsynteny          between the           eve coding and  CNCSs is          consistent with the fact that this region is known to          contain multiple enhancer sequences that regulate          embryonic           eve expression                             Prospects for comparative cisregulatory prediction          in Drosophila          Conservation of noncoding sequences is rapidly          becoming one of the most powerful methods of predicting          individual           cis regulatory elements in genomic          sequences   Most computational methods designed to          identify CNCSs rely on the assumption that noncoding          conservation implies functional constraint rather than          heterogeneity in mutation rates   Our results          provide two pieces of evidence that support this          assumption and argue against a simple mutational          coldspot interpretation of noncoding conservation          First we demonstrate that the lengths of spacer          intervals separating CNCSs are nonrandomly distributed          in the           Drosophila genome indicating a          tendency for CNCSs to be clustered in noncoding DNA          Second we show that the spatial relationships of          neighboring CNCSs are generally conserved as revealed by          the strong correlation of spacer interval lengths in          divergent species Clustering of CNCSs and conservation          of CNCS spacing are not expected under a mutational          coldspot hypothesis and suggest that the spacer          intervals between CNCSs and therefore CNCSs themselves          are under functional constraint Given the rapid rate of          DNA loss for unconstrained sequences in           Drosophila    it is          difficult to understand the mere existence of spacer          intervals as well as their conservation of length          without invoking some form of functional constraint          acting on these sequences          Clustering of CNCSs has also been recently reported in          the worm genome   and future research will determine          if CNCS clustering is a general feature of noncoding          conservation in metazoan genomes As yet there has been          no report of a general tendency for CNCSs to be clustered          in mammalian genomes although certain regions of the          mammalian genome such as the           H region   show a strong          pattern of CNCS clustering The general functional          significance of CNCS clusters remains to be explored but          it is clear that some CNCS clusters correspond to          functional enhancer sequences We show here proof of the          principle that CNCS clusters can be used to identify          functional enhancer sequences in the           Drosophila genome Figure   as          Ishihara           et al    have shown for CNCS          clusters in the mammalian genome          Using CNCS clusters to identify enhancers represents          the comparative genomic analogue of efforts to predict           cis regulatory sequences by          exploiting the clustering of predicted transcription          factor binding sites    However unlike          bindingsite clusters CNCS clusters can be rapidly          identified in the absence of any           a priori information about          transcription factor specificity and may therefore          provide a more general approach to genomewide           cis regulatory prediction In          fact CNCS clusters may be a powerful source of data for          inferring transcription factor specificity as specific          bindingsite motifs are likely to be locally          overrepresented in CNCS clusters with demonstrable          enhancer function Using the intrinsic clustering of          CNCSs provides a new way of circumventing the reliance on          expression data implicit in current approaches to          CNCSbased motif discovery   Finally successfully          linking CNCS clusters with enhancer function will provide          an alternative means of defining enhancer structure based          on evolutionary rather than operational criteria                            Conclusions        The patterns of divergence in both coding and         cis regulatory sequences described        here indicate that         D pseudoobscura will greatly aid        efforts to functionally annotate the         D melanogaster genome and justify        the choice of         D pseudoobscura as the second         Drosophila species for complete        genome sequencing The divergence between these species is        sufficient such that there does not appear to be any need        to go to more distantly related species to obtain a high        level of signal to noise to detect functionally constrained        sequences This observation suggests that the search for        additional         Drosophila species whose genome        sequence would help interpret the         D melanogaster sequence should focus        on species at a similar evolutionary distance as         D pseudoobscura         Of the species studied here         D erecta is too closely related to         D melanogaster for comprehensive        gene and         cis regulatory prediction Neither        coding nor noncoding sequences have experienced sufficient        divergence to differentiate whether sequences conserved        between         D erecta and         D melanogaster result from        functional constraint or shared ancestry Figures   At        the other extreme using         A gambiae genome sequences may not        substantially aid comprehensive genome annotation as a        large proportion of         Drosophila genes may not be present        in the         Anopheles genome and the lack of        noncoding conservation between these groups Figure and          means that this powerful source of data is unavailable        for         cis regulatory annotation In        contrast divergent species in the genus         Drosophila such as         D littoralis and         D willistoni  show similar        properties to each other and to         D pseudoobscura in terms of their        utility for identifying functionally constrained coding or        noncoding sequences                D willistoni and         D melanogaster are both members of        the subgenus         Sophophora  thus these two species        are expected to share more aspects of their biology in        common than either will with         D littoralis Therefore we propose        that of the species studied here         D willistoni is the most suitable        candidate for the third         Drosophila species for complete        genome sequencing We make this suggestion despite the        increased rate of evolution and changes in base composition        and codon usage observed in this lineage In fact it may        be possible to take advantage of these unusual patterns of        molecular evolution in the         D willistoni lineage to dissect        regions of the         Drosophila genome under different        levels of functional constraint Given a more thorough        understanding of these phenomena and their causes we        believe that a         D willistoni genome sequence would        complement efforts to annotate the         Drosophila genome based on whole        genome comparisons between         D melanogaster and         D pseudoobscura                     Materials and methods                  Construction of Drosophilaspecies fosmid          libraries          Four           Drosophila species spanning a range          of divergence times in the genus were selected for study                    D erecta strain            D pseudoobscura strain                     D willistoni strain           and           D littoralis strain           All strains are available from the Tucson                    Drosophila species stock center            To construct fosmid libraries genomic DNA from          adult flies was prepared by partial digestion with           Mbo I and sizeselecting fragments          using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis then cloned in          the           Bam HI site of the fosmid vector          pFOS   and transformed into           Escherichia coli strain XLBlue MR          Stratagene Detailed information about the           Drosophila stocks construction of          the genomic fosmid libraries and their availability can          be found at the Childrens Hospital of Oakland Research          Institute BACPAC Resources website                            Probe design and library screening          To amplify genespecific STSs           D erecta D pseudoobscura D          willistoni and           D littoralis genomic DNA was          isolated from adult flies and used as template for PCR          with degenerate primers Primer sequences are available          upon request Doublestranded nucleotide oligomers          designed from the gene and species specific STSs were          radioactively labeled with P and hybridized to genomic          colony filters   Positive clones were subjected to          PCR to remove false positives and restriction mapped          using           Sal I           Not I           Eco RI           Not I double digestions The          largest clone overlapping all positive hits was sheared          and subcloned into kb plasmids and sequenced using          methods described in   From the results of this          screen we estimated the average number of unique hits          per library per species to be  for           D erecta   for           D pseudoobscura   for           D willistoni and  for           D littoralis  These figures          indicate that these libraries have fewer unique hits than          the expected approximately  coverage Sequences for          these clones have been submitted to GenBank under the          accession numbers AY and AYAY                          Comparative gene prediction          Coding sequences in these fosmid clones were predicted          using the computational pipeline used to reannotate the           D melanogaster genome   The          only major modification to this pipeline was to add an          additional tier of evidence containing the results of          TBLASTN searches of all Release            D melanogaster peptides            against nonmelanogaster sequences Gene predictions were          manually verified and refined using the annotation          platform Apollo   As no EST information exists to          annotate transcribed noncoding sequences such as UTRs          for nonmelanogaster species we annotated only          proteincoding gene and exon models For similar reasons          and to minimize the insertiondeletion of amino acids at          intronexon boundaries we did not require          nonmelanogaster models to obey consensus splice site          rules Annotated sequences were stored and queried in          Gadcompara a cloned version of the           D melanogaster annotation          database Gadfly          To identify orthologous genes in           Anopheles gambiae   scaffolds          from project accession number AAAB were          downloaded from GenBank and searched using default          parameters of TBLASTN    with the           D melanogaster peptides listed in          Supplementary Table  see additional data files as          queries Homologs were identified as HSPs with an          expected value   and   identity over           amino acids                          Alignment and estimation of sequence          conservation          Orthologous regions of the           D melanogaster genome          corresponding to sequenced fosmids were identified using          default parameters of BLAT   against a database made          up of the Release  sequences   The union of          sequences spanning hits to each candidate region was          extracted and is listed in Table  Orthologous coding          and peptide sequences from           D melanogaster were identified by          unique gene symbols in Gadfly using Release  annotations            For genes with alternative transcripts the          transcript leading to the longest translation product was          chosen in most but not all cases Coding and translated          aminoacid sequences from nonmelanogaster species were          extracted from Gadcompara using MySQL queries          Multiple alignment of orthologous aminoacid sequences          was carried out using the default parameters of DIALIGN             Aminoacid alignments were used to align          coding sequences using the gapcds utility of the SEALS          package   to ensure that nucleotide alignment gaps          were inserted between codons Pairwise K           a K           s tests were carried out using PAML             with runmode   as outlined in            Evidence of functional constraint was inferred when twice          the difference in likelihoods between a model with K           a K           s ratio fixed at  versus one with K           a K           s as a free parameter exceeded a          cutoff such that the           p value was less than  per          number of tests Estimates of K           a and K           s in Table were obtained using the          method of Yang and Nielson   which accounts for          differences in nucleotide and codon frequencies as well          as transitiontransversion rate bias implemented in PAML             Multiple aminoacid and coding sequence          alignments are available on request          Annotations of candidate regions in Table were          exported from Gadfly in VISTA format   and used to          evaluate conservation in noncoding sequences          Nontranscribed intergenic and transcribed UTR and          intron noncoding sequences were analyzed together            Pairwise alignment of homologous genomic regions          between           D melanogaster and individual          nonmelanogaster species was performed using default          parameters of the AVID global alignment tool   CNCSs          were identified in VISTA using a window size of  bp          with an identity of  with manual postprocessing to          remove spurious matches at the beginning and end of the          alignments Repeat masking was performed before coding          sequence annotation to identify transposable elements          however it is possible that some CNCSs are simple          repetitive sequences Only sequences from candidate          regions that clearly maintain microsynteny in          nonmelanogaster species were included in estimates of          noncoding conservation Thus the entire           D littoralis ftz Rh and           Rh clones as well as rearranged          segments of the           D willistoni D pseudoobscura and                    D littoralis eve clones           D willistoni and           D pseudoobscura Rh clones and           D willistoni Rh clones were          omitted from analyses of noncoding conservation In          addition we also reanalyzed noncoding conservation          between           D melanogaster and           D virilis using this same approach          for the dataset of   Pairwise genomic alignments and          VISTA regions files are available on request                          Generation of transgenic flies and expression          analysis          The CNCS cluster carrying the           ap brain enhancer was amplified          from           D melanogaster BAC and           D virilis P clones bearing the           ap gene respectively The          following pairs of oligonucleotides were used for PCR          amplification          DmelBRFAAACCATCTCACTCGCATGA

standard           P element transformation            Two independent lines were generated with pChabMelBR and          three with pChabVirBR all of which showed similar          expression patterns Transgenic embryos were          immunostained with monoclonal antigal antibody           Promega as described in                              Additional data files        Supplementary Table
