                 did they mention our topic   yes  vacation spots   okay right anything anything in the area of types of vacations youve been on lately youve really enjoyed   well i  i guess probably my favorite thing to do is to go to the beach um and my most favorite place to do that is San Diego uh i love San Diego very much but this past summer we went to um  Gulf Shores Alabama and had a great time there   uhhuh   the beach was beautiful and and that was really uh a nice place to go so thats  thats probably one of my most favorite places to go how about you   well im a lot the same way we uh i was raised well West Virginia but also Virginia and i spent an awful a lot of time on the Virginia Beach area and i sort of love the water ive always loved the ocean so i enjoy going to the beaches myself as far as a favorite beach um probably Myrtle Beach is as as more of a younger person i havent been there for years id like to go back and see how it has changed but i enjoy Myrtle Beach i enjoy Padre Island right here in Texas but i enjoy pretty much any beaches   uhhuh ive ive heard that Myrtle Beach is wonderful i have friends who think that thats the best place in the world ive ive never been myself but uh you know ive heard that its a wonderful place to go   well i havent been right havent been for twenty years myself but   oh   one of these days ill go back and see how nice it is im sure its just as nice as ever as a as a high schooler and a college kid it was a great place to go it was the big weekend place and things like that especially in the summer the place to go in the summer to get a   yeah sure   you know a summer job and to spend your dollars and uh have fun and everything   sure well also one of my i was thinking another one of my favorite places is uh Santa Fe uh have you ever been to Santa Fe New Mexico   no i havent   well its wonderful   oh ill bet it is   yeah it really is a beautiful place and for the past two falls ive gone there ive made two trips to Santa Fe its sort of becoming an annual thing for me uh i go by myself i go without my family and uh if   what do you do   uh pardon   what do you do while youre there   well  i basically uh i love to visit churches there are wonderful churches in Santa Fe its a real uh its just a wonderful area and this past year i went to a fabulous uh monastery   uhhuh right   uh thats out in the desert uh out in the hills of Santa Fe i also went to one of the Indian pueblos this past year and that was just wonderful   yeah my wife would probably enjoy i mean enjoy wed probably enjoy that also are you Catholic   no im not   okay were were Catholics so wed wed definitely definitely enjoy all the old churches   oh youd really enjoy it then well you would love it because i have a very great appreciation for uh the Catholic church and for Catholic churches and all the ones i visit are Catholic uh   right   one of the places  that i went to is a little place town called Tamayo its out of Santa Fe   uhhuh   and they have theres a sanctuary there there was supposed to be some uh miracle healing that occurred there and it is just a fabulous place i i  i just love Tamayo and its about thirty minutes north of of Santa Fe and   oh no kidding well have to maybe give that a try sometime   well id highly recommend it particularly if youre Catholic i think youd have a great appreciation for it   if youre a a water person my wife still says the best vacation we ever went on with our kids and as a family was we went to one of the Jack Tarr Villages in the Caribbean and we went to one the one located at Puerto Plata   did you Puerto Plata   and you know thats the most reasonable vacation we were ever on we just opened the paper one morning four or five years ago and it said round trip all included seven days hotel food all you could drink just every party everything it was almost like a cruise   ah uhhuh   but uh it was like five ninety nine so we said lets do it so we packed up everyone four of us plus my sons girlfriend we all went and its probably not like i said not only the most reasonable vacation we were ever on and everything was paid for it was just glorious i mean the water was fantastic you get they had pools they had beaches people were so courteous the lodging was fantastic the food was just like being on a cruise ship   huh   everything from Baked Alaska right on down and all this for five hundred and ninety nine dollars it was   uhhuh i mean thats unbelievable the price   oh it is unbelievable and we keep saying that one of these days our kids are getting older now theyre in college and uh be getting married and whatever so we doubt well ever have the opportunity to go back with our with our kids but but were certainly going back but   with your kids   thats probably one place that we really enjoyed   now that didnt include your airfare did it   that included everything airfare lodging every meal i mean if you were a heavy drinker you could sit there and drink twenty five or thirty drinks a day or whatever you wanted i mean just it was everything   gosh good grief   and it was just a a Caribbean type of surrounding very tropical just uh entertainment every night i dont know if youve ever been a cruise ship or not but it was exactly like being on a cruise ship   yeah ive been on a cruise ship   and we were on four cruises and uh
