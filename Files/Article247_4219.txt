                                 Inside the BradleyMcCain Handshake             At their jointappearance in Claremont NH today Bill Bradley and John McCain seemed to besaying much the same thing about campaign finance reform Both see the presentsystem as murderous to democracy McCain said at the event what he has oftensaid before that reform is required in order to give the government of thiscountry back to its citizens Bradley using somewhat stronger languagedescribed big money a plague an acid eating away at the core of ourdemocracy and as a great stone wall that comes between the people and theirrepresentatives As the two men also explained in a Nightline forumtaped before their handshake they both support an outright ban on softmoneythe huge unregulated contributions funneled into the general electionby way of the political parties            But Bradley and McCain dont fully agree about campaign finance reform Someof their differences are subtle ones grounded in their respective politicalorientations For instance Bradley the Democrat thinks that specialinterestmoney works primarily to prevent the government from passing useful new lawslike healthcare reform and regulation of handguns McCain the Republicanthinks that specialinterest money causes the government to waste money onunnecessary programs and prevents it from cutting ones it should get ridof            Other distinctions visible today point up temperamental differences betweenthe two men McCain who is more of a risktaker feels so strongly about softmoney that he has promised not to accept it should he become the nominee nomatter what his Democratic rival does Bradley more cautious by nature hasdeclined to take a pledge of unilateral disarmament McCain is also morecategorical about his moral indictment saying at the press conferencefollowing todays event that specialinterest money corrupts everyone inpolitics himself included Money he said buys access and access isinfluence Bradley by contrast said no decision he had ever made wasinfluenced by money merely that he resented the suspicionthe appearance ofimproprietythat is unavoidable under the present system            But when it comes to what sort of reform is necessary Bradley and McCainactually have big disagreements that they didnt illuminate today Basically itcomes down to this Bradleys idea of campaign finance reform iscomprehensive  He wants to eliminate the role of private money frompolitics once and for all McCains approach on the other hand isincremental  He will be satisfied with reducing the role and power ofspecialinterest money in Washington            Bradley believes that the entire system of financing campaigns needs to beoverhauled To do this he thinks will require not only banning soft money andproviding free TV air time to candidates but also full public financing ofcongressional elections and a constitutional amendment to overturn Buckleyvs Valeo  the  Supreme Court decision that defines spending as speechIn Claremont Bradley employed the metaphor he also uses in his book Money inpolitics is similar to the ants in your kitchen he writes Just when youthink youve got them blocked they find another way to get in Onlyhermetically sealing the kitchen off will work We need to amend theConstitution and provide full public financing he writes because anythingless means that democracy can still be corrupted            McCain agrees with Bradley about how harmful specialinterest money is Buthis own solution is much more modest McCain doesnt think it will be possibleto eliminate the influence of private money from politics or that doing sowould even be desirable He wants to stamp out the most pernicious abusestheenormous contributions by corporations labor unions and wealthy individualsAnd he hopes to level the playing field for challengers and incumbents byproviding free airtime for candidates But McCain does not favor publicfinancing for congressional campaigns and doesnt think its necessary to amendthe Constitution to get meaningful reform            Id give a lot of credit to both McCain and Bradley for trying to explainthis complex problem and make it into a major issue in the campaign But Ithink that McCains less ambitious piecemeal approach makes much more sensethan Bradleys comprehensive one Bradleys desire to solve the problem onceand for all is understandable but his approach is dangerous Amending theConstitution should always be a last resort And in this case the alternativeshavent been exhausted Its not clear that Buckley v Valeo preventsgenuine reformor that even if it does the corruption of the current systemis severe enough to warrant tinkering with the Bill of Rights And in practicalterms whats the point of even discussing a constitutional amendmentwhichrequires a twothirds vote in the Senate as well as ratification by thestatesif you dont have a majority to pass a simple bill            Bradleys sweeping proposals also cut against the nature and history of theproblem Political reform in this country has never taken the form of systemicreengineering Instead it has always been a frustrating but productiveprocess one in which rising expectations and public outrage lead toameliorative legislation and higher ethical standards Bradley ought tounderstand this not only because hes wellversed in the history of politicalreformtheres a chapter on the subject in his bookbut because the challengeof campaign finance reform is so similar to that of tax reform which was hisown greatest legislative accomplishment as a Senator Passed in  taxreform was undone over the course of the following decade The postWatergatecampaign finance reforms were unmade in a very similar waysmart lawyers andlobbyists opened loopholes The loopholes expanded and eventually got to thepoint where a fresh set of reforms was needed Just like campaign financetoday
