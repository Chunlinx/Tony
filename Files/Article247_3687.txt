                                 Does It Pass                        Dear Nat            Ive been looking forward to this book for a long time and I find myselfimpressed annoyed and disappointed Im tremendously impressed by the firstchunk of the book which is a description of the emergence of the SATtestedmeritocracy Lemann is emerging as our leading chronicler of hugely importantbut underreported events And the social transformation he captures here ismomentous It is nothing less than the death of one elitethe WASPEstablishmentand the rise of anotherthe meritocratic establishment            We all sense that this transformation occurred sometime after World War IILemann wont like me invoking them but in The Bell Curve  CharlesMurray and Richard Herrnstein include one fact that starkly illustrates theshift In  the average verbal SAT score for incoming freshmen at Harvardwas  Ninety percent of all applicants whose fathers had gone to Harvardwere admitted By  the average verbal SAT score was  The middlestudent in the  class would have been at the bottom of the  class TheWASP gentlemen had been replaced by brainy strivers            What many of us didnt appreciate until Lemann book is that the ProtestantEstablishment committed suicide for the highest of motives Lemann identifiestwo key players James Bryant Conant the president of Harvard and HenryChauncey a Harvard administrator who went on to become the head theEducational Testing Service Conant was alarmed by the thought that Americamight be developing a hereditary aristocracy He sought to replace it with aPlatonic class of guardians who would be selected by merit and who wouldselflessly serve the public Henry Chauncey didnt have this sort of grandsocial vision but he was enthralled by the possibility of testing with thethought that human beings could be measured and sorted by these fantastic newscientific evaluations Like Conant Chauncey was a member of the ProtestantEstablishment a graduate of Groton and Harvard a man from Puritan stockThese unsung men helped push through the changes that are the basis for ourcurrent social setup            While telling us about Conant and Chauncey Lemann keeps reminding us aboutthe fundamental issues at stake and the central problems inherent in ameritocracy The new SATbased system gave some people more opportunity butalso closed off opportunity for people who couldnt ace the tests Furthermorewerent Conant and Chauncey just undermining one system of social rank andreplacing it with another and possibly even more rigid one I am muchfriendlier to the current elite than Lemann is but he is right to raise allthese issues            Having described this fundamental change the decline of the elite based onblood and breeding and the rise of the elite based on brains it seems to methe next obvious question is What does this mean for America What culture andvalues get adopted by a meritocratic elite How do they see themselves Whatdoes a society led by brainiac strivers look like I confess I read this bookwith some trepidation because I have just completed a book that attempts toanswer just these questions So it was with some relief tinged withdisappointment that I found Lemann veers off and avoids them            The next big chunk of the book is about Clark Kerr and the Californiauniversity system and the fight over the California Civil Rights InitiativeThere must be some law somewhere that says when a liberal starts talking aboutmerit he must immediately move on and talk about race Obviously theaffirmativeaction debate is an important if wellworn controversy But it isnot central to the issues Lemann raises in the first third of the book whichare the problematics of meritocracy As Lemann admits at the end of the bookboth sides in the affirmativeaction debate accept the assumptions ofmeritocracy that its good for the country to have a designatededucationally derived elite So why does he let this book on meritocracy gettaken over by affirmative action            This section on CCRI is a journalistic account about some of the liberalactivists who fought CCRI The story is told through their eyes and it is abiased account I am a nervous opponent of affirmative action and through thiswhole section I felt my point of view was not being treated fairly When I readit again I got angrier It is incredibly unfair to Ward Connerly a leadingopponent who is treated like a hollow front man It treats other opponents ofaffirmative action as oddballs So one opponent is described living in anisolated mountaintop aerie and spending his days talking in a lowconfidential mumble on the telephone Another is a ferociously quiet youngman with a shaved head What does ferociously quiet mean Would Lemann usesuch a menacing phrase to describe a liberal Lemann is generally not crudelybiased but liberal readers will find themselves flattered and conservativereaders will find themselves feeling that they are victims of an injustice            In the final pages of the book Lemann gets off race and returns to the coreissues He asserts that our meritocratic system is unfair that it is anaffront to our egalitarian ideals He asserts that our system measures only anarrow set of skills and selects people too early in their lives These arefair assertions but he never really makes the case in the center of his bookThis last section is only  pages long and contains none of the sociologicaldata or journalistic reportage that would flesh out his assertions He says weshould close the gap between selective colleges and nonselective ones Thatmight be fine for English majors but what about scientists and engineers whoare rarely discussed in this book Wont the ramifications be grave if eliteinstitutions like MIT are disbanded Not everybody on earth is a lawyer or ajournalist despite the impression we journalists often give Lemann doesnthave time in this final tackedon section to address such issues                           The Big Test is worth reading for the superb section on Bryant andConant I learned a lot But I come away thinking Lemann let his narrativesidetrack him from the issue he cares about most The huge question of whetherour current meritocratic system is just or unjust and what we can do aboutit            Im looking forward to your reaction to the book            Highest regardsDavid
