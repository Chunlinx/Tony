                                 White Heat            Should we be sad that JamesCagney is slipping from memory or was it inevitable that his star would fadeThese days Cagneys image tends to flicker Hes that tough guy who talks sofast you can hardly hear the words and who at the end of his films getskilled Few people know Cagneys performances as intimately as they know thehigh points of the performances of Humphrey Bogart or Jimmy Stewart or CaryGrant Or compare Cagney with fellow macho icon John Wayne The punk gangstersstock has fallen while the silent cowboys keeps on rising What Americans dorecall about Cagney theyre likely to have picked up from imitators includingof all people Sammy Davis Jr who loved to mimic his nasal rapidfiredelivery and to reenact that moment at the end of his films when he getsplugged with what seems like  bullets and reels theatrically for  minutesbefore dropping dead            Cagneysslow fade is especially surprising when you consider how much the genre hehelped to invent the gangster film thrives As described by John McCabe inhis oldfashioned and sometimes overly affectionate new biography the streetmilieu that Cagney brought to the screen seems contemporary too He was bornin  on Manhattans Lower East Side into an Irish family facing problemsyou can still see every week on NYPD Blue  His father was a tragiccombination of saloonkeeper and drunk who died relatively young during theSpanish flu epidemic of  His mother was a martyr with Irish red hairthestuff Oedipus complexes are made of He grew up all the way east on th Street in Yorkville and although he seems to have been amamas boy a loner who liked to read tough guys in the neighborhood gave himnicknames like Red Runt and Short Shit and forced him to learn how to fightA few of them also taught him Yiddish a language he adored and drew onthroughout his life for insults He called his main career nemesis studio headJack Warner the Schvontz  one of Yiddishs many creative terms forprick Cagneys first showbiz gig was unplanned and inauspicious a musicalrevue about sailors in drag According to McCabe the need to support hisfatherless family not vain hopes of becoming a star is what drove him            He worked his way up in vaudeville perfecting adistinctive style of dance in which he stiffened his legs and stuck out hisbutt and he was playing a sniveling bootlegger on Broadway when Warnerrecruited him to Hollywood in  While other movie companies of the earlys filmed literary adaptations or drawingroom comedies or musicals WarnerBros which specialized in nofrills realism set Cagney to work in a cycle ofsocialproblem flicksmovies drawn from headlines about striking milk truckdrivers warring taxi unions and of course gangsters These films claimed towarn America about its urban ills but what Cagneys first breakout hit ThePublic Enemy  conveyed was the charisma of the amoral hood Heplayed Tom Powers a street punk who gets rich running booze duringProhibition grows too big for his britches and winds up being shot Otheractors had played scum but only Cagney played scum with an awesome dignitylike a predator in a nature documentary Years later Kenneth Tynan said thiswas the role that let audiences admit theyd take a stinking lowlife over afussbudget hero any day                         The careerthat followed is a good example of how shrewd the old studio system was atfiguring out exactly what a star is supposed to do and an even better exampleof how the system locked stars into an increasingly stultifying caricature oftheir greatest roles Cagney riffed on this hardboiled persona for about adecade most harrowingly in Angels With Dirty Faces  playingRocky Sullivan a killer who freaks out just as hes about to go to theelectric chair The audience is left to guess if Rocky is spineless or if hesjust trying to convince all the kids who worship him that crime doesnt payTo keep his fans from getting bored he improvised what he called goodieslittle touches like kicking a chair out from under his costar Shortly beforehe died Cagney described to McCabe his method of acting Basically helistened Watch Cagney while someone else is speaking and youll see a dartingeye a quivering eyebrow a splitsecond grin He hardly moves but he makeseveryone onscreen seem important and he creates a rare kind of inthescenesuspense            Nonetheless he kept getting stuck with hackdirectors and predictable scripts Relief came when he got to play the greatIrish song and dance man George M Cohan in the musical Yankee DoodleDandy  At last a showcase for his stifflegged routine and a chanceto be recognized as a wholesome patriot instead of a rat He thought hedbroken out of his niche but Warner still wanted to boss him around So in Cagney became one of the first stars to start his own production companyUnfortunately in his rush to change his image he picked a string of sappypseudoprofound roles He was a gentle country newspaperman  Johnny ComeLately   or a lovable alcoholic who sits in a bar all day musing overthe destinies of his friends  Time of Your Life   A couple oftimes during this period hed testscreen a film the audience would object tothe new passive Cagney and hed have to shoot a new ending in which he wentcrazy and punched someone out            McCabeleaves the impression that Cagney never got over this rejection of hissentimental side When he started out in show business he was something of alefty living briefly on a quasisocialist commune in New Jersey sending moneyto striking Mexican lettuce pickers and naming Stalin and Gandhi as hisfavorite human beings in a survey in  But he was less an ideologue than anidealist and as he got older his views shifted to the right In fact beneathCagneys amoral public image there seems to have been a Norman Rockwellstruggling to get out In his spare time he wrote naive mystical verse aboutGods presence in nature All space is filled with wondrous things Unseen byhuman eye Before us hover kings and queens With realms that float and flyPerhaps the most shocking fact revealed in Cagney is the actorslifelong secret desire to leave Hollywood and go into agriculture He bought anumber of farms and apparently loved to sit in the pasture and meditate on hiscows            Cagneys corniness never really worked onscreenthegoodies were drowned out by windy speechesbut when he turned it upside downin White                Heat  his great  comeback to the gangster genre hewas unmatched as a ruthless pervert He played Cody Jarrett the head of abankrobbing gang who was trained in criminality by his mother and who thoughwell into middle age still dotes on her with an infants fierce love WhiteHeat features two of Cagneys greatest primal tantrums in prison when hefinds out that his mother is dead and moans like a maniac and at a chemicalrefinery where he screams Top of the world Ma and then gets shot by thepolice and consumed by fire            To playsomeone this unpredictable today we might turn to an actor like Nicolas CageBut Cages eruptions look narcissistic next to Cagneys When he snaps hesnot responding to other people in a scene hes hearing voices in his head Theother obvious comparisons to Cagney are Robert De Niro and Al Pacino buttheyre prestige actorscerebral introverted and usually not as funny Itried to think of a modern actor who is as natural as Cagney and to mysurprise the name that made the most sense was John Travolta Like Cagney hehas a dancers grace In Saturday Night Fever his charisma elevated junkto greatness and in Pulp                Fiction he played a dirtbag with justthe right winking theatricality Also a few years ago when left to choose hisown material Travolta made the hideous Phenomenon  therebydemonstrating a Cagneyesque taste for treacly fables            The search for a modern Cagney is a vainonenobody could compare to him So why do we remember Wayne so much betterOne reason is that Cagney didnt make enough really great films But theres alarger explanation Wayne had the good luck to rule over Westerns a genre thatwas set on wideopen land and commemorated the past and dealt in stark moraltruthsa genre doomed to grow obsolete leaving Wayne to dominate thelandscape a proud and lonely warrior Cagneys charisma launched what looksdecades later like the most enduring film style of all Hes been sucked intothe cultural ether His skepticism and short fuse which once seemed soradical are taught at the Actors Studio His name may be vanishing but morethan ever hes everywhere
