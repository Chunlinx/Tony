Englishspeakers they can baffle foreigners  Where do weusually find these nonstandard forms  What purposedo they serve  When are they right and whenare they wrong  Why do we usually read them soeasily  There are many questions to be answeredso ow bout takin a kwik look a sum o de mainkindsa nonstandd spellin            From the sheer numerical point of view therecan be no doubt that literature provides us withmost examples of modified spellings the vast majorityin fact being found in dialogues in novels  Authorsusually want to give readers an idea of not justwhat a character says but also how he says it  Inother words they want to indicate how a charactersspeech is delivered and how it may reflect socialcultural or geographical deviations from standardforms  The authors purpose is to give a more realisticpresentation of speech to provide a more vividpicture for readers            Alongside other features such as nonstandardvocabulary regional forms slang etc nonstandardgrammar we was he dont and graphological featuresimPORtant imperfection  modified spellingis an essential ingredient in many novels  The use ofsuch modified spelling in literature is generally referredto as eye

Faulkner The Sound and the Fury                        Opportunities to modify spelling may be moreor less limitless but they may also be rather dangerousIf an author tries to make a fairly accurate transcriptof say a regional accent by using a good dealof eye dialect the printed version may end up withalmost every word being altered  At this pointreaders will be faced with a barrage of unusual lettercombinations a complex code that needs to be unraveledThe consequences may be disastrous withreaders forced to concentrate more on decipheringthe words than considering their meaning losing

        To bring some order to this possible chaos a setof unwritten rules has emerged for the use of modifiedspelling in direct speech in novels  The most importantrule of thumb is to avoid overburdening readerswith anything like a close transcript of what mightactually have been said  Since readers are alreadyusing their imagination when reading a novel a goodwriter must simply encourage them to imagine what acharacters speech may actually sound like by providingthem with a smattering of eyedialect markersIn other words just a handful of wellchosen modifiedspellings indicating that a characters speech isnonstandard should be enough to convince readers ofthe mock speech reality the author is trying to create            Most authors therefore limit nonstandard formsto small sections of direct speech and only rarelyare major characters given much nonstandard dialogueA sprinkling of dropped hs or modified conjunctionsis often quite enough  Indeed there arecertain common lexical items that are regularly subjectedto this treatment and readers have probablyalready seen them elsewhere or quickly become accustomedto them  This group includes conjunctionsan n cos  prepositions o bout btween  commonverb forms ave spokn woz wuz and pronounsas shown in the table on the next page            Other common lexical items that are often alteredinclude elided verb forms wanna cannadunno and question words linked to verbs wodyaowja  A pattern emerges here the words that arewritten with nonstandard spellings are generallyshort words which carry little essential meaning andwhich are repeated often enough for readers to becomefamiliar with them  They remind readers of acharacters way of speaking without distracting fromwhat is actually being said            When an author wishes to indicate a geographicalor regional variety a few key markers are againusually quite enough  The use of v instead of f Its avine day is almost enough on its own to indicate aspeaker from southwest England repeated t in placeof the Its in t house suggests a Yorkshire dialectthe use of e instead of a indicates a South Africanspeaker Shell I give you e hend a long drawnoutaw rather than a shorter o suggests a southern USspeaker Hes gawn fishin with his dawg  Foreignspeakers of English can quickly be identified withone or two key sounds a v for a w suggests a Germana z for a th pinpoints a French speaker  Likewisewhen Englishbased pidgins and creoles arewritten down the phonetic transcriptions use a similarsystem of modified spellings to indicate pronunciationExamples abound in the writings of authorsfrom the Caribbean West Africa Oceania and soon  We come across dialogue extracts such asE better so  No be for umbrella we de roast forsun since waka come here dis morningChinua Achebe Anthills of the Savannah                        Most of the conventions established for representingnonstandard forms of English are applied to Englishbasedpidgins and creoles when used in literature            Writers can also use eye dialect to indicate socialclass or level of education  A common practicein novels is to show the speech of the lower classesor poorly educated with dropped hs and other truncatedforms  A further device used to indicate a lackof education is incorrect spellingwhat we couldterm pointless spelling changes  When an authorwrites what as wot no indication of pronunciation isbeing given the same is true for a number of otherwords woz skool gon sez sed our rite  In suchcases the writer is using a phonetic spelling that remindsus of the incorrect attempts made by childrenor the uneducated at spelling these words            But wot as a modified spelling of what is notrestricted to novels  It regularly crops up in graffitiin press advertising in humorous publications insigns  Its wrongness immediately attracts peoplesattention and at least as far as graffiti is concernedit helps to set up a kind of antiestablishment bondThe proverbial writing on the school wall is Downwith skool  When such spellings are used in signsand advertising for their eyecatching value theyare usually referred to as sensational spellings  Aclassic example is the muchquoted slogan BeanzMeanz Heinz used in Britain  Advertisementsalong the roadside sometimes use sensational spellingto an extreme degree especially in the US  Thefollowing table has some typical examples            For similar reasons trade names often employmodified spellings particularly when two or morewords are put together to make a brand name  Someexamples are Accurist Dabitoff Dunlopillo KleenexKwiksave Loctite PlakOut Playskool Trufit WestcloxWindolene Xpelair            In a few cases a modified spelling can move intoan everyday standard area of usage  Though isfrequently seen as tho and through as thru in thruwaythe official spelling for many US state roads            High spelled as hi is frequently found in compoundssuch as hijack

certain alternative spellingsmany of which has come about through misspellingsSome common examples are given in thefollowing table            Of course some language purists object to allforms of modified spelling outside dialogues in novelsLeaving aside unintentional errors spellingsome people claim that in Dickens wot is acceptablewhile almost everywhere else it is wrong  Suchdistinctions are hard to substantiate and deny thefact that alternative spellings can serve the purposeof being eyecatching or distinctive or even creatinga social tie  A comparison with some other languagesparticularly languages with a largely phoneticspelling systemGerman Italian Spanishshows that this range of nonstandard spellings is anadded bonus that our quirky English spelling systemhas given to the language  It is often impossible fortranslators for example to transfer the implicationsand undercurrents suggested by modified Englishspellings into another language  The multiplicity ofEnglish spelling can therefore provide readers witha rich source of extra information that should clearlybe looked on as a positive enriching feature of thelanguage  In the right place a wrong spelling isoften just the rite thing                              As I travelled the province I found a bureaucraticquagmire stewing in the ugly builtin racism that is anecho of Canadas colonial past

are concerned sexualharassment as well as related issues like pornographyhave now replaced both legalized abortionand equal opportunity as the central issues ofthe sexual politics of the s with the obvious politicaland legal ramifications            It may be of interest then to consider the languagein which this debate is normally carried outan examination of which I propose will revealsomething of the assumptions and limitations governingvirtually all discussions of the issue            Let me make my own ideological position explicitAlthough routinely denied it is not alwaysclear whether what is being condemned is sexual harassmentor just sex  Or put differently onesviews of sexual harassment are inevitably intertwinedwith ones views of healthy sexuality andas others have pointed out  the current debate hasbeen framed by the largely puritanical segment ofthe womens movement            Indeed I would maintain that the language ofsexual harassment reflects this ideological bias  Tostart consider the expression to make sexual advances Clearly the term has a formal and legalisticconnotation which is hardly neutral  Althoughsomeone might reasonably characterize ones ownbehavior as flirting for example it is unlikely thata person would report making sexual advancesexcept facetiously  The term usually appears expandedin one of two ways univited sexual advancesand unwanted or unwelcome sexual advances   Thedistinction is significant  What is an invited sexualadvance    If A invites B to make a sexual advancethen A has made an uninvited sexual advance anyinitial step is uninvited by definition  To construeuninvited sexual advances as a form of sexual harassmentis to condemn all sexual advances                           Unwanted sexual advances are rather differentWhereas uninvited sexual advances can be identifiedby both parties before they occur unwanted sexualadvances are presumably identifiable by one partyonly after they occur ie when they have been rejectedThe party receiving the sexual advance mayknow in advance that it is not wanted but not theparty making the sexual advance  Indeed it seemslikely that the behavior in question is more likely tobe characterized as a sexual advance if it is rejectedOne does not usually respond favorably to asexual advance  Furthermore invitations that areclearly nonsexual are rarely referred to as advancesat all  To make advances means to make sexual advances The word advances is itself emotionallycharged            But to repeat the people engaged in the behaviorreferred to rarely use such terms at all  Sowhat terms do they use            Well to court or to woo someone sounds absolutelyVictorian whereas to seduce someone soundsmorally reprehensible  Expressions like to come onto someone or to hit on someone or to make a pass being largely informal seem to have a frivolous orsometimes even a threatening connotation  Youngpeople will sometimes talk of working on someonewhich sounds exploitative  Even flirting implies acavalier attitude which may be innocuous but whichalso may connote a lack of sincerity            I have been intentionally vague regarding thegrammatical subject and object of these verbs  Firstit is clear that heterosexuality is assumed unlessthere is some evidence to the contrary  Furthermorewomen do not normally court men and althoughboth men and women may flirt or seduce  a sentencelike My neighbor hit on my friend out of context willtypically be understood to refer to a male neighborand a female friend and not viceversa            There is a whole range of behaviors which aresexually ambiguous to a certain extent almost bydefinition a fact which is reflected in expressionslike to ask for a date or to express an interest in someonewhere the sexual interest is tacit but not explictSimilarly expressions like to try to connectwith or to try to get next to someone may or maynot express sexual intent            So unless I have missed a range of expressionsthe conclusion one can draw from the above is thatthe language we use to describe the initial attemptsto establish sexual relations is either puritanical orhostile or frivolous or ambiguous hardly the rangeone would expect in an open sexually healthy egalitariansociety  The semantic hole is itself a symptomof the disease                         See for example Camille Paglia The Joy of Presbyterian SexThe New Republic  December   pps  or SusieBright The Prime of Miss Catherine MacKinnon In TheseTimes  pp   I feel obligated to add that as someone accusedof sexual harassment my interest in these issues is notpurely academic            I take the approaches made by prostitutes to be classic examples ofuninvited sexual advances   Whatever ones views of prostitutionhowever one would be hard pressed to seriously consider suchbehavior as a form of sexual harassment  Incidentally a relatedlinguistic usage and one which I agree is pernicious is illustratedby the allegation that certain persons invite offensive behavioreven violencethrough for example their dress or appearanceThe contradiction is clear  If neither dress nor appearance constitutesan invitation to make sexual advances then it is difficult to seehow the fact that sexual advances are uninvited should be sufficientbasis for allegations of sexual harassment            One obvious example of a semantic hole in sexual relationshipsis the oftenobserved absence of neutral terms for unmarried sexualpartners  A colleague writes that his university is seriouslyconsidering the expression spousal equivalent   The caricature hasnow become the reality                              Language at Bay            Much of Rhode Island fronts on NarragansettBay hence is called the

Certain routes which arenot necessarily the highest longest or highest onesin the area are known as classics             A pitch is one ropes length of a route whilethe most difficult part is called the crux   There isalways a belay or anchor point at the ends of eachpitch  Utilizing one of these or using the rope tosafeguard another climber is belaying   A psychologicalbelay is one that would not support a fallingclimber  Loops of rope or tape called slings  fittedwith karabiners or krabs metal snaplinks are usedfor running belays or runners   These are placed onthe rock face during the ascent and used to preventthe leader from falling too far  Slings can be slippedover points of rock attached to pitons metal spikesor chocked fitted into cracks with shaped pieces ofmetal  These pieces are called chocks small pebbleswere originally used for this purpose or nutsthe earliest metal chocks being nuts with the screwthreadsdrilled out  A small chock on a thin wiresling is a baby on

theclimber uses the inside edge of his boot on a verynarrow hold he is edging             Over the years climbers have developed a systemof calls  Tight rope means take in any slackrope while slake slack means let out a littlemore rope  The leader shouts Taking in when hereaches the top of a pitch and begins gathering inthe slack  When the rope goes taut the second answersThats me the leader

situationin presentday use of the English language viz tautologicalmodes of expression  But I do not agreewith the statement in his first paragraph that onecannot enclosed an item anywhere but herewithHis solicitor could well have stated We have pleasurein enclosingwith a statement that we are mailingseparately  A field may also be enclosed in abarbedwire fence and not in any way herewith            I also take exception to considering They gaveus a number of donations as tautological  Thephrase a number of is one of several that are commonlyused at least in American English with

Withregard to the first it must be noted that withoutspecifying where an item is enclosed it would usuallybe construed as accompanying the messagehence I should agree that enclosed herewith is redundantAs for fence enclosures that is anothersense of enclose  Editor                               Regarding Brian Daviss EPISTOLA XX andhis list of tautologies I believe that enclosed herewithis but a borderline example if one at all  Myunderstanding is that when a check for example isplaced within the fold of its cover letter it is properlyreferred to as being enclosed or enclosedherein   If an enclosure is not within the letter butseparate from it in the same envelope it is enclosedherewith             Anyone with half an eye will be able to find asenclosure whether it is in or with the covering letterbut it is my belief that while adequate Englishcan be readily understood good English precludesif possible any misunderstanding                              We would not dare to disagree but the distinctionbetween enclosed herein and enclosed herewithseems a finicky needleseye of pedantry and itsmacks of reconstruction of something that wasnever structured to begin with

accreditation            My point however is serious  Sexual orientationdoes not confer taste the lack of it or a set ofsocially approved or disapproved styles ormoreimportantvalues  Your closing comment on theresearch suggesting homosexuality is generelatedseems well off the mark in this regard            The entire drift of your article on sexism in languageis that much sexual behavior is shaped bynature  Since the sexual orientation heterosexual isgenetic it stands to reason that the eternally recurringvariant sexual orientation homosexual likewisehas a genetic base            Acknowledging that however frees no onefrom accepting responsibility for her or his behaviorNor does the hypothesized genetic link explainthe awesome variations within the different sexualorientations  Chromosomes do not exculpate thepredators Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy and theycertainly cannot reductively account for the prose ofHemingway or Proust                              My point about mauve was that it has no particularusage associations but that devine and adorable among other words are associated with ways inwhich some women but probably no men exceptthose imitating women sarcastically homosexuals orinterior decorators express themselves  I certainlydid not say or suggest that all homosexuals or indeedall of any group of speakers use any particularword with any consistency  Being either homosexualor heterosexual male or female or fitting intoany one of the myriad gradations between those extremeshas nothing whatsoever to do with taste orvalues and I did not imply that it does            My closing comment referred to current researchthat attempts to show that homosexuality isgenerelated which I termed fatalistic because itwould appear to relieve any individual of responsibilityfor his actions as we learn from frequent pressreports defense attorneys are seeking exonerationfor their clients on the grounds that although theycommitted the crime in question it was circumstancesabusewhen they were children is quitepopularthat were responsible for their actionsand they should be let off            I did not write anywhere that much sexual behavioris shaped by nature  I wrote one must becareful to distinguish between nature in which wemust recognize that there are differences betweenmales and females and bias which ought not be toleratedI keep an open mind on the question of thegenetic origins of heterosexuality and homosexualityI regard efforts to stereotype or categorize peopleas futile as they are tediousEditor                              Re your recent OBITER DICTA XXI Im sorryyou did not delve further into the idea that the wordblack is on its way out  I hope not though I haveseen people of color  a far better descriptive termbeing used more frequently  I do however prayfervently that the use of AfricanAmerican wouldvanish completely  It is cumbersome and greatlymisleading and it sounds sycophantic  Whenever Ihear a white person use that term I feel he isproudly intimating an obvious lack of prejudice  Idraw an analogy between that and the time I heardmy German landlady announce that she was going toa wedding between her niece and a very nice Jewishboy suggesting strongly that this Germanharbored no prejudice towards Jews            Whenever I see the term AfricanAmerican with its sixteen letters in print twelve times in asingle article I wonder if the writer realizes howmuch space is wasting and how pedantic it allsounds            Let me put a few cases as the lawyer said toPip in Great Expectations Suppose the followingpeople came to the United States and became citizensa Moroccan Jew from Casablancaa Rhodesian policemana Boer farmer from just outside Johannesburgan Egyptian taxidriver                        Are they all AfricanAmericans  The word is a hyphenatedmisnomer                              The problem lies in the fact that people lack a senseof history  Black  used by Americans refers to Negroesbut colonial Britons have used it to refer toany darkskinned people particularly southeastAsians  People of color is an old facetious euphemismfor Negroes it is the plural of gentleman ofcolor  Colored man woman person people  etc allseemed quite satisfactory and have been used byNegroes to refer to themselves  The picture is furtherconfused by the term Cape coloured  South AfricanEnglish for a person of racially mixed parentageBut then there was the old vaudevilleminstrel tune My gals a highborn lady  Shesblack but not too shady  She aint coloredshewas born that way  which would invoke greatwrath today  The problem with colored is thattaken literally it can be used to refer to anyone whois not white  There isor wasa US newspapercalled The AfroAmerican  and there is a popularmagazine called Ebony   As Mr Livingston pointsout AfricanAmerican isor can beambiguousand is a poor choice solely on that ground  Thepress in the US is virtually enjoined these days fromidentifying people by race in the text of articles apractice that has extended to the banning of songsand spirituals like Ol Black Joe   But that is gotround either by showing a photograph or by makingcertain that we learn the subjects name is Wong FuTakashimaya Goldberg ORourke Nielsen GandhiRashid Zbigniew Molotov  etc though one is lesslikely these days to be able to identify race color orethnicity from certain names like Livingston for exampleThese are linguistic clues and can be misleadingcf Whoopi Goldberg   The problem lies notin the name but in the prejudices of bigots and inthe perception of those who are discriminatedagainst  Undeniably there is prejudice against Negroesin many Western societies and as long as thatprejudice exists it will attach to the name of thoseagainst whom the prejudice is felt or practicedThus we can be confident that as time passes theterm AfricanAmerican will be exchanged for somethingelse perhaps Negro will again become the politicallycorrect term  Other words like darky  aretaboo leading to a change in the lyrics of JeromeKerns Ol Man Ribber now probably Old ManRiver            Racial and religious slurs and epithets aboundsometimes those who use them are not even awarethat they are offensive like the term Hebrew for aJew  Older dictionaries labeled the term Jewess asoffensive but I have heard Jewish women refer tothemselves using the word evidently oblivious towhat lexicographers identified as insulting            I quite agree that AfricanAmerican is both cumbersomeand undescriptive I am also aware thatmany blacks do not use the term Jesse Jackson usesblack  and the NAACP has retained Colored People inits name  Not the smallest part of the problem arisesbetween those who seek the general acceptance ofanonymity in which any identifying reference is eschewedand those who stridently voice their ethnicityand race Editor                                Blessing of the AnimalsPets of all

unclear  Of unknownorigin and origin uncertain are blankwalls beyond which few can go  Perhaps indicatesthe lexicographers wish to be helpful or to solve aproblem or not to be beaten probably a slightlyfirmer resolve or more dangerously tidiness ofmind  But the fact remains that some hundreds ofwords that have entries in a standard dictionary remainetymological mysteries  And some of these areour everyday companions whose credentials we donot doubt and whose very ordinariness leads us totake them for granted            Take surf  the swell of the sea which breaks onthe shore and slides back with Arnolds slow forgivingroar  Surf is first found in  on the coastof India and bearing a strong resemblance to suff found  years earlier on the same coast and withmuch the same meaning may be presumed to be avariant form of the same word it may also be assumedto be of Indian origin  In fact as late as crossing the surf can be described as an expressionequivalent to entering or leaving India as a personis never supposed to venture across this tremendousbarrier of the Coromandel coast unless on such momentousoccasions  But from the middle of theth century this sense had been supplemented bya more generalized but at the same time more precisesense of the mass or line of white foamy watercaused by the sea breaking upon a shore or a rockSurf in Australian English of course has this generalmeaning but is used mostly of the sea and particularlythe surf as a place of recreation  It is earliestrecorded in  in a couplet Arnold would havebeen proud to claimThe Manly maidens shoot the surfOr bake their bingies on the shingly shore                        In this sense and with a host of compounds amplifyingand asserting the recreational possibilitieswe tend to think of it as our own and as an importantpart of our social history  But it is as much a part ofinternational English as it is of Australian as theprovenance of the range of compounds suggests  Soto take only a selection of the more common termssurfbathing dates from  surfboard from surfboat from  surfriding from  and surfswimmerfrom  all long before the first Australianenjoyment of the surf is recorded in the earlyyears of this century  What is our own and whatlight do the terms collectively throw on our societyFirst surf as a verb  seems to be an abbreviationof the now obsolete surfbathe   Andsurfbathing was not always respectable  As a writerin the Sydney Truth observed in  I think respectablepeople may go surfbathing and still remainrespectable but people who arent moral andrespectable do not become so by shooting the breakersand airing their figures on the beach  Or in theterms of a dialogue reported in the same journal Oh Auntie said the child whats surfbathingSomething the savages do on boards replied theaunt vaguely  The difficulty lay in the garmentsworn and the degree of exposure they allowed  As alocal government ordinance put it in All persons bathing in any waters exposed to viewfrom any wharf street public place or dwellinghousein the Municipal District of Manly before thehour of  in the morning and after the hour of oclock in the evening shall be attired in properbathing costume covering the body from neck to theknee  Any person committing a breach of this Bylawshall be liable to a penalty not exceeding onepound                        The existence of surf beaches within the environs ofSydneyat Bondi Bronte Coogee and Tamaramain the south and Manly to the northmeant that thebattle of the beaches was fought in Sydney andwhen respectability was obtained that it was in theterms of an activity very much associated withSydney surflifesaving  Surf club  glossed as lifesavingclub is first found in  Surf and LifeSavingClub in   The surf carnival  wasinitially as much a publicrelations exercise as a competitiveoccasion the iron man  unheardof            The earliest term for a swimmer who preferredswimming in the surf to swimming in the baths atfor instance Coogee was surfbather   Thiswas soon joined and ultimately replaced by surfer and the earliest quotation for surfer  beingpart of an account of a surfers companion adainty article intended to hold bathing suit and wettowel in a waterproof case suggests that there wasa potential market amongst the fraternity a writer in saying emphatically that SurfBathing is dangerousfor women  The surfers companion  incidentallywas irrefutably Australian being made ofdingo skin  The contemporary surfie  at leastpartially replaces surfer in its turn though it invokesthe image of the monosyllabic cretin who speakstwo words of English yeah and man streaks hishair with Clairol and worst of all drinks milk  Inother words a Bondi surfie  dated as it now is is formany still predominant            Frequenting the surf entailed sunbaking without fear of the consequences and shooting waves with the ambition of scraping yournose after a shoot on the sand of the beach itselfor cracking a beacher   Refinements of bothactivities have been made over the years as bodysurfing is distinguished from boardsurfingor boardriding  though the latter use of board first recorded by Captain Cook in  cannotreally be claimed as Australian                                             VERBUM SAP                                          Par for the Coarse            When my eye came a cropper on the wordornariness in a headline in the Toronto Globe andMail  I was pretty sure it was either a misspelling oran editors plain orneriness  Nearly all current dictionariesbore out my first suspicion  They gave theroot word as ornery  admitting no variants  The exceptionwas the Oxford English Dictionary  whichlisted four obsolete variants including ornary whichas it turns out is the most etymologically logicalThe adjective which now means contrary or obstinatewas originally just a lazy pronunciation of ordinary That is also what it meant  The earliest recordeduse is an  quotation from the MarylandHistorical magazine The land is old completelyworn out the farming extremely ornary in generalAn  citation mentions a onehorned cowmighty onnerylookin  By the s the spellinghad regularized to ornery  and the meaning had degeneratedto disagreeable or cantankerous  Thispejorative development was not extraordinary becausethe word ordinary had itself taken on a debasedsense  Among the definitions listed by SamuelJohnson in his  dictionary were mean of lowrank ugly not handsome            It is probably a characteristic of humanityseternal upward struggle that good enough is nevergood enough and neutral terms like ordinary mediocreaverage soso runofthemill  and indifferenttend to take on negative connotations  A classic ofcourse is coarse   This word seems to have poppedup in the early th century as an adjectival form ofcourse ordinary order or normal manner  Forthree centuries there was no spelling distinction betweenthe two but the noun was pronounced with along u sound COORSE  The earliest uses of theadjective referred to fabrics to distinguish ordinaryor runofthemill cloth from finer weaves  But evenbefore that century was out the sense had depreciatedto denote inferiornot just averagequality            When the vowel sound in the noun changedfrom long u to the same sound as in coarse  a needwas evidently felt to have a spelling distinction so asto tell the two apart in print  Isaak Walton is theearliest known to have used the modern spellingwhen in The Compleat Angler  he wrote of theworst or coarsest fresh water fish  Coarse has undergonea thorough pejoration once it began to beused for people in the sense of unrefined or indelicatefull stigmatization was probably guaranteedNow it passes as a synonym for indecent obscene  orgross three words that have also gone through somedownward sense development                           Ornery is one of a clutch of bristly words withodd and often controversial etymologies  Johnsonbelieved that ugly  which was sometimes spelledoughly  derived from ouph  a variant of elf   Modernexperts are satisfied that it grew from Old Norse uggligrto be feared or dreaded                           Cantankerous is even more moot  Ernest Weekleyspeculated in  that because the earliest writtenuses are in Goldsmith and Sheridan in the thcentury it might have been Irish in origin  EarlierJ C Hottens Slang Dictionary suggested it might bea corruption of contentious   Most dictionaries todayaccept the theory that it arose from a Middle Englishword conteck quarrelling or contention  Theagentnoun would have been contecker and the adjectiveconteckerous   The latter according to thecurrently accepted theory became contankerous and then cantankerous  influenced by cankerous andrancorous             It is well known that onceordinary words forfarmers or people of low birth became debasedthrough class contempt knave villain boor  andchurl are only a few examples  Surely is one of thevery few words to result from the same process butin reverse  In the mid th century it was sirly likea sir or lordly haughty imperious arrogant superciliousThe modern sense of illhumored orrudely morose dates from about the midth centurybut the u spelling had taken over about ahundred years earlier perhaps one fancies as an actof revenge by the churls            If surly is a product of class contempt backwardsobnoxious is a thoroughly democratic erroreverybody got it wrong  The main word noxious isthe harmful or injurious one  Obnoxious means orrather meant exposed or liable to harm vulnerableThis sense is clear in John Evelyns French Gardener which recommends covering certainplants with straw in winter to secure them fromthe frosts to which they are obnoxious  This meaningis obsolete but it hung on until late in the lastcentury even though the current sense of offensiveor highly disagreeable began to make inroads asearly as c             Perhaps the most vexing of all these crossgrainedwords is peevish  Oxford just throws up itshands and cries Derivation unknown addingNone of the etymological conjectures hitherto offeredare compatible with the sensehistory            Conjectured ancestors include the LowlandScottish peu to make a plaintive noise and the Danishpiave to whimper whine or cry like a child  Itmay also be related to the bird pewit or peewit imitating its cry  Peevish  from which the noun andverb peeve appear to have been backformed hasbeen used since the th century with a wide varietyof senses including childish silly waywardthoughtless froward uncouth perverse whichsome think is the source and even witty            A word with that many diverse senses is aboutas extraornary as they come                              German Loanwords in English            Now that Sidney I Landau has become entrenchedas Editor in Chief at Cambridge UniversityPress in New York we are begining to see reflexesof his expertise in

the right setting then goes on in PartI with An historical overview by semantic fields andin Part II with a Linguistic overview which treatsmatters like Phonology and Graphemics GrammarWordFormation

descriptive definitionsAs is to be expected most of the entries arescientificthat is not particularly gemutlich  somemay be disputable as in the cases of words like geochemistrygeomedicine geophyte geoscience etcwhich are described as translations from GermanGeochemie Geomedizin Geophyt and Geowissenschaft respectively unless such formation is acknowledgedby an author in their first manifestationsin English text these and others could just as wellhave been English coinages and many are so characterizedin English dictionaries  An outstanding exceptionis geopolitics  acknowledgedly from GermanGeopolitik  but even in that case there are antedatingovertones from Swedish and French  Suchthings are arguable and it is neither useful nor interestingto try to settle trivialities  But one is given towonder about the treatment of Geiger counter which we know is a radiation counter developed bythe German physicist Hans Geiger evidently workingwith someone named Mller whose given nameappears to have disappeared but who once sharedthe honors as the former name of the device wasGeigerMller counter  this is described as a translationof Geigerzahler lit Geiger counter replacingGeigerrohr lit  Geiger tube but how it can be soanalyzed when the counter sense is inherent in thefunction of the device and Geiger can scarcely besaid to be a translation of Geiger  is a little hard tojustify  As the term arose only about seventy yearsago it is probably well documented  W Mllercrops up again in GeigerMuller threshold alsocalled Geiger threshold  not listed in the book

reflects an admitted prejudice against thematerial which is about as quippy and clever as thebrickwall comedians one must suffer on odd nightson obscure cable channels in the US  Further on inthe Preface one reads that major collections of wellerismsin some of the European languages arereadily available and the implication that what wehave here is representative of the rich British andAmerican

Bernardnot only carefully documents his ideas about the variousinterpretations that might be given the curiouslyanomalous references in the song but suggestspossible variants  At bottom his conjecture

received from readers which rarely if ever appearin the newspapers where his column is syndicatedThe names of these correspondents are indexedenabling potential bookbuyers to confirmtheir immortality

Times should be aware that he also writes awidely syndicated weekly column on language forthe Sunday Magazine of the NY Times  Lately thiscolumn has been focused a bit too frequently for mytastes on the jargon that echoes within the Beltwaythatis insiders Washington DC for the uninitiatedAnother complaint is his detailed treatmentof the semantics of a word appropriateperhaps to synonym studies in

television inparticular especially after the socalled watershedhour of nine oclock which some are trying toput off till ten oclock  In this comprehensive studyTimothy Jay who teachers at North Adams State Collegein Massachusetts divides his subject into severalsubcategories Cursing Profanity BlasphemyTaboo Obscenity Vulgarity Slang Epithets andScatology  Although he defends these classificationsby detailed discussion and definition it is not easy toapply them for the distinctions tend to be blurredBlasphemy and profanity  for instance are differentiatedon the grounds that the former treats somethingsacred with abuse irreverence or contemptwhile the latter is an attack on religion or religiousdoctrine  These are points too subtle to be readilygrasped  The term taboo in linguistics means simplyproscribed by society as improper or unacceptableRHD  but Jay prefers the narrow somewhatarchaic anthropologists definition that focuses onsupernatural and ritualistic interdiction  Thedefinition he accepts for obscenity is as alegal termwhich he expatiates on to confusion  In the sameway he accepts a traditional definition of vulgarity languageof the common person not necessarilyobscence or taboobut that is not themeaning most people would apply in the context of abook on cursing  The perception and usage of theseterms is personal and I for example prefer to usevulgar to describe current manifestations like RoseanneButthead and Beavis  and other televisionshows that exhibit crude situations encountered byrude people drawings and graphic style as inButthead  some of the artwork in Mad Magazine and many of the new cartoons on the television are extraordinarilyvulgar and tasteless without any redeemingquality            It is likely that ones taste deteriorates under thecontinuous barrage of vulgarity many who today admirethe dadaists cubists surrealists hardedge realistsnonobjective and abstract artists would have reviledthem along with a significant percentage of thepopulation had they been dalive when their paintingsfirst appeared just as staid conservative criticscondemned the impressionists and advocates of othernouvelles vagues   Is it that we gradually become accustomedto what we first perceive as trashas vulgarityandbecome inured to it or that we come tounderstand and if not enamored of it at least tolerateit as a legitimate form of expression            To be sure one is no longer shocked at hearinghell and damn on radio or television or even readingit in the press although both were taboo a scanttwenty years ago  Programs and films that are broadcaston television after ten oclock in the evening areno longer censoredeven in the United Statesformentions of shit and piss  though fuck  which canoccasionally be heard on British television has notas far as I know made it to the American mediaStill it is worth pointing out that the shock felt wasnot at hearing these words but at hearing them onradio and television where everyone knew theywere banned  In other words the context was inappropriateas if one heard his priest say Goddammit despite the fact that one said it oneself wheneversomething went awry  The s Hollywoodcensors ban on showing even a married couple inthe same bed or a man putting on his trousers andzipping or buttoning his fly seems ludicrouslyprudish to us today  But the motivations of thosecensors driven by powerful conservative religiousgroups were quite different and we ridiculed themeven then because of their interference with the everydayfacts of life  It is difficult today to find a filmmade in the past decade that does not contain whatmust be regarded as an obligatory nude scene andin many instances such scenes have no integral partin the plot  To me vulgarity means bad tastewhether deliberate as in the case of Roseanne  orunintentional as in the case of crude drawingsfoisted on us as art            The chief problem with these and other definitionsis that some are based on semantics the intentof the speaker and the understanding of the hearerothers on usage and others on referents  In a subjectwhere there are no fixed criteria of definition itis unfair to criticize an attempt at classification afterall we have been putting up with ambiguous definitionsfor the eight parts of speech for as long as anyonecan remember yet we find their occasional applicationconvenient  In short the perception ofthese terms is culturedependent and culture is akinto language in the sense that while a large number ofpeople might be said to speak a language we knowthat it is made up of a larger number of dialectswhich in turn are made up of a still larger numberof idiolects            To some extent these social aspects of languageare accounted for in Cursing in America  but thestudy is married by the lack of uptodate data someof the more interesting tables result from surveysdone in the late s and one can be certain thatthings have changed markedly since then            On the other hand I found utterly fascinatingthe chapter Censorship which describesrathercursorily I regret to sayseveral US court cases inwhich defendants were charged with various violationsstemming from their use of bad language  Inthe case of the State unspecified vs Dreifurstmore detailed comments is forthcoming but it is difficultto understand whether the source of the expositionthat follows is the authors or a rewording anddigest of the proceedings            The writing is easy to read and colloquial bywhich I mean it contains the classic solecisms thatpurists deride  Disturbing are the gaps in informationAppendix I consists of several lists of films from  etc totaling  in all andshowing for each the Total number of twentysevenBad

population  No comment is offeredon the selection of the films  Other manipulationsof the data are described in general but are notreflected in detail in the statistics            On the whole Cursing in America  while an interestingbook does not go very far in presenting acogent analysis of the present situation or its historyThe fault lies partly in the difficulty in securingfunding for proper studies in the area on the otherhand one cannot help feeling that studies that havebeen done could have been better conceived andorganized  There is a miscellaneous Bibliographywhich seems to include every linguistics book andarticle the author has ever read and a pitifully poorIndex containing about seventy items            Laurence Urdang                              Pronouncing Dictionary of Proper Names            The lengthy subtitle is given above because it isthe most succinct way to describe the contents  Aninteresting additional bit of information is buried inBollards Preface to witPronunciations were actually prooflistenedThrough facilities made available byATT Bell Laboratories of Murray Hill NewJersy all pronunciations were actually heardusing speechsynthesis technology                        That is probably the first time such a procedure hasbeen followed            The Introduction constitutes a brief but comprehensivecourse in pronunciation and a detailed descriptionof the symbols used both for English andfor foreign pronunciations like that of the Welshll sound the German sound and sound etcThe transcriptions are mercifully what phoneticianscall broad which provide the basic informationneeded to be able to reproduce the pronunciation ascompared with narrow in which detailed phoneticfeatures are reflected that are useful for specialistsbut clutter up the field for ordinary users  The socalledsimplified respelling is what I usually refer toas the Moo Goo Gai Pan school of phonetic transcriptionconcoted for those too lazy to learn even thesimplest rudiments of phonetic transcription whichused to be taught in highschool English Courses duringthe few hours spent on How to Use the DictionaryThe schwa is anathema in this pattern uh substitutesfor it  Still the user must contend withmacrons over some vowels and with the intrusive h which crops up here and there in order to lengthen avowel  Although it might be seen as commendable tomake the interpretation of pronunciation symbols aseasy as possible for the laziest users I have littlesympathy for the policy in most cases those who aretoo lazy to learn even the rudimentary respelling systemsused in popular dictionaries like the variouscollege and desk dictionaries are also too lazy to lookup the pronunciation of a name or word as is evidenceddaily in the utterances of newscasters andannouncers            Of some complexity in English is the pronunciationof r it disappears entirely in syllablefinal andpreconsonantal positions in some dialects of English harbor hb in others it is reduced to coloringthe preceding vowel or diphthong  card kdCuba kyb it crops up in words and phrasesthat are spelled without it  law and order I find Bollards superior  used to transcribe both theoptional r  ambiguous  Also he writes the r is notalways completely dropped  I would defy him tofind any r quality in the British Received Pronunciationof air fare  etc  Admittedly the r might be thecause of the lengthening or prolongation of the precedingvowel without dipthongization as Bollardputs it p xxxii but that cannot be said to be r coloringwhich we ought to restrict to a sound that hassome resemblance to the pronunciation of r             These are detailed petty matters of individualinterpretation matters that should not concernthose for whose use this book is intended  Onecould quarrel with occasional entry choices SteinbergDavid Canadian comedian actor  is in but notSaul Steinberg the artist who is far better knownat least in some circles we find Ralph

patternsfor English speakers he was called with a hint of a break before the final t  Whateverthe correct pronunciation no one could arguethat in English the second is more proper  Whatwe need is an American politician named Takapouda             The form of entry is not uniform for instancePynchon Thomas Park would lead a literalmindeduser to understand it to mean ThomasPynchon and Park Pynchon as the latter is aballpark it is probably Pynchon Park  Owing to thebroad transcription no attempt is made to duplicatethe Arabic voice pharyngeal fricative qaf as inQatar             There are not

    These details are not likely to affect the usefulnessof the book however and it contains curiousitems like the pronunciation of Roh Tae Woo  S Koreanleader no te wu following which it wasdeemed wise to put a sic  It seems that in thesoutheastern US words beginning with shr are pronouncedas if spelled sr  something I never knewThis yields a string of entries from Shreveport toShrovetide  in

recall onpronunciations  He had his hands full fielding telephonecalls from them during WWII when newscasterswere daily faced with the problems of how topronounce the names of people and places like

reviewcopy of Whistlin Dixie  we would have reviewedthat            Hendrickson does his research carefully and hewrites definitions that are eminently informative andreadable often including a useful quotation his entryfor hogan hogan A Navajo dwelling usually earthcoveredand built with the entrance facing eastThe Navajo hogans among the sand and willowsNone of the pueblos would at that time

Admittedly hogan is not one of the more interestingentries and inevitably there are quite a few suchOne problem the author had to grapple with was thevery identification of a word or phrase as Westernhightail it  for example refers to mustangs rabbitsand other animals that raise their tails high and fleequickly when they sense danger  Trappers in theAmerican West noticed this over a century agoprobably while hunting wild horses and invented theexpression to hightail it  to leave in a hurry to make afast gataway  Everything is plausible except thebusiness about trappers the expression could justhave easily originated in the parts of America settledearliest for deer exhibit the same behavior and indeedtheir tails are called flags for that very reasonalso deer antelope and many other animals in Europehave hightailed it for centuries  I fear thatHendrickson relied too readily on the OEDe  in thisinstance for that source mentions mustangs in its firstquotation from American Speech  Volume I After a diligent search I could find no earlier mentionMencken  The American Language  SupplementTwo p  refers to an article on Idaho speech theAS article was written by a resident of Seattle andmentions mustangs but that is of no significance  Itis just curious that what one might assume to be afairly obvious coinage cannot be documented to anearlier date  One might contend that before writers were not writing much about the West althoughthe western was popular in motion pictureslong before  talkies did not arrive till Zane Grey  and James Frank Dobie might have used the phrase in theirwritings but evidence is lacking            The entries make interesting reading but one isgiven no indication of the frequency with whichthey occur and whether they are current  Do peoplestill use a Jesse James as a metaphor for anybank robber  We also find a Bat Masterson and aWyatt Earp   Do courting couples still use jimpsecuteDo cowboys call farmers plowchasersMany know the tale behind dead mans hand acesand eights though their distribution is not specified            Hendrickson cannot be held accountable forfailing to trace many of the expressions to theirsource even though many are not much more than ahundred years old there is no way to documentthem  Still I should be surprised to find that coshkill mutilate is anything more than an extension ofcosh use a cosh blackjack on  Other terms likecount coup and coup stick  look as if they were derivedfrom French  Does a cowboy all the way downto his liver a fullfledged  cowboy derive fromthe damage done to ones liver by the jarring sufferedin breaking horses            These are questions that will have to be resolvedby others  Hendrickson has performed a usefulfunction in gathering the words and expressionsin one place but it would have been helpful had hegiven some indication as to how some entries wereuttered  For example  The  name of a cattleranch was it sixsixsixsix  double six double sixsixtysix sixtysix  And

which no evidenceis adduced  Some of the terms are old someare quite recent but in all fairness it must be emphasizedthat no claim is made that any have been inuse for a long time            I am ambivalent about the book  It makes goodreading and those who are interested in dialect dictionariesshould add it to their collection  But itadds little to the scholarship about the West and if ithad

national designations Z seems to havebeen accorded a special place of honor unmatchedelsewhere            The changeover from colonial to Africannames has accentuated the use of Z and demonstratedits unique appeal  For example we now havethe contiguous nations of Zaire Zambia  and Zimbabwe                countries that previously didnt have a singleZ to share amongst them  Also in this

         It is no longer news for the people of Indiawhen their media report that English is again underattack for it has been part of Indian politics todenounce English in public forums but seek its socioeconomicbenefits in private  A language of opportunityEnglish is certainly the first preferenceof Indian parents who do not let their children gowithout it in their school curriculum
