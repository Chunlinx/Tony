                                 Rat Democracy            Like most people who oncehoped for better I have become resigned to the accumulation of tawdry detailabout how President Clinton financed his reelection campaign But condemningClintons brazen opportunism begs the question Where did the opportunities tobe so brazen come from            This mayseem to be a question for a political analyst not an economist But there isan approach to political analysis known as rat choice rat as inrationalits not a comment on the candidates that flourishes along theborder of the two fields The working hypothesis of rat choice is that votingbehavior reflects the more or less rational pursuit of individual interestsThis may sound obvious innocuous and even excessively optimistic But if youreally think its implications through they turn out to be quite subversiveIndeed if you take rat choice seriously you stop asking why democracy worksso badly and start asking why it works at all            What is the problem Wont rational voters simply choosepoliticians who promise to serve their interests Well in a rough sense theydo The logic of democratic politics normally pushes both parties toward thecentermore precisely toward policies that serve the interests of the medianvoter Consider for example the question of how big the government should beIn general people with low incomes prefer a government that imposes high taxesin order to provide generous benefits Those with high incomes prefer agovernment that does no such thing The Democrats are by inclination theparty of outstretched palms the Republicans the party of tight fists But bothare forced to move away from those inclinations toward actual policies thatmore or less satisfy the voters in the middle who dont like paying taxes butdo like knowing that they wont be stuck with Grandmas medical bills            But thereare lots of issues that are not so bigissues that only involve say  or billion a yearlike who profits from electricity deregulation or how muchthe government spends subsidizing irrigation water for Western farmersAlthough these issues cumulatively are important to the electorate theelectorate doesnt voteindividual voters do And it is rarely in the interestof the individual voter to take the trouble to track the details of publicpolicy After all how much difference will one vote make            Bells have just started going off in the headof any reader who remembers Econ  What I have just said is that the duties ofa good citizensuch as becoming well informed before voting and for thatmatter bothering to vote at allare subject to the dreaded freeriderproblem  The freerider problem arises whenever some valuable good orservice is not excludablethat is whenever the benefit cannot be restrictedonly to those who pay for it It is clearly in the interest of all boaters tohave a rescue service But no individual boater has any incentive to pay forthe service if others are willing to do so If we leave provision of alifesaving service up to individual decisions each individual will try tofreeride on everyone else and the service will be inadequate or worse            Thesolution is government It is in the collective interest of boaters that eachboat owner be required to pay a fee to support a Coast Guard that providesthose nonexcludable benefits And the same is true of police protection publicsanitation national defense the Centers for Disease Control and so on Thefreerider problem is the most important reason all sane people concede that weneed a government with some coercive powerthe power if nothing else toforce people to pay taxes whether or not they feel like it            But there is a catch The democratic process the onlydecent way we know for deciding how that coercive power should be used isitself subject to extremely severe freerider problems Ratchoice theoristSamuel Popkin writes in his  book The Reasoning Voter Everybodys business is nobodys business If everyone spends an additionalhour evaluating the candidates we all benefit from a betterinformedelectorate If everyone but me spends the hour evaluating the candidates and Ispend it choosing where to invest my savings I will get a better return on myinvestments as well as a better government As a result the public at largeis entirely rationally remarkably illinformed about politics and policy Andthat leaves the field open for special interestswhich means people with alarge stake in small issuesto buy policies that suit them            For example not many votersknow or care whether the United States uses a substantial amount of itsdiplomatic capital to open European markets to Central American bananas Whyshould they I only keep track of the dispute because I have to update mytextbook which includes the sentence Efforts to resolve Europes bananasplit have proved fruitless But Carl Lindner the corporate raider who nowowns Chiquita Brands has strong feelings about the issue and thanks to his in contributions so does President Clinton Its not that Clintonbelieved that money alone could buy him the election But money does help andany practical politician comes to realize that betraying the public interest onsmall issues involves little political cost because voters lack the individualincentive to notice            So what is the solution            One answeris to try to change the incentives of politicians by making it more difficultfor special interests to buy influence It is easy to be cynical about thisbut the truth is that legal limits on how money can be given do haveconsiderable effect To take only the most extreme example Outright bribes donot as far as we can tell play a big role in determining federalpoliciesand who doubts that they would if they were legal So by all meanslet us have campaignfinance reform but let us not expect too much fromit            Another answer is to promote civic virtueThere are those who believe that if only the media would treat the public withproper respect people would respond by acting responsiblythat they wouldturn away from salacious stories about celebrities and read earnest articlesabout the flatpaneldisplay initiative instead Well never mind But it isprobably true that the quality of politics in America has suffered from theerosion of public trust in institutions that used to act to at least somedegree as watchdogs Once upon a time a politician had to worry about thereactions of unions churches newspaper editors even local political bossesall of whom had the time and inclination to pay attention to politics beyondthe sound bites Now we have become an atomized society of individuals who gettheir newsif they get it at allfrom TV If anyone has a good idea about howto bring back the opinion leaders of yore I am all for it            Finally we can try toremove temptation by avoiding policy initiatives that make it easy forpoliticians to play favorites This is one reason why some of us cringed whenRon Brown began taking planeloads of businessmen off on sales trips to Chinaand so on Whether or not those trips did any good or gave the wrongimpression about how foreigners might influence American foreign policy theyobviously raised the question of who got to be on the planeand how            But there is ultimately noway to make government by the people truly be government for the people Thatis what rat choice teaches and nobody has yet proved it wrongeven intheory
