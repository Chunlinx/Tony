                                 Yes We Have No Physicians            Many years ago when farmsubsidies were still something of a novelty an Iowa representative named HRGross used to tell of a letter he got from a constituent The writer as Irecall had heard that the government was paying people not to raisehogs and since he thought that was a trade for which he might have sometalent he wanted the congressmans help in applying for the program His planswere modest not raising a few dozen head to start But after he got thehang of it he thought he could build up to a substantial nonscale            Ofcourse not raising hogs can be a pretty smelly business not Nowadays theconstituent could aspire to more antiseptic digs He could enter thenottrainingdoctors professionthough hed have to move to New York state ifhe wanted to get in on the ground floor of this promising industry And hedhave to find a place at one of the  teaching hospitals that have volunteeredto participate in the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Projectapproved this week by the federal Health Care Financing Administration Theproject will pay some  million in cash to these schools In return theyhave agreed not to train between  percent and  percent of the medicalresidents they would otherwise have trained over the next six years Hospitalsin other states were quick to complain that they had not been offered the sameopportunity for sacrifice to the cause of medical progress But HCFAsadministrator Bruce Vladeck explained that the effort was necessarily limitedin scope until the success of the strategy had been tested This is after alla demonstration project            You might have thought that the proposition that when thegovernment hands out money someone will take it had already been amplydemonstrated Or you might have wondered why if the country is faced with animminent glut of doctors this is something the government should worry aboutWerent we taught in Economics  that if supply of a product exceeds demandfor it the price will fall And that demand will then pick up andorsuppliers will cut back and things will return to equilibrium Dont we wantlower medical prices Isnt that what the whole nasty fight over managed careand restraining Medicare costs is all about Why not just let the marketsinvisible hand perform the necessary surgery            But thatwould presume that we had something like a competitive market operating in themedical sector Of course we do not In fact we could not Even thebesteducated consumer probably cant be expected to shop intelligently for allbut the most basic health services Inevitably physicians and other careproviders will dictate both the type and quantity of treatments that theirpatients receiveas long as they are able to pay And since health care isrightly regarded as a public good a country as wealthy as ours will inevitablyprovide a host of subsidies both public and private to encourage us toswallow a good deal more medicine than we would if we paid for it out of ourown pockets            In the end we pay the bill in the form oflower wages higher prices and higher taxes but it doesnt feel that wayMarkets operate on felt signals and it is taking too long for the signal thatthere is an excess of doctors especially very highpriced specialists toimpinge upon the supplyproducing parts of the system Bright young peopleattracted both by the satisfying aspects of caring for their fellow citizensand by the high net income an average in excess of  that doctorsreceive are still queuing up to undertake the grueling and expensive trainingthat the profession requires And hospitals encouraged by Medicare subsidiesare all too willing to provide that training            Sogenerous are the government subsidies for resident training as much as a year that hospitals have reaped nice profits by using thesejourneymen doctors to do things that lessskilled personnel could do as wellAnd since the longer a resident trains the larger the total subsidy thesystem has also encouraged doctors to extend their educations and becomespecialists rather than lowerpaid general practitioners Now with managed careand government regulators cracking down on inhospital care residents arefacing a shortage of patients to practice upon            Cutting back on resident subsidies seems the obvioussolution But teaching hospitals the undisputed crown jewels of the medicalsystem are already under great financial strain And in New York they areguarded by two senior US senators and a politically potent union As in thecase of agriculturein which a complex edifice of subsidies has also succeededin developing an industry whose products are unmatched in quality quantityand varietyreform is rarely straightforward            So HCFAhas settled on a convoluted solution continuing the subsidies for theresidents that are trained but paying the hospitals additional amounts not totrain as many This the agency calculates will save it some  million overthe six years of the demonstration Brilliant and bizarre is how expertscharacterized the scheme in the New York Times             Where will it all end HCFAs Vladeck hasalready entertained extending the program noting that if jealous congressmenfrom other jurisdictions think this is a good deal they have the power tomake it more available Really How widely Surely most of us can take creditfor not having trained a legion of doctors            And why limit payments tothe medical sector Many will feel that the case for subsidizing thenonproduction of doctors is weak when law schools are still cranking outlawyers by the caseload Others may feel that the money would be better spentin paying the defense industry not to produce the latest round of hightechweaponry thus saving us the expense of generating still more lethal weaponswhen the current crop inevitably falls into the hands of our enemies Why notpay poor people not to be poor Come to think of it thats what the welfaresystem was meant to do            Which may bring us to themoral of our story When you start paying for nonproduction you are almost sureto reap a bumper crop
