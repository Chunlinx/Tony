                                 Is George W Bush a Weak Governor                        Some of George W Bushs critics particularly Orrin Hatch disparage himbecause he occupies a constitutionally weak governorship What makes agovernorship strong or weak Should it reflect poorly on Bush if he is a weakgovernor            State constitutions grant governors a variety of powersamong them thepower to veto bills appoint officials and submit a budget to the legislatureA constitutionally strong governor such as New Yorks can both veto bills andapply a lineitem veto to portions of measures he disfavors A strong governoralso appoints most of the members of his Cabinet and can serve multipleterms            Constitutionally weak governors appoint few top officials In many statesthe voters elect the attorney general secretary of state treasurer etc Thismakes the officials accountable to the electorate not the governor anddiffuses his power Weak governors also face limits of one or two terms makingthem automatic lame ducks They tend to govern less independently and exerciseless clout with legislatures than strong governors who because they canrepeatedly succeed themselves amass more and more political power            By most of these criteria Gov Bush is a weak governor Voters elect theTexas attorney general comptroller general land commissioner and statetreasurer Most agencies in Texas are run by commissions or boards whosemembers outlast the governor who appointed them The lieutenant governor runsseparately from the Texas governor and can belong to a different politicalparty The Texas governor is not subject to term limits however            The job of lieutenant governor of Texas is thought by some to be a morepowerful but less glamorous job than that of governor The lieutenant governorpresides over the Senate appoints the Senates committees and committeechairs controls the flow of bills to the floor and cochairs the powerfulLegislative Budget Board The current lieutenant governor of Texas is aRepublican The Texas governor can submit a budget to the legislature hedoesnt have to but his recommendations are usually discarded The Texasgovernor cant grant clemency to a deathrow prisoner although he can grant aday reprieve until a state board reviews the prisoners plea            The Texas governor can veto bills and make lineitem vetoes onappropriations bills He can also call special legislative sessions somethingBush has never done But a governors clout doesnt rest only in institutionaltrappings Despite the limitations of his office Bush is still the mostpowerful politician in Texas Personal charisma a hefty electoral mandate andthe cooperation of the legislature can augment the power of any governor Bushhas all three and he has used them to persuade the legislature to enactincremental portions of his agenda on issues such as education welfare andtaxes Add the likelihood of a majorparty presidential nomination to the listand you have a governor who wields a sizable amount of power even if it cantbe found in the state constitution            Next question                           Explainer thanks Thad Beyle professor of political science at theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
