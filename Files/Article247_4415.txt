                                 Common Ground                        Theres this really awful experience that some teachers knownot greatteachers but ordinary teachers or at least teachers who have not taught wellIt is the experience of reading an exam from a student who just didnt get itThere are hundreds of tricks to pass the blamethe student didnt study thestudent just isnt bright the student must have had a bad day etc But in theend such a teacher cant escape the feeling that the fault is in the teacherHad the teacherhad Idone a better job in explaining it then this studentwould have gotten it            And so it is with Richards latest reply I dont have the excuse of a slowstudenttrust me on that And obviously before reviewing a book a scholarsuch as Richard would have read it So to see his latest filled with mistakescan only say something about the teacher            The picture that animates Richards third reply is side by side networksThis mirrors his picture of before of many different sites at the ends of thewires so to speak some commercial some not With both pictures the moral isthe sameneither the network on the side nor the commercial sites at theends will effect the value of the commons The original Internet is thatcommons the rise of commerce wont diminish it            But the story I told in my bookI thought ad infinitum but apparently notenoughwas of changes that would affect the commons Changes that would changethe experience of the Net that we know right now Changes that would make itless protective of free speech changes that would make it more invasive ofprivacy changes that would make it more susceptible to regulation changesthat would interfere with the free flow of ideas            So take the example of regulation It was commonplace at the start of theInternet revolution for people to celebrate the fact that life there could notbe regulated But in my book I told the story about an increasinglycertificaterich Internetmeaning an Internet where people more and morefrequently carried voluntarily digital IDs In one version of that storythese IDs collect all sorts of facts about people And in that version theseIDs are designed to be checked automatically by servers as you pass along theinformation highway And thus in that version quite invisibly the network isnow able to identify all sorts of facts about youwhether you are an Americanwhether you are over  where you live etc And then as a byproduct of thischange it becomes possible once again for local government to begin to imposeregulation on people on the Net by forcing local servers to condition accessbased on the features of who people are It becomes possible that is to zonethe net and to reempower government control over behavior on the Net            Now the argument is a bit complex And no doubt one could disagree with itBut it is hard for me to see how one could read that argument and then talkabout gated communities or side by side networks The argument is about thecommons not the ends it is about the control that is enabled for those in theInternet we know now and it is about the control that gets enabled because ofthe emergence of one kind of architecture of identity It is about a controlover the commons not a control in gated communities            Or consider another argument at the core of the book this one about freespeech When the concern about kids and porn became pressing many said aperfect solution would be code that helped filter content on the Net And agroup of very talented architects came up with an architecture to facilitatethis filtering They called it the Platform for Internet Content Selection orPICS Using PICS individual sites could rate their material but moreimportant third parties could rate the material of others PICS was valuablebecause it was neutral The Christian Right could have its ratings the ACLUits ratings as well Individuals would then select the rating system they wantand then their PICSenabled browser as both Netscape and Internet Explorer arejust now would filter content according to this rating            Sounds just great Until one notices another feature of thisarchitecturenot only is it neutral horizontally anyone can rate the Netbut it is also neutral vertically the filters can be imposed at any place inthe distribution chainat the school at the ISP at the corporation orconceivably the nation And more significant this vertical filter would notannounce itself as a filter It could block access invisibly So that thistechnology inspired to help Americans deal with the problems of porn wouldnow become a technology that would lower the cost of censorship generally Andso the feature of the original Internet that people celebrated mostfirmlythat it embedded architecturally a First Amendmentwould under thisplan flip The technology would enable just the sort of speech control theFirst Amendment bans            Now again this is not a straightforward argument One can disagree with itas many have Mike Godwin and Paul Resnick have written strong and persuasivearticles against my position And I have seen how earlier parts of my argumentwere wrong            But I dont understand how one would believe that this change that I amdescribing is only about gated communities or a sidebyside network I dontunderstand how one would read this argument and not get that it is about theeffect these changes will have on the commons            Or finally take privacy again Once again Richard has a rosy storyTheres nothing to worry about in this bestofallpossibleworlds            Let Netscape track me so long as they disclose what they are doing But Ithink they would lose market share if they did not allow users to disable thesystem with a click of the mouse which I take it they do            First lets clear up a confusion The question isnt Netscapes tracking itis the tracking of servers that were describing And second in fact there isno obligation to disclose anything Sites have their privacy policies hasanyone ever read one of them but the interesting question is about sitessharing data You give your name to one site but choose not to give your nameto another yet unbeknownst to you the sites are allied and using a commoncookie identification they can share what you didnt want shared            Let them disclose Richard says But why would they absent an obligationto do so Because again by hypothesis consumers dont know the data is beingshared So they dont know enough to punish the sharer by reducing its marketshare            But of course Richard says Netscape will allow users to turn cookies offBut Richard have you ever tried to turn cookies off and then surf the NetSure both Netscape and Microsoft have given you that option but the optionindividuals are given is not as you predict a technology that allows choicesto be heavily individuated The option is a crude oneall off or all on orclumsily choose at each site            There are more efficient technologies that wouldnt bother you at each turnwith the cookie questionyoull recall I describe at least one in my book Butas I ask there why would one expect the market voluntarily to adopt thesetechnologies For to build in a technology that allows choices to be heavilyindividuated is to build in a technology that increases the costs of gettingdata But in Internet space data is gold Under the existing architecturecommercial sites get it for free What is the mechanism that one would imaginewhereby these sites adopt technologies to give up what they now get forfree            Once again mine is a hard argument to make Reasonable people havedisagreed with the particulars I recommend But I dont see how one can seethis as a problem about gated communities Once again it is a change thataffects life in the commons            In all these cases the changes I am describing are changes to the coreexperience of life on the Net And the question we should ask is how thesechanges will affect what we find valuable in the Net The point is not againstlibertarians Indeed one could imagine a libertarian critique of emergingarchitectures on the Net just as one could imagine a libertarian critique ofnew laws for the Net Im not arguing about the values you should have Imtrying to point to a newly salient threat to whatever values you mighthavethe regulations of code            Trying but not succeeding not even with one of my brightest students Sowe part ways here You and Dr Pangloss me and the reality that what I thoughtwas a fairly obvious point I have obviously failed to convey
