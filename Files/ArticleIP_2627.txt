                                 The Downside of Downsizing            Somewhere along the Gulfcoast a railroad car is lost Actually somewhere along the Gulf coast manyrailroad cars are lost rolling along between freight yards attached tolocomotives theyre not supposed to be attached to carrying goods that willarrive at their intended destinations days or even weeks late The cars belongto the Union Pacific Corp In the  th century Union Pacific builtthe railroad that joined the nation In the past few months though its hadits hands full trying to make the trains run on time            Aetnameanwhile is having a very hard time making sure that its clients claims getpaid Unpaid claims have been piling up in its back offices and last month theinsurance company announced that its thirdquarter earnings had fallensignificantly because of all the administrative problems Medical costs atleast at the healthcare providers with whom Aetna deals have been rising butsince Aetna wasnt paying its bills it wasnt able to figure that out untilrecently            On the surface these might seem to be twounconnected stories of corporate miscalculation But you dont have to look toodeeply beneath the surface to recognize that the problems Union Pacific andAetna are facing stem from the same cause namely overhasty and overaggressivejob cutting and that together they represent what you might call the downsideof downsizing            BothUnion Pacific and Aetna have consummated largescale mergers in the past yearand a half and both are therefore attempting to deal with sizable increases intheir everyday business Union Pacific which has spent much of the past decadeacquiring smaller rail companies bought Southern Pacific for  billionadding  miles of track to its inventory Aetna meanwhile shelled out billion to buy US Healthcare in April of  which left it with more than million people in its various healthcare plans One might have imaginedthat in the face of a larger client base and the difficult task of integratingtwo separate corporate organizations computer systems and cultures slashingpayrolls would not have been Job  But then one would of course haveimagined wrongly            Aetna waited six months after its acquisitionof US Healthcare to announce that it was cutting  jobs and consolidatingits  national service centers into  regional centers The stock marketneedless to say applauded the decision As one analyst put it Any time youhave an organization that pays close to  billion for a company that otherswouldnt have paid nearly as much for its natural that theyre going to lookfor substantial cost reductions to justify the transaction Union Pacificsjob cuts were smallermore than  employees were offered buyouts But theywere even more dubious strategically since the railfreight business wasbooming nationally and losing Southern Pacific managers and engineers meantthat UP now had thousands of miles of new track and very few workers who hadany experience with it            Inretrospect the results of these job cuts seem predictable Aetna discoveredthat in the words of its president We miscalculated how valuable theexperience level was and is in the staff that works in these servicecenters The company is now hiring back a hundred or so claims agents to speedup processing but it remains unclear how much longterm damage was done interms of alienated clients and healthcare providers and of the months thatAetna has spent essentially flying blind Whats more the companys stockprice has tumbled sharply            The consequences of Union Pacifics problemshave been rather more severe Since June the company has had five seriousaccidentsincluding two in the last two weeksthat have taken seven lives andcaused millions of dollars in damage A month ago Federal RailroadAdministration officials sprang surprise inspections on Union Pacific in cities They found overworked crews with engineers brakemen and dispatchersturning in hour weeks working six or seven days in a row Regulators calledUPs safety record a fundamental breakdown and things have not improvedsince then Last Friday the Surface Transportation Board declared atransportation emergency in the West while the FRA announced that it wouldstep up its monitoring of crew fatigue and track safety            Oddlythe FRA has yet to come up with a firm policy to solve the crewfatigueproblem though it has promised to produce one within  days Thirty days Howlong does it take to say Um we think you have to hire more people rightnow Union Pacific has in fact announced that it will be adding  newworkers but analysts estimate that the crisis has already cost shippers morethan  billion in delayed shipments and delivery snafus UP President JerryDavis has said he wanted to have the right number of people running therailroad since its a safety issue not a financial issue But one suspectsthat we got something closer to the truth when in the midst of the crisis aUP spokesman said Nobodys budget is safe when it comes to doing more withless Didnt anyone tell him he worked in public relations            What both the Aetna and Union Pacific storiesilluminate is the degree to which downsizing has become simply a reflexdecision for many managers The stock markets instinctively positive reactionto job cuts surely makes it easier for managers to justify their decisions tothemselves But the reality is that job cuts have more to do with anillconsidered definition of the bottom line than with placating Wall StreetIn other words its easier to look at the reduced labor costs from cutting jobs than to anticipate the potential chaos those cuts will bring Andthats particularly true when the concept of the lean and mean corporation hasattained the status of dogma In his A Passion for                Excellence the sequel to In Search of Excellence  still an enormously influentialbusiness book Tom Peters wrote There is then a lot that can be said forsimply cutting staff We find so many companies that do so much better with somany fewer people Perhaps Peters can issue a revised edition with chapterson Union Pacific and Aetna            Thepoint is not that downsizing is in and of itself a mistake The fact thatindustries wax and wane is a reality of any economic system that wants toremain dynamic and responsive to peoples changing tastes Jobs lost in oneplace are often created in another although there are serious questions aboutwhether the jobs will be as good particularly for industrial workers And anumber of large firms have downsized successfully most obviously GeneralElectric which cut an astounding  jobs worldwide in  years whilesimultaneously tripling its sales            But too often downsizing means what it has inthe Union Pacific case fewer people doing more work American workers now pullmore overtime than they did in the s and more companies have embracedrequired overtime as a way of ensuring that work gets done In theorydownsizing should be a way of matching the size of your work force to the sizeof your business In practice downsizing is too often about cutting your workforce while keeping your business the same and doing so not by investments inproductivityenhancing technology but by making people pull hour weeks andbringing in temps to fill the gap Downsizing itself is an inevitable part ofany creatively destructive economy But overworked engineers and sleepydispatchers arent creative theyre simply destructive
