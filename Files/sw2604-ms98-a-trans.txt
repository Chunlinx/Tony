                okay um yeah one year public service for everybody is that that was it right   right uh who wants to start this one     i dont know ive been ive been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know im like im not really sure what i think about this um uh i mean the first thing is the oh if its going to be mandatory its got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but   right right   you know senators sons and all that stuff too i mean everybodys got to do it um i dont know itd probably be itd probably be good i just dont know if you know i was eighteen or whatever id want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever   im not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesnt sound right um i guess i see overall beneficial if if were going from that point of view   uhhuh   um i you know in the past i dont know i dont know how old you are but when i was uh in high school was uh beginning of Vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted   uhhuh   and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever but i i felt strongly then that even if they didnt feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available   uhhuh   and i guess i see that as as not so much a a demand but but a privilege its its kind of uh uh   yeah is um   its something its its since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea i wouldnt mind doing it at forty four   uhhuh   uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others uh and i i guess i i cant see that as being something to really object to   well i guess its gonna depend on how i mean if if youre talking about any  if youre talking about something thats like a full time you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know youre going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean i you know i dont know   i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that would that could be done in an hour or two   uhhuh uhhuh   uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that in addition to what one does   uhhuh   uh besides that i i cant imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies wed get into and expense having it be full time oh youre going to go to this camp and youre going to you know like um back in the Depression the CCC the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but   yeah   um i dont see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule   uhhuh   uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps   uhhuh   uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting and i i dont see it just relegated to the young but i see i i see so much going on that thats bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back   uhhuh well and and also you know you you you feel more like you know youre actually part of the community if youve done something in it   thats right you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself   uhhuh   and i i see it being most beneficial if its in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county   uh definitely   because then youre youre coming in contact with it its not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that ill never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there   right yeah   its so it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going   yeah   but as far as putting that into work i dont want to  i dont want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics     oh uh that would be a nightmare and just i mean just getting getting it going   yeah   yeah   i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh   uhhuh   Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and and i guess i dont see uh this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   do you have kids   no uh no not yet about six months we will   oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many kids so many kids that were at loose ends       and that didnt really have a purpose and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it   uhhuh   i know youve got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but thats uh that that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation thered definitely have to be a major PR campaign in each community each county   uhhuh uhhuh   uh parish or however the state was divided up hum i may well i dont know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and keep and i ive seen it in other states too i dont know   yeah they have that here um theyve got um in most of the states around here i think uh   um   you know down in North Carolina there was a big controversy for a while because the uh the local chapter of the KKK wanted to uh       um to participate in it and uh there was a     and there were those that said no you cant do that im sure   yeah well uh it was it was interesting because thats an interesting question you know should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed   yeah oh and i hadnt even thought about that uh the other the other end of that that thats an interesting uh situation i hadnt thought of that we had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and   yeah i think Virginias got it and i know Maryland does and we just we went to Indianapolis last weekend and back and um im pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in Ohio and Indiana Indiana about it and Pennsylvania maybe Pennsylvania i dont remember for sure now   and i dont know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last year oh year plus i it was last beginning with last years Earth Day   uhhuh   theres just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and even i work for Texas Instruments and they theyve started some recycling campaigns that   uhhuh   a year before that had been turned down because they said well its not feasible its not a good idea   uhhuh yeah and but then they lost too much business   and i see that as being i i see that as being a a a change um it for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing its just thing a part of everyones consciousness   uhhuh well the thing about that is though its got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that and   yeah   you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue and i im worried that it it might you know itll it the same thing will happen its like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people like well you know id ruther rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know and even if its not environmentally safe who cares you know   im sure the pendulum will swing the other way uh there have been too many other things that its done that for just in my life and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up but   yeah   it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil thats burning out of control in in the Persian Gulf and and so forth just just every little bit does it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth   well yeah uh well uh wouldnt its just probably a good thing that the oils burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out   thats thats right because   of course thats probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are  in Texas   uh no  no because if   we what was it in seventy four when we had the the last last oil crisis and and uh we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth   uhhuh   and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders   right yeah   uh or well suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we dont have the ability to go on to some new technology   right well my dads in the in the solar energy business   ah   so um you know were acutely aware of a lot of this but you know on the other hand he voted for George Bush so um  you know i i wonder sometimes if he knows what hes doing   im sure you are   well i this you know just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not uh makes um uh   uhhuh   decisions that i just cant go along with but uh thats why theyre there and not me i dont want the i dont want the stress and the strain   yeah well the the thing with Bush
