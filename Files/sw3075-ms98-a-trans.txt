        Lynn do you do you want to start   certainly um   okay do you want to tell me about some of the vacations youve taken or   well i i tend to uh take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sightseeing and things like that   uhhuh which is your favorite   oh well i couldnt live without the family vacations but uh my favorite is the the indulgent ones where we go off and and uh see places that have interested me since i was a kid for the most part   uhhuh   and uh   your your family doesnt live close then   uh not anymore they uh theyve been in San Diego for the last few years and theyre moving to Florida   okay   and thats one of those things you just have to go once a year   yep i understand   so uh basically it it sorts out into that and then once about once every three or four years i try to get over to England because i lived there for a while   wow   some years back   ive only only been there once   oh   id love to go back   beautiful  country beautiful country beautiful people   it was yeah it we had a great time   but uh and id real really like to go because um im fairly recently married and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years and uh but hes never met them so uh id like id like to do that but anyway thats thats our typical vacation and uh we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways  and we probably take one of each every year how about yourself   well  we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year and but this year were not going to be taking one for several reasons but vacations we really enjoy i think weve been on three cruises   oh ive never been on a cruise   and we we really love cruises weve gone on Carnival Cruise Lines   uhhuh   and uh weve gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go uh we usually book just a month before its ready to go   yeah   and we get upgraded last time last two times in fact we had an outside room and it was beautiful   um   and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around its kind of   well what do you do on a cruise ive never been on a cruise   oh my God you do everything you i mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be you can sit in the sun all day around the pool or you can take part in the games that they have going on they always have bingo they have a casino uh they have a massage parlor they have exercise i mean you can do anything   huh   and thats just aboard ship and then when the ship docks you get to go sight seeing and shopping and thats quite fun   uhhuh uhhuh and where have you been on these cruises   uh Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas weve been there twice we went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people we weve gone with friends each time   i see   and then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh Cancun Cozumel   oh the the Mexican coast   and Ocho Rios pardon me   i the thats all Mexico i think   yes uhhuh and but it was wonderful so we really like those and uh i guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different weve been to a few places in this country we still have a lot to see though   where are you from originally   were from Illinois originally   uhhuh   and weve been down in Texas eighteen years and so like you we we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives we both still have family there      uhhuh   and thats fun it brings back a lot of memories   oh yes   uh things are different there though theyre uh i dont know its just entirely different world than this area   well i i grew up in Dallas so i mean its not its not like im going home my my parents retired first to San Diego and theyre going now to Florida and so theyre going very nice places thank God   did you uhhuh uhhuh   that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know i really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there theyve been there eight years   uhhuh   and uh you know i just grab the car and drive everywhere   oh thats great   so it it is it is nice but its not home this is home and um and ive never thought about a cruise its so funny   oh they they they really are weve yeah as i said weve done them three times wed be going again this this year if circumstances hadnt changed we wed probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he hes chomping at the bit   uhhuh     he kind of likes the casinos a little bit   uhhuh   but i like all of it and   whats the best part from your point of view   i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places   umhum   i like shopping i can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever now my kids are moving to Toronto so were going to be able to go up there   oh thatll be nice   so im kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go   oh sure   but   sure well go in dont go in the winter   oh thats what everybody says and i i think its i think ill try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January   oh   so that will be hard to stay away from   well there there are exceptions made for special occasions like that   yeah   but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so   isnt that the truth uhhuh   hum well that sounds wonderful well i i guess i i would contemplate going on a cruise uh oh all circumstances permitting it   well theres all age group groups too and thats thats kind of fun uh you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people you may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger and   uhhuh   everybody is really interesting and everybody is there to have a good time and   huh how long are the cruises   and uh weve only gone on the seven day cruises   uhhuh   they have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones but i think seven days is long enough for us by that time were ready to get home and get ba ck to our routine i think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us weve gone i think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit   yeah yeah uh i tend when when i spend enough money to go overseas  i go for a long time   yeah well that that makes sense it really does i mean oh we went to Panama too   oh thats interesting   went to Panama last August   uhhuh   our soninlaw is from Panama   oh   and uh he we went with our daughter and soninlaw to visit his parents who live there and his father is a a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher and they took time off it was      uhhuh   their winter and they were having a little break so they took some time off that uh they could show us around and it it is a beautiful country it is beautiful they have mountains we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore   huh thats really nice   and it it is gorgeous they live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica   uhhuh   and uh its its just its just a gorgeous country most people dont realize it i think if they could get tourists coming to their country theyd improve the economy considerably   huh well may maybe now things are calming down again that will happen   yeah we really hope hope so   well that thats really great um   yeah   i i mean as i said well well basically all ive done is go back and forth to parents and uh   well that thats thats pretty good thats pretty good     and and uh we had  my husband had a conference in LA so we spent a week in LA and of course   oh do you like LA   uh im very im im very unusual i like
