                    Background        Knowing the differences in gene expression levels among        different tissues is of paramount interest in various areas        of biomedical research These include but are by no means        limited to i comparisons of healthy and diseased tissue        in order to understand malfunctions in regulation and        identify genes essential for control thus identifying        target molecules for the development of novel therapeutics        and ii the observation of changes in expression over time        after addition of a drug to elucidate the mechanism of        action of pharmaceuticals and predict their toxicology        Experiments in that realm furthermore help to understand        the molecular basis of diseases provide means for early        diagnostics and facilitate monitoring of therapy        Examples for analog techniques representing mRNA        expression patterns are subtractive cDNA libraries                  and the Differential Display method and its        derivatives        Macro and microarrays           are rapidly becoming the analog method of choice mainly        due to their high throughput in data production which        allows complex biological questions to be addressed        Digital methods for counting differences in gene        expression levels provide specific advantages With the        expressed sequence tag EST approach     expression        patterns are analyzed by sequencing many clones from cDNA        libraries Even limited sequence information on the cDNA        end tag sequences permits unambiguous identification        of the cDNA and the corresponding gene The different        frequencies of cDNAs in libraries derived from different        sources give evidence of possible changes in gene        expression This approach provides accurate quantitative        information and has a flexible degree of sensitivity which        depends solely on the number of analyzed clones However        this is very laborintensive In order to analyze the        expression of low abundant cDNAs that represent mRNA in the        range of one copy per mammalian cell more than         colonies have to be analyzed per library Improvements in        sequencing automation and analysis such as capillary        electrophoresis have speeded up the process considerably        and recent developments such as a sequencing method based        on realtime pyrophosphate     sequencing on        microchips     and massive parallel signature        sequencing on microbead arrays    also contribute to        the speed and depth of EST gene expression analysis        Oligonucleotide fingerprinting    characterizes        expressed genes via the hybridization of hundreds of        synthetic oligonucleotides to cDNA that produces unique        fingerprints of matching and nonmatching oligonucleotides        Another approach to increase throughput is the serial        analysis of gene expression SAGE Short defined cDNA        sequences are initially prepared from mRNA which are then        dimerized multimerized cloned and sequenced            SAGE accelerated the process of gene expression analysis        more than an order of magnitude compared to the        conventional EST analysis and still is compatible with most        of the improvements of DNA sequencing mentioned above        However after the identification of differentially        expressed cDNA the full length gene has to be cloned        starting from minor sequence information  bp tag which        hampers further functional analysis of the corresponding        protein a complex task that requires the complete coding        sequence        Each of these methods clearly has its specific        advantages and often different subsets of differentially        expressed genes are identified employing a certain method        For example cDNAs that are not easily amplified by means        of PCR are inadequately represented in PCRbased methods        DADA was designed in order to overcome specific        shortcomings of established differential expression        analysis technologies used today eg the need to sequence        all of the examined genes or the involvement of PCR steps        In addition further cloning of the complete coding        sequence of the identified genes of interest is facilitated        by ending up with rather long eg in comparison to the        SAGE method and multiple corresponding cDNAs comprising at        least part of the coding sequence DADA is a digital method        which identifies and counts the abundance of genes by means        of restriction fragment fingerprinting                    Results and Discussion                    principle of the method          DADA distinguishes and identifies genes by their          specific patterns of cDNA fragments derived from digests          with  different restriction enzymes recognizing          sequences of  specific nucleotides In order to avoid          detection of other fragments than the desired cDNA          fragments spanning from the  polyA end towards the          nearest upstream restriction site a special cloning          vector has been devised It harbors a particular          combination of cleavage sites that permits cloning of a          nucleic acid in defined orientation and controlled          labeling of only the desired fragments with fluorescent          dyes Figs             Double stranded cDNA was synthesized by a reverse          transcription reaction using isolated mRNA and an          anchored oligo dT primer see material and methods The          resulting cDNA pool containing a defined poly A stretch          of  nucleotides was cloned unidirectionally in the          vector a cDNA library was constructed in E coli and          plasmid DNA was isolated from the resulting colonies          The part of the vector containing the cDNA fragment          was labelled by means of a simultaneous          restrictionligation reaction    with double          stranded fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides using          the Bgl I site Fig  Step  located adjacent to the          cloning site of the cDNA representing the polyA end          of the corresponding mRNA The labelled oligonucleotide          was only ligated to the cDNA end of the BglI restriction          site due to the nonpalindrome nature of the overhang          see Fig  In addition the other BglI site located          within the vector backbone Bgl I Fig  and virtually          all Bgl I sites with the exception of sites with CCT          overhang occasionally found in the inserted cDNA          sequences were not labelled as the overhangs created by          the restriction digest were not compatible with the          overhang of the used oligonucleotides In comparison the          labelling of the Bgl I was less affected by artifacts          resulting from labelling of internal restriction sites          within the cDNA as compared to labeling of a NotI site in          a different vector construct although Bgl I sites are          more often found in cDNAs compared to Not I sites data          not shown          In a second step the plasmids were digested with          restriction enzymes recognizing  bp sequences Alu I          Bfa I Dde I Dpn I Hinf I or Rsa I in six separate          reactions Fig  step  This created labelled cDNA          fragments comprising the most  located site of each          restriction enzyme respectively towards a defined          stretch of the polyA tail of the cDNA a defined part of          the cloning vector and the labelled oligonucleotide The          resulting fragments were separated by polyacrylamide gel          electrophoresis ABI DNA analyzer and the length of          the labelled fragments were analyzed by comparison to a          specially designed internal size marker Fig  step           see material and methods for details The pattern of          restriction fragment sizes generated by the procedure was          characteristic for each individual gene transcript and          represented an unique fingerprint of the corresponding          gene Partial cDNA inserts and empty vectors represent a          substantial part of cDNA libraries that would hamper the          analysis of restriction fingerprints in standard cloning          vectors eg the empty cloning vector itself would          generate a characteristic restriction fingerprint that          would overlay and disturb every analysis To distinguish          fragments derived from restriction digests within the          cDNA inserts from fragments derived from restriction          digests within the vector resulting in mixed cDNAvector          or vector only sequences the DADA cloning vector          contains an engineered segment that is free from the          recognition sites used in the fragment analysis Fig           and that is longer than the detection window of  to          approximately  bp Figs and  This extended the          restriction fingerprint of the empty vector to fragments          over  bp which were not detectable in the analysis In          addition the restriction sitefree segment of the          vector guaranteed that all detected fragments within the          detection window stemmed from restriction sites within          the cDNAs If a specific restriction site is not          contained within  bp of the  end of a cDNA no          detectable fragment was generated          There are  variations of the experimental procedure          for a given cDNA library see Fig and the detailed          description in Material and Methods In i a single          clone analysis SCA the procedure was applied to only          one clone at a time and yielded accurate fingerprints          for certain genes experimentally This did not speed up          the process of expression analysis compared to sequencing          of clones from cDNA libraries EST approach but          generated the fingerprints used for the mixed analysis          In ii the mixed analyses MA the procedure was applied          to pools of  cDNA clones multiplexing the plasmid          preparation labelling and analysis thereby speeded up          the process by nearly two orders of magnitude In spite          of the multiplexing already established fingerprints of          genes could be unambiguously identified in the          restriction fragment mixture derived from the pools Fig          and  If the characteristic fingerprint of a certain          gene was identified in the fragment mixture at least one          of the  colonies of the pool included a vector with the          corresponding cDNA Therefore the frequency of          occurrence of a fingerprint enabled us to count the          abundance of genes and to calculate expression levels          from cDNA libraries derived from different statuses at a          high throughput The high throughput only applied to the          analysis of the abundance of fingerprints as in contrast          to the SCA no new fingerprints could be generated by the          mixed analysis                            obtaining patterns from a single clone          analysis          We randomly picked single clones of  colonies from a          murine wounded skin library and compared the analyzed          restriction fingerprints with the corresponding          experimentally determined cDNA sequence of the vectors          Vectors containing no cDNA inserts produced no signals in          the detection window of  to  base pairs and          incomplete or short cDNA inserts yielded only signals of          fragments derived from restrictions within the cDNA          sequence This demonstrated that the restriction free          region next to the cDNA cloning site fulfills its          function in repressing misleading fragments and the          corresponding signals          A thorough comparison of the analyzed fragment lengths          with the corresponding sequences of the clones resulted          in a good agreement of theoretical and experimental          fragment length for the  restriction enzymes In          general only those fragments were detected that were          derived from the nearest restriction site of the          corresponding enzyme as judged by sequencing However in          several cases the first Alu I site was not recognized by          the enzyme despite the use of an at least fold excess          of enzyme units compared to the amount of cDNA          indicating site preferences of this restriction enzyme          that may depend on the context of the recognition          sequence     This did not affect the analysis of          fingerprints in mixed clone analyses reported below as          the same site preference was also observed under these          conditions          Another inherent discrepancy is the integer character          of the predicted values versus the noninteger values          stemming from the comparison to the size marker The          average of the difference of the experimentally analyzed          length to the calculated length was  bp median           bp which means that the analyzed values were          generally a little longer than the predicted ones About           of the analyzed lengths differed less than  bp and          about  differed less than  bp from the predicted          lengths which by far exceeded the experimental deviations          in repeated experiments standard deviation of less than           bp see below and is in accordance to results from          other authors      These data demonstrated that          there is a reproducible but not yet predictable shift of          the fragments within the polyacrylamide gel run Together          with the above mentioned site preference of AluI and          additional problems like the not well defined          polyadenylationsite in public database entries this          hinders the construction of fingerprints solely based on          sequence data Attempts to predict these shifts based on          the sequence composition of the fragments were not          successful in the first trials          Experimentally determined fingerprints from single          clone analysis could be used for the analysis without any          of the above mentioned hindrances The fragment lengths          from single clone analyses that by chance contained cDNAs          from the same gene reproduced very accurately The          standard deviation from the average value was below           bp for fragments below  bp and increased with larger          fragment size The range in which a band was accepted as          being the same as the search value was determined          empirically Colonies of specific genes were mixed into          different pools of defined clone compositions and the          detection width was adjusted to be the best compromise          between not missing any real hits and counting false          ones As assumed from the increasing peak width of the          analyzed fragments and the internal size marker the          detection width varied with the length of the fragments          see material and methods The detection range was          increased above the determined  bp standard deviation          especially for the longer fragments The broader          detection width that could in principle lead to false          positive identification of a fingerprint was          counterbalanced by the fact that the peak density is much          lower towards the longer fragments Fig                             proof of concept          The differences in gene expression following treatment          of a tissue with an active compound was monitored using          two libraries of wound tissue derived from control          phosphate buffer saline PBS normally healing and          dexamethasone DEX badly healing treated mice Steroid          treatment is widely used as a model for impaired wound          healing     From each library about  colonies          were analyzed in pools of  colonies each The complete          analysis of  colonies required only  runs on an          ABI DNA analyzer  lanes with  colonies each           gels of  enzymes each for the analysis of  different          enzymes All calculated fragment sizes were analyzed and          stored in a relational database representing nearly           data points from this analysis alone          Applying the restriction fingerprints of the above          mentioned single clone analysis we found several genes          that were upregulated in wounds of dexamethasone treated          animals Two genes are shown that were confirmed with          quantitative Real Time RTPCR and represent intriguing          examples Table  MCP and Cystatin C cDNAs contain          all six restriction sites within  bp from the polyA          tail experimental

 These fingerprints are unambiguously related to their          cDNA as a search in the complete GenBank database see          material and methods showed only the corresponding          murine cDNA hits even though the search parameters were          loosened to account for the above mentioned differences          in experimentally derived fragment lengths to the real          sequence          Finally these two fingerprints were used for a          digital analysis of the DEX and PBS libraries The          fingerprints of all six enzymes were used for the search          of the database from the  colonies Each of the           subsets of the data representing a pool of  colonies          was analyzed by a computer program for the concurrent          appearance of the  fragments of a specific fingerprint          The search for the appearance of the fingerprints from          MCP and Cystatin C resulted in  and  counts          respectively Interestingly the fingerprints were only          found in datasetspools from the cDNA library derived          from DEX treated animals and not in the library from          control animals The concluded induction of both          transcripts in wounds from badly healing animals compared          well to quantitative RTPCR data Table           In order to explore the limitation of the method we          also computed all possible restricted fingerprints of          MCP and Cystatin C containing only  different          restriction enzymes Here we obtained the same results          when we used the five shortest fragments of the          fingerprints but misleading results if we left out for          example the restriction enzyme that produced the shortest          fragment This observation can be easily explained as          partial cDNA sequences derived from oligo dT synthesis          can lack the most  restriction site and include the          most  restriction site but never vice versa If the          numbers of fragments were reduced to the  shortest ones          the results were perturbed by unspecific fingerprints          that were not derived from the specific cDNAs but were          erratically composed of fragments derived from different          cDNAs within the pool of  colonies More of those          comparisons started to reveal significance limits such as          the number of fragments that should be contained in a          fingerprint From the limited amount of comparisons it          would seem that having  different fragments in a pattern          and finding all of them works reliably even with low          abundant genes like MCP and Cystatin C that were          induced to medium abundance by the treatment  to           transcripts within the  analyzed transcripts or          about  Finding only  to  fragments is          sufficient only for high abundant genes with a          significant differential expression Eg serum albumin          and SPRa with abundances of about  in liver and skin          libraries respectively      could be identified          and quantified by using only  restriction enzymes in the          corresponding cDNA libraries             The clones of MCP and Cystatin C were examined more          closely regarding their length They contained the          complete cDNA sequence This is not the case for all          other genes but the clones often contain substantial          parts of the coding regions and they almost always          prolong the public database cDNA entries toward the           end This supports the notion that DADA will also          facilitate a rapid full length cloning effort after          identification of interesting genes                            Conclusion        In conclusion DADA is a digital method for analyzing        expression levels based on the counting of restriction        fingerprints of cDNA clones It is built around a        specifically designed cloning vector that suppresses        misleading fingerprints derived from partial cDNAs or empty        vectors The method yields quantitative data and absolute        figures that do not depend on amplification by polymerase        chain reaction Compared to the sequencing of cDNA        libraries conventional EST approach     it is        substantially faster and more economical In comparison to        the SAGE method    it results in physical cDNA clones        of substantial length which speed up further analysis        Within the limited number of examples there is a good        correlation between the clear results from DADA and other        gene expression analysis methods such as quantitative real        time RTPCR RNase Protection Assays and various        hybridization procedures data not shown A number of        additional genes with differential regulation discovered by        DADA and confirmed by independent methods are now under        investigations for the use as therapeutical targets        unpublished observations Some of the genes identified by        DADA including MCP and Cystatin C were neither discovered        by means of subtractive hybridization     nor by        differential display     although these methods were        successfully used in comparable settings in our laboratory        and lead to a high number of differentially expressed        genes Vice versa DADA could not detect certain        differentially expressed genes that were discovered by        standard methods As an example the injuryinduced        differential expression of SA could be detected by        subtractive hybridization     The DADA fingerprint of        SA was detected in both analyzed cDNA libraries        However as it occurs only once in each library no        statistical significant differential expression could be        identified by the DADA method Only a subset of genes was        identified by all methods In general the different        approaches can be seen as complementary rather than        competitive The specific findings will certainly vary with        changes in the completeness and individual execution of the        respective screens Additionally DADA offers advantages        with regard to absolute and quantitative data at the level        of screening        As of yet we can only perform digital analyses with        patterns experimentally analyzed from single clone        analysis These fragment lengths reproduce accurately        enough to search and count them in mixed analyses applying        rigid queries The usage of restriction fingerprints        computationally derived from sequence database entries is        hampered by the lack of predictability of gel positions        from sequences and the integer versus noninteger issue        The experimental fingerprints due to the narrower search        space allowed for the identification of fingerprints in        mixtures of  colonies as demonstrated here The broader        search space of sequencebased predictions allow only for        the identification of fingerprints in mixtures of about         colonies data not shown The one order of magnitude lower        throughput in the case of predicted fingerprints would        render the method nonsuperior to others        The generation of experimental fingerprints is the        bottleneck of the procedure as described here Once the        fingerprints are generated for a certain species they can        be rapidly applied in all possible settings Therefore we        are developing improvements of this step In addition the        use of a now available fifth fluorescent dye as a size        marker in sequencing lanes should allow for a fast        correlation between restriction fragment sizes derived        from the sequence and gel run behaviors of DNA fragments        relative to the size marker The latter improvement could        not only lead to a faster generation of experimental        fingerprints but could also supply a large dataset to        improve the prediction of gel run behaviors of fragments        based on the sequence composition        Another improvement could result from alternative DNA        separation and detection methods such as capillary        electrophoresis or mass spectrometry This could further        improve the reproducibility of the fragment analysis and        lead to a reduction of the search space for every fragment        As discussed above this parameter is directly linked to        the throughput of the method In addition DADA would        profit from the higher throughput of capillary        electrophoresis compared to the gel electrophoresis used in        this study On the other hand values created by mass        spectrometry are precisely predictable from the sequence of        DNA fragments     This would allow for the generation        of fingerprints from sequence data in silico and speed up        this limiting step of the procedure                    Materials and Methods                  Cloning vectors          The vector pUC YanischPerron et al  was cut          with Hind

the Microsoft Visual Studio           software suite was designed that extracted fingerprints          from the raw data of single clone analysis In one lane          the peak for each restriction enzyme was chosen that had          the maximum height NewHeight after applying the          following empirically determined formula in order to          account for the broadening in peak shape and

fingerprints in          mixed clone analysis MA          A second computer program was designed that analyzed          the datasets from the mixed analysis for the frequency of          occurrence of the stored fingerprints Each dataset          derived from a pool of  colonies  complex fragment          mixtures in  corresponding lanes on two corresponding          gels was queried for the concurrent occurrence of the          peaks  fragments of each fingerprint respectively see          Fig  As an example for a certain cDNA fingerprint          the the peak from SCA for restriction enzyme DdeI was          determined at  bp In one lane in a MA there are          multiple peaks stemming from DdeI digestion             The computer program          checked if the peak for Dde I was contained in the          complex peak mixture derived from the Dde I digest          considering a certain bandwidth In the example above           bp in the MA would be considered as a hit The          computer program did the same for the other  restriction          enzymes When all peaks are simultaneously present in one          dataset from a pool of colonies the counter for this          fingerprintgene goes up by one It is possible to adjust          the program to query the data with only a subset of the           restriction enzymes of the fingerprints          The empirical determined allowed bandwidth for a peak          to be counted was set to the following parameters          fragments from  to  bp bandwidth  bp           bp   bp   bp           bp
