                                 Men at Work                        Dear Shoshana            Let me first comment on the end of what you sayaboutthe British echoes of Faludis findings This shouldnt surprise you Maine hasno global reach Los Angeles does When British men feel out of it bycomparison to those sleek buffed males merchandized globally the merchandisethat oppresses and obsesses them comes from Los Angeles and New York            In a way you are unfair to Faludi her interviewsreach beyond the style epicenters But I think you are right on target inpointing to the immense divide between wiredup screwedup America which iswhere the money is and a quieter America where men may suffer far less fromidentity crises because they are trying to get by rather than get ahead When Ilived in New York it drove me crazy listening to people complain about makingonly  a year they suffered from epicenterenvy of people who made and spent  Theres no gendering these days in epicenterenvythe Manhattan female hotshot is as obsessed about the people who stand aboveher as the male of this specieswhich again is why I think the story Faludihas told is about men in capitalism rather than men as such            What her interviews show is a new chapter in thesubject Americans never talk about class Many of the men Faludi interviewedare being lumped into a new synonym for class they are losers In the lastgeneration as we know the gap between winners and losers has grown thewealth of the top  percent has expanded the wealth of the middle  percentstagnated or declined the resources those in the bottom  percent can commandhas declined As our society becomes more unequal however the imagery of howpeople ought to live the ideals of self and mutual respect are increasinglydefined by behavior and possessions at the top Thus the gnawing sense of beingout of it that surfaces among the ordinary people Faludi interviewed thefear of falling behind This is how class works in America a shared imagery oftaste and behavior a stark inequality of material educational and socialmeans in measuring up to the image of how you ought to be And this is whywhen Faludi uses the word emasculation what I think she is evoking is a fearof diminished potency which is more economic than sexual            You attack Shoshana the argument Faludi makes thatmen suffer in large part from a crisis of masculinity because they have failedrole models in their fathersie My father never taught me to be a manI have to confess that this argument which Ive heard for years applied toblacks makes me like you deeply uneasy though in my case for quite personalreasons I was raised by a resolutely single mother who in the s wassubjected in Minnesota to the widespread prejudice that by not living in anuclear family she was doing me untold psychic harm In my own case thisdidnt prove so but the prejudice in favor of nuclear families is deeplyengrained in American life Do you think Faludi is reviving it            As you say the myth of the strong father is one thingthe reality is often quite another often tyrants who are intimidating ratherthan encouraging My own experience of parenting is that adult firmness coupledwith irony and occasional bouts of silliness makes for sturdy children Perhapswhat Faludi was hearing when people told her in one way or another My fathernever taught me to be a man was a complaint about American childhood I knowof no country in which children lead more lonely isolated lives isolated fromsocial contact with children unlike themselves and from adult society Youcant be taught just by rules how to be a man or a woman you learn adulthoodfor yourself and to learn adulthood well you need far more exposure to reallife its horrors and difficulties as well as its pleasures than Americansociety makes available to children This is why I think Americans oftenremark about European children that they seem older more selfpossessed            My question to you about this book is if American menare in the trouble Faludi thinks they we are whats to be done about itYouve written about cooperation in the workplace Do you think the ills sherecounts might be righted if in communities there were more opportunities formen to cooperate Faludi seems in part to believe a more interactive societyless oriented to displays of potency would ease crises of masculinity            My own views head off in another directionbut Illsave that until I hear what you have to say
