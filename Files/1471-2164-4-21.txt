                    Background        Sequencing of the human genome has led to the        identification of mutations and single nucleotide        polymorphisms SNPs that can be linked with specific        phenotypes A number of assays have been developed to        genotype known SNPs and mutations However the majority of        these methods have many steps and are difficult to        automate Currently most genotyping methods require that        the target region of the genomic DNA be amplified using PCR        prior to the genotyping assay reviewed in             Following amplification the PCR product is either        sequenced directly or probed for the mutation of interest        Similarly OCP ligationERCA can be used to accurately        genotype PCR products in a biallelic format where the        probes for both alleles are present in a single reaction            The OCP ligationERCA method is based on ligation        dependent circularization of allele specific DNA probes        followed by exponential rolling circle amplification of the        circularized probes      ERCA probes have also been        variously described as padlock probes     or        circularizable probes     Although OCP ligationERCA        can be used to genotype PCR products it also provides a        means for directly genotyping genomic DNA without requiring        an initial amplification of the genomic DNA locus For        example we recently described a high throughput        ligationERCA protocol for genotyping genomic DNA samples        in microtiter plates            This report describes modifications to OCP ligationERCA        genotyping that reduce reaction time and improve accuracy        to above  Methods for improving accuracy include        simultaneous detection of two alleles per well probes        designed to contain hairpin sequences that regulate        ligation discrimination and prevent nonspecific        amplification and introduction of a QPNA fluorescent        detection system     Improvements in probe design        rolling circle reaction design and assay methods were        integrated into an improved high accuracy genotyping assay        and the utility of the method was demonstrated for four        clinically important mutations The QPNA fluorescent        detection system produced a sixfold reduction in time to        result        In many instances only limited quantities of genomic DNA        are available from clinical samples for genetic testing        DNA can also be limiting when large numbers of assays must        be performed on a single sample Recently a whole genome        amplification method WGA has been developed that is        capable of accurately producing large quantities of genomic        DNA from limited sample      In cases where genomic        DNA was limiting WGA genomic DNA was substituted for        genomic DNA Complete and faithful amplification of the        entire genome resulted in WGA product that could be        substituted for genomic DNA without affecting the accuracy        of genotyping WGA DNA amplification and OCP ligationERCA        can be combined to create an automated high throughput        mutation assay that includes DNA amplification from        limiting samples and allele detection in a single tube                    Results                  Probe Design          The OCP ligationERCA assay was improved to meet the          requirements for fast and accurate genotyping Probes          for both alleles were combined in a single reaction tube          Figure  One OCP annealed perfectly to the normal          sequence of interest and the other targeted the mutant          The  terminal nucleotide of the OCP annealed opposite          the variant nucleotide If the OCP and the target matched          at the mutation site the OCP was circularized by ligase          If the OCP was mismatched at the  end it was not          ligated There are a number of advantages to having both          probes present in the same reaction as opposed to having          each probe in a separate reaction     For instance          if amplification fails in a biallelic ie two allele          reaction signal is not generated for either allele and          the result can be discarded However if only one of the          two reactions fail in a two reaction single allele per          well format a heterozygote could be miscalled as a          homozygote Furthermore the two allele per well format          reduced nonspecific amplification With both mutant and          normal OCP in the reaction either one or the other or          both OCPs were circularized depending on the genotype          Therefore there was a specific rolling circle reaction          in every assay regardless of the genotype The kinetics          of the specific rolling circle reaction were sufficiently          rapid so that nonspecific amplification was greatly          reduced or eliminated Details of the mechanism of the          Exponential Rolling Circle Amplification ERCA reaction          are shown in Figure           The exponential amplification of the ligated probe          sequence generates double stranded DNA products that are          unit lengths of the probe     Electrophoretic          separation on an agarose gel generates a ladder of DNA          bands as seen in Figure  Typically the products ranged          in size from  bases to  kb with most products less          than  bases long The ERCA products for normal and          mutant alleles incorporate a different fluorescent P          primer In Figure  signal from the normal allele          results in FAM false color green fluorescence while          signal from the mutant allele results in Cy false color          red fluorescence A sample with heterozygous genotype          produces both colors          The OCPs were redesigned to incorporate a hairpin          structure Figure  that improved target specificity          analogous to beacon    probe design Parameters          affecting the stability of the hairpin were tailored to          increase the specificity of target recognition Target          directed hybridization using a hairpin is more specific          than hybridization of a linear probe because the          structure of the hairpin probe is maintained in a folded          state unless the hairpin sequence encounters its          preferred target sequence If the probe does not          encounter the correct target the hairpin will remain          selfannealed reducing the possibility of nonspecific or          transient annealing events Only the extensive base          pairing between the probe and target sequence is          sufficient to disrupt the hairpin          The new probe design also provides a way to reduce          background by rendering unused probe inert Figure           During ERCA the end of the hairpin of unused probe is          extended by DNA polymerase to produce a nonreactive          doublestranded product data not shown In the absence          of a method such as this for either removing or          inactivating unused OCP nonspecific background          amplification can occur     Sequencing of          misamplification products data not shown     has          revealed that misamplification products produced in the          absence of ligase usually consist of a short OCPderived          sequence immediately flanked by primer sequences Each          primerOCPprimer unit was repeated dozens or hundreds          of times in tandem The unit sequence varied randomly          from reaction to reaction and sometimes more than one          sequence was present in a reaction The exact mechanism          for generating and expanding misamplification products          with this overall sequence motif is not completely          understood However improved probe design that results          in enzymatic elimination of unused OCPs as demonstrated          with the  hairpin OCP can reduce or eliminate unwanted          nonspecific amplifications          To determine the effect of the  hairpin on          genotyping accuracy probes with and without  hairpins          were designed for both the Factor V Leiden and          Hemochromatosis HD mutations Table  Control probes          lacking hairpins were constructed in two different ways           Hairpins in the FVL probes were removed by simply          deleting the nontarget directed OCP sequence involved in          hairpin formation This did not change priming sites or          the base pairing between the probe and target but          nonhairpin probes were reduced in length by           nucleotides compared to the hairpin probes  To          eliminate the  hairpin without changing the length of          the OCP the hairpins in the HD probes were removed by          changing the sequence of the OCP such that the length of          the probes was conserved but the base pairing in the          hairpin was disrupted Real time ERCA genotyping          reactions were performed using FVL and HD probes with          and without  hairpins Figures   and  The          fluorescence versus time was plotted for each of           samples grouped according to genotype The genotyping          signals appeared in as little as  minutes using the          QPNA detection system Genotyping calls were made as          described in Methods Determination of Genotypes Real          Time OCP ligationERCA For both FVL and HD          nonspecific amplification occurred when OCPs lacked the          hairpin structure Strong nonspecific signal appeared for          samples known to be either homozygous mutant or normal          frequently generating a heterozygous genotyping miscall           samples were genotyped for FVL and H FVL genotyping          with the nonhairpin probes resulted in unacceptably high          error with only  of the samples called correctly          Figure  Results for nonhairpin HD probes were          similar with only  called correctly Figure  In          both cases the nonhairpin genotyping reactions showed a          dramatic increase in the incidence of late appearing          nonspecific signal When the hairpin containing OCPs          were used all  samples were genotyped correctly          Figures and           To increase the accuracy of genotyping probes for          both alleles were combined in a single tube format For          heterozygotes the two probes are concurrently amplified          in the ERCA reaction Exponential amplification of          circularized OCP requires primers P and P see Figure           The concurrent amplification of mutant and normal          probes is kept in balance by using the same P for each          probe P primers were routinely titrated to determine          optimum concentration     This approach greatly          reduces the difficulty of balancing the kinetics of          biallelic ERCA amplifications If the P primer is common          to both OCPs only P priming efficiencies need to be          similar greatly simplifying the process of obtaining          balanced reaction kinetics in a biallelic assay          The use of several P and P primers which initiate          DNA synthesis from multiple positions on the probe and          product increases ERCA rate sensitivity and specificity               data not shown Therefore secondary          amplification primers were designed for each probe In          genotyping reactions where two probes were present in a          single reaction the secondary primers were designed to          anneal to target specific sequences shared by both OCPs          in the  andor  arms Table                           Genotyping Accuracy          The improvements to the OCP ligationERCA genotyping          reaction outlined above were incorporated into four          genotyping assays and a study was performed to test the          reaction design for genotyping accuracy Probes for the          Factor V Leiden FVL mutant and normal alleles see          Table  were designed using the parameters outlined in          Methods These probes were used to screen a  patient          sample set that had been previously genotyped using RFLP          The sample groups were enriched for the mutant genotypes          that normally occur at very low frequency in the          population For example the FVL sample group contained           normal  heterozygous and  homozygous mutant          patient samples for the FVL allele Of  genotyping          reactions performed in triplicate  total FVL          reactions only  samples gave inconsistent genotyping          results and had to be repeated A repeat was indicated if          any of the three independent experiments did not agree          By performing reactions in triplicate the assay yielded          results that were  accurate with a  repeat rate          Reactions performed only once had an accuracy of            Results were visualized as both real time and endpoint          and a representative FVL genotyping experiment is shown          in Figure  The genotype for each sample was determined          as outlined in Methods and compared to the known          genotype The number of samples genotyped and the          accuracy of genotyping are summarized in Table           Probes for the Factor II prothrombin FII mutant and          normal alleles see Table  were designed as discussed          in Methods These probes were used to screen a           patient sample set that was previously genotyped using          RFLP There were two mutant genotypes  heterozygotes          and  homozygous normal genotypes Because mutant          patient samples were limiting a separate sample group          that consisted of multiple repeats of the same Factor II          mutant and heterozygous samples was screened As with the          genotyping assays described above Factor II prothrombin          FII mutant genotyping results were also visualized          either in real time or as an endpoint assay Figure           Summary of results is shown in Table  Samples probed          for the Factor II mutation were genotyped with           accuracy within a single assay  accuracy if          performed in triplicate          Probes for the two Hemochromatosis mutations HD and          CY were designed using the parameters outlined in          Methods and used to screen patient sample sets of known          genotype probe sequences in Table  There were           samples screened for HD and  samples screened for          CY This sample group was also enriched for the mutant          genotype containing  homozygous normal           heterozygous and  homozygous mutant the single mutant          was repeated  times for the H allele and  normal           heterozygous and  homozygous mutant patient samples          for the C allele Examples of typical genotyping          results for HD are shown in Figure and results for          CY are shown in Figure  Genotyping results were          visualized as both real time reaction traces and as an          endpoint assay Samples screened for both          hemochromatosis mutations were genotyped with           accuracy within a single assay  accuracy if          performed in triplicate Table                             Discussion        OCP ligationERCA can be used to directly probe genomic        DNA for SNPs or mutations and the entire process can be        performed in a single tube The ERCA amplification reaction        is rapid generating signal in as little as  minutes and        is incubated at a single temperature These characteristics        make OCP ligationERCA easily adaptable to high throughput        automated genotyping platforms Accurate genotyping was        obtained in screens designed to detect four clinically        relevant mutations Factor V Leiden Factor II prothrombin        Hemochromatosis CY and Hemochromatosis HD        Several improvements to the ligationERCA method           have increased accuracy to levels acceptable for diagnostic        applications and reduced reaction time Other reports using        ERCA based genotyping require PCR amplification of the        locus of interest prior to genotyping      which is        prohibitively expensive time consuming and more difficult        to automate We have designed ERCA primers that are        optimized for minimal misamplification and artifact        formation With any exponential signal amplification        method nonspecific amplification due to exponential        artifacts presents a potential problem In ERCA as in PCR        amplification of primerprimer artifacts can mimic specific        signal if primers are not selected carefully To avoid this        problem commercially available primer design software was        used to design P and P primers that are optimal for        amplification This step does not necessarily have to be        repeated for each target however which is an advantage        over PCR based methodologies The primary amplification        primer sequences are present in the OCP backbone not in        the portion of the OCP that anneals to target allowing        optimized P and P pairs to be used for many different        targets In principle a small collection of optimized        PP pairs should contain primers that can be used for any        given target        The QPNA detection system    was used as a        fluorescent reporter during ERCA During ERCA QPNA is        rapidly displaced from the ERCA product and is physically        separated from the fluor in a bimolecular reaction        resulting in detectable signal in as little as  minutes        By comparison Amplifluors typically required         minutes to generate signal     The substantial        difference in time to generate signal may be due to the        nature of Amplifluor design In an Ampliflour        complementary DNA sequences fluorescent reporter and        quencher are all covalently linked on the same DNA strand        The comparative stability of the unimolecular Amplifluor        hairpin is likely to hinder displacement synthesis when        compared to the bimolecular QPNA system In addition the        high local concentration of fluor and quencher may serve to        supress signal from the Amplifluor The QPNA based        reporter system consistently produces signal far more        rapidly than the Amplifluor based system allowing time to        result of less than an hour for the entire assay        Secondary allele specific nonfluorescent primers can        also be used to increase the speed and specificity of ERCA        These primers significantly advanced the rate of ERCA        amplification cutting the reaction time in half for the        Factor V Leiden probe set data not shown resulting in a        minute assay Although maximum fluorescent signal        decreased slightly as each additional nonfluorescent primer        was added the addition of one or two more primers to the        reaction did not adversely influence signal strength to the        extent that genotyping was compromised        Each of the four assays developed for this report        contained two probes one for each allele Using both        probes in a single reaction has been demonstrated to reduce        the levels of nonspecific amplification due to primer        dimers and misamplification of unligated probe     At        least one of the probes will always be amplified        suppressing low levels of nonspecific signal        The introduction of a hairpin into the design of the        open circle probes similar to approaches taken in        molecular beacon design     provides a means to        regulate the degree of ligation discrimination A  andor         stemloop structure may be designed to increase specific        binding to difficult sequences The ratio of the hairpin        stability to target annealing stability directly affects        the overall target annealing specificity By modulating the        stability of the hairpin any OCP can be fine tuned for        ligation specificity        The OCP  hairpin also decreases the level of        nonspecific DNA synthesis caused by misamplification of OCP        sequences Analysis of misamplified products has shown that        OCP sequences are usually found in the misamplified DNA        products This means that uncircularized OCP is able to        provide a template for primerbased misamplification        Removing the unligated OCP helps to reduce background        amplification     but digestion of the unused OCP or        purification of the ligated circles introduces time        consuming and expensive steps Designing a  hairpin into        the OCP creates a selfpriming sequence in unligated OCP        During ERCA the polymerase will extend unligated OCP        starting at the  end in a suicide pathway that renders        the OCP double stranded and inert This approach eliminates        nonspecific amplification and improves genotyping accuracy        without the introduction of separate isolation or        purification steps As demonstrated above removal of the        hairpin sequence either by deletion or point mutation of        the base paired region resulted in greatly decreased        genotyping accuracy for both Factor V Leiden and        Hemochromatosis HD genotyping assays        Additional methods to improve ERCA specificity were        integrated into the genotyping protocol Careful design        allowed the same P sequence to be used in the ERCA        reaction for both alleles For each set of OCPs the P        sequence was generic The generic P was not part of the        target specific portion of the probe which allowed it to        be used in both the normal and mutant OCP Because both        probes in each assay contained the same P the reaction        kinetics could be more easily balanced promoting uniform        amplification for both alleles Uniform amplification is        especially important when the genotype is heterozygous so        that both alleles are accurately represented        Genotyping accuracy depends on using sufficient        quantities of genomic DNA target As expected OCP        ligationERCA results were influenced by the amount of        genomic DNA used in the assay Typically genotyping was        possible with as little as  ng target DNA However        specific signal strength increased with more DNA target up        to  ng after which no further benefit was seen data        not shown WGA DNA can be produced in milligram quantities        from nanograms    of original sample allowing use of        high DNA concentration for optimal signal As a result         ng WGA DNA was used to obtain optimal genotyping        reaction conditions The results obtained for the WGA DNA        agreed in every instance with the known genotypes        determined by RFLP WGA product should also be compatible        with other genotyping assays where better results can be        obtained using more target DNA        Many aspects of probe design are open to manipulation        and in practice probes can be successfully designed for        most target sequences of interest Pickering         et al demonstrated a  success        rate in designing OCPs for  different targets on the        first attempt     Probes can be designed against either        strand of genomic DNA and the backbone portion can also be        varied Optimization of T         m parameters and sequence allows rapid        design of OCPs with a high degree of success        The degree to which a genotyping assay needs to be        optimized depends in part on the purpose of the assay A        genotyping system intended for diagnostic purposes needs to        meet the highest standards of accuracy robustness and        throughput as compared to a system that is intended solely        for research purposes In recognition of the expectation        that  accuracy is a requirement even under suboptimal        conditions the assays developed for the targets in this        report have undergone extensive optimization to maximize        accuracy even under less than optimal conditions As a        result the concentrations of primers probes and        polymerase vary between assays After determining the best        conditions for each individual genotyping assay the        expectation is that these conditions would be the best        possible for genotyping large numbers of samples with high        accuracy The critical nature of the information derived        from the output of the assay justifies the extra        optimization effort To minimize the potential for error        the accuracy for a single assay was compared to the accuray        for the same assay performed in triplicate Depending on        the assay requirements the level of accuracy can be        selected by increasing or decreasing the number of repeats        The demonstration that high levels of input genomic DNA        improve robustness of genotyping results is paralleled by        PCR results WGA can be used to generate sufficient DNA for        genotyping using large quantities of template The cost of        performing WGA is offset by the fact that sample prep is        unnecessary WGA product can be performed directly on crude        blood sample and yields enough DNA for dozens or hundreds        of genotyping reactions     Under different        circumstances it may be necessary to rapidly generate        assays for a large number of SNPs For this the emphasis        could be placed on optimization of assay design Amounts of        input DNA primers and polymerase could be standardized        rapidly yielding accurate genotyping assays but without the        highest accuracy under suboptimal conditions The process        of OCP ligation followed by ERCA has been designed such        that genomic DNA can be genotyped directly in less than an        hour Hundreds of individual samples were genotyped with        over  accuracy Accurate genotyping was demonstrated for        both genomic DNA and whole genome amplified DNA Isothermal        exponential amplification produces a fluorescent signal        from ligated OCP using nanomolar amounts of probe Because        OCP ligation ERCA does not rely on thermal cycling for        amplification amplification kinetics are not limited by        cycling rate The exponential nature of the reaction        produces millions of fold amplification in as little as         minutes Output can be read on a fluorescent plate reader        real time PCR instrument fluorescent imager or other        device equipped with the ability to measure fluorescent        signals OCP ligation ERCA probes can be multiplexed OCP        ligation and ERCA reactions for each SNP target are        performed in a single tube and are easily scalable from         to  well formats making OCP ligation ERCA ideal for        high throughput screening                    Methods

   phosphorylated and gel purified OCPs were designed such          that the  terminal nucleotide annealed opposite the          mutation of interest Figure  The T           m for the  arm of the probe annealed          to target was designed to be between C The  arm          of all OCPs annealed to target upstream of the mutation          and was designed to have a T           m of approximately C Oligo           Molecular Biology Insights Inc Cascade CO was used          to calculate T           m values          To reduce or eliminate the artifactual amplification          of unligated OCPs a hairpin was designed into the  end          of the OCP with approximately  bases in the stem and           in the loop The hairpin was calculated to be stable          at C in the context of the entire OCP using the DNA          folding server at Michael Zuckers website          httpbioinfomathrpieduzukermOCP sequence was          chosen such that the hairpin was the only

primers were selected using the multiplex function of          Oligo  A subset of these compatible primers was          utilized as generic P and P primers see Table  ERCA          P primers were labeled with FAM if paired with the          normal OCP or Cy if paired with the mutant OCP and          were RPHPLC purified P primers were purified by          desalting                          Allele Specific ERCA primers          The sequence of these primers was chosen from the          target specific  and arms of the OCP either          complementary to the OCP arm or the exact sequence          of the OCP arm These primers annealed to both the          normal and mutant OCPs The sequences of these allele          specific primers are shown in Table  Allele specific          primers were desalted after synthesis                          QPNA          Exponential amplification of circularized OCP see          Figure  was accomplished using generic primers P and          P along

were genotyped using RFLP and an          aliquot of the purified DNA was subsequently used either          directly in genotyping reactions or used after Whole          Genome Amplification WGA                          Whole Genome Amplification WGA of genomic DNA          samples          For some rare genotypes it was only possible to          obtain a few nanograms of sample insufficient for more          than one genotyping reaction As a result the rare          samples were subjected to whole genome amplification          WGA which yielded enough DNA for  or more          reactions WGA

C for  hours          Quality control assays demonstrating that whole genome          amplification was successful were performed for locus           and  as described     and amplified DNA was used          directly in genotyping reactions at the same          concentration as the original genomic DNA typically           ngreaction                          Genotyping reactions           ng to  g

amplitude of amplification The average amplification            threshold time for all amplified reactions was            determined using the ICycler software Fluorescence            traces were normalized using early cycles as a            baseline and a threshold value was determined            typically at fold above the average standard            deviation of the baseline values Threshold cycle for            each trace was measured at the point where the trace            crossed the threshold value Threshold cycle values            fell into three distinct clusters one each for            homozygous normal heterozygous and homozygous mutant            Reactions with times more than  standard deviations            beyond the mean cluster value were considered failures            and repeated In general amplification reactions with            an increase of less than  units were scored as            negative Any reaction with amplification of             fluorescence units above baseline or greater was scored            as positive Reactions with fluorescent units between             above baseline were repeated Any reaction            where signal was baseline for both alleles was            repeated                                End Point OCP ligation ERCA            ERCA reactions were allowed to incubate at C            until the reaction was expected to be complete  to             minutes depending on the assay After the reaction            was complete the results could be read at any time            Some reactions were allowed to remain at room            temperature overnight some were stored at C some            were frozen at C In each case the reaction was            protected from light to prevent photobleaching of the            fluorescent reporters The genotype of each sample was            determined automatically using a modified fuzzy             c means clustering algorithm                which groups the data into three genotypes plus a            negative control and assigns a confidence level to            each genotyping call from  not in cluster to              certainty that point belongs to cluster
