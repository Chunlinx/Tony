                            As the premier biological electron acceptor molecular oxygen O          serves a vital role in fundamental cellular functions including the        process of aerobic respiration Nevertheless with the beneficial properties of O         comes the inadvertent formation of reactive oxygen species including        superoxide O                  hydrogen peroxide H         O          and hydroxyl radical OH these differ from O         in having one two and three additional electrons respectively        Figure  Cells also encounter elevated levels of these reactive oxygen species when they        are released by animals plants and insects as a defense against detrimental organisms        such as microbial pathogens Reactive oxygen species can damage cells in many ways by        inactivating proteins damaging nucleic acids and altering the fatty acids of lipids        which leads in turn to perturbations in membrane structure and function The accumulation        of this oxidative damage underlies the formation of many disease states in humans It is        postulated that tissue injury by these reactive oxygen species accumulates over a long        period of time and plays roles in the aging process and the development of heart disease        diabetes chronic inflammatory diseases cancer and several neurodegenerative diseases        Halliwell         Many organisms have evolved strategies to remove reactive oxygen species and repair        damage which have enabled them to prosper from the tremendous oxidizing potential of O         without succumbing to oxidative damage Bacteria yeast and mammalian        cells all induce the synthesis of global regulatory responses to survive oxidative insults        The consequences of oxidative stress and the corresponding defense responses have been        extensively studied in         Escherichia coli  For ease of study in the laboratory the        stress responses are often provoked by the external addition of chemical oxidants that        specifically elevate the levels of reactive oxygen species within cells or by the use of        mutant strains that disrupt the normal homeostatic mechanisms for removing reactive        oxygen species or the damage they do While this primer focuses on a particular set of        protective and regulatory protein modifications induced by oxidative stress in         E coli  it should be noted that many of the same mechanisms        are present in other organisms some specific examples from other species will also be        described        The major target of O                 damage identified in bacteria is a class of dehydratase enzymes that        utilize FeS clusters to bind their substrate Imlay  Djaman et al  Since        some of these enzymes function in the citric acid cycle also called the Krebs cycle and        in amino acid biosynthesis high levels of O                 lead to a requirement for certain amino acids in growth media Imlay        and is well known Fridovich  H         O         for its role in oxidizing thiol SH groups of cysteinyl amino acid        residues in proteins Elevated levels of H         O         also are associated with the oxidation of other amino acids leading        to the formation of methionine sulfoxide and a variety of carbonyls Lastly because of its        extreme reactivity OH targets all of the major macromolecules of cells RNA DNA        protein and lipids The extent to which membrane lipids are targets appears to depend on        the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids which are not as prevalent in        bacteria as they are in mammals        Many enzymes that protect against oxidative damage have been identified in         E coli Imlay   Three superoxide dismutases each of        which contain a different metal center and show different expression patterns and        subcellular localization catalyze the dismutation of O                 to H         O          While the superoxide dismutases eliminate O                  they also are a source of endogenously produced H         O         in         E coli  The major enzymes involved in reducing H         O         to H         O and O         in         E coli are catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase There is        no enzymatic mechanism for decreasing levels of OH produced from H         O          Thus levels of OH will be directly proportional to levels of H         O          and accordingly catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase        activities are critical to oxidative stress survival        Another component to the oxidative stress response is the reduction of oxidized thiols        that arises through one of the mechanisms described below The tripeptide glutathione and        the thiol reductants glutaredoxin and thioredoxin are key to the restoration of thiols to        their reduced state SH Fernandes and Holmgren          E coli contains three glutaredoxins that utilize the reducing        power of glutathione to catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds SS in the presence        of NADPH and glutathione reductase There are two thioredoxins in         E coli that also function to reduce disulfide bonds Reduced        thioredoxin is regenerated by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH The fact that NADPH is        required to maintain the reduced state of glutathione and thioredoxin indicates that the        response to oxidative stress is coupled to the physiological status of core pathways that        generate NADPH                    Regulatory Roles of Thiol Modifications        As mentioned above proteinsin particular the thiols of cysteinesare the major        targets of H         O          The reaction of cysteinyl thiolates with H         O         can lead to the formation of different modifications such as sulfenic        acid SOH sulfinic acid SO         H and sulfonic acid SOH as well as disulfide bond formation        SS and glutathione conjugation SGSH Jacob et al  Poole et al  Figure         These modifications often alter the structure and function of the protein Recent        progress in this field points to a common chemistry in the reaction of H         O         with thiolates through the initial formation of sulfenic acid In the        case of proteins that have a nearby cysteinyl residue a disulfide bond forms between the        two sulfur atoms The sulfenated cysteinyl residue also can react with a cysteinyl residue        on another protein or with glutathione leading to a mixed disulfide If no cysteinyl        residue is nearby the sulfenated cysteine can be further oxidized to sulfinic or sulfonic        acid or it can remain in the sulfenic acid state All but the sulfinic and sulfonic acid        modifications are readily reversible by reduction using proteins such as thioredoxin or        glutaredoxin though sulfinic acid reductase activities have recently been identified in        yeast and mammalian cells denoted sulfiredoxin and sestrin respectively Biteau et al         Budanov et al         Given the reversible nature of most forms of thiol oxidation it has been suggested that        thiol modifications can play roles in signal transduction that are similar to protein        phosphorylationdephosphorylation Sitia and Molteni  In support of this model there        are several examples of proteins whose activities are modulated by thiol oxidation and        reduction        The first of these examples is the OxyR transcription factor which upregulates peroxide        defenses in         E coli and a variety of other bacteria OxyR contains two        critical cysteines that are oxidized to form an intramolecular disulfide bond when cells        encounter peroxide stress Zheng et al  Aslund et al  Disulfide bond formation        is associated with a conformational change that alters OxyR binding to DNA and allows the        protein to activate the transcription of genes encoding enzymes such as catalase and the        alkylhydroperoxide reductase that destroy H         O          Once the H         O         concentration is decreased OxyR is reduced and the system is reset        The unusually reactive cysteine in OxyR that is oxidized by H         O         to form the sulfenic acid intermediate can clearly be nitrosylated and        glutathionylated in vitro Hausladen et al  Kim et al  but the in vivo        relevance of these other modifications is questionable Mukhopadhyay et al         Two other examples of redoxregulated proteins are the         E coli chaperone protein Hsp Jakob et al  and the         Streptomyces coelicolor antisigma factor RsrA Li et al         Paget and Buttner  Bae et al  For these proteins the cysteine residues which        form intramolecular disulfide bonds are in a reduced state when coordinated to a zinc ion        Zn          and zinc is released upon oxidation of the thiols For both        proteins oxidation and zinc release are associated with an opening of the protein        structure For Hsp this structural change allows for dimerization and activates its        chaperone activity Graf et al  RsrA on the other hand dissociates from a promoter        specificity factor of RNA polymerase an extracytoplasmicfunctiontype alternative sigma        factor allowing the transcription of genes that permit recovery from the stress Li et al         Bae et al  Among the target gene products is a thioredoxin which reduces the        disulfide bonds that form within oxidized RsrA Presumably reduction of the disulfide        restores the binding of zinc and its inhibitory association with the sigma factor Thus        the RsrA regulatory circuit provides another example comparable to OxyR in which the        modification of a regulatory protein thiol group can be linked to a change in the        transcriptional output of genes that remediate stress        The peroxidesensing repressor OhrR from         Xanthomonas campestris pv         phaseoli Panmanee et al  and         Bacillus subtilus Fuangthong and Helmann  can be        inactivated by H         O         or by organic peroxides ROOH formed by the oxidation of a variety of        organic molecules in the cell or in the environment The         B subtilis OhrR transcription regulator contains only a single        cysteine that forms a relatively stable sulfenic acid upon its reaction with H         O         or organic peroxides Fuangthong and Helmann  Oxidation of the        single cysteine leads to the dissociation of OhrR from its DNA binding site and the        derepression of the gene encoding an organic hydroperoxidase that eliminates the initial        oxidizing insult        In this issue Hondorp and Matthews  provide an example of a thiol modification        that protects an enzyme activity during oxidative stress Their data suggest that when        cells encounter oxidative stress a key cysteinyl residue near the active site of        methionine synthase MetE is glutathionylated This modification blocks access of the        substrate and prevents further synthesis of methionine This finding is significant in that        it presents a mechanism to reversibly preserve the function of a protein during oxidative        challenge By glutathionylating a single cysteinyl residue the protein is protected from        further oxidation of that cysteinyl residue to the irreversible sulfinic and sulfonic acid        forms Once the stress is removed the mixed disulfide bond will be readily reduced and        access to the substrate restored                    Prevalence of Regulatory Thiol Modifications        As illustrated by the examples above an array of chemical modifications obtained by        oxidizing cysteinyl residues has been exploited in combating oxidative stress Yet it is        important to note that not all cysteinyl residues of proteins are readily oxidized by        oxidants such as H         O          We do not currently understand all of the features that determine        the reactivity of a particular thiol to H         O         Poole et al  The pKa of the thiolates clearly plays an        important role as thiolates are more reactive than their protonated counterparts In        addition the contribution of protein environment to the stability of the oxidized products        is also known to be a factor but is not well understood Given that many of the thiol        modifications do not appear to be in equilibrium with the redox state of the cell the        features of the protein that determine the rate at which the modifications are formed are        another important parameter        The added complexity of the cysteine targets that compose part of a Zn binding site        found for Hsp and RsrA raises questions about the function of the zinc Perhaps Zn        binding provides some additional control over the reactivity of the cysteine thiols or        perhaps the loss of the zinc facilitates conformational changes Recently the oxidative        stressinduced thioredoxin from         E coli has also been shown to contain a H         O         labile zinc site although the loss of zinc does not change its        reductase activity Collet et al  Thus the way this oxidatively labile Zn site        affects thioredoxin function has yet to be established        The extent of thiol oxidation within the cell remains another open question The variety        of modifications that arise from treatment with H         O         and the experimental challenges associated with their detection has        made it difficult to catalog all the proteins that are modified and all the types of        modifications that exist In this issue Leichert and Jakob  report a general method        for detecting cellular proteins whose cysteinyl residues were modified after imposing an        oxidative stress Such an approach will greatly enhance our understanding of targets of        oxidative stress The method described by Leichert and Jakob also will be useful in        detecting transient cysteine modifications        The importance of monitoring transient changes in cysteines is highlighted by the recent        finding that oxidation of the Yap activator of antioxidant genes in the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a peroxidase denoted Gpx or        Orp Delaunay et al  In this case H         O         reacts with a cysteine in Orp forming an unstable sulfenic acid        intermediate that then reacts with a cysteinyl residue of Yap to form an intermolecular        disulfide The disulfide undergoes an exchange with a second cysteine within Yap to form        an intramolecular disulfide that locks Yap in a confirmation that masks the nuclear export        signal Wood et al  Thus methods that allow the appearance of thiol modifications        in cells to be monitored kinetically will greatly enhance our understanding of how cysteine        residues become oxidized        The examples mentioned here illustrate the versatile potential of thiol modifications        Given the reversibility of thiol oxidations and the wide range of structural constraints        that can be imposed by the formation of a sulfenic or sulfinic acid or a disulfide bond we        predict there will be many more examples of regulation by thiol modification
