        um i dont know about you but uh i work outside the home and uh       in fact uh ill be leaving very shortly to go to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a a later shift to where i dont have the family time uh when my husband gets home its usually hes home with my daughter alone and then uh couple of hours later im home um i dont know im finding that more and more people that i talk to theres less and less family time available to them and uh it seems that business wise um in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family so you know if you do have any time its kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done um just just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children and it its sometimes a very its a its a very hard juggling act   i agree   and you know i look at my daughter and shes now uh four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i dont have that much time with her   yeah   and shes growing fast and   i know that i have three children and um i stay home i dont work   umhum uhhuh   and um i know that it it must be really challenging to um try to juggle a job and and also your children because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is   yeah   we wouldnt have the influence on them that i would wanna put on them   yeah sure exactly   and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to day care every day   umhum uhhuh   they dont like to be around adults   uhhuh   they dont wanna play around adults they dont want to be around you they dont want you to tell them what to do they want to do their own thing and theyre the very same age as my children   sure umhum exactly   and im finding as i volunteer up at the school i just a being um im not educated at all in um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after ive worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home   umhum sure sure   and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that um the ones that are are home and the ones even that are home that are getting the love and attention they need   umhum   not that the kids that go out arent getting that its just a different theyre they are more used to being with their own age kids theyre not use to being with adults and to responding to adults   yeah yeah sure sure sure yeah i agree to a   um i think the trend in the United States i feel really bad that its turned so much to where the children are um   i think so too in fact um i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks whatever the employer says you have to be back to work is basically when you have to be back to work whether it be six weeks or three or four but how these women must feel to place their children into care and you know its our society saying yes this um you need this job its a little bit financial type thing because uh if you look all over in the other countries like Europe and that um their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and thats part of it too but   right   uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know ill go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well ill have the boat ill have the car and its nice   right   and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too uh because it is now our financial situations are as it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now and   its hard it really is hard i know that my husband and i have to do a lot of sacrificing to keep me home and um   umhum sure i did it for three years and uh it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it and pretty soon you know youre at the limit where youve got to say okay youve sacrificed for you know so many years at home and youre not getting any further you know along   right   and you have to make that decision to go back to work part time or go back to work full time and you have to make that decision and its a tough one and i   right i think one of the things that people look at too though is um spending how they spend their time with their children   umhum   i think with working moms if you can get the managers the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like theyre going to do with year round school where you work   sure
