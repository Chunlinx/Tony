               okay um i i guess um you know i really i remember what school was like when i grew up and uh you know back then i believe i really do believe people had more respect for teachers back then   well thats what i was thinking the discipline just isnt there anymore like it used to be   umhum umhum   and theyve lost the teachers have lost control   yeah i agree and i dont know  i you know i think some of that stems with the parents but   well i think so too   i i think some of it also stems from just society in general  because teachers arent looked looked upon as uh you know like with as much respect as they use the to be   thats right   because back then you know if you were a teacher people used to think oh you know that you know thats great and nowadays if youre a teacher its like oh you had nothing else that you could come up with to do so you decided to go into teaching   yeah well they didnt used to sue the teachers like theyre doing now and thats why why the teachers are in so much trouble   you know its like yeah that too thats true thats true   thats really too bad that the teachers dont have have control over the students like they used to   yeah thats true yeah my wifes a teacher but she teaches preschool   and see the um parents used to back up the teachers too they would sit they would tell the kids now you do what your teacher says   umhum umhum thats right   and the teacher would let them know if they werent doing the right thing and the parents would be right there on the kids but   thats right and it seems to me like now its just the opposite in in a in a lot of cases you know the   thats right thats right parents are behind their kids now and they believe the things that they say about the teachers so   right umhum yeah i   i dont know how they would correct it   yeah yeah and i also dont believe that you know uh you know physical punishment is is really the answer either uh   no i dont believe that either   uh because you know a lot of kids you know they get that at home you know they dont need it at school either they need some other way of   right   of discipline thats you know its going to uh more or less snap you know snap the child around  and and get them you know just just earn some respect   right   you know anybody can beat up on anybody else   well they should just for the discipline at school they should just uh take away some of their things that they enjoy the most   yeah yeah i guess it really would i mean doesnt matter what age the the child is you know anywhere from preschool to you know teenagers you know you take away what they what they want and enjoy then theyre going to pay attention to you   right right   thats true   i have a sister thats a first grade teacher she teaches first grade   umhum umhum   and she just she thoroughly enjoys the kids she really likes them   yes yes yeah   and im gonna im going back to school im gonna start back in January get my teaching certificate im gonna teach high school     ooh youre brave   im gonna be a home economics teacher     ah you know i i think maybe it might not be too bad of an idea  you you i dont know if youve seen the movie where the the principal cracks down on the kids and he says okay let me know who all the trouble makers are and theyre out of here and im wondering how practical that is to apply to you know to all the schools its   yeah   i mean i wonder if that would work or not or what kind of alternative they could provide for these you know troubled kids and trouble makers that type of thing   well you know the main theres a big really another big problem and thats the drop out problem now all the kids are dropping out and i think its because the parents dont tell them they cant   umhum yeah thats right   parents dont dont um you know the kids say well i dont want to do that anymore and then the parents say well okay whatever you think and thats what that wasnt that way when i was a kid     yeah thats true   uh and wed say why do we have to do that and the parent would say because i told you so  and you do what i say see they found theyve     right right   theyve uh lost whoevers supposed to take charge here   yeah it its getting to the point where you know where well you know its kind of with both parents having to work its really hard to uh     that has a lot to do with it too uhhuh they cant watch over their kids anymore like they used to   uh to have the strength yeah yeah and then when mom and dad do give notice at home then you know theyre too tired from working all day long they just assume let them do whatever they want and   neat yeah   dont bother me im tired   uhhuh yeah its really too bad   and that doesnt help either thats true   because it depends on what they do in school as how theyre going to do their future things in life   yeah thats true especially i think at the younger ages uh elementary you know  i i think maybe you know i hate to say you know one teacher teaching a certain grade is is higher priority than another teacher but you know so much of of what they experience in their early years   oh thats right they need the basics too in the education they need that reading and writing   sets a pattern umhum um
