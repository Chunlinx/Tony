                                 Theater of War            According to Nathaniel Hawthorne who met Abraham Lincoln in March of  oneyear into the Civil War Lincoln looked like a country schoolmaster He wasabout the homeliest man I ever saw Lincolns hair was black still unmixedwith gray stiff somewhat bushy and had apparently been acquainted withneither brush nor comb that morning after the disarrangement of thepillow                           The manwho spruced up the shaggy president for posterity was Mathew Brady and a brushand comb were the least of his tools of transformation as a comprehensiveexhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington makes abundantlyclear Bradys studio assistants used vises and braces to keep their subjectsstill columns and drapes to make them look distinguished light and shade togive them depth and stature When Lincoln posed for Brady in  during acampaign swing through New York City Bradys staff retouched the negative toreel in Lincolns roving left eye and erased the lines on his face Theshimmering and widely published result according to Lincoln made mePresident A Brady Lincoln is on the penny and another on the fivedollarbill                        This exhibition along with the excellentcatalog by curator Mary Panzer is out to correct the impression that Bradycaptured the look of his times with the new apparatus that couldnt lie Bradyis often credited with bringing the war home in the images that appeared innewspapers all across the North Bradys name in fact has become all butsynonymous with Civil War photography While it is probably true as SusanSontag has argued that Bradys images of the horrors of the battlefields didnot make people any less keen to go on with the Civil War he did convey tohis audience the sheer human cost of the war He also inspired generations ofphotographersespecially such s masters of documentation as BereniceAbbott and Walker Evanswith the idea that there was something peculiarlyAmerican about the pitiless gaze of the camera If he has not brought bodiesand laid them in our dooryards and along the streets wrote a New YorkTimes editorialist at the time he has done something very like it Thesewere the images that lit a fire in the brain of Stephen Crane when he waswriting The Red Badge of Courage  years later            Butactually as Panzers catalog makes clear Brady was put off by corpses Thestunning images of the Antietam dead lying in ditches where they fell are thework published under Bradys name of his brilliant assistants AlexanderGardner and Timothy OSullivan You can see some of these battlefield photosin                   Slate               s The Taste for Taboo            Far from being a documentarian Bradyconsidered himself an artist and his images in the jargon of current arthistory were highly constructed When a general failed to show up for agroup photograph of Gen William Sherman and his staff Brady had himphotographed the next day and spliced his image into the ensemble When thefaces of the Senate committee convened to impeach President Andrew Jacksonlooked too sour Brady painted in a reassuringly genteel background For a fewhundred dollars he was willing to go all the way and replace the grays of aphotograph with painted colors            Bradyworked in close collaboration with painters Lincoln died in a room barelylarge enough to hold his bed but Brady photographed the multitude of mournersone by one in his studio and the painter Alonzo Chappel assembled them oftenin the exact poses Brady had choreographed in a monumental and wildly popularpainting The Last Hours of Lincoln             That Brady was a great photographer who did nottake photographs was merely the most obvious of the many paradoxes of hiscareer He was an impresario and a brand name hiring talented assistantsseveral of whom went on to become major photographers in their own right toshoot color and otherwise alter first daguerreotypes and thenBrady wasalways up on the latest technical innovationsstereographs ambrotypesImperial salted paper prints and other photographic exotica During the CivilWar Brady sent teams of assistants into the battlefields His own whereaboutsduring much of the war remain unknown A possible reason for this has come tolight While pursuing Gen Grant for portraits late in the war Brady wasapparently using his knowledge of troop movements to speculate on Wall Streetsending coded messages through intermediaries in New York One of Grantsassistants got wind of the scheme and asked Assistant Secretary of War CharlesDana to tell Grant how he is being deceived by one to whom he has grantedvarious privileges and favors But Grant remained a stalwart supporter ofBrady            Thewizard behind these Ozlike wonders remains elusivewe dont even know whatyear Mathew Brady was born though  is the usual guess His childhood inupstate New York is a blank Brady had serious eye trouble from his youth onan oil portrait in the show by his friend Charles Loring Elliott shows himwearing thick spectacles Brady made his way to New York City and by five years after Daguerre announced his new invention he was already active inthe slightly disreputable trade of photography manufacturing the leather andmetal cases for holding daguerreotypes Bradys first published work was an collaboration with the female warden of Sing Sing on a phrenologicalstudy of prison inmatesthe sort of analysis of criminal physiognomy thatlater influenced painters like Degas and the poet Baudelaire Though Bradynever acknowledged the project he remained in close touch with quacks Adetailed phrenological analysis of Brady himself dating from the yearthat Brady moved his base of operations from New York City to WashingtonDCis included in the exhibition catalog            A tireless selfpromoter a friend describedhim as felicitously prehensile Brady was camerashy placing himself on themargins of photographs in which he appeared or more often with his backturned But theatricality is the hallmark of his work He loved to photographactors the more flamboyant the better He was apparently drawn to women

often appeared as HamletBrady also delighted in Indian costumes among his photographs are those of aUte delegation negotiating a treaty in Washington and of the actor EdwinForrest in warpath regalia as the Indian prince Metamora            When Bradyphotographed the leaders of the antebellum yearsDaniel Webster Henry Clayand the resthe turned them into actors too They strike heroic Napoleonicposes hand to heart which made these wafflers and compromisers lookridiculous after the debacle of the Civil War If you want to see the originalof the pose you can cross the Mall to the National Gallery whereJacquesLouis Davids  Napoleon in His Study hangs            But for Brady himself warnever quite lost its theatricality Unlike his coldeyed assistants hepreferred to visit the battlefield after the corpses had been cleared awayThere he would stand his back turned to us like the contemplative artistfigure in a painting by Caspar David Friedrich and reflect on the glory andfolly of mankind Mathew Brady died in  Elusive till the end he wasscheduled to lecture two weeks later on his life and work as a warphotographerwith slides and patriotic musicat Carnegie Hall
