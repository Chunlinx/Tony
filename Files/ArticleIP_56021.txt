                                  What Do You Say to a Naked Alien            The spaceship comes down in your backyard crushinga bed of petunias and out steps the alien This is always an awkward socialmoment What exactly do you say to someone who may hold the secrets to theuniverse After that is you finish quivering and quaking and wondering if heshe it is going to suck you down like a raw oyster            Obviously you would wantto get some information out of the alienno easy trick to judge from mostalienencounter narratives The aliens who show up in the middle of the nightand abduct people are notoriously stingy with information They never solve anymathematical equations They dont offer up the longsought simple andelegant proof of Fermats Last Theorem They dont tell us where Jimmy Hoffais buried            When aliens do communicate with humans theyre always abit like the Michael Rennie alien in the  movie The Day the Earth StoodStill  They tell us to behave They say we need to get our act togetherTheyre selfhelp gurus A fellow named Darryl Anka channeled an alien namedBashar for many years and Bashar though wise didnt really have much data tooffer just advice on how to live a better life Anka when I last spoke tohim said hed given up channeling Bashar and was working on designing a UFOtheme park            Theres a scene in CarlSagans excellent novel Contact when Ellie Arroway his protagonistwhooshes down some kind of intragalactic wormhole and winds up on a sunnybeach face to face with an alien The alien annoyingly doesnt seem to knowwho built that wormhole subway system Eventually Arroway gets around to askingwhat is no doubt her most urgent question I want to know what you think ofus what you really think            Wow Thats really the wrong question there Thats blowingit big time This gal crosses half the galaxy and is tossed and rattledaround to within an inch of her life and when its over she starts fishing fora compliment            No a better question to an alien would be Whatare you made of Are you based on carbon and liquid water Do you haveDNA as your informationbearing molecule or something like it            Stephen Jay Gould put it this way on TimothyFerris recent PBS program Life Beyond Earth  Whats yourbiochemistry            Some people may argue that other questions shouldprecede the biological ones They might for example choose a politicalquestion asking who exactly is in charge of this universe Or they may skewtheological and ask if theres a God and what exactly hes got on hismind            A good argument could bemade that a physicist should pose the first batch of questions to an alienasking whether its possible to go faster than the speed of light and whetherthere are other universes outside our own The physicist and the alien would nodoubt get embroiled in a discussion of string theory and soon theyd bejotting down incomprehensible equations about dimensional vibrating loopsMaybe at the end of the encounter wed figure out how to yank free energy outof the quantum vacuum Wed have a new trick for cooking a hot dog            My feeling is that the biology questions trump everythingelse We know essentially nothing about life beyond Earth Because we areignorant of other biological systems we have no context for understandingEarth life for knowing to what extent the life we see around us is on thecosmic scale relatively ordinary or totally freakish            We dont know forexample if Earthlike planets are common We look around our own solar systemand what appears to be common are planets that have no life whatsoever We alsosee signs that Venus and Mars were once more hospitable to life and over manyhundreds of millions of years became inhospitable Bad stuff happens to goodplanets Itd be nice to know more about that trend            We also dont know how life originates and to what extentit evolves in an orderly pattern The debate in Kansas over the teaching ofevolution misses the real debates within the field There are those who arguepassionately that life originated with a single replicated molecule Anothercamp favors the notion that it began with a kind of garbage bag of moleculesthat more or less eased its way from nonlife to life And the biggest questionmay be to what extent evolution is divergent or convergent Divergence gives usa bewildering variety of life convergence gives rise repeatedly to certainanatomical features like wings and eyeballs You can make an argument thatintelligence is an extremely unlikely random quirky event in terrestrialbiology or you can make the counterargument that you can see intelligencecoming down the pike from many millions of years in advance On that issuehinges the abundance of intelligent life in the universe            How likely is it that life elsewhere will gothrough the same evolutionary leaps as life on Earth To take one obscure butcritical example Life on Earth remained entirely onecelled for  billionyears For at least half of that time those cells didnt have a nucleus Theycouldnt use oxygen in their metabolism They were pitiful even by microbialstandards So how lucky was the evolutionary leap from prokaryotesnonnucleated microbes to eukaryotes nucleated and using oxygen Ithappened here about  billion years ago Was that our lucky break Or doeslife in general figure out the trick of using oxygen and growing big andbrawny            And of course we dontreally know what were talking about when we talk about intelligence We tendto think of creatures that use technology and language But that could beshortsighted Maybe most intelligent creatures are dolphinoids blissfullyswimming in an alien ocean with little interest in building spaceships            Imagine for a moment that we could see the universe throughthe eyes of an alien creature Would the universe look more or less the sameOr would we be confused dazzled and feel as though we were hallucinating            Are the aliens interested in the same things thatinterest us Could we carry on a meaningful conversation            We should prepareourselves for finding something out there thats totally unexpected And wehave to prepare for bad news or at least bad news in the context of ourStar Trek fantasy We may have wildly overestimated the abundance ofextraterrestrial civilizations Carl Sagan thought there were millions suchcivilizations in existence right now in our own galaxy The actual number maybe a handful Or we could be as Sagans old collaborator IS Shklovskiiargued functionally alone Not literally alone just so isolated thattheres no practical way to make contact of any kind with another intelligentspecies            Whatever we do we shouldnt take ourselves for grantedThere may be something extremely rare and wonderful about a world in whichwater splashes on the surface and where life survives for nearly  billionyears where it has the leisure to evolve and through natural selectionexplore the possibilities of complexity            The search for life beyond Earth always doublesback to our own existence Why are we this way How did we come about Howspecial is it to be a thinking organism This is the kind of stuff youd wantto discuss with the aliens And remember they like it when you compliment themon the really cool spaceship
