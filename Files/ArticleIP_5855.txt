this is a perfectillustration of the truism that theres still one group in this country thatrespectable people even especially sophisticated newspaper people areallowed to slanderSouthern white males Hey Posties  time to reworkthat stylesheet            Having recently read withsome annoyance Michael Lewis Day  Dispatchfrom the Microsoft trial I had to wonder whether                   Slate               s stylesheet had anything to say about this subject Lewis described Microsofts JohnWarden as having an overripe drawl and being Southernbut yet notes he isfrom Indiana Through the rest we get Lewis sensitive transcriptions of abooming hick drawl culminating in a contrast to Jim Barksdale who we aretold has escaped hickdomhe retains only enough of the piney woods patter tooffer a passing imitation of a good ol boy when he needs to As an aside Iwonder how many times the word hick recurred in that short piece            Lewis ismost exposed in his transcriptions At the end of a string of them he quotesWarden as pronouncing modems mode ums Maybe Im just another piney woodshick but dont we all pronounce it like that I guess Ill close by quoting acomment by Lawrence W Levine in Black Culture and Black Consciousness on transcriptions of  th century black speech made by whites            Even when thepronunciation of a given word was precisely the same as that of the collectorstheir desire to indicate the exotic qualities of black speech led them toutilize such misleading and superfluous spellings as wen for when fok orfokes for folks             TomFreeland Oxford Miss

caricatures he drew of the peopleinvolved he brought to life the dynamics of the barely sheathed claws of theinteractions in the courtroom It was refreshing to have coverage that pointedout so

noteThanks for the reminder Weve now corrected our error                                       BlackClinton Myths                        I normally do not write tothe editors of magazines to voice my opinion because I dont think it will doany general good but at this point I cant see what good being silent does Iam a black American and have found it strange that the media have concentratedso much on how AfricanAmericans feel about Clinton It has been my experiencethat our community is only brought into the discussion after every other anglehas been covered and people are being pressured into the right opinion I amtired of reading that Clinton is somehow black or at least as black as any ofour other public officials            As I read Brent StaplesBlack Like Whom I saw at least several assumptions run through hiscommentary on my community and public sentiment about us One assumption isthat at least  percent of AfricanAmericans feel the same way about Clintonfor the same reasons He is black he is great because he comes from a singleparent home or he has a similar background so we can understand himbetter            We are not a singlemindedcommunity that values or devalues Clintons private adulterous conductWhatever our general feeling is about Clintons behavior why are we being usedat the tail end of the blitz of political inquiry as a rallying tool to bringmore people out to vote to produce more negative opinion against Clinton andto reaffirm the idea that we somehow dont know what is really going on            The second assumption thatcomes out is that we dont understand what is happening when a politicalcandidate courts our community on one issue and then targets us on anotherissue Staples runs through a litany of economic gains that have broughtAfricanAmericans closer to some kind of economic stability what stabilitythat is or what marker he uses to measure that stability is unclear whichAfricanAmericans credit Clinton for providing            Staples appears to contrastthe middleclass black community from the lowerclass community when it appearsto fit his framework but to ignore it when it does not fit within his argumentIt is hard for me to believe that he would ignore the education or criminaljustice factsor that AfricanAmericans would ignore the dropping numbers ofstudents in college and graduate school programs the rising level of blacksincarcerated or increasing number of jails The failure to include theholistic view seems even more astonishing given our position in this societywhen the author reviews what is being said and who is asked            I realize that we tend to beheld up for our nonmainstream views on issues such as the Los Angeles riotsOJ Willie Horton and a million others We normally will turn the tideagainst whomever we advocate for or in defense of but when it comes to the jobapproval rating for the president of United States it seems like the mediaattention focused on us is misplaced If our opinion were valued throughoutthis process I think the media would have noticed a marked difference in howwe feel about this president this administration and the process he has gonethrough in order to reach this phase in the impeachment inquiry On this issueI doubt that our approval rating is going to bear on the ultimate question ofwhether the entire public will rally around the Republicans as they move to tryClinton in the Senate The negative perception surrounding our community wasinvoked too late in the game for it to do Clintons opponents any good            I end myemail as I began it by asking if the author truly believes that a few chickenwings given to black preachers a few honorable mentions and awards to a coupleof black poets or visits and speeches to commemorate historic memorials andvisionaries within the black community are enough to lead blacks to rallybehind a president who has allowed our community to lose whatever gains weregiven to us by a browbeaten Congress of the wartorn s And if he doesdoes he think we are gullible enough to buy it as a true understanding by apresident of our collective blackness

black in America say in Black Like Whom that allAfricanAmericans have Southern roots Hed better brush up on history as wellas geography             Helen Hopps SanMiguel El Salvador                                             BrentStaples responds Genevieve Banks claims to have read my essay Black LikeWhom but seems to have missed its central arguments She accuses me ofassuming that AfricanAmericans like Clinton because he is black But I arguefrom the beginning that black affection for Clinton stems from  a widespreadsense among blacks that the economy is doing better by them than ever before a deliberate Clinton program to court black churchgoers who make up theheart of the black middle class and  Clintons intuitive understanding thatthe black middle class is basically conservative on the issues of crime unwedmotherhood and welfare Ms Banks further accuses me of ignoring black schooldropout and incarceration rates To this I plead guilty Those factors areirrelevant to black approval ratings with respect to Clintonspresidency                                       HelenHopps has me dead to rights however I did not intend to say that allAfricanAmericans have Southern roots But most do It may surprise you MsHopps but the majority of black peopleabout  percentstill live in theAmerican South As late as  nearly  percent did Not much before thatthe ratio
