                    Introduction        The immunotherapy of cancer holds promise in harnessing the host immune response to        specifically target tumor cells without harming normal tissues Strategies involve adoptive        cellular therapy or active immune induction commonly referred to as cancer vaccination        Cancer vaccines may consist of whole tumor cells or tumor lysates but identification of        tumorassociated antigens TAAs over the past decade has made possible the use of specific        proteins or peptides as cancer vaccines The antitumor potential of TAAspecific CD T        cells has been illustrated by the demonstrated capacity of adoptive T cell therapy to        reduce tumor size  While endogenous antitumor CD T cell responses may already exist        in some cancer patients  vaccination with TAAderived peptides and in particular        heteroclitic peptide analogs increases the frequency of TAAspecific T cell responses to        detectable levels in many patients  Heteroclitic peptide analogs are        created by substitutions at anchor residues resulting in increased association of peptide        with the major histocompatibility complex MHC  Consequently heteroclitic peptide        analogs are predicted to be more immunogenic than their native counterparts because of more        stable binding at the surface of antigenpresenting cells APCs Indeed T cells capable        of tumor lysis have been isolated from patients vaccinated with heteroclitic peptide         However the presence of TAAspecific T cells elicited by vaccination often        does not correlate with clinical responses         Various reasons for the paradoxical coexistence of cancer cells and TAAspecific T cells        within patients have been proposed  One possibility is that elicited TAAspecific T        cells are not optimally functional in vivo  Another possibility is that T cells        inefficient in tumor recognition or lysis are induced by vaccination  It is becoming        recognized that antigenspecific T cells may have substantially different requirements for        cognate peptide the peptide that is recognizable to a specific T cell clone for efficient        target lysis  Recognition efficiency RE also known as functional        avidity is a measure of the sensitivity of a T cell to different peptide concentrations        for stimulation  We hypothesized that high antigen densities on APCs resulting        from vaccination with heteroclitic peptide may paradoxically drive T cells of predominantly        low RE which are not efficiently activated by the endogenous expression levels of native        peptides on tumor cells Consequently such T cells would be ineffective in tumor cell        destruction Support for this notion is emerging T cells with low RE are predominantly        expanded in vitro with high peptide concentration  Moreover in vitro stimulation of T        cells from healthy donors with heteroclitic peptides results in expansion of cells with a        wide range of RE  A similar phenomenon may occur in vivo leading to TAAspecific T        cells of low RE depending on the nature of antigen stimulation         While isolated T cell clones with low RE have indeed been generated from melanoma        patients following heteroclitic peptide vaccination the proportion of vaccineelicited T        cell responses these cells represent in vivo is not clear If predominantly highRE        tumorcytolytic T cells are generated then a small fraction of lowRE T cells generated        would be of little consequence However if predominantly lowRE T cells are generated        then this low proportion of highRE T cells may be an important factor in the observed lack        of clinical effectiveness of current cancer vaccination strategies To address this        important issue we undertook a systematic examination of the complexity of T cell        responses induced by heteroclitic peptide vaccination and compared these responses to        endogenous antitumor T cell responses which develop in some patients Typically responses        to vaccination are examined following in vitro expansion from patient samples which may        alter the composition of cells and consequently not reveal the proportion of cells in vivo        having sufficiently high RE to lyse tumor targets Although staining with peptideMHC        tetramers provides a direct estimate for the number of TAAspecific T cells present in        vivo and intensity of tetramer staining has been employed as a parameter for isolation of        highRE tumorlytic T cells  staining intensity does not correlate well with RE or        tumorlytic potential  and cannot be considered a reliable indicator for the        functional status of TAAspecific T cells        To analyze and compare T cell responses in melanoma patients on a singlecell level we        generated and examined a large number of cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL clones derived from        postvaccination or endogenous antitumor T cell responses Each clone was analyzed for T        cell receptor TCR variable chain beta VB expression RE and ability to lyse melanoma        targets Importantly these clones were generated directly ex vivo through tetramerguided        sorting which minimizes the selection bias that could be introduced by prior in vitro        expansion Therefore data from these clones could be taken to estimate the complexity of        the responses in vivo                    Methods                  Patients and Samples          All patients had resected stage III or IV melanoma as determined by the  modified          American Joint Commission on Cancer staging system They were required to have a

Generation of CTL Clones          CD T cell clones were derived by FACSorting individual tetramerpositive cells from          PBMC samples prepared for flow cytometry as described above CD

            M T cell clones were incubated with T targets at  ET            ratios for  h then chromium release was measured and percentage cytotoxicity            calculated by standard methods Prior to each cytotoxicity assay clones underwent            ficollhypaque centrifugation to remove dead feeder cells and were determined to be            greater than  CD tetramerpositive T cells by FACS The ET ratio was based upon            live T and target cells For each T cell clone percent cytotoxicity was plotted            against peptide concentration The peptide concentration at which the curve crossed             cytotoxicity was defined as the RE of that clone                                 Microcytotoxic assay            Cells were isolated directly from PBMCs from patient  by FACS

     vaccineinduced or endogenous TAAspecific responses were selected In recent cancer          vaccine trials  many melanoma patients who received heteroclitic peptide vaccines          gp  M IMDQVPSFV GM and MART  L ELAGIGILTV M had          measurable CD peptidespecific T cell responses in PBMCs detected by peptideMHC          tetramer staining In addition TAAspecific T cell responses could be detected in some          patients without vaccination suggesting the existence of an endogenous antitumor T cell          response in these patients For the current study we selected samples from six melanoma          patients from these trialsfour with vaccineelicited responses patients             and  and two with endogenous T cell responses patients  and for detailed          analyses of TCR VB usage RE for the target peptide and tumor cytotoxicity The samples          from these six patient had peptidespecific T cell populations detectable with          GMtetramers patients   and  or Mtetramers patients   and           ranging from  to  of total CD T cells Figure A                          VaccineElicited T Cells Are Functional Directly Ex Vivo but of Variable Tumor          Reactivity          Patient  had the largest detectable TAAspecific CD T cell response           GMtetramerpositive and thus sufficient numbers for examination of lytic function          immediately following isolation To test whether peptidevaccineinduced T cell responses          were functionally active directly ex vivo T cells isolated by GMtetramerguided          cell sorting from patient  were tested for lysis of peptidepulsed and melanoma target          cells in microcytotoxic assays Figure B The directly isolated tetramerpositive T          cells from this patient specifically lysed T cells pulsed with high concentrations           gml of GM and native Gn peptides but not with T cells pulsed with a          cytomegalovirusderived HLAArestricted peptide NLVPMVATV or melanoma targets          This suggests that while a significant portion of the vaccineelicited T cells from          patient  may be functional in vivo they did not have significant tumor lysis          activity          To assess the functional status of the smaller TAAspecific CD T cell responses in          the other five patientswhich were too small for direct cytotoxicity assays after          sortingwe utilized a novel FACS assay for degranulation based on CD mobilization           All six TAAspecific populations exhibited robust functional responses ex vivo as          measured by percentage of GM and Mtetramerpositive cells that mobilized CD          andor downregulated the CD complex upon incubation with T cells pulsed with cognate          peptides Table   In response to melanoma targets mel and MalmeM which          both express gp and MART and are HLAA positive the two endogenous          TAAspecific responses samples from patients  and  also exhibited robust          functional responses directly ex vivo Table   and these responses were          specific as they had little response to A a HLAApositive melanoma cell that          does not express gp or MART and served as a negative control for antigenspecific          killing Table   and  In contrast the vaccineelicited responses exhibited          much lower reactivity to mel and MalmeM Table   These data          demonstrate that all six TAAspecific CD T cell responses were functional ex vivo but          there were significant differences in reactivity to melanoma targets between endogenous          and vaccineelicited responses          To substantiate the generality of these findings we analyzed four additional patients          with vaccineelicited responses One subject responded to GM only patient  one          to M only patient  and two to both GM and M patients  and           Similar to the first four vaccineelicited patients these four additional patients six          TAAspecific responses in total exhibited variable reactivity to melanoma targets          ranging from  to  Table                           VaccineElicited T Cells Have Varied Capacity to Lyse Melanoma Targets          To confirm and further investigate the differences in tumor reactivity between          endogenous and vaccineelicited responses we reasoned that analysis of a set of clonal          CTL lines that represented the tetramerpositive population would provide an accurate          estimate of the complexity of the TAAspecific T cell response in each patient A large          number of clonal CTL lines more than  were generated by FACS of individual GM          and Mtetramerpositive cells directly from PBMC samples Table  Up to  of sorted          cells expanded in various sorts data not shown Randomly selected expanding clones and          the tetramerpositive population from which they were derived were examined for TCR VB          expression using TCR VBspecific monoclonal Abs and VBspecific primers in PCR Diverse          TAAspecific T cell responses were found in the four vaccinated patients with multiple T          cells expressing different TCR VB while the two endogenous responses were less diverse          All but one clone derived from patient  expressed VB while two dominating T cell          populations in patient  expressed VB and VB Table  The clonality of the          dominant populations in these patients was evaluated by PCR fragment length analysis          Table  Identical length fragments were demonstrated in the four selected clones from           BV and  BV populations Identical length fragments were also demonstrated in          all BV clones from patient  Furthermore analysis of sorted tetramerpositive          cells from patient  demonstrated single fragment sizes for BV and BV which were          identical to the fragment sizes generated from the selected clones arguing for clonality          of these dominant populations Table           Peptide specificity and CD expression of each clone was confirmed by staining with          GM and Mtetramers and antiCD monoclonal Ab data not shown To obtain an          accurate reflection of the total T cell population detected with tetramer in each          patient we decided to rigorously examine at least one representative clone for each          subpopulation expressing a different TCR VB Table  Multiple clones were analyzed to          determine dominating populations From patients   and  for which fewer clones          were generated all clones were included in the analyses Table           To determine the effectiveness of tumor lysis by the different TAAspecific T cell          clones that were propagated clones were analyzed for their ability to lyse melanoma cell          lines mel and MalmeM A cells served as a control for antigenspecific killing          In addition each CTL clone was examined for antigenspecific lysis of T cells pulsed          with high levels gml of GM or M peptides Efficient lysis in these          experiments was defined as  or greater specific release of radiolabel from the target          cells  or less specific release was categorized as low or no lysis and  to           was termed intermediate lysis All but two of the CTL clones elicited from endogenous          antitumor responses from patients  and  exhibited efficient lysis of both the          mel and MalmeM melanoma cell lines Figure  In contrast only a few clones from          the vaccineelicited responses from patients    and  efficiently lysed          melanoma cells The majority of clones examined from these vaccineelicited responses          either failed to lyse melanoma targets altogether or lysed them with intermediate          efficiency Figure  This lack of efficiency in melanoma cell lysis was not due to          cellular dysfunction since each clone efficiently lysed T cells pulsed with high levels          of relevant but not irrelevant peptide Figure  Overall the majority of clones          derived from endogenous antitumor responses patients  and  lysed both mel and          MalmeM melanoma target cells more efficiently than clones from vaccineelicited          responses patients    and  Figure  These findings suggest that          TAAspecific T cells elicited by heteroclitic peptide vaccination have different          tumorcytolytic potentials from those which develop endogenously to cancer                          RE for Native and Heteroclitic Peptides of T Cells from Endogenous or          VaccineElicited Responses          We hypothesized that CTL clones that did not efficiently lyse melanoma targets may be          incapable of recognizing the relatively low surface densities of native peptide present          on tumor cells CTL clones selected for analysis of tumor lysis were also assessed for RE          for the native and heteroclitic peptides via a tenlog range of dilutions This is          illustrated with clones  and  Figure A There were considerable          differences in killing of peptidepulsed T cells by these two clones The differences in          RE for Gn native peptide displayed by the two clones highlighted in Figure A          correlated with their ability to lyse melanoma cells the highRE clone  efficiently          lysed melanoma targets whereas the lowRE clone  did not Figure B In contrast          to the differences in RE for Gn peptide similar assays revealed little difference in          RE of the two clones for GM heteroclitic peptide Figure C suggesting that these          clones recognize the native and heteroclitic peptides differently and that RE for the          native but not heteroclitic peptide correlates with tumorlytic potential          Similar RE assays were performed for the remaining clones from each patient selected          for analysis In order to compare REs of various CTL lines each clone was assigned an RE          score expressed as the negative log           value of the peptide concentration required for  specific lysis          at an ET ratio of  For clones  and  these scores were  and  for          assays with Gn peptide Figure A and  and  for assays with GM          heteroclitic peptide Figure C respectively We compiled the data on clones from all          patients which showed a correlation between tumorlytic potential and RE for native          peptide Figure A and B Overall clones generated from endogenous antitumor          responses had higher RE for the native peptide than clones generated from postvaccine          responses Figure C and D We estimated the composite RE of the overall TAAspecific          response composed of a heterogeneous population of T cells in vivo by summing the RE of          each clone multiplied by its representation in the original mixture the representation          was estimated based on the proportion of TAAspecific cells expressing the same VB as the          clone These composite RE values are represented in Figure  as horizontal bars for each          response Clearly the endogenous responses patients  and  had a higher overall          and more homogeneous RE for the native peptide than the vaccineelicited responses          patients    and  Figure C and D Importantly the vaccineelicited          clones also exhibited wide variations in RE even for the heteroclitic peptide compared          to the endogenous responses Figure E and F This suggests that the variation in RE          for native peptides and hence ability to lyse tumor cells for vaccineelicited          responses is not merely a reflection of differential recognition of native and          heteroclitic peptides by many clones Rather variations in RE may be a function of the          manner in which these cells were elicited in vivo via vaccination                            Discussion        To achieve maximal clinical responses the majority of T cells elicited by vaccination        in cancer patients should be capable of responding to tumor targets We have undertaken the        most detailed analysis to date on a singlecell level of T cell responses elicited by        cancer vaccination and have compared these with endogenous antitumor responses To        evaluate the full spectrum of T cells elicited in each patient by vaccination we utilized        tetramers made with the vaccine peptides heteroclitic M and GM to isolate such        cells CTL clones were selected directly from patient PBMC samples without enrichment in        culture to closely reflect the composition of the antigenspecific T cell response in vivo        at the time of isolation        Our data revealed that T cell populations induced by vaccination were significantly        different from endogenous responses while some CTLs elicited by vaccination could kill        melanoma targets most were inefficient in tumor cell lysis In contrast nearly all clones        from endogenous responses were efficient at melanoma cell lysis This difference was        related to RE for the native peptide Clones that did not lyse tumor cells required up to                 fold higher concentration of peptide for similar levels of lysis of        targets compared to T cell clones that were tumorlytic Sidebyside comparison of        endogenous responses and vaccineinduced responses suggests that low RE TAAspecific T cell        responses may be preferentially driven by heteroclitic peptide vaccination Thus high        doses of peptide andor the higher levels of expression of heteroclitic peptide on APCs may        induce and actively propagate predominantly T cells with RE too low for recognition of        physiological levels of the native peptide present on tumor targets These data suggest an        inverse relationship between antigen density and the RE of T cells elicited This would be        an important consideration in design of future vaccine strategies        Differential recognition of native and heteroclitic peptides by many T cells may also        account for the induction of nontumorlytic clones by heteroclitic peptide vaccines which        has been suggested previously  However our data suggest that epitope density may        be the dominant driving factor for RE in vivo In all of the vaccineelicited T cell        responses many of the T cells generated were either of low or intermediate RE not only for        the native peptide but also for the heteroclitic peptide and exhibited no or intermediate        lysis of tumor targets In contrast nearly all of the clones generated from the endogenous        responses were of high RE This suggests that the high dosage of peptides administered in        vaccinations and the increased binding capacity of heteroclitic peptides to MHC        moleculesthe very quality that provides them with increased immunogenicitydrive the        induction of many T cells with low RE for both heteroclitic and native peptides        Another implication of this study is that the number of cells measured by current        methods including ELISPOT or staining with MHC tetramers may not correlate directly with        the RE or tumor reactivity of T cell responses to vaccination For example of the nine        clones analyzed from patient  none were efficient in tumor cell lysis yet these cells        were detectable by MHC tetramer staining T cells with low RE for native TAA do not        efficiently lyse tumor and therefore are unlikely to have an impact on clinical outcome        Furthermore it may be possible that lowRE TAAspecific T cells may interfere with        elicitation of highRE T cells either by direct competition for antigen on APC surface         or downmodulation of peptideMHC complexes        Our data support the notion that not only quantity but quality of the T cell response        elicited by vaccination may be important for clinical efficacy There are a number of        strategies to increase the magnitude of T cell responses to peptide vaccines These include        using various adjuvants such as incomplete Freunds adjuvant and immunomodulatory agents        such as IL  GMCSF  antiCTLA Abs  or heat shock proteins  Thus far        none of these approaches have produced improved clinical outcomes Our data suggest that in        addition to driving higher numbers of vaccineelicited T cells strategies to modulate the        relative RE of T cell responses are also needed While the selective activation of high        versus lowRE T cells is relatively easy to manipulate in vitro via stimulation with        limiting amounts of peptides this may be more difficult to control in vivo It is        important to bear in mind that signals needed to drive a de novo nave T cell response may        be different from those required to drive further expansion of an activated T cell        population  Thus a complete vaccination strategy may involve an initial induction        phase followed by progressive shaping of the response to higher RE Although heteroclitic        peptide vaccination may drive T cells of mixed high and low RE such a strong stimulus may        be needed to induce an initial de novo T cell response Studies in mice suggest that once        activated effector CD T cells may have an increase in RE of up to fold compared to        nave cells  Thus nave TAAspecific T cells with inadequate RE to become        activated by low densities of native peptides present on tumor cells may become efficient        in tumor lysis upon vaccination with heteroclitic peptide This notion has support from        studies in tolerized mice vaccination with a heteroclitic peptide analog recruited T        cells which were responsive to secondary stimulation with native peptide         Therefore optimized use of heteroclitic peptide to induce an initial peptidespecific T        cell response followed by selective expansion of the highest RE tumorlytic T cells may be        needed for an effective strategy with clear clinical application        In summary we have demonstrated that vaccination with heteroclitic peptide at high        concentrations may drive T cell responses of variable tumorcytolytic potential in cancer        patientsand that the ability to lyse tumor cells correlates with the T cells RE for        native peptides This represents an importantbut not solefactor in explaining the lack of        correlation between immunological and clinical responses after vaccination for cancer        Importantly the situation is different in endogenous responses in which cells are        predominantly of high RE This suggests that the manner in which T cells are elicited in        vivo are different in these two settings and may underlie their differences in biology
