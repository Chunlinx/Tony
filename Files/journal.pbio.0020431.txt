                            How did life emerge from a soup of chemicals How do patterns such as schools of fish        form from individuals How do voting patterns emerge Such a diverse array of problems        seems completely unrelated However they all involve emergence of complexity When        individuals come together they form patterns structures and organizations that cannot be        discerned from the individuals alone The study of the emergence of complexity is one of        the most active and important areas of research It is important not only for understanding        nature but also for technological applications including the fabrication of largescale        integrated nanocircuits using a bottomup approach and the preparation of multifunctional        smart nanomaterials        DNA evolved to be the primary carrier of genetic information because of its        extraordinary chemical properties These same properties also make DNA an excellent system        for the study of selfassembly and selforganization Two complementary molecules of        singlestranded DNA have paired bases that bond with each other and form the wellknown        double helix structure Two molecules of doublestranded DNA duplexes can further        associate together if they have complementary singlestranded overhangs sticky ends        Intermolecular interactions can be precisely predicted by WatsonCrick basepairing adenine        to thymidine and guanine to cytosine And these interactions are structurally understood        at the atomic level Given the diversity of the DNA sequences we can easily engineer a        large number of pairs of DNA duplexes that associate with each other with sequence        specificity and in a welldefined fashion This property is not common among other        molecular systems Small organic and inorganic molecular pairs can interact with each other        with specificity and in welldefined structures but the number of such pairs is limited        and their chemistry varies greatly Protein molecules such as antibodyantigen pairs have        great diversity and high specificity However it is extremely difficult if not        impossible to predict how proteins interact with each other In contrast DNA as a        molecular system fulfills all the aforementioned criteria        In nature DNA occurs predominantly as a linear molecule and if its conformations were        limited to linearity it would not be very useful for studying selfassembly Fortunately        branched DNA structures can be engineered Holliday junctions for example are        intermediates that occur during genetic recombination To model Holliday junctions a        stable fourarm junction has been constructed in which by design no two strands are fully        complementary to each other Kallenback et al  Seeman  Figure A For example        the  half of strand  is complementary to the  half of strand  but the  half of        strand  is complementary to the  half of strand  instead of that of strand  Combining        branched structures and the excellent molecular recognition of DNA we are ready to        engineer complicated DNA nanostructures and use them for studying selfassembly        Extensive studies have shown that the fourarm junction adopts an Xshape structure        Figure B under physiological conditions and the angle between its two helical domains        can vary widely Lilley  It is impossible to construct welldefined large structures        from flexible components To overcome this problem several wellbehaved DNA motifs have        been engineered Double crossover DX Fu and Seeman  and triple crossover TX        LaBean et al  molecules are two early examples Figure C and D In such        molecules two or three DNA duplexes lie side by side Two neighboring duplexes are joined        by two crossovers which prevent any duplex from twisting against its neighbor duplex        Thus the interhelical angles become fixed at  Other motifs quickly followed including        the paranemic crossover motif Shen et al  rhombusparallelogram motif Mao et al         cross motif Yan et al  and several triangle motifs Chelyapov et al         Ding et al  Liu et al  They all are stable rigid and readily designed for        selfassembly        One simple example of selfassembly is the formation of twodimensional D periodic        arrays or D crystals This is also one of the greatest successes in the field of DNA        selfassembly Figure  The first D DNA crystals were assembled from DX motifs Winfree        et al  In a D crystal each DX molecule contains four sticky ends AA and BB        distributed on its two component duplexes The complementarity of the sticky ends is        designed in such a way that a DX molecule will interact with another four DX molecules        through its four sticky ends Any two DX molecules can interact with each other though only        one pair of sticky ends Any pair of sticky end interactions will position the two DX        molecules in a conformation such that no other sticky ends from these two molecules are in        sufficient proximity to interact As a result of this design regularly ordered D arrays        have formed Figure  Following similar strategies others have designed DNA motifs to        assemble into D arrays whose symmetries include tetragonal Yan et al         pseudohexagonal Mao et al  Liu et al  and hexagonal Chelyapov el al         Ding et al         Inspired by early theoretical suggestions Winfree  experimental exploration of        aperiodic selfassembly immediately followed One study applied algorithmic selfassembly        to TX molecules Figure  Mao et al  The assembling rule exclusive OR XOR is        encoded in the TX molecules Consider the value of all inputs and outputs as either  or         For XOR operations if two inputs are the same the output will be  otherwise the output        will be  If molecules X and Y are the input and output respectively Y        i molecule takes the input from the X        i and Y        i molecules In other words the values of the X        i and Y        i molecules determine what Y molecule will be incorporated There are        four different types of Y molecules whose inputs are       and          These four and only four Y molecules are enough to satisfy any input combination Two C        molecules connect the input and output molecules which is necessary for the        characterization but not essential for the selfassembly process Sticky ends between the X        molecules and the C molecules are longer than those between Y molecules and between Y and X        or C molecules Thus the C and X molecules assemble first to form the inputs because the        association between longer sticky ends is more stable than those between the shorter ones        Then the output Y molecules assemble to the assembled C and X molecules In that study Mao        et al  two different input combinations were used and one of them is shown in        Figure  The resulting DNA structures are periodic with respect to the backbones but they        are aperiodic in their sequences Though the resulting fourbyte onedimensional D        structures are quite simple this study demonstrated that aperiodic structures are        achievable through selfassembly        Winfree and coworkers in this issue of         PLoS Biology have extended the algorithmic selfassembly strategy from D        to D Rothemund et al  This achievement is certainly a milestone in the field of        selfassembly It overcomes a great challenge as the structural complexity dramatically        increases from D to D structures These researchers have applied the same XOR algorithms        to DX molecules in their study and achieved fractal structures Sierpinski triangles        Figure  External inputs are in the bottom row Each row takes inputs from the row        immediately below and sends the operation outputs to the row immediately above Each        position takes two inputs identical or nonidentical from lower left and lower right        positions and sends identical output to both upper left and upper right positions The        arrows indicate the direction of information flow or assembly sequences In their        experiment the rules are encoded in DX molecules This study is conceptually        straightforward but the experimental challenges are tremendous One key challenge is        assembly fidelity The right molecules have to compete with partially matched molecules        The concentrations of the competing molecules further complicate the fidelity issue as        some molecules could be rapidly depleted from the solution In that sense the current work        is quite stunning even though the assembly is far from perfect        In principle a wide range of D patterns could be generated with the same set of        molecules and the same strategy changing only the first row of the assembly which        specifies the external inputs Realization of this goal will critically rely on the        elimination of assembly errors or the introduction of error corrections Winfree and        Bekbolatov         The current work represents a neat approach to understanding the emergence of        complexity It integrates both simulation and wet chemistry It also provides a plausible        approach to nanofabrications Over the last decade a variety of methods have been        developed which use biomacromolecules as templates to fabricate nanostructures Braun el        al  Douglas and Young  Mucic et al  Fu et al  Limited by the        complexity of the available biomacromolecular templates simple nanostructures are the        usual result mostly nanowires nanoparticles and simple aggregates of nanoparticles The        current work illustrates the possibility of generating more complicated structures and        promises unprecedented structural complexity for nanomaterials
