                so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you do you like to do it   yeah well i um about a or just over a year ago i bought my my own house so this has been the first opportunity ive had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden i id hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i dont mind doing it so much anymore   yeah yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn   well its yeah its its primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know ive got some uh bushes around the foundation you know the foundation planting things like that and then theres some uh uh just some little flowerbeds and my mom grows shes an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and uh she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them uh she ends up with so many plants that she cant fit them all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras   well thats pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too shes got   yeah   some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them this is my first year in a in a house where i thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff oh we ive always had crude ones at my fathers but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road   yeah uhhuh   my house is on a main road and it has nothing  i mean nothing  but uh what i do do is now ive always done it at my fathers house   yeah   we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total um this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre so we each have a third of an acre we do   uhhuh geez thats a thats more than   thats a lot     thats more than than the property i have right here that youve got as a uh a garden thats amazing   yeah well its my dads and weve had it for over hes been there for a long time so   right   um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it  but um they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy   oh geez   and we grow a lot of food   uhhuh   uh i enjoy it um the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them now that the   uhhuh   and weve tilled them so much but theyre still       we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i dont know if thats a good thing or a bad thing boy i wish this phone would stop screeching   are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line   yes        im trying i dont know if its my phone this is bad its not getting any better   yeah i cant even hear what youre   oh okay   geez its gone   i dont see i dont think my phone really does that but every time i have this phone is a little weird i mean its been dropped on the floor a hundred times   well i i dont know there was well whatever it was there was a second there i couldnt even hear what you were saying but um   yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so   yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work but um   yeah   yeah i mean thats a uh heck of a plot you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it especially up in Vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil   yeah we we grow a lot of um the basic corn corn potatoes   uhhuh   she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow basic corn potatoes and uh acorn squash are good winter keepers   yeah   i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own plants she plants a lot of tomatoes   umhum uhhuh   i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i i do a lot of the uh a lot of the the back the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out   uhhuh   beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes dont do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i dont know something   oh really is because of like the cross pollination or   no its just like something like an onion and a tomato would go together but youre not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess its it its just what scents it gives off they just dont like each other   huh   i mean  she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but   what huh my mom uh put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once and they got cross pollinated by the bees   they yeah   and we ended up with these these like things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers   oh thats really weird   and and yeah i mean there these were like some mutant   i will put ive put my uh cucumbers are down at one end of the garden and like like ill make an L shape ive put cantaloupe so theyve been pretty close together   huh   but i dont think the vines they dont really they dont have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees   no its just the like the bees and insects will do it   oh   um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something   i know some something weird   yeah   this year we didnt this last season it was it was too wet up here   uhhuh   we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield it was really bad because of the water   oh well yeah when i uh my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet backyard and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh i think it was seven what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards i think thats how they measure dirt but   yeah yeah   yeah seven yards of sand i got to shovel it all   yeah i i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and im going to have a seven yard truck come in   lots of fun   with some topsoil   uhhuh   and im going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i dont know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something   sure   to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there  i i mean i guess itd go for my flowers but   right well it seems ive seen a lot of people use them you know for flowerbeds but i dont know what whether theyd have creosote would do anything i mean   yeah i dont i dont i just dont think you i always thought id put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i dont think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering   umhum   and i dont know if they make landscape ties that arent treated   well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber   yeah but they put some kind of   oh thats right theres even theres bad chemicals in those too   chemicals in there too yeah well im not really worried about it its mainly for flower bed so im not going to not going im just not going to put that tomato plant in there   alright   but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed ive never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground   right   they dont it just looks so much better when its up against the house tiered up   well not that you can see it a little better and it stands out   yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you theres nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush       there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and said yep thats one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesnt rub up against the siding and im looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush   oh geez yeah   and hes cutting it down  so thats all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesnt rub up against the siding   rub up against the siding uh   yep thats what hes worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast some people uh would really like to have them and then the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over their their lawn   umhum   so theyre kind of a pain but you know people who dont have them think theyre great and people who do have them   right   curse curse   right   another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact theres three of them very badly trimmed they arent trimmed at all   uhhuh   and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said wed do if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it so   yeah because it like i i think ive seen those before but i dont remember what they look like   theyre a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them theyre covered with thorns so were going to get a chain saw and were going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead   so itll give you room to get under it sure   yeah  because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin its worse than a rose a rose bush   yeah hm   many times worse because of course its a tree   oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have   yep my uh dad used to work on them so i dont think ill have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing one       even   then you got to get him to if hes going to do it youve got to twist his arm to get him to go do it   well if thats not the problem it
