                                 The Unbearable Being of Whiteness            What would it be like to bewhite            Its a question Ive neverreally considered but pondering it now I find the answer unsettling Itwouldnt be all that different Yes of course it would mean unstitching frommy soul that thread of thoughts and habits one might call Chineseand whoknows just how unraveled Id become without that thread But as far as how theworld would treat meignoring me or not abusing me or not redeeming me ornotI cant say I would be much better off for being white            For although I amChineseAmerican and thus a person of color I am also this child of thesuburbs product of mostly white schools junior officer of the overclassskeptic of hardcore multiculturalism friendly with many minorities butfriends with few never once the victim of blatant discrimination husband nowof a woman named Haymon I am by the reasoning of racial ascription alreadyquite white            What thatsays about me Ill leave for those who know me to assess What it says aboutour idea of whiteness though is for all of us to contemplate In thecosmology of race whiteness is something like a black holea crushingly densecomplex of myth and rumor that pulls us invisibly and irresistibly into itshold We move according to its properties yet we know not why we move            Consider for instance the nowstandard formulation thatif blacks would only surrender their raceconsciousness we could all ascendto a colorblind nirvana  You hear this line from plenty of wellmeaningwhites But you also find it embedded in nasty rightwing polemics againstdiversity and affirmative action The idea is simple Given the end ofracism or at least the end of irrational discrimination minoritybellyaching only upsets what would otherwise be the proper socialequilibrium            Im thefirst to concede the awful balkanizing folly of many leftliberals on raceAnd to be sure weve stockpiled so much difference over the years that around of identity disarmament would be welcome But we should first acknowledgethat it is white raceconsciousnessnever quite named as such in ourpopular discoursethat begets the compensatory identities of nonwhiteAmericans And it is whiteness that must first be revealed andsurrendered before we can ever hope to transcend race            White raceconsciousness manifests itself intwo forms as blessing and as burden In both cases it exists mainly bynegation it nourishes itself upon all that it excludes Thus it is that whitesdont generally think of themselves as having a race at all To be whitereally is not to be many thingsmost notably blackand to deriveboth security and standing from the absence of the stigma            It isprecisely this sense of antiracethis affectation of colorlessneutralitythat has allowed whiteness to insinuate itself as the social normThis is whitenessasblessing the knowledge whites have that in law inliterature in politics and in a hundred other realms a regular person isby default a white person Our vocabulary for assimilation makes the pointHow do we describe the method by which nonwhites enter the mainstream and climbthe class ladder We say or at least think that theyre becoming white            It used to be of course that becoming white was anoption open only to European immigrants But over the last generationhighachieving AsianAmericans have been anointed honorary whites usually soordained by conservatives wary of black militancy By striving and succeedingwithout complaint Asian immigrants have become in the words of IrvingKristol just another European ethnic group            Ah I seeSome are born white others achieve whiteness still others have whitenessthrust upon them This is sheer narcissism the notion that making it meanswhitening And when it comes from the white right its narcissism in theservice of hypocrisy For some of the very guardians of Americas alabastertemplatePat Buchanan Peter Brimelow and their ilkare the same ideologueswho reflexively rebuke blacks for any show of ethnocentrism            The second variety of whiteraceconsciousnesswhitenessasburdenis no less tangled up in hypocrisyBut while whitenessasblessing expresses the arrogance of privilegewhitenessasburden reveals the willful ignorance of privilege Nowhere is thatmore clear than in the periodic appearance of what I call the LeftBehindWhite            In thes the LeftBehind White appeared in the form of the unmeltable ethnicthat longassimilated Italian or Irish or PolishAmerican who in the wake ofthe Black Power movement felt it necessary to dust off and revive the ways ofthe Old Country He rematerialized in the late s this time in the guise ofthe Angry White Male the forgotten victim of minority preferences and reversediscrimination A decade later he has entered the scene again dressed now inthe finery of the EuroAmerican a pitiable white who cant find his heritagebut doesnt want to get left behind in the parade of affirming identities            The spectacle of the LeftBehind White tells us again thatmany whites who complain about black obsessions with blackness are themselvesobsessed with whiteness What they are obsessed with in this case though isthe cultural emptiness of whiteness In a cruel reversal it is the white guywith no tradition to call his own no history but one laden with guilt andapology who is truly disadvantaged            Justdeserts you might say for those minority multiculturalists who pretended thatequality of cultural recognition was as good as equality of actual power Nowwhites want to play the same game recounting to us the sufferings of theCelts the indignities borne by the Welsh yet still retaining the powerpremium theyve long enjoyedas whites            But alas weve hit a sure conversationstoppernow the question of white power No one really wants to talk about thatPerhaps its because white power sounds too much like an accusation Perhapsits because white power brings to mind those neoNazi supremacists thosehateful extremists who most white folks will say arent like usand whotruly arent like most white folks But whatever the reason we have analmost allergic reaction to any serious consideration of the ideology ofprivilege we call whiteness            How elseto explain the reaction to whiteness studies an academic discipline that hasemerged in the last few years Sure whiteness studies which might includeeverything from the history of Irish laborers to the folkways of suburbanmallrats is open to abuse and therefore to ridicule It appears at a glancelike ethnic studies gone fatuously awryand some of it is indeed loopy            But whiteness studies has also been mightily anddeliberately misunderstood It is not the selfadulation of an alreadydominant class or a crusade by the oppressed to demonize The Man It is simplyan attempt to identify the ways that whites remain blind to and blinded by anunspoken faith in raceand to expose the means by which white skin and whiteattitudes still confer social advantage            It seems to me that we couldall use some of that schooling For it is whitenessnot blacknessthat is theoriginal sin of identity politics And it falls on all our shouldersnot justcolored onesto rid the country of its viral colorconsciousness What wouldit be like to be white One day perhaps there will be a better way to measurethe blessings and burdens of American life
