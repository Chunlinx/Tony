                okay what do you think about the school systems   uh well where i live in Plano one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their school system   uhhuh right   and uh in fact i think that theres some areas of of Dallas and Richardson that are in the those city town city limits but they uh all of the the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district and they use that as one of the things that they uh you know that they try to market when they sell homes in that area the fact that it is in Plano schools uh i do have children in that school system uh and have been personally pleased with that uh im not sure that its that that theres that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas   okay   uh   what do you see as being a problem with the school system   uh probably the biggest controversy within our school system is the use of the open classroom concept uh where uh all uh all the students at a given grade level are in one large area for much of the day uh segregated you know by teacher but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms   uhhuh   uh ive now had two children that are have been in the system in the system uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere the other im not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think hes a little bit more easily distracted than was she   oh   and that seems to be the primary complaint uh i think my biggest complaint problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom to eat uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day   uhhuh   uh and uh thats  i guess im a fairly satisfied uh parent as far as the school system goes myself uh that that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers   uhhuh   uh and their interest uh in the students individually is going to make the difference versus you know physical things such as the open classroom versus a more closed classroom uh what do you see as problems   yeah well i dont have children in school and its been so long since i was in school myself im not really sure how to answer that   yeah   when uh  i dont know it seems that theyre you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing   right   uh the curriculums differ so much and im not saying that thats bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is   uhhuh   you know you cant really tell from a group of students if its a if if its the the teacher thats got the problem or if its the book thats got the problem you know what the materials that theyre using and everything   right   that could be causing a problem   now in in Dallas i know at least at some of the later grade levels they have these magnet schools that i think were initially set up to address the segregation issues   uhhuh   uh and i wondered uh what the real overall effect on education is of those uh i know i have a niece in the Dallas system that is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but shes interested in the arts and in in particular in dance   what kind of school is that   uh they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain interest   oh okay   and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and something  magnet school uh next year when she enters high school   yeah i think thats kind of a good idea because you know it doesnt it doesnt it doesnt divide people by by anything besides what theyre interests are   yeah   and its a much higher its a learning environment if youre group if youre interested in sciences and youre grouped with other people that are interested in sciences   uhhuh   it seems like it would it would uh it would help   now i would think that would would be a good point as well   yeah   they they dont have that type of thing in Plano they just have these two gargantuan  high schools   uhhuh   uh but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years uh for for students   okay what do you think about about sports in high school and about uh the competitiveness ive ive know ive seen in Plano that theres a lot of really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high schools   well   and do you think thats healthy   oh not really uh ive not been that aware of it   uhhuh   uh i live on it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle   yeah uhhuh   uh and i am on the west side but just barely on the west side i guess my kids are younger than that and in theyre in the non competitive uh just athletics uh organizations you know your typical soccer and baseball and all that sort of stuff   oh yeah uhhuh   and because of where we live uh the teams that my son has been on has have been from both sides of the fence if you will   oh okay   theyve drawn from both sides and i really havent sensed any of that yet i it may become more obvious to me in later on   uhhuh   i think the one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have high schools and senior high schools which a lot of people dont realize that that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools of which there there are quite a few in Plano and the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade   uhhuh now i didnt even realize that at all   yeah thats was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth   um right   and then theyll have uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building   huh   but uh   well i know theyve got a lot of elementary schools   for the most part yeah bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools for sixth seventh and eighth and then there a number at least i could probably think of six high schools   well now what is Shepton going to be   Shepton is a high school   okay   ninth and tenth   okay   and uh theres Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams and theres Clark and i dont know whether theres more than four i want to say that there are more than just four but uh its just ninth and tenth grade and then the the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders   um   which is a sort of a different concept   yeah that does seem kind of different   and theyre theyre just so big im a little bothered by that uh just the sheer
