                                 The Very Picture of Bliss            We all know something ofwhat went on during the reign  of Joseph Stalin show trialspurges mass executions death camps We may also know something about howhistory was rewritten wholesale in the Soviet Union during those yearshow thefacts concerning the October Revolution were successively recast as key figuresfell from favor how the existence of Leon Trotsky was first reviled and thendenied after he was forced into exile in  how even such things as theinvention of electric light were reattributed to Russians in the textbooks anastonishing number of scientific breakthroughs were allegedly the work of onePopov These matters run the gamut from the monstrous to the comical Thescale of crimes against humanity against truth against common sense engagedin by Stalin and his minions is so extraordinary that merely reading about themcan provoke numbness The figures blur The USSR seems an alternateuniverse            David Kingsnew book however demonstrates all these things with clarity concision andforce through the use of period pictures The four images on its cover forexample dryly sum up the tenor of Stalins regime In the first photographStalin is shown in Leningrad in  posed at a worktable with three cadresone of them had just been made first secretary of the local party The secondis a version printed in a  History of the USSR  looking less like aphotograph than like an awkward charcoal tracing the comrade on the left hasbeen excised having in fact been imprisoned prior to being shot The thirdversion which appeared in a  biography of Stalin is more the work of anairbrush than a camera the figure on the far right is now gone as wellalthough it is unclear why since he remained in favor until Stalins deathThe fourth picture an oil painting from  is actually out of sequencechronologically but its point is clear Stalin appears in the same pose atthe same table but alone The focus of that image turns out to have been thefocus of the other images as well the meaty knuckle of Stalins left middlefinger weighing on the table with a force of tons The sequence iscartoonlikeby the fourth image we imagine that the three absent apparatchiksreside in Stalins belly            We know thatnowadays photographs can be digitally manipulated with ease in the era inquestion they were manipulated crudely and grotesquely using scissors inkand airbrushes King shows us sequence after sequence of group photographstheoriginal happy gathering of Old Bolsheviks say and then one or morevariations printed in later years from which figures have been excised afterthey fell from grace The altered pictures rarely look convincing When I wasyounger I would occasionally come across books issued by Progress PublishersMoscow and I never failed to be puzzled by the poor quality of thephotographic illustrationseven works published in the s featured pastysmudgy usually bluetinted approximations of photos the translated works forthat matter were printed in a roman typeface that looked as if it had beenpurchased before  from a Western dimenovel concern The motive for thistechnical inferiority was probably budgetary but there is no denying that itmade falsification so much easier since even the unaltered pictures look likefakes A yawning gap in the lineup of military officers a face that failed tomatch the body attached to it a face whose shading did not match that of thefaces on either side an elbow marooned in space bereft of other bodypartssuch things could just pass for evidence of ineptitude            Kings bookis rich in horrors The photographs in which faces have been blotted out withink smears or hysterically attacked with a pen are more immediately alarmingthan the ones from which figures have been surgically removed and there aresobering unretouched group shots of NKVD bureaucrats and the prosecution staffof the Supreme Soviet mass murderers who invariably look like factory hands ormath teachers But the overwhelming impression the book leaves is less ofdevastation per se than of contemptthe contempt the Little Father of thePeople felt for ordinary workers the generalized contempt for humanintelligence that pervaded his regime            Nowhere is this contempt moreevident than in the images that purport to represent friendship fellowshipjoy triumph and even grief all of them exclusively formal modes Stalinsface juxtaposed with Lenins bier in a  photomontage can be imagined asmourning only by an effort of will he is sidelit vampiric sinisterbut thenStalin rarely fails to look sinister in photographs and this is not merely amatter of the viewers preconceptions In paintings and drawings Stalin isoften represented in utterly fictitious settings addressing workers on thefactory floor say or surrounded by gleeful ethnic types from the Sovietrepublics His eyes are narrowed his mustache conceals his mouth but isbracketed by laugh lineshe is made to denote some kind of perfunctoryemotion actual emotion being consigned to his grinning subjects And he isoften shown entwined in fishingbuddy affection with the departed Lenin whosewill actually called for Stalins removal as general secretary though it wassuppressed In almost every representation Stalin appears either more or lessthan human a mobile icon wheeled about as real as a stuffed trout            Posed groups of commissarsmeanwhile display collective warmth in the way that departmentstoremannequins do when they are grouped on the same pedestal Of course thepicture in your local newspaper of the funddrive chairman handing an oversizedcheck to the mayor features smiles that are scarcely more genuine Kings bookis of enormous historical value but it should not encourage smugness We arecurrently capable of perpetrating every kind of visual lie on display here andseamlessly and invisibly at that for reasons some may well think arejustified Everyone has a little Stalin lurking somewhere within
