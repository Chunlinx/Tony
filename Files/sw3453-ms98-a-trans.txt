                 okay  did they tell you our topic   uh no somebody else answered the phone and put my number in uh what is the topic   okay its uh the topic is cars what kind of car will you buy next and what kind of decision you know do you   okay   think about getting the you know to pick that car out and uh and why   okay uh my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac ive had uh   okay   well im on my third one and im not real sure that id be in the market for a car for quite a while   yeah im the same way i was uh i had two Cadillacs i went to my first Lincoln this last time i travel and uh my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company so he always said why dont you drive a Ford or dont you try a Lincoln so i finally tried one   umhum my   after fifty years and uh ive had i guess i guess four Cadillacs and and one Suburban in my last five cars but i bought a Lincoln and i like it   my my dad has been a uh uh Lincoln man for a lot of years but ive always been a GM man im in the auto parts business myself   oh are you   and uh the last Cadillac i bought was an Allante   uhhuh   and i just love it to death im not sure id ever get rid of it   well im a im a traveling salesman i travel on the road so i like a little heavier car so thats   i used to do that quite a bit myself   so thats why i choose you know to drive a heavier car and more luxury car but i tell you what i will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly yeah because i like the Lincoln but   yeah really   theres just something about that Cadillac that whether its a GMC product or whatever seems they handle better and   they seem to put they seem to be put together a little bit better   i think so too   and you know the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products and i think thats one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports is they put so much you know gadgetry on the dash and and the the buttons are so small to push and GM doesnt seem to do that i kind of like that feature   yeah they really do   so   you know im a im a funny duck that came that comes to the simple things like front end alignments i have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac   umhum   i dont know why why whether i just seem to drive them better or what but ive never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac they always appear to hold well   umhum ive uh i had an Eldorado was my first one was an eighty and uh   uhhuh   i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up and i had them do all four wheels   did you and the only thing i miss about a Cadillac is a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car and i traded it in traded it in on my Lincoln and theyre just not as large as before i do miss that   thats true yeah but what is big today   well youre right   you know Lincoln still as big as it always has been but   yeah its big but the trunk space for me uh what i usually do is i usually take the backseat out of my car and thats where i put my samples because trunks just arent big enough   you know a car i ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental   yeah now i have the Towncar and its its a deep trunk but not as broad as the uh the Cadillac   well the Towncar i noticed uh or with the with the Continental uh i was rented one one time   uh uhhuh   uh we could uh put golf clubs in them   oh good and it went all it went all the way down   you know straight across i mean front to back not going from side to side   well thats good thats good   and we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage   yeah i sell sporting goods uh hunting related items i sell guns gun cases and things like that and i need to you know its about the same size as a golf club they need to samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that and   i see yeah umhum i dont know if youve ever looked at a Continental uh   nope   its not as peppy as a as a Towncar because its a V   right   but it uh i took i drove it from here to Memphis and i really enjoyed driving that car if i was going to buy a Ford product thats what i would buy   yeah i drove mine a couple weeks ago to our one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville i usually fly i drove it with another one of my guys that worked for me we drove its you know ten hours to Nashville and it it handled real well but my main thing is space so if a Continental i might consider it the next time a Continental has more trunk space you bet   you might take a look at them they they had a a lot more space trunk space as a matter of fact they had more trunk space than my uh Sedan de Ville had   you always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs   um all three of mine have had leather interiors yeah   yeah i like leather interiors also   uh i had a eighty Eldorado which was leather leather and uh then my eighty six was a touring sedan   uhhuh   and uh it had the gray leather package in it and my Allante has um i guess saddle saddle colored   thats a nice car   type thing   you bet and ill and i will say one thing about Cadillac versus
