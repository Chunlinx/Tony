                    Background        Aneuploidy is a common feature of cancer Genetic        alterations such as amplification deletion translocation        and rearrangement could result in either gainoffunction        or lossoffunction mutations in genes that modulate        aspects of cell proliferation differentiation motility        and survival Whereas cytogenetic profiling techniques        such as comparative genomic hybridization CGH   have        been useful in finding genetic abnormalities other        experimental approaches are frequently used to identify        which specific genes drive selection for the genetic        aberration and contribute most to tumor progression Common        gene identification techniques include determining if a        candidate gene contains a sequence mutation andor        determining if the candidate gene or gene product is        abnormally expressed As mutation analysis and protein        expression studies are timeconsuming increasingly        highthroughput geneexpression profiling is being used to        identify abnormally expressed genes within a region of        cytogenetic change              Recently several groups have observed that chromosomal        changes can lead to regional biases in geneexpression        values both in yeast          Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and in        human tumors and tumorderived cell lines             These studies suggest that a fraction of geneexpression        values  are regulated in concordance with gene        dosage A computational technique termed comparative        genomic microarray analysis CGMA has previously been used        to identify regions of allelic imbalance indirectly from        geneexpression profiles of human tumors   CGMA        predicts chromosomal amplifications and deletions by        organizing geneexpression data by genomic mapping location        and scanning for regions that contain a statistically        significant number of geneexpression values that change in        the same relative direction In this study we apply CGMA        analysis to a large hepatocellular carcinoma microarray        dataset to demonstrate its validity as an alternative to        CGH and to identify candidate genes in regions of frequent        cytogenetic change        Primary liver cancer in adults is the sixth most common        form of cancer and the fourth leading cause of death from        cancer worldwide    Through the examination of        hepatitis B virus HBV  and hepatitis C virus        HCVinduced tumors two landmark CGH studies have        suggested that a subset of cytogenetic changes frequently        occurs in HCC    These include frequent gain of        chromosomes q p q q and q and frequent loss of        chromosomes p q q p   and p    In        particular gain of chromosomes q and q has been        associated with the early development of HCC   whereas        loss of chromosome q has been linked to increased        aggressiveness of established tumors   To determine        whether geneexpression data could be used to identify        cytogenetic changes accurately we applied CGMA to a        microarray dataset of HCC tumors and compared the CGMA        predictions to existing CGH data For HCC CGMA was able to        predict nearly all chromosomal aberrations identified        previously by CGH In addition from the geneexpression        data we also identified a set of genes whose expression        values change most within the regions of cytogenetic        change These genes may represent candidate genes whose        expression changes drive selection for chromosomal gains or        losses                    Results                  CGMA predictions of cytogenetic changes          Normalized logtransformed geneexpression data from           HCC geneexpression arrays   were obtained from          the Stanford Microarray Database   As CGMA analysis          yields more intuitive predictions if the tumor expression          data is compared to a normal tissue reference the          original HCC geneexpression data was mathematically          transformed such that the pooled cellline reference was          replaced by a normal tissue reference   see          Materials and methods Using this transformation          geneexpression values from the tumor sample are compared          to corresponding values from noncancerous tissue          Genomic regions that contain a disproportionate number of          genes that change expression in the same relative          direction that is show a geneexpression bias may          indicate an underlying chromosomal gain or loss Figure          a      Chromosomal regions that contained a          geneexpression bias with at least  confidence a sign          test           z statistic of at least  see          Materials and methods were identified for all  HCC          expression profiles Figure b In addition genomic          regions that contained significant geneexpression biases          in at least  of nonreplicate samples were identified          Figure c A  threshold was chosen because in          previous CGMA profiling experiments this threshold          yielded the highest CGMA to CGH agreement   and data          not shown CGMA predicted frequent gains for chromosome          q gained in  of tumor samples p  q           q  q  q  P  and q           Frequent chromosomal losses were predicted for chromosome          q lost in  of tumor samples p               and p  To determine if CGMA predictions          were consistent with other cytogenetic profiling studies          the CGMA data were compared with data from two of the          largest CGH profiling studies  and  samples          respectively using HCC tumors    Of the           regions detected by CGMA   were also implicated          by CGH Figure c CGMA also detected three gained          regions chromosomes q q and p which were not          implicated in the CGH analysis CGMA failed to discover          two regions of loss detected by CGH  chromosomes p and          q It is noteworthy that these particular losses were          not identified in both CGH studies These data suggest          that CGMA predictions produce results very similar to          traditional CGH profiling studies                          Comparison to previous HCC studies          To date there have been at least  reports on the          application of CGH to HCC                               To          determine whether the differences between the CGMA          predictions and the two large CGH studies were similar to          the experimental variation observed between different HCC          CGH studies predictions produced by CGMA were compared          to  different HCC CGH profiling studies Figure           CGMA produced  of   predictions that matched a          consensus chromosomal aberration profile On average          each CGH study matched the consensus profile in             of the chromosomal regions analyzed Therefore the          variation in CGMA results was similar to the variations          between independent CGH studies These results suggest          that CGMA profiling is able to predict regions of          frequent chromosomal imbalance in HCC as well as CGH          profiling As only  of the   samples analyzed          scored positive for HCV infection we could not use this          dataset to detect significant cytogenetic differences          between HCVinfected verses HBVinfected individuals          data not shown                          CGMA predictions of multifocal tumors          Included in the set of HCC geneexpression profiles          were several cases in which multiple tumor nodules were          removed from the same patient In some cases the nodules          had related geneexpression profiles patients HK          HK HK whereas in other cases tumors from the same          patient had distinctive profiles HK HK HK            In particular in patient HK the geneexpression          profile from nodule HK was distinct from the          expression profiles from nodules HK and HK            Array CGH was used previously to determine the          cytogenetic profiles of the tumor nodules from this          patient   Array CGH identified common cytogenetic          abnormalities in patient HKs tumors including loss of          chromosome q an unusual gain of chromosome q and          loss of the centromeric region of chromosome  However          additional cytogenetic changes were found in tumors          HK and HK that were not present in HK The          cytogenetic profiling data coupled with the observation          that HK and HK were both smaller in size and had          an increased mitotic index suggested that HK was the          primary tumor and HK and HK were divergent HK          subclones To determine whether CGMA predictions agree          with this monoclonal origin hypothesis CGMA profiles of          patient HKs tumor nodules were isolated and organized          by hierarchical clustering Figure  CGMA also detected          the common chromosome q gain and chromosome q loss in          the HK tumors CGMA did not identify a common loss on          chromosome  however CGMA identified other genetic          aberrations q q and q consistently found in          the HK tumors CGMA also identified additional          aberrations q q q present in H and H          that were not found in H Taken together the CGMA          data supports the hypothesis that the H and HK          tumor nodules probably arose from HK but that          additional distinct cytogenetic events had occurred in          these nodules during tumor progression In contrast          tumor nodules from patient HK have very similar          geneexpression profiles and very similar cytogenetic          profiles as predicted by CGMA suggesting that these          tumors have common origins and these nodules have not          diverged significantly from the original lineage In          addition tumor nodules from patient HK showed          distinctive expression profiles and distinct HBV          integration sites   Similarly the tumors from          patient HK also show distinct CGMApredicted          cytogenetic profiles reflecting the independent          transforming mechanism Figure                           Identification of candidate genes in regions of          frequent cytogenetic change          Frequent cytogenetic abnormalities suggest that          tumormodifying genes oncogenes or tumor suppressors          may be driving selection for the amplification or          deletion of these particular genetic regions                 An advantage of using CGMA profiling rather          than traditional molecular genetic profiling is that          access to geneexpression data is inherent in the          analysis CGMA allows cytogenetic analysis and the          candidate gene approach to be performed with the same          dataset For example the           cmyc oncogene has been postulated          to drive selection for frequent chromosome q          amplification Though           cmyc is located on a region that          both CGMA and CGH identify as frequently gained c           myc s expression is increased more          than twofold in less than  of the samples In fact in           of the HCC tissue samples c           myc s expression is downregulated          Table  This implies that increased           cmyc expression is not driving the          selection for the amplification of chromosomal region q          in these samples In the small region of chromosome q          presented in Table  two other genes for squalene          monooxygenase and pro do show increased expression          in a majority of HCC samples Consistent with previous          reports examining geneexpression levels in regions of          cytogenetic change expression levels for a large          percentage of genes in this amplified region remain          unchanged              The set of genes that are consistently misregulated in          regions of frequent cytogenetic change as predicted by          CGMA are shown in Table  Plateletderived growth factor          receptor alpha is consistently downregulated in a region          of frequent cytogenetic loss and this suggests that loss          of a member of this receptor gene family is important in          HCC progression It has previously been reported that a          transcript            PRLTS  with sequence similarity to          the extracellular domain of plateletderived growth          factor receptor may also be a tumor suppressor for HCC            In addition consistently increased expression of          the pituitary tumor transforming gene  oncogene            PTTG  is observed in these samples          Table            PTTG maps to chromosome q a          region that was identified as frequently changed by CGMA          but not identified in the majority of CGH profiling          studies           PTTP overexpression in NIH T          cells induces these cells to form tumors when injected          into nude mice Overexpression of this gene may result          from frequent chromosomal amplification and may          participate in HCC tumor progression                          CGMA prediction software          To assist in identifying regions of unidirectional          geneexpression bias we have constructed a webbased          program that processes twocolor geneexpression data and          identifies genomic regions that contain geneexpression          biases The input for this program is a simple          tabdelimited geneexpression matrix file consisting of          columns for the probe sequence identifier probe name          and geneexpression ratios Because different microarray          technologies use different identifiers to describe the          microarray probe the program translates probe sequence          identifiers ids such as GenBank accession numbers and          UniGene cluster ids to Ensembl transcript ids using          precompiled sequence comparisons After data analysis a          summary table is displayed showing chromosomal regions          that show significant    unidirectional          geneexpression bias highlighted in either red or green          indicating either increased or decreased expression          biases respectively The program can also send several          output files to the user via email These files include          a summary report that contains the           z statistic for each chromosomal          region positive for upregulated regions and negative for          downregulated regions and a list of genes located in          regions of frequent cytogenetic change The program is          available at                              Discussion        In this study we have used geneexpression profiling        data to predict cytogenetic changes that frequently occur        in HCC Two landmark CGH analyses identified  different        regions of frequent imbalance However one study found         regions and the other study found     Five of        these  regions were not found in both experiments CGMA        successfully identified  of  regions previously        distinguished by CGH CGMA also detected three regions that        have not been implicated by these CGH studies On average        however  of genomic regions indentified in a particular        HCC CGH study are not constantly identified in other        studies Therefore the three inconsistent CGMA predictions         of   are comparable to the inconsistencies        between independent CGH studies for HCC        Three additional regions were identified by CGMA that        were not identified by CGH While these CGMApredicted        regions were near the  cutoff for detection they could        represent other regions of allelic imbalance yet to be        detected by CGH It is also possible that biological        mechanisms other than cytogenetic change could influence        expression in large genomic regions and produce regional        geneexpression biases Additional molecular genetic work        will be required to resolve these differences        If CGH data are not available for a particular cancer        type but geneexpression profiling data are then CGMA        could allow rapid prediction of the cytogenetic        abnormalities that frequently occur within that cancer        type Moreover in instances where geneexpression        profiling reveals previously unrecognized cancer subtypes        CGMA could determine whether cytogenetic differences are        responsible for these different subtypes In cancer types        where traditional cytogenetic profiling has already been        carried out CGMA predictions could serve to confirm        existing cytogenetic profiling data and be used further to        examine candidate genes whose expression changes most        within a region of frequent cytogenetic change In this way        CGMA can be combined with the candidate gene approach to        identify genes that are directly involved in tumor        progression                    Conclusions        CGMA can be used to indicate chromosomal imbalances by        detecting chromosomal regions that contain a        disproportionate number of geneexpression values that        change in the same relative direction This analysis        provides good evidence that CGMA is a practical alternative        to CGH cytogenetic profiling when geneexpression profiling        data is available                    Materials and methods                  Normalization and filtering          Normalized logtransformed geneexpression data for           HCC samples and  corresponding noncancerous liver          geneexpression profiles   were obtained from the          Stanford Microarray Database   Genes that were          present in at least  of samples  genes were          used for further analysis In this study both the tumor          samples and normal tissue samples were compared to a          pooled cellline reference   To allow comparison of          tumor geneexpression values to geneexpression values          from surrounding noncancerous tissue new gene          expression ratios tumor verse normal TN were          estimated To create the new ratios logtransformed          noncancerous tissue ratios NU were subtracted from          the logtransformed HCC tissue ratios TU for each gene          such that log            TN  log            TU  log            NU If an HCC sample did not have          a corresponding noncancerous sample the global mean of          the noncancerous tissue geneexpression ratios were          used                          CGMA analysis          To identify regional geneexpression biases          geneexpression values that map within a given          chromosomal arm were collected and a sign test for a          onesample meanmedian was used to determine whether a          significant upward or downward bias was present in the          expression values An exception was made for chromosomes            and  These chromosomes are more telocentric          and therefore only their qarms were tested for          expression biases Sequence comparisons were used to map          microarray probe sequences the sequences that are placed          on the microarray to predicted Ensembl transcripts          Ensembl version    Included in the Ensembl          transcript annotations are chromosomal mapping locations          at basepair resolution Redundancy introduced by          replicate probes on the array andor multiple probes          mapping to the same gene were eliminated by averaging          expression values that map to identical transcripts Of          the filtered set of  genes  genes  were          unique and had associated genomic mapping          information          A sign test for the onesample meanmedian was used to          determine whether a significant number of genes that map          to a given chromosomal region change in a unidirectional          manner The algorithm scores a gene as up  or down           regulated if the magnitude of the expression value change          is at least fold The sign test computes the          probability in the form of a           z statistic of finding           x upregulated genes out of           n genes that change in a given          genomic region For simplicity the           z statistic is computed using the          normal approximation to the binomial distribution such          that           z             x            n sqrt           n  Genomic regions that contained          less than  changed geneexpression values were excluded          from further analysis On average  geneexpression          values were located to each genomic region The sign test                    z statistic can be converted to a          significance value  based on the twotailed           z statistic            z             critical values For example if                    z   then    if           z   then    and so          on
