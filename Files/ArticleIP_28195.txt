DearPrudie                                                      This is an oddquestion to ask a strangerbut at least you are objective seeing as how wedont know each other I am undecided about whether or not to get breastimplants I have convinced myself that they are not dangerous The issue nowis the correctness of having such a procedure I do not mean politicalcorrectness I mean how important should it be for  oneself  onesonlookers and whatever ethicalphilosophical considerations come into playMy boyfriend by the way says the decision is mine PS I am notparticularly flatchested                                       To D or Not To D                        Dear To            This is a first for Prudie who has never beenasked before to decide about someones chest enhancement            Only you know thereasons for considering implants Are you built like a boy Do you think a pairof remarkable hooters will change your life for the better Do you thinkdrawing attention to your chest is a good thing In general there do not seemto be ethicalphilosophical considerations attached to breasts Prudiespersonal view is that implants fool very few people they often do not feelgenuine to a companion and really what is the point Prudie wishes she couldattribute the phrase to the proper person but some clever soul named thebearers of implants the balloon smugglers That pretty much expressesPrudies thoughts on the matter            Prudie naturally                                             DearPrudence                                                      Could it be that who so disliked the use ofthe expression there you go has confused that phrase with off you go Imnot sure whether the latter has any currency in America but here in Australiait is often uttered in a pleasantand perhaps patronizing tone of voice ininstances such as say insisting to a reluctant teenager that he march offand do his homework By actually describing the addressees future act ofleaving the presence of the speaker the off you go indicates a request fordeparture                                       I think the reasonthere you go has no such unpleasant connotations is that it describes in theretail context the state in which the customer finds him or herself aftersuccessful completion of the purchase See also the rather Henry Jamesianthere you are In other words it functions as a polite observationnaturally terminating the transaction                                       Yourspedantically                                       Amitavo from Sydney                        Dear Am            Prudie thanks you foryour internationalist input on the issue of there you go She found itenlightening and thoughtful Whoever named your part of the world down undersurely was not referring to the educational level of Prudies Australianreaders            Prudie internationally                                             DearPrudence                                                      Having just markedMothers Day here is my problem I am married to a lovely man with a charmingfamily He has no sisters and I am the only daughterinlaw For as long asanyone can remember the men in this family always forgot my motherinlawsbirthday Mothers Day etc Although she clearly loves a fuss her sons andhusband produce not a cake a card a flower or a gift A year ago I realizedeveryone expected me to attend to these details which I had previouslyneglected to do I am happy to celebrate her occasions in a way she wouldenjoy but I resent being expected to handle this task for everyone justbecause I am a woman Should I put feminist principles aside and do my familialduty because its the nicer thing to do or should I leave it to the men towise up                                       Dutiful Daughterinlaw Toronto                        Dear Duti            Lets make a list Onthe plus side is a lovely man with a charming family On the minus sidethese male people cant seem to get it together to do anything about occasionsPrudie feels certain feminism wasnt addressing itself to this issue and hopesyou will lose the resentment factor Do the thoughtful thing for your lovelyhusband and the charming others because on the Richter Scale of Family Choresthis ranks about  You can only reap the appreciation of your male clanmembers and who knows In time you might have trained them by example withouttheir even knowing it            Prudie generously                                             DearPrudence                                                      What is the mostpolitebut effectiveway to handle guests who do not know when to leave aparty My brother brought friends of his to a brunch I gave recently Not onlydid these friends have too much to drink but they actually stayed later thanmy brother I resorted to timehonored tricks such as washing the dishes thenannouncing I had a headacheand yet the guests stayed for another hour Ofcourse I will never invite these people to my home again but was there a moredirect yet still polite way I could have induced them to leave                                       Tired Host                        Dear Ti            You say you will neverinvite these people again My dear you didnt invite them the firsttime Prudie recommends however for those invited or not a direct approachonce a hint is ignored Granted people who arent sober can be rather slow onthe uptake Simply say the festivities are over and you hope they had a goodtime If they wore wraps hand them to them If the weather is too warm thankthem for coming and walk with them to the door Do not take no for an answerThe socially inept are not kidglove candidates            Prudie directly
