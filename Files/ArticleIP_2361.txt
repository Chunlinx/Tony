                                 Mars to Humanity Get Over Yourself            So far popular reactionto NASAs announcement that its scientists have discovered evidence of life ina meteorite from Mars has been pretty positive Only a few cynics have accusedthe space agency of a ploy for more funding But that may change as theimplications sink in Last weeks announcement is the biggest insult to thehuman species in almost  years step two in a threestep process that willleave humanity totally humbled            Ptolemy second centurywas the first and boldest in a long succession of spin doctors for the primacyof human beings The whole universe he postulated rotated around us with theEarth sitting at the center of heaven itself Any marketing consultant willtell you that positioning is everything and centeroftheuniverse is hard tobeat            APolish astronomer named Copernicus  rudely pointed out Sorryearthlings we spin around the sun not vice versa This might have madeCopernicus unpopular if he hadnt had the good sense to die the day his bookwent to press His follower Galileo Galilei  built a telescope andused it to piss in the soup even more The sun it seemed has spots on it Farfrom being the perfect furnace of heaven it has a face covered with celestialzits The moon is an uneven and pockmarked rock and Jupiter upstages Earth byhaving multiple moons The sky went from being a perfect clockwork centered onEarth to a fairly shabby neighborhood in which we were a minor resident            This revelation was disquieting enough that the authoritiesof the time sought the only rational solutionthey decided to burn Galileoalive if he didnt recant Eventually Galileo did sign a decree saying that theEarth sat at the center of the universe while muttering Eppur si moeveBut it still moves under his breath Giordano Bruno a sort of th century Carl Sagan popularized these concepts withoutrepenting saying among other things that innumerable suns existInnumerable earths revolve around those suns Living beings inhabit theseworlds A soundbite like that would have gotten Bruno his  minutes of TVcelebrity if hed been around last week But this was  years ago so theyroasted him to death instead            Brunoscrime like Galileos was to undermine the uniqueness of our planet and bydoing so to threaten the intellectual security of the religious dictatorshipsof his time People get cranky when you burst their bubble Over time advancesin astronomy have relentlessly reinforced the utter insignificance of Earth ona celestial scale Fortunately political and religious leaders stoppedbarbecuing astronomers for saying so turning their spits with humanrightsactivists instead            But the hubris that makes us insist on a special role forhumans and Earth didnt disappear It just found other bases Among thesciences biology became the last refuge for within its realm Earth was stillspecial Life was the unique and sacred phenomenon of which we humans were thecrowning glory Consciously or not mainstream opinion in biologyuntil lastweekorbited around the essential mystery of life on Earth just as surely asthe Ptolemaic view was lodged in the firmament Only a few brave scientistsviolated the taboo and speculated on life beyond Earth            Most visions ofextraterrestrial life are actually steeped in human hubris The fictionalextraterrestrials of Star                Trek or a hundred other space operasare less alien than many of my neighbors And funny the ones running the placeare mostly WASPish men A galaxy full of these folks is no stranger than aKiwanis club meeting We have met the aliens and they are us Darker visionsof life beyond earth support human supremacy in another way After all eventhe most monstrous and advanced alien foe can be vanquished by the likes ofSigourney Weaver or Will Smith For that matter those hapless aliens cantstay ahead of the doughty XFiles team without a conspiratorialcollaboration with that least effective of all entities the USgovernment            Alienstories that are claimed as true are no better Why Earth would be such afascinating place for UFOs to visit is left unexplained I mean reallyRoswell NM Inevitably the UFO stories climax in the ultimate tribute tohuman ego The aliens it seems have traveled umpteen billion miles so theycan abduct us from our beds and have sex with us Im told that once you try ahuman you never go back            The NASA discovery suggests that life is probably a prettyordinary phenomenon that occurs anyplace you give it half a chance Earth isntspecial The alien life forms arent special either Instead of highly logicalhumanoids with pointy ears or other endearing characteristics they seem to bea lot like simple bacteria Should they invade Will Smith can wipe them outwith some Listerine            When theres only oneexample of anything its very uniqueness makes it special Life on Earth wasspecial because it was the only life we knew In this case however the dogmabeing shattered is based fundamentally on ignorance Nobody knew whether therewas life on Mars because oddly enough nobody had looked until now The wholefield of biology has rested precariously on a single data pointlife on EarthLast week we got a second data point            Research over the last  years has changed the scientific view of lifeResearchers have found fossils similar to those in the meteorite in some ofthe oldest rock on Earth There was evidence that life was present just as soonas the planet cooled and solidified If that happened so quickly on Earth whynot on Mars whose early stages of development were quite similar toEarths                           A  succession of discoveries has taught us about archeabacteria veryancient and primitive singlecell organisms that live in the places youd leastexpect anything to call home They inhabit the nearboiling water of geysers inYellowstone and the even hotter water in volcanic vents on the ocean floorThey are in oil wells and the crevices of basalt deep within the earth A basictenet of biology used to be that the energy requirements of all living thingsare met ultimately by the sunmainly through plants converting sunlight intomore easily digestible forms of energy The archeabacteria live far from anycontact with the sun subsisting instead on heat from the center of the Earthnourished only by sulfur and other elements leaching from the rock Somescientists have estimated that the sum of these tiny organisms spread deepwithin the Earth outweighs all the forms of life on the surface combinedPerhaps we surfacedwelling life forms are the exceptionsbizarre mutations ofthe normally deepdwelling archeabacteria that populate the interiors ofplanets all over the galaxy If the discovery is what it appears to be theinside of Mars may still be full of them            Looking ahead we can anticipate the next frontier ofhubris Sure there may be life on other planetsif you call that life Buthumans are still the only intelligent liferight The wagons willcircle to defend this last bastion of human conceit Technology is only justbeginning to let us search the skies for the telltale clues anothercivilization might offer People who speculate on the odds can be either upbeator quite discouraging depending on what ax they have to grind But as with lifeon Mars until you get a chance to take a look how confident can you be oneway or another Maybe its true that were the only members of the big brainclub but Ill lay my bets with ET            Theres a consolationprize for humanity though The steady erosion of our claim to a special placein the universe has come with a steady growth in our maturity as a speciesWhat greater intellectual puzzle can there be than dealing with nature on itsown terms Wallowing in a solipsistic world dictated by our own hubris isntmuch of a challenge in comparison Mankind is not special by virtue of ouraddress in the universe or what spins around us or because life originatedhere Slowly but surely weve been compelled to renounce the comfort of thesebeliefs Our true distinction is the intellectual journey that brought us tothis understanding
