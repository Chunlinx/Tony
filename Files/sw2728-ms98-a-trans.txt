        okay   is this one of your favorite topics   well i love to fish i havent in the last few years but uh in fact   yeah   when i married on our honeymoon thats where we went was fishing   oh my my my son would love to find a woman like that i think     well yeah i really do enjoy it but i like i say i havent been for years we used when after we got married a couple of years after we got married we got a boat and we used to fish a lot and including you know we skied too but after the kids came we stopped and um now im im divorced so   yeah they have a way they have a way of influencing your life   yeah they dont you know and especially when theyre little like that it was difficult to have them in the boat we were always worried something would happen so we didnt   what type what type of fishing did you enjoy   well i liked trolling the best i i mean i like moving so instead of just sitting in one spot and i really do like to fish in the rain   umhum oh is that right   yeah i and when its not pouring i mean but when its just a light rain im i really enjoy that and i find that you we use to catch a lot of fish when it was raining   oh yeah do you do you like cartoons   do i pardon me say that again cartoons yes   cartoons yes one of the my favorite cartoons is a picture of a a fellow in a pouring a downpour raining oh now the boat is half full of water there are beer cans floating all around and the the line is in the boat with him and hes got the biggest grin on his face youve ever seen   oh gosh i dont know whether id go that far   no  but when you say you enjoying enjoying the rain that uh you must be in a warm weather climate then   well see the thing is when when i i am from originally from Ohio and i met my husband in Iowa and we   umhum   he was from Minnesota and we went on our honeymoon to Minnesota so it was well it was in August and so it was warm enough but uh   oh   i because i dont enjoy cold weather at all so we we uh we lived right by a lake and it was nice   yeah have you ever done any the uh ocean fishing   no i have not i lived in the Bahamas for a year but i didnt do any fishing we did some scuba diving but thats all   no oh i thats thats a nice sport too i think beautiful sights and it   yes its its its gorgeous   now the only offshore fishing ive done is from the Bahamas and caught a nice big barracuda   ooh how nice   yeah yeah interesting interesting time ive ive been in the Great Lakes too and caught some salmon there   uhhuh   but i really enjoy farm pond fishing probably as as much as anything   oh ive never fished in a farm pond   oh you you can get out and it a fairly large pond with a lot of stumps and everything good black bass fishing   um   and i enjoy walking around the edge and   um   trying to select a spot ive even done some uh tube fishing are you familiar with that   no uhhuh   thats an inner tube with a special seat in it   ooh   and you wear waders and you have little fins that you kick around so you move move manipulate yourself anywhere you want in a pond   oh how wonderful relaxing too huh   yeah its a lot of fun  it is  and cooling   oh that sounds great   you know the the uh water below helps keep you cool you may be baked in the sun in the upper half of your body but uh       its its a nice relaxing way and   oh   gentle undulations of the water you know is it is nice i think   oh it sounds wonderful   but fishing is a good relaxing sport if you if you dont have patience i dont know if you would enjoy fishing because you   no i know i know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be moving all the time i think you have to be able to sit and and just enjoy yourself quietly if you cant do that youre not going to make a good fisherman   yeah no and i think thats part of the lure is is just to be uh relaxed and with the world and no pressure not not worrying about whether you catch anything or not   right well in this day and age thats wonderful to be able to do that because when we our lives are so stressful so     uh do your children fish   well real sad to say we dont as much as we im im divorced and and uh since weve been to Texas we havent now in Iowa when they were little my son i used to take him fishing and they both have you know gear and weve weve gone   umhum   once or twice but and theres just not that many lakes around here that id be interested in in going to and so   no no   you know and uh i just uh we just havent and not that they i think they both would would like it they have gone with their dad and uh he lives in Arizona now and uh he lives in the Phoenix area and the mountains are real close and hes taken them up to the mountains and yeah   trout fishing yeah thats fun too   yeah yeah and theyve enjoyed it   it its a challenge to learn to use the different equipment a fly rod entirely different technique   it is yes   and im always amazed that you can catch a large trout on a hook that small   yeah isnt that it that is amazing isnt it     yeah   well i can remember when i was trolling i caught a and we couldnt eat this it was a a Rock Bass and of course theyre not good to eat but i mean it was it was for me it was like a six pound fish and that was big for me and i was just tickled to death that   the oh yeah   to catch it we threw it back in but um that was i think the biggest fish i ever caught   well you know in Virginia well they they do eat the Rock Bass though   but well we dont in Minnesota people just dont they dont eat them for some reason so   yeah i think if they if they cut around that red streak in it then youre in good shape umhum   oh is that right see we didnt know that so we just threw it back in so   well thats a hybrid right its a salt water that migrated into the fresh   yes it is uhhuh uhhuh   yeah   yeah   and that it was a big thing they call Stripers in Oklahoma   oh   and Rock Fish i know in Virginia   uhhuh   and uh probably up up there too then   yeah yeah   have you ever done any surf casting   no   thats fun   is it   umhum i could stand all day on the surf and you just have a lot of weight on the end of it and youre fighting the undertow so theres some action going on whether its the fish or not all the time   uhhuh   and thats a a relaxing time too you   would you have to repeatedly cast though in the no   no uhhuh no the secret is to cast just over the break of the wave and then the undertow keeps the line moving outward in in you know it stays there for the uh flounder or or some of the other special fish too   oh   its good good exercise too   oh that sounds great   yeah   well uh when i grew up when i was growing up my dad was an avid fisherman fisherman and we had a boat and we would go out in Lake Erie because im from Ohio   what   and we would fish that was before it was so polluted and so yucky it was a beautiful lake then and um we would we would fish and and my dad would i can remember even when we were interested werent interested in when we were younger and wed play around the the the lake or around   oh yeah   and wed go up into go uh Michigan and the rapids up there in Grand Rapids Michigan were just beautiful and he would fish he would get his you know his waders on his long boots and he would go out and we would just play by the water and just have a ball and he would fish and it was so gorgeous   umhum well   and that was one of my wonderful childhood memories   yeah i hope uh that the future generations have places they can go   yeah isnt that scary   it is it is and with all the pollution that we do have   yeah yeah it its bad Lake Erie when i havent been home for several years but the last time i was home i was just so surprised to see how terrible Lake Erie was i mean it just was awful   um   and it just makes you so sad because at one time it was just a beautiful lake   yep   and not too long ago really   right   but   but Sally its been nice talking to you and i hope you get to go fishing soon   it sure has well thank you and you have many good fishing days too     good night   bye night byebye
