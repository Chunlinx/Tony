        well what do you know about Latin American policies     well i think theyre kind of ambivalent really uh i i just have a feeling that weve kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know   umhum uhhuh   were we dont know half the time we dont know who to support   are you uh relating this uh to the uh affair weve got going on in Haiti right now   that and you know uh maybe its maybe its tough for a big powerful nation to deal with with uh countries like that that depend on us so much without you know just telling them running their country for them but   right that thats just it   its got to be tough but i mean uh uh im you sure you still have to you know let them know how you feel   right i guess my concern uh you know no matter which no matter which side we take were gonna have supporters and were gonna have uh antisupporters i guess for lack of better term and uh like you said theyre such small countries that were bound to upset somebody but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance   yeah it it worries me that uh the economy of so many countries in in South America and Central America depend on something that that damages people like the you know like cocaine from Columbia and   right right   uh you know of course i im sure we have some enemies down there who would wouldnt care what happened to us but   thats true   but that is thats a tough deal  and it i dont think that maybe im maybe its you know im just reflecting how i feel about it but i have a feeling that we that we really dont understand basically the the the competing factions in a lot of those countries and i mean theyve been hammering tongs for the last you know ten centuries   sure   and its still going on and uh we we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us i think sometimes   that thats about the lump sum of it well um i was speaking with a a woman from uh uh i believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala or somewhere in there no she was from El Salvador   yeah   and uh she was from a relatively wealthy family and when uh the Contras came into power of course with uh oh gosh darn it whats his face hes in in Florida jail now Marcos   yeah yeah   uh no hes Marcos is Philippines   yeah um well im blank  i can see his face i mean how could you forget his face   well you know who im talking about yeah i i know it uh anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybodys property you know just assigned it to himself   yeah kind of nationalized it   right right and uh   for himself   so shes been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the US government in that respect and i in that respect i have to agree that       i think were taking the right stance uh because they were a democracy   yeah   turned uh   dictator yeah   you know right basically a dictator fascist   and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing it just   sure   you know unstable   well what do you think of uh this uh US free trade agreement were working on with Mexico   well i think its long overdue uh i just you know theres so much difference in in the economies of the two countries i im not you know i have a problem uh   umhum   with whether its gonna work or not you know theres uh it seems like theres and i this may be unfair to Mexico but it seems like theres a lack of honesty in  in in in foreign policy a lot of the times   umhum uh Mexico theyre i i know theyre trying theyre really trying the Mexican government is trying and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to oh make themselves Americanized i guess   yeah   and uh which is great because thats what they basically need to do the big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know and we dont have the Siesta and theres the cultural differences is what   yeah yeah   is whats kind of its whats really hurting uh the Mexican the Mexican people because theyve had their way of life and weve had our way of life and uh   i think theres their version of the good old boy network going  that uh you know has a lot
