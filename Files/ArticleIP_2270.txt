                                 Chinagates Big Winner            In the summer of candidate Bill Clinton made a strategic decision to spend tens of millions ofdollars on early television advertising This unprecedented media blitz whichbegan in  cities nearly a year and a half before the election hadfarranging consequences for Clintons future            Accordingto Dick Morris the chief effect was Clintons reelection In my opinion hewrites in Behind the Oval Office  the key to Clintons victory was hisearly television advertising Morris argues that by stealthily airing the adsin places where they wouldnt be noticed by the national media Clinton gainedan advantage that Bob Dole was never able to counter This claim is highlydebatable But two other results of Morris early ad strategy are harder todispute One which was unintended is the campaignfinance scandal that isruining Clintons second term The other very much intended is Dick Morrisrise to riches            Though it is now conventional wisdom that the ads workedthe evidence for this consists entirely of unsubstantiated assertions by thepeople who made the ads Morris whom I spoke to this week continues to makeextravagant claims In the areas where they ran Morris says the ads boostedClintons numbers  percent compared with places where they did not run Thissevenpoint difference he says held through Election Day Others who watchedthe numbers with a professional eye are dubious of this boast Theres noquestion they were great ads says Mark Mellman a Democratic pollster Buttheres a lot of question about how central they were to Clintons ultimatevictory Another wellregarded Democratic pollster Geoff Garin expresses hisdoubts more strongly My sense is that Clintons situation improved in placeswhere they werent advertising pretty much to the extent that they did inplaces where they were advertising            Morris bases his explanationson polls done by Mark Penn and Doug Schoen Neither he nor they are willing toshare the numbers But independent comparisons of places where Morris says theads ran and places where they didnt do not appear to substantiate his claimIn Ohio where the early ads did run Clintons net favorable rating droppedfrom nine points in March  to six points in June and four points inNovember In Maryland where the ads did not run the ClintonDole matchup pollwent from a onepoint lead for Clinton in the early spring to a ninepoint leadin midOctoberthat is Clinton did significantly better in the state wherethere were no early ads Of course these numbers dont prove the ads wereuseless For one thing the ads ran in media markets which are generally onlyparts of states and are sometimes made up of parts of more than one state Buteven if Penn and Schoens secret data support Morris claim of a sevenpointbump inbuy it doesnt prove the ads worked All the early ads ran in swingstates where you would expect Clintons numbers to move more As Morrishimself acknowledges Its easier to change someones mind in Ohio            Defendinga fallback position Morris argues that the ads helped because theystrengthened Clintons hand in resisting a budget deal on Republican terms Wehad to win the battle of budget to win the war of reelection he says Theads helped win the battle What Morris conveniently forgets is that at thetime he had wanted Clinton to compromise with Republicans on the budget Thepurpose of the ads can hardly have been to achieve a result Morris opposed            Amore demonstrable effect of the ads was theincitement of the campaignfinancing scandal that now dominates Washington Inthe summer and fall of  Morris nemesis Harold Ickes opposed the early adstrategy because he thought it was a waste of money As one source involved inDemocratic fund raising explains Asking contributors for money in August raised a question of whether they would be tapped out in  You either haveto go back to the same corporations and ask for an even bigger percentage oryou have to find new systems new pockets of money Corporations that havebudgeted for contributions of a certain size are loath to allot large amountsof additional cash in the middle of the year To get more soft money out ofthem the Democratic National Committee turned to new perks like White Housecoffees But fundraisers leaned more heavily on the secondalternativefinding new untapped pools of cash Thats where John Huang camein            The oneindisputable consequence of the ads was that they generated a great deal ofmoney for those who created them As a rule media buyers get a  percentcommission In a presidential campaign with tens of millions being spentthese fees can be enormous Ordinarily a political consultant like Morriswould not share in them But in  Morris set up a consortium called theNovember  Group Inc to split the rakeoff This group was composed of BobSquier and Bill Knapp who did the actual station buys Hank Sheinkopf andMarius Penczner who collaborated with Knapp in producing the spots thepollsters Penn and Schoen and Morris himself Details of this partnership arenot subject to disclosure under federal election laws But according to asource with knowledge of the deal the split was  Half of thecommission went to Squier and Knapp A quarter went to Morris A tenth went toPenn and Schoen and another tenth went to Sheinkopf The final  percent wentto Penczner            Consider this deal from the perspective of June Morris was making a  percent commission  percent of  percent on asmuch commercial time as Clinton bought That means that when Morris urged thepresident to spend an unprecedented  million in early ads he stood to earn for himself on top of the several hundred thousand being paid to himas salary by the campaign According to Bob Woodwards The Choice Morris was so anxious for Clinton to have as much money as possible forpolitical advertising on television that he proposed that Clinton forgo federalmatching funds of some  million so the president would not have to abide bythe approximately  million limit on fund raising during the primary seasonUnfortunately for Morris Clinton ignored this particular advice and decided tostay within the limits            In the end Morris madesomewhat less than he might have hoped Ickes pushed hard to whittle down thegroups commission reducing it to  percent by the end of the campaignAccording to Knapp the total commission shared by the various consultantsworked out to an average of  percent per dollar spent And Morris did notget his  percent cut on the full  million he says was spent on ClintonsTV advertising After he resigned in disgrace in August  Morris November Group colleagues cut him out of the action As it was according to aknowledgeable source Morris earned approximately  million on the ads            Morris says the realprofligacy was Ickes insistence on keeping large staffs in key states longafter the danger of a primary threat to Clinton had evaporated He disputesthat the ads played a role in the current scandal On the subject of Clintonsaggressive fund raising Morris recently told the New York Daily News I just think he overdid it Thats some chutzpah considering who the chiefbeneficiary was Morris commission alone amounts to more than all the moneyDemocrats have had to give back to suspicious contributors
