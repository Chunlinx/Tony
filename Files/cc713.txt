                    Introduction        Involvement of the spleen in malaria that results in        splenomegaly renders this organ prone to complications such        as rupture   In areas where malaria is endemic        spontaneous rupture of spleen is uncommon Because of        increased travel to endemic areas and resistance to        antimalarial drugs however malaria is a major medical        problem which is becoming increasingly important to        surgeons worldwide During the s and s in the USA        the annual number of diagnosed cases of malaria rose by        twofold to fourfold that of the preceding decade           We report two cases of spontaneous rupture of malarial        spleen treated with splenectomy                    Case reports                  Case           A yearold man presented at hospital with sudden          onset of upper abdominal pain followed by palpitations          and fainting He had been taking chloroquine In the          emergency department he was hypotensive and had pain in          the left hypochondrium Ultrasound showed an enlarged          ruptured spleen and free blood in the abdomen There was          free blood  cm  in the peritoneal cavity and a          friable enlarged ruptured spleen grade III was found          and removed Pathological examination revealed that the          spleen weighed  g and measured      cm Gross          examination showed the spleen to be dark grey with          capsular tear and subcapsular haematoma on the medial          side Microscopy revealed dilatation of sinuses          increased pigmentation and elevated concentration of          macrophages Thick and thin films revealed the presence          of           Plasmodium vivax  The patient          much improved was discharged  days after the          operation                          Case           A yearold man was receiving treatment for a          duodenal ulcer in the gastroenterology department He was          also receiving chloroquine for malaria For  days of          hospitalization he had highgrade fever and immediately          became hypotensive and had abdominal pain We performed          abdominal paracentesis which demonstrated free blood in          the peritoneal cavity Explorative laparotomy revealed          approximately one litre of blood in the peritoneal cavity          and an enlarged spleen measuring almost double its          normal size with a tear on the inferior surface grade          II Splenectomy was performed The spleen was  g and          measured      cm Gross examination showed grayish          brown discoloured spleen with capsular tears at a few          places Microscopy revealed congestion and dilatation of          sinuses and bleeding areas           P vivax was identified by thick          film The patient was discharged well  days after the          operation                            Discussion        Malaria parasites have been with us throughout human        history They probably originated in Africa along with        humans and fossils of mosquitoes show that the vectors        for malaria have existed for at least  million years         Plasmodium parasites are highly        specific with humans as the only vertebrate host and         Anopheles mosquitoes as the vectors        This specificity of the parasites also indicates a long and        adaptive relationship with humans          Despite initial success there was complete failure to        eradicate malaria in many countries because of a number of        factors Although technical difficulties such as vector and        parasite drug resistance have played a part failure in        this endeavour was probably due to social and political        factors that prevented efficient application of control        measures   The malaria control operation was criticized        for being too much like a military operation and the lack        of explanation given to local populations meant that the        control measures received little support or even        opposition   Accurate information on the global        incidence of malaria is difficult to obtain because        reporting is particularly poor in areas that are known to        be highly endemic The global incidence of malaria is        estimated to be nearly  million clinical cases each        year with nearly  million people carrying the parasite        The vast majority of malaria deaths occur in Africa        Estimates vary greatly the World Health Organization          quoted a figure of   deathsyear in African children        during         Malaria is generally endemic in the tropics with        extensions into subtropic regions Malaria in travellers        who arrive by air is now an important cause of death in        nonmalarious areas   and this is not helped by        ignorance or indifference of travellers to prophylactic        measures          Malaria has long been among the most common diseases in        the southeast Anatolia region of Turkey During           cases were diagnosed in Turkey and Diyarbakir city had        the highest incidence  cases followed by SanliUrfa        city  cases The southeast Anatolia region is in        upper Mesopotamia covering Diyarbakir SanliUrfa        GaziAntep Adiyaman Batman Mardin Siirt and Sirnak        Malaria was especially common during  and  with          and   cases being diagnosed in these years        respectively However in  the number of new cases        decreased with   cases being encountered Table         Proquanil with chloroquine have been advised as the best        prophylactic regimen for tourists travelling to the        southeast Anatolia region of Turkey between March and        November          Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is well described in        many diseases of which malaria is the most common           Other such diseases include infectious mononucleosis        splenic neoplasms and haematological malignancies             The incidence of rupture of the spleen in malaria        is poorly defined Comparisons of cases that occur in the        setting of natural or induced infection have most        frequently been employed to investigate this issue Natural        infection is that acquired via a mosquito bite or        transplacentally Induced infection is that obtained        through blood transfusion sharing of needles laboratory        accidents and experimental or therapeutic inoculation          Fifteen cases of malarial splenic rupture have been        reported since  Table  From only three of the        reports can the incidence be calculated Rates of splenic        rupture in naturally occurring infection ranged from          rupture total cases of infection to   rupture        total cases of infection     The only series of        splenic ruptures in induced infections reported an        incidence of   ruptures total cases of infection          That only  cases have been reported since         suggests underreporting or underdiagnosis especially for        those cases of splenic rupture in the setting of naturally        acquired infection                           Splenic enlargement is very common in malarious areas of        the world It is found in  of some populations          When a palpable spleen is present it is generally        appreciated within days of the onset of symptoms If        disease remains untreated the spleen can grow This        results in greater average spleen size in a population as        the prevalence of malaria increases           P vivax has been the species most        closely associated with rupture of the spleen in both        naturally acquired and induced infections   Among        cases reported after  nine out of  were due to         P vivax four cases were induced        infections and five were naturally acquired infections        Both of the patients described above had         P vivax infection Spontaneous        rupture of the spleen occurs almost exclusively during        acute infection and usually during the primary attack                 The exact mechanism of spleen rupture is not known        However three mechanisms have been implicated in the        process   The first of these mechanisms is increase in        intrasplenic tension that is due to cellular hyperplasia        and engorgement Second the spleen may be compressed by        the abdominal musculature during physiological activities        such as sneezing coughing defecation and sitting up or        turning in bed Finally vascular occlusion due to reticule        endothelial hyperplasia resulting in thrombosis and        infarction may be involved This leads to interstitial and        subcapsular haemorrhage and stripping of the capsule which        lead to further subcapsular haemorrhage The distended        capsule finally gives way        Pathological findings in spontaneous rupture of the        spleen include gross and microscopic changes On gross        examination acutely malarial spleen is dark red because of        congestion hyperaemia and deposition of haemozoin a        malarial pigment The capsule is thin and friable Chronic        malarial spleen tends to be dark grey with increased        density of connective tissue and fibrosis resulting in a        heavy often massively enlarged organ with a firm or hard        capsule In addition disruption of the spleen capsule and        single or multiple tears in the underlying parenchyma may        be found Tears may be small or large grades IIV and may        be present on any surface In both of the cases described        above the spleen was massively enlarged        Microscopic examination demonstrated haemozoin        parasitized and uninfected erythrocytes and a massive        proliferation of macrophages throughout the capillaries        venous sinuses and pulp spaces There is congestion and        dilatation of sinuses and scattered thrombosis with focal        necrosis in capillaries and splenic pulp        Splenectomy is accepted as the treatment of choice in        cases of spontaneous rupture of the spleen Of the         patients described since  including those described        above  patients underwent surgical procedures all of        which were splenectomies In regions in which malaria is        not endemic improved surgical techniques and supportive        care in addition to increased preoperative and        postoperative risk of splenectomy have led to attempted        nonoperative management of splenic rupture in many cases of        penetrating and blunt trauma   Nonoperative management        consists of observation for  days in the hospital        strict bed rest and administration of fluid and blood as        needed   In areas in which malaria is endemic there        is growing evidence to suggest that management of        spontaneous rupture of malarial spleen without splenectomy        should be attempted A conservative strategy is also        reasonable in patients who travel frequently to malarious        areas Splenectomy should be reserved for those patients        with severe rupture or those with continued or recurrent        bleeding                      Conclusion        Changes in the structure of the spleen during the course        of malaria can result in asymptomatic enlargement or        complications such as haematoma formation and rupture        Primary exposure to malaria and infection with         P vivax appear to be important        factors in spontaneous rupture of the spleen Malaria is        still important in the southeast Anatolia region of Turkey        Prophylactic measures should be taken by tourists who        travel to this region especially those who do so during        the summer
