                                 Plugging in a Speaker            House politics continue to dominate The WP leads with the de factoSpeakerhood of Rep Robert Livingston The LAT goes with the fractiousRepublican caucus he will try to lead which the WSJ also addresses in afrontpager The NYT goes instead with yesterdays Judiciary hearings at whichscholars said middleground outcomes like censuring the president had noconstitutional basis The hearings are also the offlead at the WP andmake the front at the LAT and USAT which leads instead with the SupremeCourts allowing the continuance of Wisconsins program of subsidizing poorchildrens attendance at private and religious schools This voucher storymakes the LAT and NYT fronts but is played inside at thePost             The WP  LAT and NYT each give the whosupwhosdownon the House GOP wrangle but there is no clear sense communicated about what itall means The LAT bothers to tell us that to hold together the HouseGOP caucus Livingston may have to to coin a phrase resort to scotch tape andbailing wire but doesnt tell us much about the ideological differencesoperating except to say that Livingston has been slammed by the WSJeditorial page and is also disliked by something called the Traditional ValuesCoalition The coverage tells us that Livingston is apparently all about toneand management and could this be the Jesse Ventura effect that hes a blackbelt in karate But thats about it For a topography of the House GOP turn tothe Journal account which nicely articulates the three main branches ofits conservatism pragmatic economic and social            As for the lesser offices in the hierarchy the papers dont evencommunicate what they do The reader has no idea what to make of learning thatfor example the vice chair of the House Republican Conference is challengingthe Majority Leader The one exception to this complaint is the Post sreporting on the job of Majority Whip Tom DeLay Delay it seems was able tovector support to Livingston because he possesses the only really uptodatelist of members phone numbers and addresses            The NYT observes that if the Republicans were looking for a way togracefully abandon impeachment this was not in evidence at the Judiciaryhearings The other papers see things the same way Although it was Elbow Patchand Tweed Day at the committee the NYT shows that often the academicwitnesses were just foils for members speechifying All the experts testifiedthat the standards for impeachment should be kept very high but some of theRepublican members of the committee made it clear they felt that lying aboutsex qualified            Its a bit sobering to read that the WP s political dean DavidBroder refuses to bury Newt Gingrichs career in public life His model forGingrich in  is Nixon in down but not out If writes Broder theDemocrats clobber the GOP in the  presidential vote Gingrich would bepositioned for a comeback this time as a presidential candidate            As an apparent conflict with Iraq looms USAT reports on a visit madelast month to a Navy carrier now enroute to the Mediterranean The paperreports that the ship is deployed with  fewer crew than its supposed tohave with the result that flight operations cannot be sustained at the tempocommanders would like The paper reports that although the Navy denies that thecarriers recent fatal flight deck collision had anything to do withshorthandedness the service has experienced a rise in its flight accidentrate The story quotes one civilian defense experts assessment theres plentyof money its just being spent on the wrong thingsglamour weapons instead ofparts and manpower            For those wondering how long Kenneth Starrs operation could stay inbusiness the WP runs a story inside about the independent counselappointed to look into conflict of interest charges against Eli Segal aonetime Clinton national service advisor Nine months after getting the casethe IC recommended against prosecuting Segal and no further action was takenagainst him But more than a year after that the office still exists albeitdown to one attorney working about half time Why Well says the Post the office had to continue operating while those investigated or required totestify appealed for reimbursement of their legal expenses And theres thecost in time and money of as the law requires turning over all paperwork tothe National Archives And best of all since any IC office must be audited bythe government every six months someone must be retained to preside over theoffice while its being audited Thats how the Segal IC is still managing tospend more than  a year
