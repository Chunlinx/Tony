Bailando con el Diablo Dancing with the DevilA popularly narrated legend found throughout the Southwest south Texas and even parts of northern Mexico that tells of the appearance of the devil at community dances dance halls and discotheques Called the devil at the dance legend or devil haunts the dance hall in folklore literature it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed usually in a suit he is strikingly handsome muy suave smooth and poised tall and refined Consequently he stands out from among the rest of the men Besides his stunning appearance he is always an amazing dancer knows the latest dance steps and selects the prettiest girl to danceAs the tale is often narrated a disobedient young girl goes to the dance without her parents permission or she goes against her mothers express wishes While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed man asks her to dance They dance all night until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isnt wearing shoes and in fact he doesnt even have feet instead he has chicken feet goats hooves or a pigs foot and a chicken foot It is usually at this point after hes discovered that he disappears into thin air leaving the odor of sulfur in the air or in some versions of the legend just runs out the door The girl he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke If the girl doesnt die as in some stories she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a mans handprint might be found on her back A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was thereThe lesson learned is that one must not disobey ones parents for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends among themselves or from mothers to daughters in a didactic fashion to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on Good Friday a religious holy day and a revered day of prayer in Chicano Catholic households The appearance of the devil on this day is an especially ominous signRobes collection of New

traditions among Mexicans and Chicanos throughout Mexico and the United States Since the Spaniards conquered the Southwest bailes have been important community social and cultural events In Texas New Mexico and California because of the isolation of the communities dancing became the principal source of entertainment The social status of women in Spanish colonial society was limited and cloistered with their primary social venues consisting of church and home El baile provided entertainment and physical activity As an early California traveler put it I was astonished at the endurance of the California women in holding out night after night in dancing of which they never seemed to weary but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising Shay  It was at el baile that courtship occurred since girls although they may have gone to the dance chaperoned were allowed to dance with boys it was at el baile that families and relatives interacted that the weeks work was forgotten and that lifes mysteries were discussed The local dance brought the community together and allowed interaction between the sexes A girl was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy because to turn down an invitation exposed the boy to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition and could be cause for revenge Countless corridos ballads leyendas legends and chistes jokes narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at el baile from fights to courtships to elopements Encounters with the legendary weeping woman La Llorona often occur after a dance when a solitary man is finding his way home From the devilatthedance narratives to the tragic death of Rosita Alvarez recounted in the corrido of the same name we learn of the importance of el baile in both rural and urban Chicano communities Major Horace Bell describes the difference between a baile and a fandango in Mexican California history and Arnoldo De Leon describes the baile in eighteenthcentury San AntonioMost Mexican national holiday celebrations such as Cinco de Mayo and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre will end with a community dance Even in modern times professional Latino

dances The dances are carefully choreographed and well rehearsed they are representative of the dances from the different regions of Mexico An important characteristic of the dance performances is the elaborate beautiful costumes very full and colorful dresses that are the traditional dress from the various states of Mexico such as Jalisco Veracruz Chihuahua and Durango The dances many of which have been danced for decades such as El Jarabe Tapatio and La Negra are danced to Mariachi music and performed on the Mexican national holidays Las Fiestas Patrias such as Cinco de Mayo and El Diez y Seis de SeptiembreThese folk dance groups became popular in Mexico right after the Mexican Revolution but did not become prevalent in the United States until the s It was the influence of the Chicano

by Amalia Hernandez in the early s became the official cultural representative of the Mexican government and has often toured the United States Amalia Hernandez based her folklore costumes and folk dances on the authentic folklore traditions of the Mexican people This folklrico group became the model on which most Chicano folklrico groups are basedMexican folklore traditions folk songs and folk dances had been taught within Mexican colonias neighborhoods today known as barrios since before the s usually through the efforts of a single individual in the community in church halls and mutual aid society halls but not in the public schools There was one exception in Tucson Arizona a teacher named Margarite Collier started a Mexican Folklore Club in  in an elementary school for the specific

Chicano singer Ritchie Valens who recorded the song and made it very popular in  The song actually goes back to early Mexican colonial history it has been traced to  when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries By the s it was also a popular dance in Mexican CaliforniaLa Bamba is considered to be a son jarocho country folks dancing music an example of the mestizo mixedrace musical tradition with strong African influences from the state of Veracruz The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp a small eightstring guitar jarana and a small fourstring guitar requinto The dance that went with son jarocho was a zapateado a footstomping dance There are two different accounts about how Ritchie Valens learned the song since he supposedly never learned Spanish One source states that he heard the song on a short trip across the border into Mexico and another states he learned the song from his uncle when he was five years old His innovative style mixed jarocho music with a rock n roll beat His recorded version of La Bamba in  is the first known US recording La Bamba has now been recorded more than  different times in the United States for example in  by Trini Lopez in  by the Plugz and in  by Los

ward in an urban area where Mexicans and Chicanos live In the early s Mexican communities were called colonias as they are in Mexico today but at some point after World War II Chicano neighborhoods became known as barrios In Chicano culture barrios are identified by given names that in some way describe a characteristic of the neighborhood or reflect its history Some barrios are only a few blocks whereas others encompass large urban areas Some of the oldest barrios can be found in major cities like Los Angeles Chicago El Paso and San Antonio In San Fernando also known as San Fer two very early barrios were La Rana and El Bajillo The Frog The Little Low One Hoyo Marvilla another wellknown barrio in East Los Angeles was famous because it was where farmworkers lived and was extremely poor Barrios are sometimes called ghettos even though there are very negative and sometimes few positive attributes to living in barrios they cant always be presumed to be ghettos in the sense of places where a group is forced to live against its will Vigils work on gang culture explains the allegiance felt by gang members toward their barrio Mary Helen Ponce writes in Hoyt Street about the barrio where she grew up in Pacoima California during the s and s Many Chicano novelists have set their stories in the barrios of the Southwest and Midwest Ral Salinas in his poem A Trip

political satire Barriology was created as a spoof on the academic social sciences it involved testing those Chicanos not so fluent in the traditions and rituals of living in Chicano neighborhoods or barrios Con Safos carried monthly examinations developed by Antonio Gmez PhD Barriologist Emeritus It was also a way of gently poking fun at Chicano culture reminding the readers of the uniqueness of the Chicano culture Some of the exam questions consisted of multiplechoice answers others required the reader to fill in the answer Some sample questions followMenudo is made from tripe which isa the

of white bread or a large dinner roll which in the United States is sometimes called French bread Bolillos also known as birotes can be found in most Mexican and Mexican American bakeries and are often served in Mexican restaurants The folkloric use of bolillo occurs when it is derogatorily applied to Anglo Americans supposedly because they are as white as bread and because the Americans invaded and annexed Mexican territory the Southwest Although not as popularly known it carries the same meaning as gringo or gavacho Chicanos also often use the term as they do agringado to describe an overly acculturated Chicano one who is trying to be whiteIt is believed the word was originally used to describe French soldiers when they occupied Mexico in the s Although written references to its use in this way have not been found there are references to the French eating small loaves of white bread in corridos Amrico Paredes cites a stanza from a corrido ballad the Mexican soldiers sang after the Battle of Puebla celebrated on Cinco de Mayo that taunts the vanquished French soldiers with the following wordsQues de las piezas de panAgurdenlas que ahi les van PamWhere are the loaves of

early writer of Chicano folk culture and folklore from the TexasMexican border Although Bourke was first and foremost a military man he became interested in ethnology and anthropology and wrote extensively on these subjects Born in  to Irish Catholic parents in Pennsylvania he enlisted in the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry during the Civil War In  he attended West Point graduating in  with a commission in the Third Cavalry He served with General George Crook from  to  and in  wrote a wellreceived book titled On the Border with CrookThrough his friendship with the director of the Bureau of American Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution Bourke studied anthropology and broadened his interests to include ethnology and folklore At various times he wrote pamphlets for the Bureau of Indian Affairs He gained fame as an Indian fighter but was also known as an anthropologist and writer Although primarily a military man he managed to conduct fieldwork among several Indian tribes and was considered an expert on the Apaches He was stationed along the Rio Grande for two years during the era of the Catarino Garza revolt and his diaries from this period are a valuable resource on the Garza movement He learned the Spanish language apparently because of his ethnological interests and wrote on the Tejano and Mexicano culture of the border region During the s he published ethnographic articles about the TexasMexican border in the Journal of American Folklore and the American Anthropologist Bourke observed chronicled and wrote both as a journalist and anthropologist about the folk medicine practices and the folk foodways of the Rio Grande regionHis approach to folklore study was that of the established tradition of the times which examined current customs traditions folkways and folk narratives as survivals of an earlier civilization Sometimes this survivalist perspective carried with it an attitude about the prior culture where the customs originated as having been a higher civilization Accordingly when Bourke became interested in Mexican customs and language he approached them as the cultural remains of a higher SpanishArabic civilization In spite of the fact that his nineteenthcentury biases are very apparent in his writings the data he collected are valuable for the study of Chicano folklore of the TexasMexican border He was elected president of the American Folklore Society in  and he died in  He is buried at Arlington National CemeteryReferences Limn  New Handbook of Texas Braceros LaborersMexican workers recruited from Mexico under the Emergency Farm Labor Program known as the Bracero Program which was in effect from  to  The word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo arm which is used as English uses hand to mean laborer In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands a laborer and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II and this program offered an answer to that problem although some braceros also worked on the railroad Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker and is often used interchangeably with words like wetback or greaser The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of  in  to a high of  in  It is estimated that by  nearly  braceros had worked in the United States under this program It continued even after the war and between  and  over  braceros were still working in the United States Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and instead stayed and hid from la migra the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service INSMany Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed never returning to Mexico The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies and although the image presented is often a negative one like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaqun the revolutionary figure of Joaqun Murrieta the mythical pachuco the stately learned persona of Dr Paredes the gentle leadership of Csar Chvez the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker the campesino of the world Many corridos ballads describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest Maria HerreraSobek describes the prototype of the bracero as represented in countless corridos in her book The Bracero Experience In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero by Jesus Amaya Topete published in  and reprinted

BolillosBrujera WitchcraftWitches and brujera witchcraft are accepted facts of life in Mexican and Chicano culture Belief in witches and witchcraft is common in the Southwest as can be seen by the large number of folk narratives and legends about witches collected in New Mexico and Texas in the last century This form of occultism is an integral part of the culture of Mexico and the Southwest The Spanish conquerors and colonists who settled New Mexico in the sixteenth century communicated to the indigenous communities a belief in witchcraft Beliefs in witchcraft were prevalent in Europe during the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the missionary friars brought these beliefs to the New World The Spanish Catholic missionaries worked hard to convert the indigenous populations of New Spain and any nonChristian belief that was not acceptable to the Spanish friars was often attributed to sin evil the devil or witchcraft Consequently it was easy to assign unexplainable natural phenomena to the work of witches and these beliefs have persisted over hundreds of years Contemporary witches can prepare love potions lift spells cure and cause illnesses and in general cause great harm They can also take on any form they desire such as a cat pig or owl and so can make themselves difficult to identify In folktales from New Mexico they often appear as balls of fire flying across the sky Curanderas are sometimes mistaken for witches because of their healing power but they are also often called upon to undo the work of witchesMany of the folktales legends and cuentos stories collected in New Mexico by Aurelio Espinosa Juan Bautista Rael and R D Jameson Robe  are about witches and witchcraft In the s writers employed by the Works Progress Administration WPA as part of Roosevelts New Deal collected many cuentos and legends about witches from the people of northern New Mexico and many beliefs expressed then are still held today For instance the way to tell if a person is a witch is to stick two needles in the form of a cross into the sill above a door if the person in the room is a witch she wont be able to leave the room Another belief is that only men named Juan or Juan Bautista or women named Juana have the ability to catch or overpower a witch Conversely the power of a witch cannot be exerted over a person named Juan or Juana A witch cannot sense the presence of a Juan so he may be able to trap her by drawing a circle on the ground and throwing his shirt turned inside out into the circleWitches often take the form of an owl in New Mexican Spanish called a tecolote from the Nahuatl word teolotl The hoot of an owl is an evil omen so one must be careful to stay away from owls In other parts of the Southwest owls are sometimes known as lechuzas A lechuza is a woman who has sold her soul to the devil and becomes an owl by night Only a woman can become a lechuzaA prayer meant to keep witches away was recited at night in a low

tortilla instead of a corn tortilla filled with meat rice frijoles beans and chile then folded and rolled up There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito and there may be some truth to all of them One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico tacos de frijoles or bean burritos were easy to carry in the saddlebags of the vaqueros cowboys so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaqueros horseTacos made from corn tortillas are much older they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries Once flour tortillas were discovered the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical Since corn tortillas are small and can only bend or fold over once and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times the flour taco was a natural outcome A burrito can be made with any type of filling such as beans potatoes chile con carne chile colorado carnitas chile with meat red chile roasted pork meat or even peanut butterFlour tortillas and burritos are found in northern Mexico and the Southwest but are not known in other parts of Mexico Since at least the s Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos Originally they were called tacos another story about the origin of the name is that in the s there was an establishment in Jurez Chihuahua Mexico called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina flour tortillas It became a wellknown place to go and people spoke of going a los burritos to the burritos when they wanted tacos of that kind Commercial burritos became available in San Francisco in  according to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle and now there are supposedly over  burrito taqueras taco restaurants in the Mission District of that city Burros is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos in which the tortilla may be a foot and a half to two feet in diameterSee also TacosReferences Griffith  Roemer
