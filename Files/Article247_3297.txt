                                 Is Eleanors Nanny State Really So Bad                        Dear Chris            I dont see how we can say that the good things ER was involved in egcivil rights would have happened just fine without her but she must take ahuge share of the blame for the invention of the nanny state Eleanor like alldogooders motivated by the perilous business of noblesse oblige might havehad her authoritarian leanings but the point is that FDR wasnt adictator and neither was Eleanor whowhatever she may have mused aloud atthe start of the New Dealnever got half the loaf she wanted            What she did get was a chance to rally and embolden the men and women insidethe New Deal who shared her belief that its benefits ought to extend toeveryone including negroes and to give some lasting symbolic weight to thecivil rights movement Symbolic weight isnt nothing in this case No one cansay how much it ultimately meant that ER had lunch on the patio of the WhiteHouse with Walter White of the NAACP but it meant something for thecountrys first hostess to say that there was no reason a black man shouldnteat with her in the White House as her equal If she hadnt broken that barwho would have Bess Mamie Pat Civil rights would always be a cause thatmoved by symbolic advances and the fact is that Eleanor took down more thanher fair share of bricks from the edifice of respectable racism And she didit as Cook makes clear in spite of her class and upbringing which she sawpast only with great difficulty            Cmon dont you love the scene from the Southern Conference on HumanWelfare Its Bull Connors Birmingham November  Connor has insistedthat the  delegates sit in segregated sections ER upon entering takesher place among the black delegates When the police ask her to move shestands and moves her chair to a spot between the two sectionswhere she plantsher chair every day for the remainder of the conference Whats a little aristodisingenuousness held up against such brave improvisation I know youregoing to tell me that the Southern Conference on Human Welfare was full ofcomsymps But so did Cook tell me that            Besides lets say I grant you that Eleanor is responsible in part for thenanny state I still cant grant you that this is a bad thing I know we dontwant to get lured into this old argument but still which part of the New Dealdid you hate Was it the SEC The NLRB Social Security Putting my grandfatherto work in the Civilian Conservation Corps I know I know or at least I thinkI know Were talking about a spectrum here in which some freedom istraded for some security and reasonable liberals like me and reasonableconservatives like you simply differ on where the appropriate balance isreached But where ER and FDR are concerned I think the burdens on aconservative to explain whether and why the New Deal should have halted shortof where it did            Finally you really lost me on that last curveabout Gingrichianbuckraking and rich old Eleanor inveighing against the greed of others Whyisnt it better to make a lot of money you give to charity than to make a lotof shady money you give to your NewtPAC Maybe ERs money made her modestlyhypocritical in preaching against the greed and privilege of others but itstrikes me as unfair to seize on this as a reason to disqualify her as havingdone any good  Its not that I have reasonable objections to what you didits the way you did it or who you were as you did it   Would it havebeen more virtuous of her to while away the Depression polishing the WhiteHouse china May only the poor object to the treatment of the poor            But Im very grateful to you for the word latifundium I had to look itup            CheersMarjorie
