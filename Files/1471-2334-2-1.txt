                    Background        Diabetes mellitus predisposes individuals to bacterial        and fungal infections including those caused by         Candida species Many investigators        have suggested that vulvovaginal candidiasis VVC occurs        more frequently in diabetics            Further        chronic recurring VVC may be a marker of diabetes            Several studies report increased rates of asymptomatic        vaginal carriage rates of         Candida species and incidence of        symptomatic infection in diabetic women but results are        inconsistent          While some show no        increase in carriage of vaginal         Candida     those demonstrating        increased         Candida carriage in female diabetes        patients do not examine the effect of glucose control or        diabetes type      However         in vitro studies demonstrating        impaired host response directed against         Candida in diabetics support the idea        of increased rates of         Candida colonization among diabetics              Whether diabetes leads to more symptomatic        andor more recurrent VVC episodes is a subject of        controversy        Potential risk factors for VVC include diabetes type        severity and degree of glucose control               In addition to diabetes mellitus a number of VVC risk        factors have been identified including AfricanAmerican        heritage       previous history of VVC            higher education degree intermediate age oral        contraceptive pills        use of commercially        available solutions for cleansing of external genitalia or        vaginal douching frequent sexual intercourse              sexual behavior age at first intercourse frequency of        oralgenital contact     contraception devices        diaphragm vaginal contraceptive sponge intrauterine        device and antibiotics       Whether these        factors increase risk of         Candida colonization or symptomatic        infection following colonization or both is unknown        however it should be emphasized that a prerequisite for        symptomatic vaginitis is vaginal colonization        Few studies have addressed the relationship between         Candida colonization VVC and        diabetes none we are aware of have examined the role of        behavioral VVC risk factors for colonization among persons        with diabetes To evaluate the relationship between         Candida colonization and hypothesized        risk factors for vulvovaginal candidiasis colonization in        diabetics we conducted a crosssectional study among        female diabetes patients receiving care at one of two        diabetes clinics We describe the associations between         Candida colonization        sociodemographics health behaviors diabetes type        diabetes severity and Hemoglobin A         c level among women with type  and        type  diabetes                    Methods                  Study population          Female diabetes patients seen at an outpatient          academic diabetes practice of Wayne State University          Division of Endocrinology Department of Internal          Medicine were eligible for study The practice included          an urban University Health Center Detroit MI clinic          and a suburban clinic Hechtman Clinic Bingham Farms          MI Patients were diagnosed with type  and type           diabetes on clinical presentation by a board certified          endocrinologist Potential participants were approached          in the clinic waiting room and consent obtained As an          incentive for participation subjects were rewarded with          video rental gift certificates value  Participants          consented to a medical record review which included          abstraction of total glycated hemoglobin levels obtained          at the enrollment visit completed a selfadministered          questionnaire and selfcollected a vaginal swab The          questionnaire addressed the following variables          sociodemographic age race marital status insurance          status highest education completed occupation          diabetes duration type severity and abnormal glucose          level lifetime history of physician diagnosed VVC          episodes recent antibiotic use by type sexual history          health behaviors For the diabetes section we used          questions from the Diabetes Care Profile an instrument          developed and validated by the Michigan Diabetes Research          and Training Center      The study protocol was          approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the          University of Michigan and Wayne State University          Of  women approached   consented One          woman was ineligible because her vaginal sample was lost          Two women decided to stop participating during the study          one did not understand the questionnaire while the other          felt the questionnaire was too intrusive leaving a final          sample size of  participants                          Laboratory methods          All vaginal specimens were cultured for yeast          Specimens were placed on plates with media selective for           Candida growth Sabourauds          dextrose agar Suspected mixed samples as determined by          colony type and microscopic characteristics were placed          on plates with media showing speciesspecific colony          color change Chromagar CHROMagar Paris France           C albicans and           C glabrata were identified by          chlamydospore and germ tube tests all other species were          identified by carbohydrate assimilation tests APIC          AUX                          Data analysis          We described the distributions of hypothesized          variables among participants using simple descriptive          statistics and the associations between hypothesized          risk factors and           Candida colonization using odds          ratios OR and Cornfield  confidence intervals CI          After a detailed stratified analysis to assess          confounding and effect modification we fit a logistic          regression model for           Candida carriage We calculated ORS          and  CIs for the bivariate analyses using EpiInfo              all other analyses and data management were done          using SAS     Several variables strongly associated          with           Candida colonization had small          numbers of missing values particularly for oral sex           and douching  others did not exceed  In          this case for the multivariate analyses we inferred          that a missing response was equivalent to a negative          response If we are wrong in this inference the          resulting estimates will be biased towards the null          hypothesis of no effect Excluding the missing responses          from the relevant analyses only modestly changed the          point estimates                            Results                  Demographic characteristics by clinic          Fiftynine participants

    C glabrata              C albicans predominated among          women with type   colonized or  and           C glabrata among women with Type            colonized or  We identified one isolate of

 CI   p   Table  Women with          abnormal HbA           c were almost three times more likely          to be colonized with           Candida than those with normal HBA           c  but this association was not          statistically significant OR    CI            p   No statistically significant association was          detected between           Candida colonization and duration

were not significantly associated with           Candida colonization Table           Antibiotic use in the past  weeks lifetime history of          chlamydia douching and report of both performing and          receiving oral sex in the last two weeks were strongly          associated with           Candida colonization whereas          vaginalpenile sex had only a modest and not          statistically significant assocation with           Candida colonization When          stratified by oral sex there was no association between          vaginal sex and colonization status However the effect          of oral sex remained after stratification by vaginal          sex                          Multivariate Analyses          To simultaneously adjust for variables independently          associated with           Candida colonization in the crude          analyses we fit a logistic regression model predicting           Candida carriage Table  Because          of the small sample size we created a base model          including age diabetes type abnormal HbA           c  recent antibiotic use and          performing oral sex We assumed for this analysis that          those who did not respond to questions about oral sex did          not engage in oral sex Receiving oral sex was not          associated after adjustment for performing oral sex OR              CI   p   and thus was          excluded from the base model Other variables associated          in the bivariate analyses were added one at a time to the          base model After adjustment older age having type           diabetes an abnormal HbA           c level and report of antibiotic use          during the previous  weeks were statistically          significantly associated with           Candida colonization Performing          oral sex was associated with an almost fivefold increase          in colonization but the association was not          statistically significant p   When added          individually to the base model lifetime history of          chlamydia OR    CI   but not          douching OR     CI   remained          strongly associated with colonization Four participants          positive for           Candida also had a previous          chlamydia diagnosis and reported douching When entered          simultaneously into the model the estimates were          unstable thus they were entered separately Douching          and history of chlamydia were also strongly associated          with performing oral sex adding each of these variables          reduced the parameter estimate and statistical          significance of the association with performing oral sex          Pregnancy history had no association with colonization          after adjustment OR    CI                             Discussion        Among women with diabetes         Candida carriage increased with older        age type  diabetes abnormal HbA         c level oral antibiotic use in the        previous two weeks and ever history of chlamydia Other        VVC risk factors including African American descent        lifetime history of VVC higher education oral        contraceptive use and frequency of vaginal intercourse        were not significantly associated with         Candida colonization after adjustment        for other variables These data suggest that behavioral        factors as well as HbA         c  are important determinants of         Candida colonization among women with        diabetes        Women with type  diabetes had higher         Candida colonization rates than those        with type  even after adjusting for age behavioral        factors and HbA         c  One possible explanation is        difference in duration of         Candida carriage women with type         and type  diabetes may be equally likely to acquire         Candida but those with type  may be        less able to clear it Similar to previous reports         C albicans was isolated from the        majority of colonized type  participants while         C glabrata was the most common        isolate in type  participants but our numbers are small            Whether this is due to diabetes type or reflects        different distributions of         Candida species by age or both is        uncertain        The observation that hyperglycemia in type  diabetes        increases risk for         Candida colonization is consistent        with previous reports        A New Zealand study of         women with type  diabetes found  of  women with        elevated glycated hemoglobin reported vaginal symptoms for        the previous year compared with  overall            Hyperglycemia limits neutrophil function among persons with        type  diabetes including neutrophils ability to        phagocytose and kill         Candida organisms With the oxidative        killing ability of neutrophils hindered diabetics may not        be able to clear pathogens as well as nondiabetics               Hyperglycemic individuals may also have increased        risk for         Candida colonization because their        secretions contain glucose which can serve as nutrients        for         Candida organisms Sobel and        colleagues reported a fucose deoxygalactose vaginal        epithelial cell receptor that aids in adhesion of         Candida to vaginal epithelial cells            Since fucose contains an isomer of glucose and acts        as one form of receptor site for         Candida adhesion it is possible that        increased         Candida colonization is proportional        to glucose level Receptor avidity may be a reflection of        increased glucose levels in the blood and tissues        Glycemia however does not fully explain the observed        increased risk of         Candida colonization        We found a borderline significant association with        performing oral sex associated with an almost fivefold        increase in vaginal colonization with         Candida Receiving but not performing        oral sex has been previously reported as a risk factor for        VVC     Oral sex may facilitate transmission of yeast        as         Candida often colonizes the oral        cavity      Diabetics may be more likely to carry        Candida in the oral cavity than their sex partner thus        performing oral sex on their sex partner prior to vaginal        intercourse may serve to inoculate the vaginal cavity        Douching has also been previously associated with         Candida colonization              The practice is hypothesized to disrupt vaginal flora        vaginal symptoms may also lead a women to douche so the        direction of effect is unclear The association we observed        with chlamydia is probably a marker of sexual behavior        rather than a causal factor for example women who        reported a history of chlamydia were more likely to douche        and to report engaging in oral sex although it is possible        that chlamydia carriage adversely affects the vaginal flora        increasing the chance of         Candida colonization Recent        antibiotic use is a welldescribed correlate of symptomatic                Candida vaginitis                 While asymptomatic infection is not equivalent to        disease antibiotic use may act to alter the vaginal        microenvironment to facilitate         Candida colonization in the same way        it is hypothesized to promote VVC        Women aged  years and older in our study were more        likely to be colonized with         Candida species We are unaware of        colonization studies in women of comparable age most have        emphasized women of childbearing age       Whether        our observation is a real finding or a reflection of our        age distribution  or unknown selection biases which        led to inclusion in our study requires further        investigation However incidence of symptomatic infection        is higher in younger  women            This study is small and was intended to be hypothesis        generating The study population is in no way        representative of all females with diabetes although the        age and racial distribution of participants reflected that        of the participating clinics Although it is possible that        women with a history of symptomatic infection might have        been more likely to participate we have no reason to        believe that women differentially participated by both        symptomatic history and other variables under study which        would have biased our results Further as women were        unaware of whether they carried         Candida at the time of completing the        questionnaire it seems unlikely that a differential recall        of behaviors among colonized and noncolonized might have        occurred A final concern is that         Candida colonization while the first        step toward VVC is not equivalent to symptomatic        infection Larger more definitive studies which include a        nondiabetic control group and prospective followup are        planned                    Conclusions        We found strong statistically significant associations        between vaginal         Candida colonization and antibiotic        use lifetime history of chlamydia diabetes type and HbA         c level and a borderline significant        association with performing oral sex More         nonalbicans species were observed        among women with type  diabetes Improving glucose control        and possibly modifying sexual behavior may reduce risk of         Candida colonization and potentially        symptomatic infection among women with diabetes
