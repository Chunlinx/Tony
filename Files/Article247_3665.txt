                                 Policy Corner Bush Ed            The reviews of George W Bushs proposal for educationreform unveiled three weeks ago in California have been largely favorableSoberminded columnists and education reformers have praised the plan whichhinges on taking federal money away from failing schools and giving it toparents to use elsewhere But the analysis has neglected one salient pointabout the Bush program It already exists in Texas And its a failure            Under Bushs proposal states would be required to testtheir disadvantaged students on academic basics every year If a schoolstest scores didnt improve after three consecutive years the federalgovernment would take away its contribution that comes under an aid programknown as Title  This federal money would then go to parents who could use itas a voucher to pay for a private school tutoring or another publicschoolfor whatever offers hope as Bush put it In announcing the plan heestimated that the Title chit would be worth about  per student            You can find the details of how something similaractually works in W country in a Sept  HoustonChronicle story by Melanie Markley and Kathy Walt Under a program thatBush has promoted but did not initiate Texas tests all its students andschools just as he envisions doing nationally Students have to take the TexasAssessment of Academic Skills TAAS On the basis of that test and a few otherfactors schools are rated in one of four categories lowperformingacceptable recognized or exemplary Only one school in the entirestateGoodrich Elementary School  miles outside Houstonhas been ratedlowperforming for three consecutive years What would happen to Goodrichunder the Bush plan This school which has  students gets only  inTitle  funds each year This means that parents would receive a voucher worthnot  per student but  That doesnt buy a lot of hope even inGoodrich Texas In fact there are no private schools in the vicinity whichmeans that there wouldnt even be anyone to turn down this sorryassed excusefor tuition            What about urban districts It so happens that Houstonhas a program that is both more generous and more stringent than Bushsproposal It says that students who fail the Texas test and who attend schoolsrated lowperforming by the state for just one year can receive a credit of to attend private school Its not exactly a voucher since the schooldistrict negotiates directly with private schools to place these students Thisyear students in the Houston Independent School District qualify to opt outof failing public schools under this program How many have taken advantage ofit Zero            The Chronicle story offersa couple of explanations for this For one thing the Houston school districtdidnt identify which students qualified for the program until August by whichtime it was too late to enroll elsewhere for this year But the bigger problemis that even  isnt enough to pay tuition at a private school in HoustonFour or five private schools did contact the school district to expressinterest in the program but all considered a payment of  too lowTuition at runofthemill private schools in Houston runs more like  forthe school year At elite academies it can be as much as  per yearSince the Chronicle story was published oneprivate school has agreed to accept  students Its a mostly AfricanAmericanreligious school which intends to create a separate secular facility for thepublicschool transfer students            If private schools in Houston wont accept a voucher its pretty clear that a  voucher wont produce any real choicefor parents And if theres no choice theres no competitive pressure onfailing public schools which is the chief justification for the program Tofind out whether vouchers can actually improve education Bush would have tooffer an additional incentive worth several times the federal governmentsTitle  spending currently around  billion But even the compassionate oneisnt prepared to run afoul of conservative dogma to the extent of proposingspending tens of billions of additional federal dollars on education            The Texas story points to another fatal flaw in Bushsproposal How is it that only one school in the whole state of Texas has beenrated lowperforming for three consecutive years Bush might have you believethat its because he has done so much to improve education in Texas In factits because the state standards are riddled with loopholes Schools can exemptstudents judged to have learning disabilities or who have limited Englishskills from taking the state test Schools do thisand the state permitsitto avoid punishment and embarrassment Its the bureaucratic equivalent ofsocial promotion How likely is it that states would set up stringent systemsof evaluation and accountability for the sake of having their federal educationfunding taken away Not very Bush is proposing that federal education dollarscome with strings attached But the people receiving the dollars get to pullthe strings            Theres a way around this problem set federaleducation standards Reading at a fourthgrade level should mean the same thingin Goodrich Texas that it does in Bismarck ND With a single standard youcould measure any school against any other school and truly assess theirprogress or failure against a common baseline Checker Finn and Diane Ravichtwo of Bushs education advisers have championed this idea in the past YetBushs plan steers entirely clear of national standards in favor of state onesThe implicit reason is once again that anything the federal government doesruns afoul of the conservative dogma which says that education is anexclusively local responsibility            More money and strict federal standards would makeBushs plan plausible and interesting Until his work improves he deserves aD
