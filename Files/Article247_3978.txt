                                 Was It Worth It                        Hello Fred            Im in a sudden panic realizing that this is the last installment and wehave a few hundred words to wrap up the argument and resolve the points lefthanging around So Ill do it Larry King style with varied points connectedwith ellipses thats the three dots in a row Larry              One perspective thats gotten no hearing in this discussion is theimmoral war viewthat the South Vietnamese regime was so corrupt or theNorth Vietnamese aims so admirably anticolonial that the effort to protectSouth Vietnam was wrong per se Thats because neither of us nor Lind is inthis camp But weve suggested that the scope of argument is narrower than Isuspect it still remains in the United States              What you Lind and I disagree about in various forms all has to do withmeans and proportion We agree that it would be better if South Vietnam had notbeen taken over by the Northand that it was better that ThailandMalaysia and others beat their insurgencies The question is whether the fightwas worth it at several crucial junctures when the United States gotmore seriously involved in  when it dramatically escalated in and when it began a prolonged withdrawal from  through the fall of Saigonin               Lind argues that the initial engagement was necessary  for thebandwagon reasons of the Cold War we have discussed previously I view it asunderstandable for those same reasonsbut ultimately unwise anddestructive for reasons that have been played out in US politics ever sinceAnd much as I hate using this word Nixons prolongation of the withdrawalseems to me well criminal OK sstyle hyperbole but you know what Imean Maybe criminally unwise Tens of thousands of Americans and hundredsof thousands of Vietnamese died during the extended separation Even assumingthere was some offsetting increase in US credibility in those years it couldnot have been worthwhile              You ask about the Korean optionlongterm partition enforced by UStroops That might have been conceivable in  or  when the balancebetween aims and costs was still more reasonable from the US perspective By everything about that balance had shifted For reasons Lind lays out veryclearly domestic politics had powerfully and predictably turned against such acostly war              You raise several times the claim that the South Vietnamese were in somesense winning by  Even assuming for purposes of argument that this istrue which I dispute but thats for another day by that time it wasbecoming irrelevant The cost had exceeded a level that any student of USpolitics thought this country would endure for such a symbolic struggle              Yes its odd that we should be struggling for the mantle of RonaldReagan But the balance of costs and goals is something he clearly understoodThe United States as Lind also points out is willing to pay financial costslike those of the Reagan defense spendup But we properly dislike sendingpeople to die for symbolic struggles when its not really necessaryand thatswhy My Ronnie got those Marines out of Lebanon I am sure someone made the casethat this had become a symbolic stand and he couldnt afford to look as if hewas running That didnt stop him              My starting point was that agree or disagree people should read MichaelLinds book I end on that point too But of course its not the only one toread Peter Scotts recent Lost Crusade  the memoir of a US soldierwho trained Cambodian mercenaries is the most affecting book of any sort Iveread in a long time It was by the way recommended to me by the novelistCharles McCarry whose book The Tears of Autumn stands with GrahamGreenes The Quiet American in conveying the climate of Americas firstinvolvement in Southeast Asia              Ive also just been reading Fredrik Logevalls Choosing War  a newacademic history that argues more or less the exact opposite of Linds caseFrom late  to early  Logevall claims the Johnson administration faceda deliberate choice about whether it should raise or lower the stakes inVietnam Make it an allout test of will which it became or look for anexcuse to leaveperhaps with the claim that the regime in the South had becometoo illbehaved to be worth further US support or lives Logevalls evidenceis beyond my ability to introduce here Ill simply say that if Lind provesthat the decision to go to war was understandable Logevall provides theargument for the minimal realist view that it was unnecessary and unwise Andas he says in the final pages of his book                           The certainty that this was an unnecessary war not merely in hindsight butin the context of that time also makes the astronomical costs that resultedfrom it during  that much more difficult to contemplate
