The beauty of automatic replenishment is that the buyer is really the customer She is telling us what she wants and needs in the future Quite frankly of all the buying we do letting our customer make the choice seems to make the most senseTom Cole Chairman and CEO Federated Logistics and OperationsOur goal is to replace the product on the retail shelf as quickly as possible because thats where the consumer buys itJeff Kernodle Vice President for Replenishment VF CorpMany of the popular accounts of quick response rapid replenishment and supplychain management assume that all partiesconsumers retailers and supplierswin as a result of these policies Consumers have definitely benefited because these practices afford them a greater choice of products at lower average prices It is safe to say that lean retailers have also come out ahead given their rapid growth in relation to and at the expense of traditional retailers in many different retail channels But have suppliers benefited from entering into relations with lean retailers Have such firms improved their competitive position along with the retailers they supplyThe short answer to these questions is It depends Although it is certainly true that a supplier gains from successful customers the degree to which such a company actually benefits has much to do with its internal manufacturing choices A supplier that has done little to change its internal practices may end up simply holding the bag of a retailers inventory Alternatively an adept supplier who uses information for planning production and distribution may well share in the competitive advantages derived from better information on the true state of final customer demandThis chapter examines the reasons that different suppliers win and lose reviewing many of the innovations we have discussed throughout Drawing on the HCTAR survey we first look at the way apparel suppliers adopt combinations of information and manufacturing practices in response to lean retailing We then show how supplier performance ranging from the degree of inventory risk to profitability is changed by their information technology investments and the sequence in which they are adopted The chapter concludes with a more general discussion of what suppliers in informationintegrated channels must do to succeedClusters of Supplier Practices One Innovation Is Not EnoughLean retailing allows department stores mass merchandisers and other retail outlets to capitalize on information allowing them to minimize their exposure to demand uncertainty Retail adoption of these strategies in turn means suppliers must invest in a basic set of technologies to provide the information links necessary for rapid replenishment These investments consist of the capacity to receive and transmit information electronicallythe minimum set of practices required for working with lean retailersIn addition apparel suppliers must invest in technology and capital improvements to package label route and move products rapidly from their production operations directly to the retailer Once again these capital expenditures represent a basic cost of doing business in a lean world As detailed in Chapter  our research indicates that the prevalence of information technologies advanced distribution and logistics operations along with the other related services apparel suppliers provide to retailers have grown dramatically since  particularly among business units that supply a large percentage of lean retailersLast but not least responding to lean retailing requirements ultimately necessitates much more sophisticated demand forecasting production planning and manufacturing strategies than the practices employed by traditional suppliers At one extreme a manufacturer can simply hold inventory for lean retailers and make few changes in its internal practices At the other end of the spectrum a manufacturer can alter its internal design planning procurement and manufacturing operations and respond rapidly to demand changes through the use of flexible manufacturing or sourcing practicesDetermining the degree to which a supplier benefits from its technological investments is the real issue Although there are no easy formulas it does appear that the specific combinations of information technology and assembly methods drawn on by the supplier make a difference in responding to lean retail requirements In order to study performance we must first examine how different manufacturing practices fit together for suppliers In this section we will discuss the interaction of four information and manufacturing practices related to apparel suppliers ability to provide products in a lean retailing world These key practices affect how apparel suppliers acquire and use information concerning demand at the SKU levelNote that the information and manufacturing practices examined here are not specific to the apparel industryin fact most were originally introduced in other sectorsbut are applicable to a wide variety of consumer product industries We focus on the retailapparel channel because HCTARs surveys provide extensive evidence for the ways in which apparel suppliers are changing Even if suppliers in other businesses will not make the specific operational changes of an apparelmaker an increasing number are establishing information links with other channel players and combining information use with technologies and work practices to speed up order processing For example textile firms that supply retailers directly with their own products may have to combine equivalent information technologies with manufacturing innovations in finishing lines that shorten production cycles in order to gain competitive advantage Much of what we have learned about the determinants of success for apparel suppliers can be applied to comparable situations faced by businesses in other retaildriven industriesKey Practice  Bar CodesThe adoption of the Uniform Product Code UPC provides unique optically scannable bar codes for identifying products at the SKU level The availability of a standardized system of classification gives companies the means to input store transmit and access information concerning demand inexpensively Use of the UPC bar code system has the potential for significantly decreasing transaction costs with customers Adopting bar codes of course requires a variety of technological investments by business unitsin bar code readers and writers hand scanners computer hardware and softwareand conventions such as those promulgated by the Uniform Product Council Even so use of bar codes has become the norm for apparelmakers and retailers to date few channel partners have failed to make this changeKey Practice  Electronic Data InterchangeThe second basic practice involves the use of electronic data interchange EDI as a means for transmitting data on orders between apparel suppliers and retailers Like bar codes the use of EDI requires a set of investments by suppliers and customers in computer technologies capable of sending and receiving data rapidly It also depends on conventions that standardize the system of data interchange including payment mechanisms While many channel players have adopted EDI it also represents an area of evolving practice the amount of information that can be transmitted between retailers and suppliers has grown at the same time that the costs of transmission have fallenKey Practice  Standard Labeling of Shipping ContainersMarking cartons and containers for shipment according to channelwide standards can speed up distribution Modern distribution centers are capable of rapidly identifying and sorting incoming shipments from all supplierswhether apparelmakers textile producers or grocery manufacturersthrough the use of scanning systems automated sorting and conveyer systems and computer controls At the same time these systems use the information on container labels to process and reconcile invoice information on incoming and outgoing shipments This means incoming shipments must adhere to a set of technological and process standards regarding the use of bar codes for labeling cartons in addition to other standards for packing labeling placement shipping and display of productsKey Practice  Modular AssemblyFinally apparel manufacturers can make innovations in the assembly stage through modular or teambased production Instead of breaking up sewing into a long series of small steps modular production entails grouping tasks and assigning them to a team to reduce the elapsed throughput time required for assembling a given product Adoption of this assembly technique involves altering the physical layout of sewing machines as well as human resource changes in training requirements compensation systems and methods of supervision As Chapter  stressed modular production need not be adopted for all assembly it makes most sense for products that require rapid replenishment where the capacity to engage in shortcycle production matters In particular retaining some shortcycle capacity may be advantageous for production of SKUs with higher levels of demand variation whether because of fashion content or uncommon sizethat is for garments that have unique design elements or are in a size few consumers wearCombining Key PracticesFirms responding to frequent purchaseorder requests from retailers benefit from combining these practices At the simplest level the benefits of adopting a uniform system of production identification are reinforced by the presence of EDI transmission of information which lowers the cost of moving data between channel partners Business units adopting both bar codes and EDI are therefore able to reduce the transaction costs for processing information about sales and ordersWhen bar codes and EDI are combined with advanced shipping practices the benefit of each practice is enhanced order processing occurs more rapidly accurately and with less paper The standardized shipping container markerwhich is possible only because of the existence of bar codes in the first placeprovides a scannable description of a carton that can be electronically associated with data files containing specific information on the individual products shipped to the retailer This information sent via EDI can then be used to check incoming orders against purchase orders and authorize payments to suppliers It can also rapidly identify discrepancies between invoices and actual shipments once again lowering the cost of the transaction for both partiesMeanwhile modular production allows apparel suppliers to reduce the time required for a given product to move through the assembly process For instance by substantially reducing workinprocess buffers in assembly throughput time on the modular lines of business units in the HCTAR sample dropped to just two days compared with nine days for standard assembly methods But the benefits of throughputtime reduction cannot be fully realized unless firms are rewarded for their ability to replenish rapidly Rapid replenishment in turn requires the availability of detailed demand data and its frequent and accurate transmission Finally suppliers must be capable of using this data to allocate production capacity between shortcycle modular and standard progressive bundle system production lines In this way modular assembly systems only yield real advantages in the presence of the other three practicesIn particular advanced practices in distribution and modular production interact with each other because they both reduce throughput time The time saved in production can be lost if the distribution method is slow or if there are other impediments to the movement of products from the apparelmaker to the retailer Alternatively distribution operations that efficiently process finished products reinforce the benefits of a teambased assembly system One extreme case illustrates the importance of fit between these performance elements A mens trousers manufacturer in the early s invested in modular production in some of its lines to reduce throughput times Yet it left its distribution practices unchanged The plant required that trucks be filled before making deliveries which often meant two weeks of production would build up In other words the savings created in throughput reduction in assembly were lost on the shipping dockWhat Clustering Looks Like in the Real WorldAccording to the HCTAR survey apparel suppliers do seem to invest in clusters of practices arising from the joint benefits of adoption Table  shows that combinations of practices increased quite dramatically between  and For example in  joint adoption of bar codes and EDI systems was uncommon Only  percent of business units had adopted both while  percent had adopted neither By  threequarters of the business units had implemented both bar codes and EDI technologies while only  percent had neither in place Similar patterns of increased adoption can be seen among other combinations of these practices in Table The mere fact that two practices have been adopted however does not tell the whole story The changing organization of the retail and apparel industries also suggests that there is a particular sequence for adopting the four key practices To begin with the adoption of bar codes came before rapid replenishment arrangements because retailers required a lowcost means of collecting information at the detailed product level for their own usethat is they first developed an efficient method for scanning prices at the checkout register and tracking products for internal inventory purposes Only after a common convention for bar codes had been established and in use for several years did retailers turn to such systems to transmit and receive data from suppliersIndeed the use of bar codes followed by implementation of EDI systems provides the basic foundation for subsequent investments in efficient logistics management in retail distribution centers Retailers do not get much out of investing in advanced distribution technologies such as shipping container markers if they lack a means for electronically identifying and using information concerning the contents of incoming shipments or of connecting that information back to suppliers for invoicing purposes And suppliers get little return out of providing customers with standardized shipping container markers if neither of these channel players has made previous investments in bar codes and EDIAs we detailed in Chapter  changing the method of production to reduce manufacturing throughput times also makes little sense if a business unit has not first invested in the necessary information links for carrying on rapid replenishment relationships From an apparel suppliers perspective the benefits of adopting shipping container markers and modular production are much higher once bar codes and EDI are in placeIn fact our analysis of the HCTAR data shows that the probability of adopting shipping container markers and modular production significantly increases if both bar codes and EDI have already been implemented The probability of adopting shipping container markers in  given that bar codes and EDI had been adopted in  was  percent compared with only  percent if bar codes and EDI were not both present Similarly the probability of adopting modular systems in  was  percent compared with  percent if bar codes and EDI were not both presentFrom Supplier Practice to Performance ResultsOnce these manufacturing and information practices have been adopted it should come as no surprise that they affect the performance of business units Based on our survey research we found that implementing a combination of the four key practicesbar codes EDI advanced shipping systems and modular assemblyincreases businessunit performance because these practices interact with and reinforce one another This is sometimes described as complementarities between practices The specific sequence of adoption should also affect performance outcomesTwo types of performance measures are of interest in this regard The first pertains to operational performance or the ability of a supplier to respond to lean retailing replenishment requirements Successful performance includes providing high levels of order completeness short lead times for new products and rapid response to requests for replenishment However operational performance measures do not necessarily provide a direct financial return to the supplier beyond allowing that firm to continue supplying a retailer with these service requirements A second set of outcomes relates to the financial performance of the business unit itself These include impacts on its revenues prices and sales cost structures and profitability Financial performance encompasses the impact of the suppliers manufacturing investments on its inventory levels which directly affects the business units costs and the degree of risk it bears from holding high finished goods or workinprocess inventoriesFrom the perspective of operational performance two business units with different degrees of investment in the four practices may do equally well in the short run But their financial performance as measured by inventory levels or profitability may differ substantially As we have emphasized in earlier chapters an apparel manufacturer that meets a lean retailers replenishment requirements while optimizing the level of inventories it holds per SKU will be exposed to less risk than one that meets retailer requirements by simply holding larger stocks of inventoriesRetail Replenishment PerformanceLean retailers now have much higher standards than they did in earlier years for the accuracy and timeliness of order fulfillment Our studies of business units with differing levels of the four practices indicate that firms with the complete set of practices achieve similar or slightly better performance in regard to the percentage of goods delivered complete and on time although these differences between business units are not very dramatic This is to be expected given the high penalties faced by suppliers for violation of these standards and the fact that retail standards may be met without extensive changes to internal apparel production practicesIn contrast more innovative business unitsthose that have adopted three or four of the key practicesare able to replenish products more rapidly than less innovative ones We have observed this in a number of different ways In  the mean response time for replenishing products that the supplier had agreed to provide on this basis was  weeks among those business units that had adopted none of the four practices But the average replenishment interval was only  weeks for those that had adopted all the key practices These performance differences persist even after controlling for other characteristics of business units such as size and product mix which might also be associated with replenishment speed and technology adoption The results are particularly striking given that only the most demanding lean retailers in  required replenishment within two weeks of order placementLead times provide another measure of supplier responsiveness Lead time is calculated as the number of days required for an apparel manufacturer to procure textiles manufacture and deliver a typical product in its collection The total time includes the number of days it takes a supplier to order and receive fabric make the marker cut the fabric sew the pieces press and package the product ship it to a distribution center and finally process it at the center The shorter the lead time the more quickly a firm is able to deliver products to retail customers Based on our  survey we estimated lead times for two different scenarios standard lead times that represent performance for a typical product in the suppliers selection and shortest lead times that indicate a suppliers best practice Both measures were for products manufactured domesticallyAs shown in Figure  those business units that invested in a more complete set of innovative practices had significantly shorter lead times for standard products The total elapsed standard lead time for business units with little innovation in practice averaged  calendar days compared with only  days for those that had invested in bar codes and EDI Even more striking lead time dropped to just  days among those units that had adopted all four practicesFigure  suggests that the most innovative firms are able to produce and deliver their products in less than half the time of the least innovative apparel suppliers Of course other firm characteristics such as businessunit size or product type might also be correlated with adoption of innovative practices and performance outcomes Even after we control for these factors using multiple regression techniques the number of innovative practices adopted by business units have a statistically significant positive effect on lead timeInventory PerformanceThroughout we have argued that reducing the substantial risk presented by inventory particularly in the presence of everincreasing product proliferation is essential for improving a manufacturers performance in integrated retailappareltextile channels That means inventory performance measures are crucial to determining the impact of information technology and flexible manufacturing In this case we draw on a unique matched data set that combines the HCTAR sample results with detailed microdata collected by the US Department of CommerceSpecifically we matched data from the HCTAR survey to corresponding establishmentlevel data from the Department of Commerces Longitudinal Research Database LRD The LRD provides longitudinal data for establishments included in the Bureau of the Census Annual Survey of Manufacturing To understand the relationship between technology adoption and inventory levels we matched survey data on adoption decisions in  with inventory observations for the  period and adoption decisions in  with inventory observations for the  periodOne common way of measuring inventory is to calculate the IS ratiothat is the ratio of total finished good inventories to total sales This measure allows one to compare inventories in firms with different sales volumes We calculated the IS ratio for suppliers in our matched sample and then compared those with the ratios of suppliers that used different combinations of the four manufacturing practices Figure  illustrates the impact of manufacturing practices on average inventory levelsThe average IS ratio fell considerably as business units adopted more of the four key technologies during both time periods under study In the  period firms that adopted none of the four technologies had an average IS ratio of  while those that implemented bar codes EDI and either advanced shipping container markers or modular assemblyor bothhad an average IS ratio of only  What is more these differences between low and highlevel adopters grew dramatically by the  period in which the lowtechnology firms had more than twice the inventorysales ratio compared with just  for the highlevel adoptersA reduction in the IS ratio means that changes in sales will be matched by smaller changes in inventories Therefore a lower IS ratio implies lower inventory volatility or variation This in turn suggests that firms with more of the key technologies in place will have total inventories that are less volatile One method of capturing volatility is to look at the standard deviation of each establishments inventory level and IS ratio for the two time periods Based on this measure inventory volatility did not decrease with more technology adoption between  and  However by the  period firms with all four technologies had lower standard deviations in total inventories compared with less technically innovative onesThis impact on volatility is even more striking when examining variation in IS ratios for the  period see Figure  Standard deviations in the IS ratio of business units with low levels of adoption were  compared with only  for the suppliers that had implemented all the manufacturing practices by  Note that the IS standard deviations control for differences in firm size And these results remain even after controlling for other factors such as product diversity that may be related to both inventories and the adoption of modern manufacturing practices by suppliersAdopting more of these practices also decreases the growth of inventory levels Figure  shows the comparative growth rates in inventories from  to  for business units with low medium and high technology levels Adjusting for inflation and other factors that affect inventory growth we found that establishments with low levels of technology adoption in  experienced far higher annual growth rates in total inventories and IS ratios than those with a more complete set of innovative practices This confirms the fact that apparel suppliers investing in both information technology and shortcycle production capacity can move to lower inventory levels more quicklyThe implications of these findings are significant A supplier attempting to meet the rigorous standards of a lean retailerwhether a shirt manufacturer for WalMart a pastamaker for Ralphs Food or an electronic drill supplier for Home Depotmust hold a far larger amount of inventory if it has not invested in a comprehensive set of information technology and shortcycle production capacity As the next section demonstrates holding larger inventories to service lean retailing demand translates into diminished profitabilityImpact on ProfitabilityImagine two mens dressshirt suppliers One still operates traditionally except for the implementation of basic information links to receive orders from lean retailers The other maintains extensive information systems which allow it to send receive and process information on retail demand orders and shipments advanced information technology also helps it plan manufacturing capacity so that the firm can engage in shortcycle production Although the first shirt supplier can respond to retailers weekly orders in a timely manner its costs for doing so are high both in terms of the internal expense of transacting frequent orders and its increased exposure to the risk posed by holding inventory It costs the second supplier less however to transact weekly business with retailers because of the electronic systems it has in place In addition its capacity to use information on the state of demand allows it to set inventory levels on a SKU basis that balances the benefits of having a product available against the costs of holding workinprocess and finished goods inventoriesAs a result of these differences we expect that the second dressshirt suppliers financial performance will be decidedly better than that of the first over the long run Our survey evidence confirms this expectation Consider the frequency with which suppliers reduce the price of their product for retailers during the selling season Apparel suppliers in our survey that had adopted all four of the key information and manufacturing practices reported fewer price markdowns by retailers than those with few or none of the practices Therefore retailers that work with suppliers employing a more complete set of information distribution and manufacturing innovations need not eliminate as many of their unsold products at the end of season via price reductionsManufacturing markdowns to retailers provide more direct evidence of the benefits of these innovative practices Those business units that had adopted all the practices reported an average discount provided to retail customers of just  percent compared with an average discount of  percent among suppliers that had implemented none of them Although these differences cannot all be directly attributed to the adoption of the practices per se they do suggestespecially when combined with the significant inventory performance results reported previouslyhow important it is for manufacturers to be adept at using incoming information from lean retailing customersThe real question then is how do these factors together affect the bottom line And do business units with the more complete set of innovative technologies have higher profitability Here the answer is a definite yes Profitability is measured as operating profit marginrevenue minus costs of goods sold divided by revenue Figure  shows our basic results in regard to average profit margin for different levels of technology adoption Business units that did not adopt any of the four key practices earned the lowest profit margins about  percent in  The most innovative firms were approximately four times as profitable achieving average profit margins of  percentEven after controlling for the independent effects of firm size product mix and distribution channel on performance we found that the most innovative firms were significantly more profitable than those that had adopted fewer of the key practices In our sample adding shippingcontainer markers to established bar code and EDI practices increased operating profits by  percentthat is from about  percent in average profit margins to  percent adding some modular assembly capacity to these three practices increased operating profits by about the same amountSince HCTARs  survey informal case evidence suggests that these disparities in operating and financial performance have only grown larger as lean retailing continues to sweep across distribution channels The least innovative apparel suppliers are seeing their chances for survival dwindle every year In contrast suppliers that have continued to innovate and expand their use of the four practices as well as other activities described in previous chapters keep outperforming the industry as a wholeManagement Practice The Final Ingredient in Enhanced PerformanceThe upshot of all this is that manufacturers need not hold the bag for lean retailers if they adopt a set of technologies and practices that allow them to collect and process demand information incorporate it into planning and use traditional and shortcycle production strategically Simply doing business with lean retailers in no way confers competitive success In fact a supplier that attempts to provide rapid replenishment without any other innovations may end up performing poorly from the perspective of its retail customers More important it will sustain higher costs in inventories face a greater need to mark down the prices of its products and therefore earn a lower profit margin than those establishments that have invested in comprehensive changesOf course becoming an advanced manufacturer is not just a matter of buying more information technologies or setting up a shortcycle assembly line The essential force behind the performance impact of these practices is their effective integration with one another Integration does not arise from hardware or software purchases It comes from successful managementWe have already described some specific ways that managers can think about integration of new information technologies and manufacturing practices Chapter  presented two production planning cases The first indicated how managers must assess a product line according to the variance in demand for particular SKUs in setting inventory policies The second case developed how suppliers must use this new perspective on demand to plan production or sourcing strategies Both cases illustrate the necessity of creating managerial practices that explicitly link the data arising from information technology with changes in manufacturing practices to take full advantage of these innovationsA contemporary apparelmaker handling on average  SKUs in its collection faces the challenge of replenishing weekly numerous retail customers at high satisfaction levels with a constantly shifting subset of its goods Managers of such a firm must do so by drawing on information from the past weeks sales as well as explicitly factoring in the impact of uncertainty They need realtime information regarding what goods their plants have in finished workinprocess and material inventories They must know the leadtime requirements for procuring textile products and establish relationships with at least some textile suppliers that allow the apparelmaker to procure fabric in smaller quantities and with shorter lead times This supplier must draw on production lines and sourcing arrangements that provide it with a range of response times from shortcycle production capacity for products with high demand variability to lines or sourcing arrangements that create larger production runs at lower costs for items with low demand variability But most important it must have a managerial system capable of coordinating these elements on an ongoing basisBased on our observations of apparel suppliers coming up with the money for new technologies and practices seems to be less of an impediment than altering basic management conceptions about using these technologies for planning and production Many of the business units in our sample have adopted specific practices without changing their approach to using them together to compete in an integrated channel They continue to draw on traditional conceptions of planning production and sourcingin other words they still think in terms of large orders of their products placed months before delivery is expected Needless to say these business units have not fully benefited from the investments they have madeSuppliers in most consumer industries now face lean retailing pressures or its equivalent Many are taking steps to adapt to the changed requirements placed on them One example is the restructuring beginning to appear in automobile distribution Traditional auto retailing focuses on selling product lines in production quantities that were largely determined in advance of distribution The system therefore placed tremendous pressure on auto dealers to sell the enormous finished goods inventory found in a car lot In contrast to this traditional retailing model BMW announced in  an effort to restructure its US dealers by allowing consumer customization of car purchases through the use of multimedia computer systems By allowing customers to design their own cars BMW dealers hope to reduce their finished goods inventoriesNote that this system poses production questions for BMW similar to those faced by apparel suppliers The company will need to decide which auto SKU or subassemblies to produce using traditional assembly techniques and which to produce with shortcycle production methods BMW will also need to combine information technologies planning and forecasting methods and production techniques to implement such strategies Similar pressure to innovate automobile distribution and production is also increasing because of the emergence of new retailers like Car Max Auto Superstores and the United Auto Group which operate under principles more akin to lean retailingTwo examples from the computer industry further illustrate supplier approaches that integrate information technology and manufacturing decisions In the early s facing product proliferation and replenishment requirements for its laserjet printing products Hewlett Packard redesigned its manufacturing process for printers It did so by separating those subassembly processes that were standard across products from those that were distinctive to specific laserjet products By using incoming demand information in concert with this subassembly and assembly redesign Hewlett Packard can now assemble different products with shorter lead times in response to actual information concerning demand at the same time it continues to take advantage of scale efficiencies in production The resulting inventory and production policies allow Hewlett Packard to balance the costs of stockouts with those of unsold inventoriesIn  Compaq Computer the worlds largest producer of personal computers announced a plan to change relations with its distributors Compaqs main competitors Dell Computer and Gateway  sell directly to consumers through mailorder and Internet operations In contrast Compaq sells its products through computer dealers Technological advances and rapid diffusion of older technologies make personal computers extremely perishablemuch like apparel with a fashion contentand subject to almost constant price markdown pressure Because Compaq like other personal computer manufacturers provides its distributors price guarantees on purchased inventories ie it reimburses the distributor if it must mark down prices in response to falling memory or other costs its inventory carrying costs are significantRather than continuing to increase inventory Compaq announced that it would only assemble its new line of personal computers as its retail customers ordered them And instead of providing an openended guarantee on prices to its distributors the company would guarantee the price for only two weeks after purchase by the distributor refusing to take back computers unless they malfunctioned By changing its method of distributing products Compaq hopes to reduce the level of dealer inventory across product lines to two weeks worth and in the process save  billion or more a year These cost savings will be used to reduce prices and compete more aggressively with Dell and Gateway  that do not work through distributors Therefore Compaqs competitive strategy arises from its efforts to advance informationintegration forward in the channels in which it operates Note also that if Compaq seeks to take full advantage of these changes in distribution it must also adjust its production strategies to account for differences in demand variability across the computer makers product linesIn fact companies in myriad sectors are grappling with the same managerial challenges and opportunities of those in the American apparel and textile industries Rethinking how to service stringent retail replenishment requirements for ever broadening product lines in more selling seasons has become a central business challengeThe implications of these changes do not end here An economy consisting of lean retailing and corresponding lean suppliers operates in a fundamentally different manner from one based on traditional retailing and supply practices The industrial transformation currently in progress encompasses international trade issues competitiveness labor regulation and macroeconomic policies Accordingly the last chapter of this book is devoted to our reflections on the impact of channel integration on certain public policy issues
