                                  Dont Blame It on Rio  or Brasilia Either            Back in the s a friendsent me a postcard showing the famous statue of Jesus that overlooks Rio deJaneiro Underneath the outstretched arms he had written a caption The debtis this big and only God can repay it He was wrong Brazil eventuallyworked its way out of the debt crisis and even became a favorite of foreigninvestors As late as last summer things still seemed to be going pretty wellAnd then the bottom fell out            The economic history ofBrazil is one of punctured enthusiasmsof brief episodes of hope followed bybitter disappointment From the Amazonian rubber boom to the Brazilianmiracle of the s the country has repeatedly seemed on the verge of aneconomic takeoff only to slide back again into stagnation Or as an old localjoke has it Brazil is the country of the futureand always will be            But what has happened to Brazil over the last six months isperhaps the saddest story of all because this time the punishment seems sounjustified Back in September when the backwash from Russias crisis forcedBrazil to raise interest rates to almost  percent one Brazilian lamented thesituation Brazil has never had such a responsible government the environmentfor business has never been so good why is this happening to us Goodquestion            For the fact is that thistime Brazil has tried very hard to play by the rules Five years ago itintroduced a new currency the real and promised to avoid the inflationaryexcesses of the past Thus far it has delivered with prices basically stableover the past year Like other Latin America countries Brazil also moved tofree up its markets privatizing inefficient companies eliminating importquotas lowering tariffs and so on While the process of reform has by nomeans been completed the progress is real and substantial            Then came Russia What does Brazil have to do with RussiaWell to a certain extent both were attracting money from the samepeoplespecifically hedge funds that were borrowing in dollars or yen andinvesting in higherinterest real or ruble bonds When these funds lost moneyin Russia some lenders became nervous and demanded their money backwhichmeant the funds had to sell off assets which meant pulling money out ofBrazil But the main reason for contagion from Russia to Brazil waspsychological Seeing Russia default on its debt raised fears that Brazilwhich also has large budget deficits might be risky too And so capital beganfleeing the country Initially Brazil tried to support the value of the real byselling dollars at the official exchange rate but as its reserves of dollarsdeclined it supplemented this strategy by raising interest rates to punitivelevels in order to persuade people to keep their money in Brazil Of coursethese high interest rates also made a recession inevitable            Now you might say thatthis only shows that countries should not run big budget deficits that Brazilneeded to get its government accounts under control to restore marketconfidence And that has indeed been the thrust of the governments policyagreed upon with the International Monetary Fund But there is something a bitfunny about Brazils deficit if you look at it at all closely You see Brazilis actually running a substantial primary surplusthat is if you do notcount the interest on outstanding debt tax receipts are larger than spendingThe primary surplus would be even larger than it is if the economy were notdepressed depressing tax receipts too            So the problem must be all that debt Brazil ran up in yearspast right Well not exactly It turns out that Brazil isnt particularlydeep in debt by the usual measures The government debt is less than half theannual GDP no worse than the ratio for the United States and better than thatof most European countries What makes Brazils deficit so large is not thesize of its debt but the very high interest rates it must pay on thatdebtinterest rates that are high because of a lack of investor confidenceAnd why do investors lack confidence Because of those big deficits            In case you somehowmissed the absurdity of the situation let me say it again Investors lackconfidence in Brazil because it has a large budget deficit which is the resultof high interest rates and a depressed economy which are the result ofinvestors lack of confidence Its completely circular If markets werewilling to give the country the benefit of the doubtif say they werewilling to hold Brazilian debt at a real interest rate only twice as high asthat on US bondsBrazils budget deficit would not look scary at all            So whats the answer Conventional wisdom embodied in theIMF program that Brazil embarked on last fall was that the way to break thevicious circle was for Brazil to demonstrate its resolve And the way to dothat was to make that primary surplus even larger and defend the value of thecurrency at all costswhich meant keeping interest rates high This wassupposed to convince the market that all was well so eventually interest ratescould come down The trouble was that all that austerity was a hard sellpoliticallyespecially because the economy was going into a nasty recessionthanks to those high interest rates I dont think you can blame Brazilianpoliticians How well would our own Congress perform if told that taxes must beraised and spending slashed in the midst of a recession with no clear rewardexcept a possible reduction in speculative pressure maybe sometime in thefuture            What were thealternatives Some peoplenotably Harvards Jeffrey Sachssaid Brazil shouldsimply let the real fall without raising interest rates maybe even cuttingthem Otherssuch as meworried this would lead to such a massive devaluationthat inflation would surge and argued in the wilderness for temporarycontrols on capital flight            Which brings us to the story of the latest crisis The IMFprogram fell apart predictably though earlier than most people expectedStill on the Friday in January when the real was floated things didnt looktoo bad The currency didnt fall as much as some feared and the stock marketsoared It looked in other words as if Jeff Sachs had been right Then overthe weekend Washington officials convinced Brazil to raise interest ratesWhen the interest rate increase was announced panic set in and the currencyplunged Instead of helping in other words the interest rate increaseapparently simply reinforced the vicious circle            Maybe it is still possible to push the resetbuttonto rewind the tape to midJanuary and recapture that initial optimismAfter firing two central bank heads in close succession Brazil appointed anaide to George Sorosan interesting move particularly given the market actionover the preceding couple of days For more on the recent turmoil click And perhaps the new man can somehow say the magic words find the formula thatwill turn selffulfilling pessimism into selffulfilling optimism But win orlose the story is let us say not exactly a wonderful advertisement foreither the competence of the IMF or the virtues of the New World Order
