as Let Si Get Thiswas it bears no relation to my experiences at the company over the past yearEither those of us who work at the West Coast outposts arent in on the perksor your research was a tad outofdate             Victoria von BielBonApptit magazineLos Angeles                           NegativeAction                        In BlacksOnly Jacob Weisberg appears to be all over the map On the one hand hecorrectly diagnoses the central problem with affirmative action which is thatit causes one group of people blacks to be favored at the expense of anothergroup whites Yet at the same time that he admits this is unfair he proposesthat we retain it            How to justify then thefact that a white person who has never practiced discrimination and who neverhad anything to do with the subjugation of blacks should be placed at adisadvantage in relation to lessqualified blacks Why should whites who didnot themselves discriminate against blacks be punished for what their orsomeone elses ancestors did The answer is that it shouldnt be thought of aspunishment            This isOrwellian logic at its best it is reminiscent of communist propaganda at itsworst Despite the fact that on its face it is punishment we shouldnt thinkof it that way Excuse me Perhaps extending Weisbergs philosophy a bitfurther we should simply declare that there is perfect equality between blacksand whites in society even though there isnt Why should we ignore the factthat there is inequality between races in society The answer is that it shouldnot be thought of as inequality Seems to work for me

publics socalled irrationality But theres no need for woolly notions ofregret to explain why someone would rather have  million than a shot at million but would rather have a shot at  million than a slightly better shotat  million            Its very simple reallymillion isnt worth five times as much as  million If I receive  millionIm rich If I receive  million Im rich So the first choice should be readas being between the certainty of being rich and a possibility of being richThe second choice is a simple mathematical choiceas Landsburg points out is a lot more welcome than             Im surethat if you asked the same questions but divided all the amounts by a millionyour answers would be very different             Felix Salmon NewYork City                           StevenE Landsburg responds I am deluged with email from readers whowant help understanding my column Take This Simple Test In the course ofresponding Ive found a much better way to explain the paradox            In theoriginal column your cousins Snip Snap and Snurr asked you to choose amongvarious gifts Lets put those questions aside Instead here are three simplerquestions                           A Imgoing to give you a Christmas gift Do you prefer                         A duck             A goose                           BTheres an percent chance I wont give you anything for Christmas Theresan percent chance Ill give you a choice of gifts If I give you a choice ofgifts do you prefer                         A duck             A goose                           CTheres an percent chance Ill give you a duck for Christmas Theres anpercent chance Ill give you a choice of gifts If I give you a choice ofgifts do you prefer                         A duck             Agoose            I define a rational personto be a person who gives the same answer to all three questions Some rationalpeople prefer ducks to geese some prefer geese to ducks but no rationalperson switches answers in going from one question to the next            Now replace a duck with million and replace a goose with a  shot at  million ThenQuestions A B and C are identical to the questions of Snurr Snap and Snipin that order So a rational person should give the same answers to thequestions of Snurr Snap and Snip            To see that these questionsare exactly the same as the SnipSnapSnurr questions keep in mind that anpercent chance of a  shot at  million is the same thing as apercent chance at  million            Noticethat contrary to the expectations of several readers none of this hasanything to do with the fact that  million is worth less than  times million replace the  million with any other amount whatsoever and theargument still holds                           Harry andLouise Practice PostStructuralism                        One glaring weakness ofdeconstruction a method of literary criticism long favored by the academicivorytower elite is that it often searches for meaning in a comparison wherein reality there is none However useful in the rarefied halls of academia itis conspicuously ineffective in the real world Robert Shrums comparison ofthe Harry and Louise ad campaign with that being conducted by the GlobalClimate Information Project Harry and Louise Go to Kyoto is no more than an interestingacademic exercise and a cynical misrepresentation of both the facts of theglobalclimate debate and the membership of the National Association ofManufacturers            It is wrong to characterizethe UN Map ad campaign as a use of populism by big business The adcampaign is simply one way in which we are attempting to educate the public onthe effects a treaty in Kyoto would have on the  million people who makethings in America Furthermore the overwhelming majority of NAM members aresmall manufacturers To lump these small companies many of which arefamilyowned businesses with fewer than  employees in with the artificialmoniker of big business itself a populist tool of the left is a disserviceto the men and women whose efforts form the backbone of onequarter of oureconomy These small manufacturers would by the very nature of their sizefeel the devastating impact that mandated carbonbased emission reductionswould have on the US economy to a greater degree than any other group            TheAFLCIO and NAM are united in opposition to a treaty mandating emissionreductions because such a treaty would take a bite out of the budget of everyAmerican family in the form of among other things higher costs at the gaspump more expensive home heating and lost jobs The United States cannot seeits competitiveness and prosperity erode for the benefit of developing nationsthat for whatever reason will not be required to abide by the strictimpositions of a globalclimate treaty That is a fact that bears repeatingover and over until reason wins out over the scare tactics being employed byenvironmental extremists and political consultants in the furtherance oftheir own agendas             PaulHuard National Association of Manufacturers                           Address your email tothe editors to lettersslatecom Please include your address
