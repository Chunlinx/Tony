                                 George W Bush War Patsy                        Dear Mim            Good morning again This time its coffee and two cigarettes Ive beenwriting all night on some kind of destructured Burroughs roll out of which Ihave yet to make sense so I guess this serves as a return to comparativesanity            I promised that Id explain why so much money is being heaped on George WBush to make him president and here goes If the predictions dont actuallypan out and I actually pray they dont its also a classic example of how tobuild a high conspiracy theory from the ground up The trick is to combinetotally separate news stories as factors in the same scenario and take it fromthere In this case the first clue was provided by Paul Beaver of JanesDefense Weekly reporting on the massive proliferation of a class of cheappostScud surfacetosurface missiles with limited range that are ideal forwars between adjacent countries such as India and Pakistan North and SouthKorea and most of the Middle East The missiles are designed to deliverconventional weapons but can be easily adapted to carry a payload of anthraxor a small dirty atomic bomb The matching piece of the puzzle was served upon CNNs Worldview  The Middle East is seemingly about to hit acatastrophic water crisis Rainfall in Syria Jordan Israel Iraq and SouthLebanon is down a frightening  percent the Sea of Galilee is at adangerously low level and the River Jordan could be a trickle by the end ofthe year            All peaceful solutions would require immediate cooperation by the nationsinvolved but I doubt we should hold our breath on that The alternative isdrought famine and ultimately war over the entire area What better USpresident to have in power during this unfolding scenario than a completelymalleable nonentity totally in the pocket of corporate oil The true face ofthe alliterative compassionate conservatism This may sound a little wild butwhat other reason is there for heaping so much funding on a selfadmittedboozer and cokehead whose road to Damascus was provided at age  by BillyGraham After the entire area has decimated itself some compliant commander inchief has to be in place to send in the troops to secure the oil if its nottoo radioactive            Any thoughts on Pokmon Ive been sifting through the reports of all thelawsuits against Nintendo claiming that collecting the Pokmon trading cardswith their builtin scarcity factor is a form of insidious infant gambling Isympathize with the family whose kid blew a thousand dollars on the cards Ialways sympathize with the irredeemably stupid I wonder however having nowwatched the show that it may be its impenetrable Japaneseness is what reallyscares parents Lets not forget that the zombieteens on the current Gaptelevision commercials were raised on Power Rangers Whither the Pokmontots            I was also going to mention David Bowie and the new California licenseplates that carry a picture of Ronald Reagan in a cowboy hat but I fear Iverun out of space and will have to save these gems for later            LoveMick
