                    Background        Mounting concerns about drugresistant pathogenic        bacteria      have rekindled interest in alternative        treatments of bacterial infections Prominent among these        alternatives is phage therapy the use of bacteriophages to        kill or otherwise control the bacterial populations in        infected hosts The use of bacteriophage for the treatment        of bacterial infections is an old idea    that not only        caught the imagination of at least one novelist    it        was practiced with sporadic successes worldwide in the        s and s However following the development of        antibiotics in the s the use of phages to treat and        prevent infections disappeared from socalled Western        Medicine but it did survive in the former Soviet Union A        rekindled interest in phage therapy over the past decade        has inspired historical reviews increased our awareness of        a substantial body of phage therapy work from Eastern        Europe       resulted in the Wests discovery of        the Eliava Institute a onetime vast and thriving phage        therapy research and production facility in Tiblisi        Georgia     and motivated the formation of companies        developing phage therapy Biophage Inc of Montreal        Canada Exponential Biotherapies Inc of Port Washington        NY Intralytix of Baltimore MD In recent years this        renewed interest in phage therapy has been displayed in        articles in the popular press eg Kuchment         Superbug Killers News Week Dec    and of        course reviews and discussions on the internet        httpwwwphageorg        httpwwwevergreeneduuserTPhageTherapyPhagetheahtml        Renewed interest in phage therapy is also evident from        recent empirical studies of phage therapy                and theoretical excursions into the population        dynamics of phage therapy      This rebirth has also        revived attention to earlier experimental work on phage        therapy and prophylaxis including several impressive        studies using phage to treat and prevent bacterial        infections in mice calves piglets and lambs by H        Williams Smith MB Huggins and their colleagues                     The earliest of the Smith and Huggins studies    is        especially instructive in this light Using experimental        lethal infections of an         E coli KH into the mouse        thigh it showed i phage were at least as effective as        antibiotics in preventing mouse mortality ii not all        phages were equally useful rather those that required the        K antigen for infection were superior to phages not        requiring K iii survival declined with a delay in        treatment even though the treatment was applied well        before untreated mice had overt symptoms of the infection        Perhaps most importantly Smith and Huggins    also        provided information about the dynamics of phage treatment         the changes in bacterial and phage densities over the        course of the infection Ultimately the efficacy of        antibacterial therapy has to be measured by the rate at        which it eliminates the symptoms of the infection        Microbiological data on the course of infections with and        without treatment  the population dynamics of the        treatment process  provide a means to understand how        treatment operates and allows one to compare modify and        improve therapeutic protocols        The present study is offered in the spirit of continuing        the precedent set by Smith and Huggins for analyzing the        population dynamics of phage and antibiotic therapy We use        their infection model to develop and illustrate the use of        two quantitative methods that facilitate understanding        comparing and developing methods of antibacterial therapy        and protocols for their application One method provides a        facile measure of efficacy of treatment that is independent        of the clinical outcome of infection and can be applied on        a tissue and timespecific basis for any form of treatment        to which bacteria can acquire resistance The other method        is a simple procedure to assay phage growth rate in vitro        that can be used to screen phages to evaluate their        potential for therapy                    Results                  Smith and Huggins results are repeatable          We repeated the experiments of H William Smith and          MN Huggins     Despite the fact that we used          different sources of mice           E coli KH bacteria and          phages our treatment and mortality rate results were          similar to theirs both qualitatively and quantitatively          Fig           a All  untreatedcontrol mice died within  hours          of inoculation with CAB All  mice survived when          treated immediately with LH the phage requiring the          bacterial K antigen for adsorption or when treated          immediately with a single dose of  ggm streptomycin          In contrast only  of the  mice survived when treated          immediately with LW the phage that was not specific for          the Kcapsule These results closely match those of          Smith and Huggins     except that they did not          report experiments of immediate treatment with          streptomycin or other antibiotic          b Even though mice with untreated infections          normally survived at least  hours delaying treatment          for only  hours significantly reduced the rate of          survival of mice treated with a single dose of  gm          and of  gm streptomycin The survival rate of these          streptomycintreated mice however significantly          exceeded that of the controls and that which Smith and          Huggins    obtained with a single dose of  gm          streptomycin The survival of mice treated with LH was          slightly reduced with delayed treatment  of the           mice treated at  hours survived versus  out of           with immediate treatment a difference that is not          statistically significant In the Smith and Huggins          study the decline in survival at  hours was significant          for the combined samples of  isolates of Kspecific          phages but not for their most efficacious phage We did          not conduct delayed treatment experiments with LW or          with multiple doses of streptomycin                          The Resistance Competition Assay RCA                      Derivation            The principle of this method is that when a mixture            of resistant and sensitive cells is treated the            relative frequency of bacteria resistant to treatment            will increase at a rate according to efficacy of the            treatment That is resistant cells increase relative            to sensitive cells by the amount that treatment kills            or inhibits sensitive bacteria The derivation of our            measure of this efficacy of treatment             RCA  follows from standard            population genetics models of selection between two            haploid genotypes that different in their relative            fitness     Following convention we use            italicised             RCA for the parameter value or            estimate and normal font RCA for the assay procedure            In this perspective sensitive and resistant bacteria            are the two competing genotypes The RCA estimates the            relative fitness advantage or disadvantage of the            resistant bacteria over sensitive bacteria In            situations where one has the luxury of many sampling            points an             RCA can be calculated from the            slope of the natural log of the ratio of the densities            of ResistantSensitive as a function of time                In situations where only two points are feasible the            initial frequency of resistant bacteria in the inoculum                         p               and the frequency of resistant            bacteria at time t              p                           t               an             RCA can be calculated from                        RCA  ln              p                           t                           p                           p                           p                           t              t             for the derivation see Crow and Kimura                           The value of             RCA is the selection coefficient            of resistant cells in the vernacular of population            genetics If             RCA   then the resistant            cells have an advantage if             RCA   the resistant cells            are at a selective disadvantage             RCA operates on an exponential            scale            p             t p             t   e t             RCA p              p                           If the differential success of sensitive and            resistant cells is constant over time then the ratio            of resistant to sensitive cells increases by a factor            of e             RCA every hour unit of t            Assuming that cells are not growing and that treatment            kills sensitive cells an             RCA of  means that sensitive            cells are not killed an             RCA of  means that  of            sensitive cells are killed per hour  in  hours            and an             RCA of  means that  of            sensitive cells are killed per hour  in  hours            If the process is not constant then the             RCA is an average over the            interval of estimation and should not be projected to            longer intervals however estimations of             RCA at different times would            reveal how treatment efficacy is changing with            time            As an alternative to using the initial frequency of            resistant cells as the estimate of             p               one can substitute the final            frequency              q                           t               of resistant bacteria in untreated controls as            was done here This substitution controls for            intrinsic differences in fitness of the two bacteria            for differences in the physiological states of the            bacteria at the time of inoculation that could affect            their growth rates independent of treatment and for            possible differences in the host response with and            without treatment The resulting             RCA is thus the advantage of            resistant cells over sensitive cells relative to their            advantage in the absent of treatment For example in            the absence of antibiotic treatment resistant bacteria            may have a disadvantage in competition with sensitives                and use of             q                           t              in place of             p              will correct for this effect It            is important however that the controls from which             q                           t              is obtained be inoculated with the same mix of            bacteria and be sampled at the same times as the            treated mice                                Bacteria become refractory to phage and            antibiotics within  hours            As noted in Figure and in more detail in                  the survival rate from treatment with phage and            antibiotics declines dramatically with the term of            infection A declining efficacy of delayed treatment is            also evident by comparing             RCA values for LH or            streptomycin Table  The             RCA for a single dose of            streptomycin was  after immediate treatment but            declined to  when treatment was delayed  hours The            corresponding values for the Kspecific phage were             and  The             RCA for LH at  hours is            statistically indistinguishable from that for immediate            treatment with LW  even though the mouse            survival under these two conditions differs            significantly Fig  P   It is thus evident            that by eight hours the bacteria had declined in their            susceptibility to phage and antibiotic efficacy            declined as well It is noteworthy that there were no            apparent clinical symptoms of these infections at             hours or even at  hours            The bacteria inoculated into the thigh not only            became refractory to antibiotic and phage treatment            within a few hours after inoculation they persisted            and remained refractory to phage treatment for a number            of days if the mouse survived In samples taken  days            after treatment the density of the LH phage in the            thigh was  phage particles per gram and while phage            resistant cells were present     of the            bacteria isolated from leg tissue remained sensitive to            this phage                                    The Phage Replication Assay phages LW and LH          have similar growth rates in broth but not serum          Mortality rates of mice in Smith and Huggins             and here as well as the           RCA values indicate that phages          specific for the Kcapsule are more effective in          controlling the infections than phage that are not          specific for the capsule Could this have been          anticipated from the in vitro capacity of the phage to          replicate on and kill           E coli KH The Phage          Replication Assay PRA attempts to provide a measure of          in vitro efficacy that can be extended to in vivo          performance The rate of doubling of a population of          lytic phage on a population of bacteria measures the          ultimate efficacy of that phage in killing those          bacteria This overall replication rate depends on          adsorption rate latent period and burst size on that          bacterial host as well as temperature and other physical          properties of the culture conditions see Additional file           The rate of replication also depends on the ratio of          phage to bacteria the multiplicity of infection and          most critically on the density and physiological state of          the bacterial population      Despite the many          factors that influence phage replication rates and hence          influence the           PRA value these factors are          easily controlled and furthermore the comparison of           PRA s between different phages is          straightforward if the           PRA s are obtained from common          bacterial cultures as here see Methods          Additional File           Sensitivity of Phage Replication Assay to Growth          Conditions This file explains some assumptions that          underlie the Phage Replication Assay PRA how assay          conditions may violate those assumptions and affect those          values estimated and how to minimize the effect of          violating those assumptions A mathematical model using          differential equations is provided to evaluate the          magnitudes of some of these effects          Click here for file          Our           PRA values are surprising in some          respects yet are consistent with the mouse mortalities          and microbiological data When the           PRA of these phage were estimated          on cells grown in Luria Broth there was no apparent          difference between the two phages Fig  the           PRA s were strongly affected by          cell densities but both phages showed similar patterns          and there is no basis from these in vitro data for          suggesting any difference in their efficacy at          replication on and killing CAB Note that the observed           PRA s declined with increasing          bacterial density the opposite of the effect seen in the          simulations of Additional file  There are in fact two          opposing effects of cell density on the PRA One is that          higher cell densities reduce phage generation time by          decreasing the time for a phage to encounter a host This          increases the           PRA  The other is that high cell          densities exhaust nutrients in the media and thereby slow          bacterial growth in turn reducing phage metabolism and          thus reducing the           PRA  Only the former effect was          considered in the model of Additional file           When the           PRA was estimated on cells grown in          mouse serum the Kspecific phage LH had a much higher          rate of replication than LW Fig  Despite variance          in the estimates there was a pronounced superiority of          the Kspecific phage LH over the nonspecific phage          LW Although this serum assay did not fully mimic in          vivo growth conditions it certainly supports the          hypothesis that the greater treatment efficacy of LH is          specific to phage replication on bacteria in mice and is          not from a general superiority of LH                            Discussion                  Factors affecting treatment success          Two observations from these combined studies seem          especially interesting i Phages vary in treatment          success ii Delaying treatment by  hours substantially          increases the rate of mortality relative to that of          immediate treatment for many of the treatments applied          here despite the fact infected mice survive at least           hours longer In attempting to better understand these          observations we developed two assays One assay the RCA                     R esistance           C ompetition           A ssay measures the efficacy of a          treatment in killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria          based on changes in the frequency of treatmentresistant          bacteria after treatment is applied The other assay the          PRA            P hage           R eplication           A ssay measures the ability of a          phage to replicate on populations of a bacterium under          controlled in vitro conditions          The           RCA and           PRA values reflect what is observed          with other microbiological measures of the efficacy of          treatment Consider first the effect of delayed          treatment which reduced mouse survival in most          treatments Increased mortality with delayed treatment          could have various causes i By the time of treatment          the numbers of bacteria are already sufficiently high          that mortality is caused by toxins and tissue damage          ensuing from them rather than from further growth of the          bacteria Under these conditions reducing the number of          bacteria by treatment would have little effect on the          clinical outcome of the infection ii By the time of          treatment the numbers of bacteria are so high that the          mouses defenses cannot prevent further growth of the          bacterial population even with treatment and bacterial          numbers simply increase to the point of mortality This          model is similar to that in i except that a treatment          which controlled bacterial growth would prevent          mortality iii As a consequence of the hosts response          to the proliferating population of bacteria the site of          the infection becomes less accessible to the antibiotic          or phages and the proliferation of the bacterial          population can no longer be controlled by these          antibacterial treatments iv The bacteria become          physiologically refractory to the treatment          The RCA specifically supports the latter two models          If by eight hours the bacteria were as accessible and          responsive to the phage or antibiotic as they were          initially the           RCA values would remain high We          instead observed a drop in           RCA values The data do not rule          out additional processes consistent with models i or          ii but the data clearly reveal a reduced bacterial          susceptibility or reduced access of treatment to the          bacteria when treatment is delayed          More than a half a century ago H Eagle and          colleagues observed a dramatic decline in the efficacy of          antibiotics with the term of the infection in a mouse          thigh model In their now classical investigations of the          withinhost dynamics of antibiotic treatment they          followed the course of penicillin treatment of           Treponema pallidum and Group A and          Group B Streptococcus       Eagle             postulated that the most likely reason for the declining          efficacy of treatment with the term of the infection was          due to i a decline in the rate of metabolism and          replication of bacteria during the infection and ii          that slowly growing or nongrowing bacteria are more          refractory to penicillin than those that replicating at          higher rates More recent work by E Tuomanen A Tomaz          and their colleagues supported this interpretation a          phenomenon they called phenotypic tolerance                They also provided evidence that nutrient limitation          was the cause of the decline in the rate of bacterial          growth     Not only do bacteria become increasingly          refractory to the majority of antibiotics as their rate          of growth declines but they also adsorb to and replicate          bacteriophage less efficiently      as is evident          from the           PRA values in Fig  Thus the          decline in the efficacy of phage and antibiotic therapy          with delayed treatment in our experiments is plausibly          attributed to a decline in the rate of replication of           E coli K once inside the          mouse          The other intriguing observation from Smith and          Huggins that we corroborated here is the consistent          superiority of phages requiring the K antigen for          infection when measured as mouse survival Our           RCA values showed a significant          difference between the phages in vivo suggesting that          the Kspecific phages replicate at a higher rate than          the nonKspecific phages inside the mouse Yet although          Smith and Huggins casually observed that their          nonKspecific phages were inferior to Kspecific          phages at lysing cultures of bacteria grown in artificial          media suggesting intrinsic differences between the          phages more generally our           PRA estimates indicated that there          was no intrinsic difference between our two phages in          artificial media Instead           PRA differences were consistent          with mouse survival and           RCA data only when the           PRA was measured on cells grown in          mouse serum Thus the           PRA enables one to begin          unravelling the environmental bases of differences in          phage growth in vivo          In this investigation we used the mouse thigh          infection model because of the many precedents for its          use and because of its established repeatability                 The fact that bacteria undergo such a profound          change in susceptibility or accessibility to treatment in          only  hours raises the question of whether the mouse          thigh infection model is representative of natural          infections This question is not necessarily answerable          at present but the results do highlight the fact that          development of specific protocols and phages for          treatment in any one experimental model may be inadequate          for treatment of the same bacterium under field          conditions                          The Resistance Competition Assay          The preceding discussion indicates that the resistance          competition assay is consistent with other measures of          phage performance in vivo and provides specific insights          not easily obtained in other ways The RCA has other          virtues that make it useful for studying phage therapy          and other forms of treatment  It is versatile In          addition to being used to study the population dynamics          of phage and antibiotic treatment in general the RCA          could be employed to design and evaluate the efficacy of          different antibiotic treatment protocols It can be          applied to virtually any experimental model such as          enteric infections     or urinary tract infections               The RCA provides a more direct measure of          the in vivo action of antibiotics or other treatments          than estimates of the concentrations of these compounds          in serum or in solid tissue Moreover the RCA protocol          controls for the contribution of the host defenses as          well as variety other factors that could influence the          density of bacteria in a particular tissue Only the          action of the treatment per se can account for the          difference in the frequency of resistant bacteria between          treated and untreated treated hosts  The RCA is more          humane and offers greater statistical power per animal          than outcome measures of the efficacy of treatment          based on survival or other clinical indications The fact          that the RCA yields a continuous statistic rather than a          binary one enables the use of standard statistical          analyses in which meaningful comparisons can be made with          as few as two replicates per group  The RCA can be          applied to populations of bacteria infecting specific          tissues at specific times even allowing multiple          measures per animal However individual tissues          subjected to the RCA must not have high levels of          bacterial migration from other tissues over the course of          treatment          The RCA is a sensitive and specific measure of          treatment efficacy and as such will not correlate          perfectly with other measures of treatment To wit our           RCA s were similar between delayed          LH treatment  and immediate LW treatment           even though mouse survival rates were significantly          different between them  of  mice versus  of           These discrepancies highlight the complexity of the          infection process and the fact that different measures of          infection dynamics capture different properties Because          our           RCA s were based on samples from          the infected thigh the values apply specifically to that          thigh and do not necessarily reflect the efficacy of          treatment in other tissues that may influence host          survival                          The Phage replication assay          This method has a potential utility beyond that          demonstrated here If phage therapy is to be developed          for particular infections it would be useful to have an          in vitro procedure to screen phages for their potential          efficacy in vivo The diversity of phage is enormous For          example among  phage isolated from different samples or          different plaques on lawns of           E coli K and           E coli B at least  distinct          phage were found    as measured by host range andor          restriction pattern A far greater number of phage could          certainly be isolated with a broader array of lawn          bacteria and by sampling different sources The          implication is that it should be possible to isolate a          substantial number of lytic phage capable of killing most          strains of enteric and other bacteria hence offering a          compelling reason to pursue phage therapy as a solution          to antibiotic resistance Screening many phages for their          therapeutic potential in experimental animals would be a          time and animalconsuming task The PRA employed here          could facilitate that screening Our results suggest that          phage performance in serum could be a sufficient          indicator of in vivo performance but there is no reason          that this assay could not be performed in vitro with          other modifications such as solid tissues Moreover as          suggested in a recent study     in vivo culture may          selectively improve the capacity of a phage to replicate          on and kill bacteria in a mammalian host                          Prospects for phage therapy          This is a methodological study to develop and          experimentally evaluate procedures to measure the          efficacy of antibacterial treatment and to screen          bacteriophage for their therapeutic potential Our          purpose in performing these experiments and publishing          these results is not to advocate the use of phages for          the treatment of systemic infections Nevertheless          because of the current novelty of and aspirations for          phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics it seems          appropriate to acknowledge that our results and those of          several other studies offer promise that phage therapy is          highly repeatable can be successful and is thus worthy          of further research for clinical practice Moreover the          use of phage for therapy and prophylaxis neednt be          restricted to humans as phage could obviously be used          for these purposes in domestic animals          There are of course a number of problems associated          with the use of phage as an alternative to antibiotics          To us the most serious biological problem is a restricted          host range Not only would one have to know the species          of bacteria responsible for an infection it would be          necessary to know which phages can infect that strain of          bacteria These requirements are certainly inconsistent          with current empiric therapy that uses broad spectrum          antibiotics which dominates how antibiotics are employed          in the community as well as in hospitals Commonly it is          not clear whether a bacterial infection is responsible          for the symptoms being treated with antibiotics much          less the species strain and resistance profile of the          bacteria responsible On the other hand there are          situations like epidemics where this knowledge would be          available And as procedures to identify the bacteria          responsible for symptomatic infections get better and          more rapid it soon may be quite easy to get this          information from individual patients As a consequence of          the ever increasing frequency of antibiotic resistant          bacteria the range of antibiotics to which individual          bacteria are resistant and the limited number of targets          to which current and soon to be anticipated antibiotics          are directed there is a pressing need to develop          alternative methods of treating and preventing bacterial          infections Phages certainly offer some of the most          readilyavailable and promising alternatives                            Conclusions         The results of the Smith and Huggins  study of        phage and antibiotic therapy    are repeatable and        robust quantitatively as well as qualitatively Using their        almost invariably more than  lethal         E coli K mouse thigh infection        protocol but with different strains of mice and        independently isolated phages and bacteria we obtained the        same frequencies of treatment survival as they did As they        also observed phages that required the K capsule for        infection provided greater mouse protection than phages        that did not require K When treatment was administered        within minutes of the infection both the K specific phage        and single doses of streptomycin completely prevented        infectioninduced mortality If however treatment was        delayed by eight hours the rate of recovery with a single        dose of streptomycin the most effective antibiotic in the        Smith and Huggins study was reduced by approximately                 The Resistance Competition Assay RCA one of two        protocols developed here uses the change in the frequency        of a minority population of bacteria resistant to the        treating agent as a measure of the efficacy of treatment in        vivo Our         RCA estimates from phage and        streptomycin treatment of         E coli K infections in laboratory        mice are consistent with mortality rates With immediate        treatment the         RCA values for the streptomycin and        Kspecific phages which totally prevented mortality were        both substantially greater than that of the phage not        specific for the K capsule for which  of the treated        mice died         RCA values for the Kspecific phage        and for single doses of streptomycin when treatment was        delayed by eight hours were substantially and significantly        less than those estimated for immediate treatment The RCA        supports earlier observations that as time between        infection and treatment increases bacteria become        increasingly refractory to treatment eg because of        changes in bacterial physiological andor the host        environment         The Phage Replication Assay PRA provides a simple        measure of the rate of replication and host cell killing        of lytic phage under defined conditions By varying those        conditions it is possible to identify factors that affect        phage growth and hence their efficacy in killing the target        bacteria Over a wide range of densities of bacteria        growing in artificial medium the estimated         PRA s were similar between the        Kspecific and nonspecific phages Based on these        estimates we would not have anticipated different        efficacies of these phage in treating E coli K        infections On the other hand the assay performed in mouse        serum yielded substantially greater efficacy of the        Kspecific phage matching its superior performance in the        mouse         The results of this investigation like those of        Smith and Huggins and others support the potential of        phage for treating bacterial infections and the development        of experimental infection models to evaluate and optimize        the efficacy of antibiotic as well as phage treatment        protocols Our results illustrate the value of exploring        the dynamics of the bacterial population during treatment        in the evaluation and design of treatment protocols                    Methods                  Culture and sampling medium and procedures          In vitro liquid cultures of bacteria and phage were          grown and maintained in Luria  Bertani broth LB          supplemented with  gml glucose Bacterial densities          were estimated from colony counts on Petri dishes          plates containing  mL of LB with  agar Phage          densities were estimated on these plates with  ml top           agar containing LB glucose and  ul of an          overnight culture of the bacteria about    bacteria          per ml When needed the bacterial and phage suspensions          were serially diluted in  saline or LB Glucose          before plating When rare less than           phageresistant bacterial densities were estimated by          plating with and without  phage particles in soft          agar when common they were estimated by streaking          individual colonies across high densities of phage on          plates A similar selective plating procedure was used to          estimate the densities of antibiotic resistant          bacteria                          Bacteria          The primary strain used in these experiments was CAB          an           E coli of the same serotype as          that used by Smith and Huggins    OKH but          isolated from a different source     We also used a          TcR Kps           E coli K chimera of this          isolate designated CAB that does not express the K          antigen                              Phage          Phages were isolated from an Atlanta Georgia sewage          treatment plant An aliquot of liquid sewage from the          inflow to the plant was treated with chloroform to kill          bacteria and human viruses The chloroformfree          supernatant was then enriched for           E coli KHspecific phage by          adding  ml of this suspension to  ml LB containing          CAB approximately    bacteria per ml These          mixtures of bacteria and sewage were grown for a minimum          of four hours mixed with chloroform and centrifuged to          remove debris The vast majority of phages in these crude          lysates were able to grow on CAB as well as CAB          hence were not Kspecific To enrich for Kspecific          phage the mixed lysate was incubated with CAB and          treated with chloroform  minutes later to abort          infections After removing the chloroform the cycle was          repeated  times The phage were then plated with lawns          of CAB and single plaques were patched onto lawns of          CAB Of the  plaques isolated after this passage          two were from phage that grew on CAB but not on CAB          hence were presumed to be specific for the Kcapsule          From these plates one clone each of a Kspecific and          nonK specific phage was chosen designated LH and LW          respectively          The two phages were characterized morphologically and          molecularly Electron micrographs revealed that both had          a B morphology    similar to phage  but with a tail          of hexagonal symmetry and a somewhat shorter headtail          connector than  Whole genomes of both phages migrated          in agarose gels at approximately  kb genomes of LH          and LW were sensitive to           Xmn I digestion but showed          different digestion patterns                          In vivoexperiments          All mouse experiments were conducted at Emory          University using protocols approved by the Emory          University Institutional Animal Care Committee All of          the           in vivo experiments were performed          with female outbred white Swiss mice Harlin Sprague          of from  to  weeks of age  grams Mice were          maintained in cages containing  or fewer animals Using           ml tuberculin syringes suspensions of bacteria were          injected into a mouse thigh For treatment phage          lysates pseudolysates phagefree bacterial cultures          treated with chloroform saline or streptomycin sulfate          SIGMA solutions were injected into the opposite thigh          or a forelimb muscle Although chloroform was absent from          injected lysates and pseudolysates no other attempts          were made to refine these preparations Except as noted          the numbers of bacteria and phage injected were each          approximately  and the total volume injected was          normally  ml or less Following the initial          inoculation the infected animals were periodically          observed usually at intervals of less than  hours          with more frequent observations  hour intervals made          during the  hour post infection period when          mortality was anticipated Infected mice surviving beyond           hours never succumbed to the infection in the next           days In situations where the mouses ataxic appearance          indicated that death was imminent the mouse was          euthanized          Samples of bacteria and phage taken from leg muscle          were maintained for a maximum of  hour on ice before          being weighed and suspended in  ml of saline and          homogenized with a Tissue Tearor The densities of          bacteria and phage in these homogenates were estimated by          diluting and plating                          Resistance Competition Assay RCA          This assay measures the efficacy of phage or          streptomycin in limiting replication by an infecting          population of bacteria in infected mice The principle          underlying this assay is that bacteria resistant to a          treatment will increase in frequency over sensitive          bacteria only to the extent that the treatment is          effective at killing or reducing the rate of growth of          the sensitive bacteria The assay converts the advantage          of resistance into a measure of treatment efficacy For          this assay mice were inoculated with mixtures of           bacteria CAB that were sensitive to the treatment          phage or antibiotics along with low frequencies             of bacteria resistant to the treatment The          mice were then treated with phage or streptomycin either          immediately  hours or after a delay of  hours or          were inoculated with sterile  saline controls At            or  hours after treatment the mice were          sacrificed and the relative frequencies resistant          bacteria in the mixtures were estimated from the          homogenized leg tissue We applied this assay in two          ways  By using different mice for the immediate and          delayed treatments or  by inoculating the same mouse          in different hind limb thighs with the second          inoculation delayed  hours and treating the mouse          immediately by inoculation of streptomycin phage or          saline into the musculature of a forelimb                          Phage Replication Assay PRA          This procedure estimates in vitro the potential          therapeutic efficacy of phages It simply measures the          rate at which a phage population increases in density          its rate of replication when grown on a strain of          bacteria under prescribed controlled conditions Phage          replication in vivo is presumed to be an integral part of          phage therapy success so to the extent that replication          in vitro mirrors replication in vivo this assay should          indicate which phages are the best choices for therapy          The rate of replication of LH and LW on CAB was          measured in LB and in mouse serum Assays in LB were          conducted as follows The bacteria were grown with          aeration in LB at  until reaching a specified density          as measured by light scattering from a sidearm flask          Glucose and calcium were not added to the LB in these          assays Aliquots of  ml of the growing bacterial          cultures were added to empty tubes along with the phage          The suspensions were grown for  hr at which time          chloroform was added Assays in mouse serum were          conducted similarly except that the densities at the          time the phage were added were determined by plating and          thus could not be standardized between replicates The          bacteria were allowed to replicate in serum for at least           hours before addition of phage Phage concentrations          were determined at the beginning and end points to          calculate a percapita increase ratio  we then          transformed this value to log             to estimate of the number of          doublings per hour see the Additional file for the          sensitivity of this measure          Several precautions were taken to avoid biases and          reduce the error in estimating  Phage concentrations          were maintained at low levels throughout the assay so          that uninfected cells did not become limiting the final          phage density was never greater than the cell density          indicating that a majority of cells remained uninfected          during the assay period To reduce sources of variance          in growth rate extrinsic to the phages growth rate          assays of both phages were usually conducted          simultaneously with aliquots of the same parent culture          for both phages
