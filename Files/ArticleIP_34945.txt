       DATE                Thu Sept             This is purely an opinion I really like readingthe diary feature But I see the writing of highachievers but Im not seeing people who are on the edge For example you hada great feature on a real estate agent But she was a very successful realestate person Likewise the lawyer who went to China was a very successfullawyer            Now in the Lewis andClark diaries the possibility of disaster always loomed Could we read thediaries of a man or a woman who is a little closer to the edge            To respond clickhere                            SUBJECT Tabloidsand Baloney Sandwiches                           FROM KingArthur                           DATE Fri Sept            I would like to take a moment to put Tabloids inperspective and challenge anyone to make a different observation            My job takes me to dozens of grocery stores whichdistribute a great number of these offensive babbleonion manuscripts andwhere a large number of employees read them in the break room Not once in my years have I heard anyone admit that they believe in the content            Why read this crapthen Well why read any type of fiction I believe it is because there is atime for rape murder hurricane political treacherytypesofreading and atime to just amuse yourself while youre scarfing down a baloneysandwichtypeof reading

everyone in the Fray whos taken thetime to comment on this months  Enquiring Minds in Slovakia            Ive enjoyed all your comments immenselyespecially Mr Heaneys suggestions that I am used to wallowing in thistype of pigslop and that I should return my fee for writing the column As tothe former while Ill confess that my office is a huge mess Ill have tosteadfastly disagree that its quite reached the pigpen level the latter Illjust politely overlook            There seems to be a huge misunderstandingunderlying many of your posts though and Id like to clear it up EnquiringMinds in Slovakia is not meant to be an essay on the socioculturalimplications of the use of the National Enquirer in a Slovakianclassroom Nor is it a serious critique or celebration for that matter of thetabloids or a Hollywood gossip column lazily cribbed from the pages of othermagazines The article you saw was this months edition of Keeping Tabs alighthearted monthly column I write for                   Slate                that sums upandpokes fun atwhat the supermarket tabloids have been writing about for theprevious month Get it Were trying to have a little fun here            Im sorry to disappoint all of you whovecomplained that I havent done anything but sum up whats in the tabloids butthats precisely what Im here to do every month I dont do any independentinvestigation of the veracity of the tabloid stories I just let them speak forthemselves in all their ludicrous gloryhopefully in a way thats as amusingas the tabs themselves But thats why Im not at all surprised that

  Sure a young girlssmile the pleasure of helping someone in need friendship etc etc may beboth hard to measure and extremely corny but lets not get carried away Thereis no doubt that those things are all indirectly but absolutely affected bythose who govern via economic and social policy If elected Bradley mighteven use unlike Clinton the bully pulpit to remind us of the criticalimportance of those intangibles in creating responsible and compassionate adultcitizens It is more than empty rhetoric            To respond clickhere                            SUBJECT you thinkthis is a joke                           FROM outraged                           DATE Thu Sept            A few things to say about the Trippin at theGNC             If you dont have an illness say depression orarthritis why on earth do you expect to feel any effects from a drug which isintended to treat said illness Side effects sure but I would doubt anyprimary effects would be felt             Depression is a serious illness Why must youtreat antidepressants as party toys             If you think herbal products are necessarilysafer or have less side effects than commercial pharmaceuticals where do youthink those pharmaceuticals came from in the first place Many if not mostcommon drugs were originally a substance that occurred in nature such asvarious plant extracts             Ever heard of a selffulfilling prophecy Or theplacebo effect The author could conceivably have convinced himherself thatbecause a product is supposed to make one feel less depressed and thereforehappier heshe will therefore feel better The mind is a powerful thingand sometimes may be as effective or even more effective in treating a physicalor mental malady than pharmaceuticals herbal or otherwise             Antidepressants are not meant to make onehappier  per se but rather to make one feel normal and better able todeal with everyday details that most people take for granted I sufferedclinical depression for several years I know So why should it be a bigsurprise if a nondepressed individual does not notice any effects from takingan antidepressant medication Put another way antidepressants dont makeyou happy they just help lift you to a plateau from which you are able to seekyour own happiness whatever that may consist of             Severe depression isnot a joke Why must the treatment of this illness always become one Donttreat it so lightly unless youve been there            To respond click here
