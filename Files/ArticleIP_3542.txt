                                                            Dear Readers                                       Prudence is greatlypleased at the confidence so many of you have shown in her by asking heradvice Sadly she must however return to her needlework now Some answers toquestions previously posed to her will be posted here in the next few weeksbut she will be unable to answer any questions received after thisdate                                       In leaving Prudence wouldlike to offer this last piece of advice                                       Exceptin a very few instances Prudence is neither better informed nor wiser than thepersons who write to her She is able to offer helpful advice only because theproblems described are not hers she is not emotionally involved in them andcan consider them objectively So her advice has two parts First when you aregreatly troubled with a problem you should write it down in the form of aletterwhich you may if you wish address to Prudence The act of translatingthe problem into written words rather than brooding over it endlessly andincoherently will itself be helpful It will enable you to see the problem inits true dimensions Second you should not mail the letter but should read itover to yourself and imagine what Prudence would say You will findnotalways but oftenthat you know the answer As Prudence read the letters shereceived she often felt that the writer knew the answer but only wanted someconfirmation Try it seriously for yourself                                       Prudence fondlybidding you farewell                                                         DearPrudence                                                      I am a woman with astrong personality As evidence my boss has said that Im intimidating andat times pompousbut then he has the IQ of a brine shrimp Now I wouldnever be foolish enough to say to anyone in my workplace that he is a simp anda mental shrimp but I think that I somehow broadcast these kinds ofmessages                                       Well my goal is to pullit back a notch I want to seem less threatening When I announced my goal topresent myself as a more middleoftheroad type of person several people wereup in arms You cant change who you are was the most common line                                       NowPrudence I have no intention of changing who I am I just want to change thewindow dressing Can I pull it back a notch or am I doomed to come off as ascary bitch                                       Strident FromDetroit                        DearStrident            It isnt necessary tochange who you are but it would be helpful to recognize who youare You are certainly not the most brilliantor otherwise wonderfulpersonin the world and probably not even in your own circle Moreover to whateverextent you are superior it is probably the result of genes and attitudesinherited from your parents and not something you created for yourselfAccepting these realities will help you to behave in a more accommodating waywithout pretense            But evenif you do feel yourself superior you can still learn to behave in a way thatis not offensive People who are attractively slim do not talk about theugliness of obesity in the presence of people who are grossly overweight Goodmanners can be cultivated You may even find pleasure in realizing that youhave acted with noblesse oblige in not flaunting your superiority There issatisfaction in feeling that you are better than other people not only inintelligence but also in modesty and good manners            Prudencerealistically                                             DearPrudence                                                      I havea pal who was actually a very good friend of mine until she started going outwith a certain guy Now I hardly ever see her Plus she has changed a lotalthough she doesnt see it She is still in high school but has already sleptwith him a few times and I believe she is pregnant This is something that weboth agreed was terrible unChristian and something neither of us would dountil we were married Now she sees everything differently and in some waydoesnt see that she has done anything wrong I feel as though she hascommitted a terrible crime almost How should I treat her now since I canhardly respect her                                       SincerelyWorried andConfused                        Dear Worriedand Confused            Yourfriend does not seem to want help or comfort from you at this time andcertainly would not welcome a lecture I think it natural and appropriate thatyour relations with her should cool That is one way she would learn theconsequences of her actions which may or may not bother her But you shouldnot be hostile and you should be open to help her if she should turn to youlater            Prudence charitably                                             DearPrudence                                                      In the social scene Ihave begun to notice people greeting each other with a kiss on the lips I wasrather appalled because I assumed that kissing especially on the lips wasreserved for people with an intimate relationship                                       Shouldtwo people who are only social acquaintances kiss each other Is this evensanitary How socially acceptable is kissing in public even for two peopledating                                       ConservativeKisserAugusta Ga                        DearConservative Kisser            Prudenceis with you If casual acquaintances kiss each other on the lips what methodof expression will be left for true loversexcept to fall into bed which issometimes inconvenient or excessive            Prudenceconservatively                                             DearPrudence                                                      I think you got it butIm not sure and since I appreciate your weekly advice I wanted to beclear                                       The letter you published onthe advice columnist referred to as Eppie and signed by Popo was a somewhatveiled reference to Ask Ann Landers and Dear Abby I read a biography ofthe two as you no doubt know they are sisters in real life and Eppie andPopo were childhood nicknames of Ann and Abby respectively The book wascalled Dear Ann Dear Abby  Therefore it would seem the writer wasintending to pose as Abby putting down her sister which would be in keepingwith the oftmentioned rivalry between them                                       I dontthink of you as one who would attempt to disrupt sisterly relations and sowanted to make sure you understood the possible ramifications of what youprinted Thanks for your good words each week and be well                                       Sue                        DearSue            Thanks I didnt get it Ididnt know that Eppie and Popo were names for Ann Landers and Abigail VanBuren            I havegreat respect for both Judging by the volume of my mail I think there isenough unmet demand for advice to keep all of us busy I suppose there aresubjects on which they know more than I do but I suppose there are alsosubjects on which I know more than they            Prudence gratefully
