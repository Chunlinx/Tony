                                 The Kosovo Killing Fields            In areport picked up by Canadas National Post to lead its front pageMonday the Observer of London said Sunday that hundreds of documentsdiscovered after the Yugoslav retreat from Kosovo prove that the ethniccleansing there had been meticulously planned and ordered from Belgrade Thepapers provide crucial evidence linking massacres that claimed an estimated lives to Serb army generals and police commanders all the way up toPresident Slobodan Milosevic the Observer reported from Pristina Itsaid most of the documents are now in the hands of the intelligence service ofthe Kosovo Liberation Army which has claimed that nothing happened in Kosovowithout it being planned and organised in Belgrade            Several British papers led with pictures of the eccentric young Britishviolinist Nigel Kennedy performing a concert for peace at the Sava ConcertHall in Belgrade Monday The Guardian of London said several members of the governmentincluding Serbian president Milan Milutinovic attended the concert Sundaythefirst in Yugoslavia by a leading Western musician since the warbut werebarred from visiting the musician backstage by his staff who wanted to avoidan embarrassing photoopportunity But Kennedy told his ecstatic audience thatthe Serbs were a warm friendly people who did not deserve to be bombed Icame to Belgrade to see if you were all right and succeeded in staying alivehe added            Withregard to the IndiaPakistan conflict in Kashmir the Times of India reportedMonday from Srinagar that nearly  personal bodyguards of Americas mostwanted terrorist the Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden were fighting inKashmir on the Pakistani side They had fled to Kashmir from Afghanistan as theUnited States began to close in on their boss the paper said The whereaboutsof Bin Laden himself is not known The Times of India said US agenciesbelieved he could be in the Kargil area of Kashmir but added there was not anyconcrete evidence of this            TheHindu another Indian daily reported Indias concern about its future relations withChina after the stateowned China Daily called Saturday for an immediate ceasefire inKashmir The Hindu said this was clearly a proPakistani comment and adeparture from Chinas neutrality in the dispute It suggested that Beijingmight be changing its tune because of growing fears of United States meddlingin the region But the paper added If China is really worried about possibleAmerican gains from the Kargil crisis it should hardly be advocating aceasefire Instead it should be demanding that Pakistan withdraw the armedaggression and remove any excuse for Western intervention            Thecrisis in Northern Ireland led the front pages Monday of several Europeannewspapers including Germanys Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  With British Prime MinisterTony Blair having set midnight on Wednesday June  as the absolutedeadline for agreement on implementing the Ulster peace deal British paperswere pessimistic The problem has been a refusal by the loyalist Protestantleadership to allow the republican Catholic Sinn Fein party a role in the newlydeveloped government of the province unless its military wing the IrishRepublican Army starts handing in its weapons            Theconservative Daily Telegraph of London said Monday in an editorial that thedecommissioning of arms has not begun because Sinn Fein knows that its powerderives from violence and the threat of violence and so it does not want tosacrifice that power The paper strongly supported the loyalist refusal toshare power with Sinn Fein under these circumstances If Sinn Fein come intothe executive this week something new in the history of our parliamentarydemocracy will have taken place the Telegraph said An armed groupwill be taking part in government The power of a private army will for thefirst time be exercised through out institutions The paper reportedmeanwhile that republican and loyalist terrorist groups are both preparing fornew violence            TheTimes ofLondon took the same view saying that a powersharing executive without an IRAcommitment to disarmament would be less a democratic political body thanbureaucratic cover for a protection racket The Independent  howevercriticized Blair for setting an unreal deadline for the peace talks Thesituation was not like Yugoslavia where a compromise between NATO andMilosevic would have been a disaster the paper said If the republican andloyalist leaders havent reached agreement by midnight Wednesday the skystays where it is the paper said They simply have to keep trying and MrBlair will have lost an important modicum of credibility            In aneditorial Monday the Guardian urged Bill Clinton to stand by Hillary during a NewYork Senate campaign that would see the dirty laundry of the past eight yearsrecycled new tensions in the Democratic camp and a hot reception nopunches pulled from New
