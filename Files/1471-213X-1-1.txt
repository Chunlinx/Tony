                    Background        Glutamate decarboxylase GAD catalyzes the formation of        the inhibitory neurotransmitter amino butyric acid GABA        from glutamate In mammals the two isoforms of this        enzyme GAD and GAD are expressed from two separate        genes         Gad and         Gad respectively     GABA        signaling plays several roles in neuronal development        Early in CNS development GABA can modulate neuron        progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration        survival and differentiation                    In some classes of neural progenitors GABA        stimulates these processes while in others it has an        antagonistic activity For example recent work has        demonstrated that GABA acts in the developing neocortex to        stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the        ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of        progenitors in the subventricular zone   Later during        postnatal development normal GABAergic input is required        for activitydependent plasticity in the visual cortex as        shown in the         Gad knockout mouse    In        addition to these functions in the developing CNS GABA        signaling is also required for the normal development of        nonneural tissues Targeted mutations of the         Gad gene lead to defective        development of the secondary palate    The cleft        palate phenotype of the         Gad mutants suggests the involvement        of GABAmediated signals in the normal development and        differentiation of a structure derived from the oral        epithelium and neural crest ectomesenchyme This        conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate        defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in        the  subunit of the GABA         A receptor             This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for        GABAmediated signaling in the development of a nonneural        structure the secondary palate The potential for this        pathway to be involved in the early development of        additional nonneural tissues has not yet been thoroughly        explored   To address this question we surveyed         Gad transcript distribution in the        nonCNS tissues of the embryo Using a whole mount         in situ hybridization approach we        found that         Gad is indeed expressed in a number        of different regions and tissues A notable feature of this        expression pattern is that         Gad transcripts accumulate in the        specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the        formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth        These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be        sources of developmental signals     In        addition transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem        cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal        endoderm and mesenchyme The expression patterns show that         Gad is expressed in several nonCNS        structures that are derived from each of the three germ        layers of the embryo                    Results        The mouse         Gad gene is widely expressed in the        embryonic central nervous system   To define        additional sites of expression outside of the CNS we        analyzed the distribution of         Gad transcripts in E to E        mouse embryos by whole mount         in situ hybridization                Gad transcripts were not detected in        E day embryos data not shown At E         Gad was readily detected in the        tailbud figure A Expression in the tail continued        through E and was undetectable by E figure        BCDand data not shown a period corresponding to        secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo          Examination of sections from an E embryo revealed a high        level of         Gad expression throughout the        mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of        the tailbud figure F No transcripts were detected in        the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme        figure F At more cranial levels within the tail        expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm ventral        neural tube notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut        figure E In the paraxial mesoderm the highest        expression levels were also localized ventrally adjacent        to the notochord figure E        In the pharyngeal region of E embryos         Gad RNA was detected in and around        the second third and fourth pharyngeal pouches figure        A Sections through the third pouch confirmed the        presence of         Gad expression in the pouch endoderm        data not shown Expression was particularly strong in the        dorsal portion of this pouch figure B The additional        diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal        mesenchyme figure B The expression in the pharyngeal        region was very transient transcripts were easily detected        at E but only faintly at E and were not detectable        by E        In the limb buds         Gad RNA was detected from E to        E figure ABCDEFGH Transcripts were initially        expressed in the preapical ectodermal ridge preAER at        E figure AB and by E were seen in the definitive        AER of the forelimb figure D At E         Gad was expressed in a diffuse        stripe in the forelimb figure D while in the hindlimb        expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm figure        E By E forelimb AER expression was fading and        expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal        forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb        figure GH The earlier activation of         Gad in the forelimb reflects the        normal temporal order of events in limb development        Sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds        was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme data not        shown         Gad RNA was not detected in the        limbs by whole mount         in situ hybridization after        E        A dynamic pattern of         Gad expression was detected in the        developing vibrissae from E to E figure        ABCDEFGH Expression was first detected in the        supraorbital infraorbital and postoral vibrissae and        in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and        maxillary rows figure AB nomenclature as in           Gad RNA was also detected in some of        the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage Expression        was activated in a posterior to anterior towards the nose        progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows        reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development   By        E         Gad expression was detected in the        anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated        in the rhinal labial and submental vibrissae figure        CD By E expression was strong in the labial        submental and rhinal vibrissae figure EF Sections of        E whole mounts show that         Gad expression was localized to the        epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae figure GH        and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate        figure G        Control hybridizations using a sense strand         Gad probe were also performed        Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any        staining pattern at any of the stages tested E E        Sense strand hybridization results for E and E        embryos are shown in figure                     Discussion        The expression results reported here show that         Gad was activated in several tissues        outside of the central nervous system during mouse        development Transcripts were not seen at E and were        first detected at E It was surprising that this very        early phase of         Gad expression was largely outside        of the developing CNS and was localized in the tail bud        mesenchyme and in the preapical ectodermal ridge preAER        of the forelimb bud As development proceeded         Gad was detected in pharyngeal        endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae        The data demonstrate that         Gad is expressed in several sites        outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all        three germ layers We have also detected the expression of         GadlacZ transgenes in the        developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and        surprising         in situ hybridization results we        report here JJ Westmoreland and BGC unpublished        results        Previous studies have shown that         Gad can be regulated at the        posttranscriptional and translational level         Gad mRNA translation or protein        stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level        of GABA    During embryogenesis        posttranscriptional regulation occurs by alternative        splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice           This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop        codon into the         Gad mRNA and can produce the        truncated proteins GAD and GAD from its  and         ends respectively The studies reported here used a probe        that will detect the adult         Gad mRNA that encodes GAD as well        as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA that can encode        GAD and GAD These additional mechanisms of         Gad regulation may control the        production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the        nonneural cell types detected in our study        The whole mount         in situ hybridization data reported        here extends the results of a recently published section         in situ hybridization study on        EE mouse embryos   Our analysis showed that         Gad expression is first detectable        earlier at E and revealed novel nonCNS sites of        expression in the pharyngeal region vibrissae tail bud        and limb bud The results of the previous study          together with the data reported herein provide a        comprehensive picture of         Gad expression in the EE        mouse embryo        Previous studies have noted         Gad expression outside of the CNS In        adults         Gad and         Gad have been detected in a number        of tissues including kidney testis oviduct pancreatic        islets and adrenal cortex      Previously        reported sites of embryonic         Gad expression outside of the brain        and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens        fibers and the olfactory pit    In EE        mouse embryos         Gad is expressed in the olfactory        and the lens placodes the anlagen of the olfactory pit and        lens fibers   We also detected         Gad expression in these tissues        please see figure Aand data not shown Expression of         Gad in the developing heart and blood        vessels has also been reported   We detected weak        staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel        expression perhaps due to the very low levels of        expression in developing vasculature   Our results        document localized expression of         Gad at additional nonCNS sites in        the mouse embryo suggesting a potential role for GABA        signaling in the development of these structures        Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing        tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from        the cleft palate phenotype of the         Gad and the  GABA         A receptor subunit mutants              The genetic data strongly suggest that GABA acts        through GABA         A receptors to modulate the development        of this tissue Although the data reported here do not        explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype they do        indicate that         Gad is expressed in several        additional nonCNS tissues in the mouse embryo It is        particularly noteworthy that these include the AER of the        limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae        Both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of        developmental signals required for morphogenesis and        patterning      It will be of interest to        examine the expression pattern of GABA receptors in the        mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers        Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues        would indicate that these receptors read the developmental        signals mediated by GABA in these structures and        tissues                    Conclusions        The mouse gene encoding the  kDa isoform of glutamate        decarboxylase          Gad  is expressed in the tail bud        mesenchyme vibrissal placodes pharyngeal arches and        pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge AER mesenchyme        and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from        EE Some of the         Gad expressing tissues vibrissal        placodes AER are known sources of developmental signals        Other sites of expression correspond to stem cell        populations that give rise to multiple differentiated        tissues tail bud mesenchyme pharyngeal endoderm and        mesenchyme The localized and dynamic expression pattern        of         Gad suggests a wider role for GAD        and GABA in the development of nonneural tissues than was        previously known                    Materials and Methods        Whole mount         in situ hybridizations were performed        on Swiss Webster embryos as described    The        morning that the vaginal plug was found was considered         days of gestation The         Gad probe was derived from an EST        clone accession W Its  end corresponds to        nucleotide  in exon    and the  end is at        nucleotide  in the cDNA sequence   Digoxygenin        sense and antisense RNA probes were generated by labeling        with digoxygeninUTP during transcription Embryos were        removed and fixed in  paraformaldehydePBS overnight and        used immediately for the         in situ hybridization The embryos        were processed as described previously   and hybridized        to the probe
