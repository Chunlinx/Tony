              okay   anyway so what have what have you been into did you watch LA Law last night   uh no actually i i dont i i dont uh its funny i dont really seem to watch a lot of television what um i usually like to pick up on TV are some of the news type of shows like you know   Minutes   uhhuh   um unfortunately a  couple of weekly soaps like Knots Landing and uh Dallas we watch and uh and i usually uh i just other than those i i catch movies once in a while i like a lot of the movies that are you know true stories true to life that type of thing   uhhuh   um but im not im not real big on that much on television uh i dont have really many favorite shows that i i must see every week you know   yeah   uh part of that i think is uh i have two boys and you know usually i dont get to sit down to watch the   they they they get first crack huh   yeah yeah so uh anyway um but how about you then   well i usually i guess a lot of the sitcoms   uhhuh   Cosby Cheers uh   well i find i do sit down with them when they have those those they like a lot of those uh shows and often when they have them on   uh uhhuh   thats when theyre quiet i like sit sit down with them and watch it yeah   yeah A different A Different World a Different World   yeah   but some of the other ones like ive been getting into L A Law and uh   uhhuh do you watch uh Thirty Something   no i dont make a point i i guess i really never make a point to to watch anything ill just end up catching it but uh   yeah so you catch whatever might be on if youre interested that evening   yeah you know if im not doing that night uh   yeah   you know which i guess is usually most nights no   uhhuh yeah yeah   but uh oh speaking of  you didnt see the one in with the exorcists exorcists   uh       um i you know i wanted to and i forget i really i kept seeing it advertised and i wanted to see that and i dont know we might not have been home or something  excuse me and i didnt see that but i was really interested in in that i i found that a pretty interesting story that they said the church recognized that as as a real exorcism   uhhuh   uh did you see that show   yeah i did   and what what did you think what did they what uh was that all about   oh well the girl that supposedly was possessed uh had actually uh you know seen uh you know something uh some medical the medical  side i dont know if it was a psychologist or what all but   uhhuh   um you know it was interesting interesting its interesting uh and uh you know im from you know im was raised Catholic fairly you know fairly fairly strong with my mom and dad so   yeah my husband is too yeah   but it you know thats kind of interesting um but the bottom line it you know they did the exorcism it wasnt real major you know she she was fairly you know she you know obviously there she you know she something was wrong with her   uhhuh   but uh it wasnt really uh you know extraordinary as far as her actions and she had done that and she felt like that helped her but at the same time shortly after that exorcism they also started um   um   um uh giving her medication for like a split personality type stuff of   oh okay   so uh shes doing better but and and the girl herself you know believes that it you know that she was uh you know possessed but and you know it its hard to say   hum it could be a multiple like one of these multiple personality disorders   yeah im not im not sure you know who knows but uh anyway it wasnt uh   also yeah huh   you know it was uh it was you know   it wasnt as dramatic as i guess maybe they made it seem   well i i cant say it wasnt just because of the fact that that its pretty unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter   right and well right right and also   and her parents are right there you know doing it all you know  so   yeah um and also for the church to recognize it as a a true exorcism you know um usually theyre such i think i really think that theres a fine line between what um you know a lot of people think is possessed and what are really mental disorders you know and maybe in the old days you know many years ago what they often said oh people were possessed we probably recognize now as schizophrenia or something   um uhhuh   um and uh you know its its its hard to to say you know whether its its just a its a mental disorder or its really uh uh its a or if its a split personality or something   yeah   wait honey i cant talk right now  uh but um what i dont know now what area are you living  in   im in Phoenix Arizona right now   oh  wait Jackie what yes okay okay go    excuse me so   are you in Dallas   uh no we are uh outside of Washington DC   oh okay   and i was just the reason i asked that i was curious i thought maybe in different parts of uh you know the country maybe there were certain shows that were more more popular than in other parts and i know in this area its i dont know DC is especially the newer areas are really known for having so many yuppies you know and a lot of them are into Thirty Something and you know   yeah yeah   uh i dont know some of the other shows they watch um Twin Peaks  you know and im not really into those shows and that really surprises people   yeah i i never got caught up in Twin Twin Peaks either so   yeah yeah and i just i was just wondering demographically if you know if different parts if there were shows that were more popular than in other areas i dont know like where you live um you know what are the real   yeah   what are the hot shows you know that everybody seems to want to watch   uh i dont know i dont hear people talk at work you know   uhhuh   as far as uh you know what what people are getting into but um you know some of the top sitcoms obviously do you know always in the top five you know the Cosby or i think A Different World is real strong and   yeah uhhuh   uh   now thats funny see i havent even heard of that show thats just   yeah well thats the one its the one right after Cosby and its produced by Co sby and its about its basically about uh college   oh is that right so   uh   oh okay   you know and it it obvious its you know since since its kind of promoted by Cosby its you know mostly blacks   i see uhhuh   but uh but its its a pretty good show it uh   and are all the kids into the Simpsons   have you ever heard of Jasmine Guy   pardon me uh yes   okay now shes one of the main stars of that and now shes just come out came out with an album   oh okay   and uh and which is fairly successful shes got one or two singles that have done very well so but she is a very strong personality in that show uh and uh   uhhuh i see   its your basic college and what people run into and they in fact they just had a show covering AIDS   and uh oh is that right   so you know they try to get their messages across i should say   yeah now theres a new show on and i cant think of the name of it apparently the producer of it was a Potomac resident um you know which is right right around here close to where we we are living you know the Potomac   uhhuh   area outside of DC and and i i think he went to like Wooton High School here or something and and some of the papers that circulating the rumor  that this show is based upon stories that actually happened at Wooton High where he went and thats and he she denies some of it you know um i oh eh eh i eh it might be the Beverly Hills um theres that one called Beverly Hills one O two one O or something like that uh   um not sure   and uh thats becoming a little popular and of course the kids all like the Simpsons here   yeah   and uh i guess its the same there also   yeah uh that one is is it still competing with Cosby   um im not sure i dont know whats happened uh i know a lot of some of the parents wont let their kids watch it  you know uh   such a brat     yeah but um it what what uh what changes would you like to see i mean in in in you know evening television do you think there should be more like news type programs like  or more comedies or weeklies   honestly im indifferent i probably i probably will watch a little bit of everything uh i i i i get into movies ill uh ill see you know ill watch  or ill   youre indifferent it doesnt matter yeah uhhuh   uh you know i guess im only mostly into sitcoms i guess my favorite you know one show im really into is Arsenio Hall   uhhuh oh yeah i watch that uhhuh   and uh and then you know ive been watching him for a long time now and i i needed a break and i watched Johnny Carson last night a little more level you know  and so its like im just   yeah   think oh what do i feel like today you know were getting option our options on different talk shows and i always liked watching Letterman but he starts so late   you so you like some of these late shows   yeah well the the talk shows with the personality yeah and uh   yeah yeah talk shows yeah   but uh Letterman starts pretty late out here about twelve oclock   uhhuh right oh oh okay   but ill still watch it once in a while   yeah yeah um i guess so i think also probably because people now there are so many uh  everybody has VCRs and rents so many movies that might have i dont know that might have hurt some of the the popularity of certain shows you know a lot of things that they put on Saturday nights a lot of people   yeah
