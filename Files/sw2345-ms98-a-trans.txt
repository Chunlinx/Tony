                okay i think the crime in Dallas is horrendous   compared compared to what   compared now to when i first came here twenty years ago when i came here twenty years ago it was not near as bad as it is now its terrible now my house has already been broken into once and there was an attempt a second another time i mean i cant its horrible im afraid   do you live in do you live near downtown   no i live well i live in Oak Cliff but uh uh we never had any problem here before we we really did not in my neighborhood were not wealthy at all know you know we dont have a rich neighborhood and when they break into our houses they dont get anything much they get a little jewelry and maybe you know a VCRs and it just irritates me to no end that somebody has broken into my house and stolen my things you know just   well   hum well i live i i live in in north west Garland actually west about a mile south of one ninety so were really quite far north and the house we just moved into a house that has lots of windows and i course i have a friend Dallas policeman that lives right behind me so i dont know if thatll do any good but       uh it its interesting though that youve been broken into uh you must you must look at this whole mess a lot different did you see today that they the the police commanders got a pay raise and the the regular folks didnt     no i hadnt i hadnt heard that   it just on the news i was just watching a little of it just before you called it uh and they cutback and they cutback on overtime and they have to take electric clocks home and you wonder what that does to the fighting crime if if they had an electric clock on their desk they were supposed to take it home to save energy   are you serious  that is the city   im serious  uh Doug Clarks on channel eight   that sounds like the city i worked for the city of Dallas for a while and i do know that theyre they can be really strange   what what what do you think why why people breaking into your house   drugs they want to see they take what they do they break in and they take your jewelry and they take it and they sell it they hock it and then they buy drugs i really think its drugs they want the money for the drugs   hum   so i think drugs is the root of it   what time of day are they breaking in   well okay i used to work second shift and when they broke in i was working at night i i work in payroll now and i work days but uh they broke in they knew my hours the police told me evidently they were watching me and they know your hours see thats what so spooky about it   uh yeah     and they broke in at night and uh since then ive put in a security light and ive marked everything i you know that i have i put my drivers license number on it ugly too i mean where it could be seen because i dont care dont i just dont want them to get it and hock it again   well are you uh you said youre not in a in a rich neighborhood but are there are there obviously um       drug people in the area   no not right here i i have never even seen like uh what they call a crack house or anything i wouldnt no theres nothing like that here that i know of now im sure there are somewhere in Oak Cliff but ive never seen it were not in a bad area you know i   do you think they just kind of hit your house at random or but they were going down the street   theyve hit theyve hit my next door neighbor they hit uh the guy about two or three houses down so theyve hit several houses in the neighborhood one of them twice   so they okay so theyre really just looking for   theyre just looking   a nice enough house to find something to steal   just something they kicked my door in they literally i had a solid wooden door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it and kicked it in molding and all   oh thats scary because everybody feels youre supposed to have dead bolts   thats real scary i have a and i my insurance  paid to have the contractor come out and i we put in a another solid door and another dead bolt but it doesnt hold it   well my the front door on the house i have has uh glass in it   so does mine now this one does have glass in it   well i i wonder you know you know it i dont know this is tough but i guess the issue is is if its drug people whats the solution     uh i dont think there is a solution i i really i really dont know i really dont and you know the police told me to get a gun and if they if youre here and they try breaking in shoot them now i have never heard policemen telling people to get a gun and shoot people before   well that   but that tells you how bad the situation is that tells you how bad it is and there arent enough police and they they didnt get here till six the next morning i got home at eleven called the police immediately   umhum   several times my neighbors came over immediately we didnt even know if they were still in the house my neighbor went through looking   yeah umhum yeah   they advised on the phone that well have somebody go through and look now thats terrible and the police did not get here until seven hours later   yeah well that thats real scary   thats darn scary   but is the is the solution uh cutting off drug supply   if its possible i guess i well or is it is it or is the solution legalizing   or or is it yeah or yeah uh do you see that these people you know are they going to if if you cut supply its going to raise the price   somethings   or if you uh   if you legalize it it uh well you couldnt legalize everything okay i just dont see that you could but if you legalized marijuana and then uh taxed it and everything then everybodyd come out okay i think on that deal   well how how expensive is um how expensive is marijuana its not very expensive is it   i dont even know i really dont know   but i mean the people that are id be curious to if the people that are wouldnt you think the people that are breaking in are probably   hard drug users   are probably crack that have got a pretty high because i would think a hundred dollars worth of marijuana i dont know what it costs but   yeah   i should think thatd be more than  a lot more than just ordinary recreation it would be interesting to see if to the problem is is is what do you lock them up for you know   and then the thing is keeping them locked up   yeah   you know they pick them up they lock them up and then they they let them go   but they dont have enough proof  them   they dont have anything to keep and you never get your stuff back you never get your stuff back   and then we got to raise well we had interesting enough we had a in in Garland before we moved we had some neighborhood kids came by and stole uh uh drill and our saw and and i had them marked and uh we called the police about a week la ter the guy caught these kids riding a motor um a motor scooter or a a go it was a gocart in the in the alley and he got to talking to the kids and and we recovered the drill and the saw it was but uh it its one of those you know it was uh not a not a real expensive neighborhood       uh but its its interesting that the the motivation and the question is whats the motivation not to steal and i i guess thats what bothers its like the criminal you know if somebody says well lets lock him up for life well how should he you know what bothers me is the incentive that hes if you if you know youre going to be in there for life why should you just be good but if you if you say im not going to let you out till you have a skill and we think youre reformed well thats not how they do it they let them out when they time is served i   thats right   i i guess the problem is is is what it would take to do that would be more money than we its like the school issue and which i guess were not supposed to talk to but anyway the idea of how much money would it take to reform these criminals and lock them all up   and they think these are kids kids are probably teenagers older teenagers that have been doing this around here   hum   they uh they werent real professional well we dont know for sure but they hit they took they knew right where to go thats what scares me   in your   they went they went right to my jewelry they did not ransack my house they went right to my jewelry box and i had a ring that had my diamonds in it and my grandmothers diamonds in it that i had made and it was worth close to two thousand dollars   oh my   they got and they i mean they had pay dirt when they saw that i mean and i couldnt i worked in the shop then at TI you you know with machinery and i couldnt wear my jewelry i can wear it now i wear everything   yeah yeah   i dont leave anything home i wear everything  you bet  but uh   everything of value   they got that and the diamond necklace and stuff so they really hit pay dirt and then they grabbed my VCR also but they didnt just tear it out they very carefully unhooked everything laid everything out you know i mean it was just unbelievable   well did they did you take your TV   no they left two TVs and one was small they could have easily carried it but the police said they must have been on foot it looked like they were on foot they left my silver my silver was sitting here in a chest   yeah but who buys silver anymore   well i did   well yeah but have you bought a place setting lately i have a niece thats getting married       and uh shes not even um selecting a silver pattern because its ive forgotten my wife was telling me what the cost is just incredible to you know a place setting is is   yeah yeah   i dont know two or three hundred dollars or something i mean your silver probably is worth a lot but uh what are they going to do walk down the street and tell everybody what would you like to buy uh a     well they could they could no well they can hock it see they take everything to the pawn shops and just hock everything but um   yeah   i dont know they just hit the jewelry well i guess if they knew their jewelry they knew their but they did take some cubic zirconiums too i had a ring that they looked awfully real   yeah   and i did have a ring that that wasnt real and they took that you know and i said   well how would they know i mean they theyd have to be pretty sophisticated   they just grabbed they just grabbed but boy they sure hit pay dirt with that one ring luckily my insurance you know reimbursed me but i cant replace those diamonds   no and and and yeah how to put a value on a ring that youd made   you know to have and that had my grandmothers stones in it you know so oh i was sick   yeah that is scary   but i still havent bought a gun   well see thats the thing scares me about it is um who gets shot with the guns they say that a large number of the homicides are people that know each other that uh ive forgot what the percentage forty or fifty percent its surprisingly high that people that shoot each other know them i mean its not like you know a
