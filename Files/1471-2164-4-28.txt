                    Background        Gene expression profiles generally present signatures        for cells at specific states homeostatic or stressed        providing fingerprints critical in identifying regulatory        pathways DNA microarray technologies are designed to        reveal gene expression profiles by simultaneously detecting        the expression levels on a genomic scale      They are        now used to profile gene expression in a variety of model        systems such as antioxidant response    and tumor        staging     However the hybridization based approach        suffers from limitations including low sensitivity for        genes with small changes of expression level limited        accuracy with potential for high experimental error           and necessity for a large amount of biological starting        material The Amplified Differential Gene Expression ADGE        technique was designed to quadratically magnify the ratios        of gene expression     Briefly the control and tester        cDNAs are digested with         Taq I restriction enzyme then        ligated with the CT and TT adapters respectively The        adapterlinked control and tester DNA are reassociated        through mixing at a ratio of  denaturing and annealing        The DNA reassociation results in the quadratic        magnification of expression ratios for the up and        downregulated genes in control and tester samples The        ADGE magnification is theoretically governed by the algebra        formula a  ba  b  aa  bb  ab  ab where aa        represents the control DNA bb represents the tester DNA        and ab and ab represent hybrid DNA s For example for a        gene upregulated fold in tester over control the        formula is a  ba  b  aa  bb  ab  ab        After DNA reassociation the ratio of bb aa increases        from  to  If expression of another gene is        downregulated  times in the tester the formula is a         b a  b  aa  bb  ab  ab Therefore the        ratio of aa bb increases from  to  after        reassociation For a gene with a ratio of  the ratio is        kept unchanged after reassociation The reassociated DNA is        amplified by using PCR with the CT primer complementary to        the CT adapter or the TT primer complementary to the TT        adapter The CT primer amplifies the control DNA aa        exponentially and hybrid DNA ab and ab linearly while        the TT primer amplifies the tester DNA bb exponentially        and hybrid DNA linearly since hybrid DNA has two different        adapters at the ends The PCR not only exponentially        amplifies the control and tester DNA but also separates        them from each other The expression patterns for        overexpressed repressed and unchanged genes were profiled        with the ADGE technique     However the throughput of        ADGE is low since it displays an average of  genes at a        time with agarose gels Our present paper combines the ADGE        technique with DNA microarray hereafter called ADGE        microarray in order to integrate the high throughput of        DNA microarray with the ratio magnification and the PCR        amplification of ADGE The combination of ADGE and DNA        microarray was used to analyze differential gene expression        in a selected drug resistant cell line        The prodrug TLK        glutamylaminoethylNNNNtetrakischloroethylphosphorodiamidatesulfonylpropionylRphenylglycine        is activated by glutathione Stransferase GST P and to        a lesser degree A and generates tetrakis chloroethyl        alkylating moieties that can react with cellular        nucleophiles Cellular response to chronic TLK exposure        included a twofold decrease in GSTP protein levels        confirming a GSTP mediated mechanism of activation            Mouse embryo fibroblast cells from GSTP deficient        animals elevated the expression of signalregulated kinases        ERKERK and reduced the doubling time of cell        proliferation     That paper also found that a clone of        HL cells resistant to TLK an inhibitor of GSTP        has been shown to have elevated activities of cJun NH          terminal kinase JNK and ERKERK        In addition GSTP acts as a negative regulator of JNK        primarily through direct proteinprotein interactions             These data suggest that GSTP has a role in        regulation of kinase activities and cell proliferation               Because of this available background        information the HL wild type and TLK resistant cell        lines were chosen as model systems for analysis by ADGE        microarray The results show that ADGE microarray improves        the sensitivity and fidelity of detection and reduces the        requirement for starting material while maintaining the        high throughput of regular microarray The gene expression        profile for the resistant cells revealed with ADGE        microarray reflected changes in the expression of GSTP        and genes related to kinase and proliferation pathways                    Results                  ADGE microarray magnified ratios          The ratios detected with ADGE microarray were greater          than the corresponding input ratios The input ratios of             were detected as averages of   and           respectively after normalization with the ratio of  In          contrast these samples were detected as   and           with regular microarray values that were less than their          corresponding input ratios Fig  The power regression          best fits the data trend of ADGE microarray with the          largest R of  among linear logarithmic polynomial          power and exponential The relationship between the          detected ratio y and the input ratio x for ADGE          microarray is y  x Fig A This relationship          is close to the theoretical one of quadratic          magnification y  x  Therefore the ratios were          magnified in power function within this low range          However the linear regression best fits the data trend          of regular microarray with the largest R of  The          relationship for regular microarray is y  x            which suggests that the ratio detected with regular          microarray represents about half the input ratio within          this range          The magnification of power function continued until          the fold input ratio After that the magnitude of ADGE          magnification leveled off Fig B The overall          relationship between detected ratios and input ratios had          a logarithmic trend y  lnx   with R                                     ADGE microarray improved detection          sensitivity          The ratio magnification was also observed when the          ADGE microarray method was applied to the whole          microarray chip The MA plot of ADGE microarray has wider          upward and downward distribution from the central area          than that of regular microarray particularly for the          spots with high intensity Fig Aand B  of           genes were detected at  fold upregulated and           genes at  fold downregulated with ADGE microarray          Fig D  and  genes detected at  fold up          and downregulated respectively In contrast with          regular microarray  and  of  genes were          detected at  fold up and downregulated          respectively  and  genes at  fold up and          downregulated respectively Most outliers in regular          microarray were the results of spontaneous experimental          error with low spot intensities When only these genes          with  confidence level of t test are considered          one and three genes were detected at  fold up and          downregulated respectively with regular microarray          one gene detected at  fold downregulated Fig D          However with ADGE microarray there were  genes           fold upregulated  genes  fold upregulated           genes  fold downregulated and  genes           downregulated The ADGE magnification raised small          changes in gene expression to a level beyond the inherent          limit of DNA microarray and improved detection          sensitivity                          ADGE microarray improved detection fidelity          Multiple steps were integrated to improve the fidelity          of detection in ADGE microarray The ADGE magnification          increased the magnitude of the expression ratios beyond          the detection error of standard microarray PCR          amplification of DNA templates dramatically increased the          amount of probe The CT and TT adapters at the DNA          fragment ends facilitated efficient labeling of Cy and          Cy thus enhancing signal intensity Variances of Cy          and Cy intensities were less in ADGE microarray than in          regular microarray Fig Aand B  and  of           genes in ADGE microarray had variances of            in Cy and Cy channels respectively while in regular          microarray there are only  and  such genes          suggesting that the results among replicates were more          consistent with less variation in ADGE microarray          The confidence levels of t tests reflect the magnitude          of consistent differences between HL and HLTLK          among replicates  of  genes were identified at           confidence level  genes at   genes at           with ADGE microarray In contrast for regular          microarray  genes were detected at   genes at           and  genes at  Fig C          Among the genes with  confidence levels and           fold changes five genes were found duplicated on          the chip The results of the duplicated spots were          similar Table  For example bmi was detected at           and  in both spots                          ADGE microarray revealed genes associated with drug          resistance          ADGE microarray was used to compare expression          patterns for the TLK resistant cell line and its wild          type counterpart by screening the expression pattern of           genes Ninety three genes were selected with the          threshold average ratio  and confidence level           Among the  genes  had functions related to          cell proliferation and kinase pathways Table  In          addition expression of GSTP was reduced in the          HLTLK cell line which was consistent with a          previous study     Quantitative RTPCR confirmed the          results of ADGE microarray for eleven of thirteen genes          The other two genes were detected unchanged with RTPCR          The gene expression profile revealed with ADGE microarray          supported the principle of GSTP mediated regulation of          cell proliferation and kinase pathways                            Discussion        The ADGE technique is a method designed to magnify the        ratios of gene expression before detection The ratio        magnification was reported with a gel system    and was        observed in this study with DNA microarray Fig and         The magnification of a power function was found up to a        fold input ratio or fold detected ratio The magnitude        of magnification leveled off after that Since different        dilutions different cycles of PCR and dye reverse were        used ADGE magnification can be applied for up and        downregulated genes with different abundance One reason        for the leveloff might be the capacity of DNA microarray        to detect large ratios For instance the maximum value of        spot intensity is  in an Affymetrix scanner If an        abundant gene has an intensity of  in another scanning        channel the largest detectable ratio will be  Another        explanation might be the saturation of PCR for abundant        genes The regression equations of the detected values with        input values not only demonstrate the magnitude of        magnification with ADGE technology but also provide a        guideline to interpret the results of ADGE microarray The        quantitative relationship between input values x and        detected values y was y  x   for regular        microarray Thus regular microarray may underestimate        differences of gene expression between two samples        ADGE methodology not only magnifies the differential        expression ratios but also amplifies the amount of        templates with PCR Exponential amplification by PCR        dramatically increases the amount of probes and reduces the        requirement for starting material Based on the current        working protocol  g of total RNA from control and        tester samples was used to generate  l of reassociated        DNA  l of the reassociated DNA was needed to make probe        for one slide hybridization Thus  ng of total RNA can        be used for one slide hybridization Therefore ADGE        microarray could provide a platform for using  fold        less total RNA than regular microarray which generally        requires  g of total RNA It is also comparable to        other RNA amplification methods such as antisense RNA        amplification where    g of total RNA is required           and Aminemodified random primer where  g of        total RNA is required      PCR cycles are        recommended since too few cycles will reduce the difference        between the exponentially amplified tester or control DNA        and the linearly amplified hybrid DNA and too many cycles        will saturate abundant genes        The adapters at the DNA fragment ends facilitate        efficient incorporation of Cy and Cy into DNA templates        and enhance signal intensity Both methods of direct and        indirect labeling were used in this study With direct        labeling CydCTP is incorporated into control and        CydCTP into tester DNA during the PCR amplification of        the hybridized DNA templates The use of Cy dyes can be        reversed if required With indirect labeling        aminoallyldUTP is incorporated into control and tester DNA        with PCR of  cycles after the reassociated DNA templates        are amplified The aminoallyldUTP labeled DNA templates        are in turn coupled with Cy dyes The use of        aminoallyldUTP in PCR amplification of the hybridized DNA        template is not recommended It is also possible to adapt        other methods of signal enhancement to the labeling        procedure For example the DNA fluorescent dendrimer        probes Genisphere Montvale NJ can be attached on the CT        and TT primers which then are used to amplify the control        and tester DNAs Since both strands of the probe DNA are        labeled with direct labeling or indirect labeling the        specific intensity is enhanced The ratio of signal to        background was improved in ADGE microarray For example on        slides of  genes  genes were detected at ratios         and  genes at ratios   with ADGE        microarray In contrast  genes were detected at ratios         and  genes at ratios   with regular        microarray The reason that overall spot intensities in        Fig Aare lower than in Fig Bis that smaller gain values        were used for ADGE microarray when scanning microarray        chips        The integration of these features in ADGE microarray        improves detection sensitivity and fidelity ADGE        magnification raised small changes in gene expression to a        level beyond the inherent limit of DNA microarray Thus        genes with small expression changes could be identified        more accurately and false negatives could be minimized with        ADGE microarray  genes with  confidence level and         fold changes were identified with ADGE microarray        compared to only one such gene with regular microarray        Fig D Therefore a more informative gene profile was        revealed with ADGE microarray than with regular microarray        The probability that the ADGE magnification introduces        false positives is low The HL vs HL selfhybridization        showed that the relationship of Cy y and Cy x is y         x   with R   none of the  genes was        detected at   fold change with confidence level          Fig C Eleven of thirteen genes have consistent results        between ADGE microarray and quantitative RTPCR The other        two genes were detected unchanged with RTPCR Table                Experimental artifacts in microarray data are        intensitydependent and tend to occur primarily for weak        spots     The nucleporin  kD AA with the        largest standard deviation in the Table had weak signal        Exponential amplification of DNA templates and double        strand labeling in ADGE microarray dramatically enhances        the signal intensity of spots Combined with magnified        ratios the enhanced signal intensities improve the data        quality and detection fidelity in ADGE microarray More        genes have low variances in both Cy and Cy channels and        high confidence levels in ADGE microarray than in regular        microarray Fig  The similarity and reproducibility of        results between duplicate spots also suggests the        improvement of detection fidelity Table         The sensitive and accurate method of ADGE microarray        provides a novel tool to reveal informative gene profiles         of the  differential genes were clustered in cell        proliferation and kinase pathways Expression changes of        genes related to regulation of cell proliferation may be        directly pertinent to the resistant phenotype or may be a        consequence of cell growth under drug stressed conditions        Adaptive changes in kinase expression have been        characterized in a variety of drug resistant cells For        example the stress kinase JNK was activated during TLK        induced apoptosis    and JNK is known to be activated        during apoptosis induced by a variety of stress stimuli            However in HLTLK resistant cells we observed        an overexpression of two phosphatases         PP AA and         MKP AA involved in JNK        dephosphorylation and inactivation Table  PP is a        serinethreonine phosphatase which dephosphorylates JNK        during inflammatory cell signaling     while MKP is a        member of the dual specificity phosphatase family which        selectively dephosphorylates stress activated MAP kinases        including JNK     The overexpression of these two        phosphatases might contribute in part to the resistance of        HLTLK by impairing the activity of JNK Kinase        pathways particularly those involving ERK and JNK are        suggested to have prominent roles in regulation of        proliferation pathways in a variety of cell lines              Reduced expression of         GSTP in the resistant cells        provides a plausible link with the JNK and ERK regulation        pathways in the resistant cells Although the interaction        among         GSTP and genes of proliferation        and kinase pathways needs to be verified and the roles of        other differential genes in the TLK resistant cell line        need further investigation the expression pattern        generated with ADGE microarray provides a blueprint for        designing further experiments                    Conclusions        ADGE microarray is the combination of ADGE technique and        DNA microarray It magnified the ratios of differential        gene expression in power function improved detection        sensitivity and fidelity and reduced the requirement for        starting material while maintaining high throughput ADGE        microarray generated a more informative expression pattern        than regular microarray                    Methods                  Cell lines          The HLTLK cell line is resistant to the prodrug          TLK and derived from the wildtype HL by

        In order to verify the ratio magnification for ADGE          and to build a relationship between input and detected          ratios a contiguous area of twelve spots    on the

cut with           Taq I at C for  hr The same          amount of           Taq I fragments for each clone was          ligated to the CT and TT adapters at C overnight The          CT and TT adapterlinked DNA fragments were mixed in          ratios of  for the three clones of the first column           and  for the clones of the second column  and           for the clones of the third

       denaturing at C for  min and annealing at C for           hr Due to high concentration of templates and          possibility of effects of template abundance the          reassociated DNA was diluted  or  times then          amplified using PCR with the CT or TT primers A PCR          reaction was set up with  l of the reassociated DNA           l of x Clontech PCR buffer  l of  mM dNTPS
