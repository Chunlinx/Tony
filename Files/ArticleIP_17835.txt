                                  Linda Tripps Payoff            You give the president ablow job and he gives you a soft job high pay no qualifications no heavylifting Right Thats what poor Monica Lewinsky thought And the theory of theRepublican impeachment drive is not too different Although the alleged quidpro quo was the helping to cover up the sex rather than the sex itself andalthough Lewinsky never actually enjoyed the alleged payoff the articles ofimpeachment nevertheless assume that Flytrap is about an exchange offavors            How naive Anyone whounderstands bureaucracies should know that the way to get a cushy job isnt tomake yourself desirable but to make yourself undesirable Thats why whilewere suffering through a national crisis over alleged favors to Lewinsky theone person who clearly has enjoyed a big payoffat taxpayer expenseis thearchdragoness Linda Tripp            Tripp was a secretary at the White House a holdover fromthe Bush administration When she began to look like trouble she wastransferred to the Pentagon The choice of the Pentagon is no surpriseAlthough conservatives who inveigh against overpaid donothing federalbureaucrats probably have in mind the Department of Health and Human Servicesif your urgent need is a government job in general rather than anything inparticular that job might accomplish apparently the Pentagon is your bestshot            Besides a military forceof one and a half million people the Defense Department employs about civilians Linda Tripp is one of them holding the position of public affairsspecialist with a civil service ranking of GS Step  That puts theyearold highschool grad at the top of the Pentagons middle managementranks Like all GS employees she just received an acrosstheboardpayincrease Tripps raise including a locality adjustment for working in theWashington DC area was  percent bringing her salary to  ayear            For which she does  Since March  nothing Althoughshe has supposedly been working at home she was stripped of her dutiesbutnot her pay or her titleshortly after the scandal broke Tripp hascharacterized this as a politically motivated demotion It will strike manyas a demotion devoutly to be wished            Monica Lewinskys titleat the Pentagon was confidential assistant to the assistant secretary forpublic affairs Her job was writing press releases for which she was paid Note that Lewinsky got this job as a payoff for being undesirable to apresidential aide not for being desirable to the president            Officially Tripp is the public affairs specialist for aprogram called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference an arguablyworthwhile annual propaganda effort that takes  civilian public opinionleaders on a weeklong tour of military operations Tripp had primaryresponsibility for the paperwork involved in the selection process for makingtravel and hotel arrangements as well as for other logistic odds and ends suchas the weeks kickoff banquet According to the New York Times  beforeTripp took the job this position was parttime            When pressed for more detail the person now doingTripps job used the word coordinating a lot but that was about it Thereis it turns out no official description of the job Writing one is among thetasks Tripp is being paid to perform now            But there are officialdescriptions of other GS public affairs specialist positions For instancethe US Commission on Civil Rights is currently looking for someone to assistin the reviews and analysis of numerous requests for speeches to developclear release and distribute a wide range of information and data concerningthe nature and objective of the Commissions programs and to prepare pressreleases fact sheets etc and arrange press conferences Translation PRgrunt Salary  to             To try to get some sort of independent measure of whatthese jobs are worth I called Kelly Services the nationwide temp agencyWithout mentioning Tripp or the Pentagon I described her job there to thewoman at Kelly Oh she said thats highend secretarial How much would youhave to pay somebody to do a job like that I asked Oh  to  an hourshe said Thats  to  a yearroughly half of what Tripp is beingpaid not to do it            Whats more there is noevidence of any competitive evaluation of Tripp before she was offered thisjob The employee a problem in one place was simply moved to another Theresa name for this personnel technique Its called Pass the Trash Federalcivilian employees who dont commit felonies and dont cuss out theirsupervisors pretty much have a guaranteed job with guaranteed wages for lifeTripp has spent  years in this cocoon which will enable her to retire on ahandsome pension based on the average of her three highest consecutive yearsof pay            Will her job description be done by then How long could ittake Shes still working on it a Pentagon source tells me Whats theopposite of stress Where else could you pull down over  and live such adeadlinefree existence And have that much free time to gab with yourgirlfriends            Not all the timewasters in the Pentagon arecivilians There are plenty of deadend GIs in deadend jobs too But at leastmost of them did something important earlier in their careersand probablysomething dangerous to boot And Tripps pay and retirement benefits arestaggering compared with those of the men and women in those hard jobs nowMost of the folks on duty in the skies over Iraq make about half of what LindaTripp makes Indeed Tripp pulls down more than all but a handful of the USmilitarys most senior officers She earns more than a ballistic missilesubmarine commander and is on a par with aircraft carrier skippers in thePersian Gulf and Army generals ready to lead thousands of troops intocombat            Imagine what Bob Barr and Henry Hyde would say ifMonica had got a deal like that
