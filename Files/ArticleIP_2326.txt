                                 Secretary Albright Meet Dr No            Last month as the UnitedStates was Tomahawking Osama Bin Laden another littlenoticed American foreignpolicy drama was playing out in the Caribbean On the tiny island nation of StKitts a cocaine smuggler named Charles Little Nut Miller threatened tomurder American veterinary students at the islands university unless theUnited States dropped its efforts to extradite him A former drug informant anda dropout from the US witness protection program Miller has found a safehaven on St Kitts where his bullying and his cash have won him enormouspolitical influence with the islands shaky government At the news of Millersthreat the State Department flew diplomatic security advisers to St Kitts toreassure students some of the young Americans fled home and there were evenrumors of a Grenadalike military strike to capture Miller            TheMiller imbroglio and the assault on Bin Laden would appear to have nothing incommon but they both illustrate a peculiar development in American foreignpolicy James Bondification            The United States born and raised during the age of thenationstate is accustomed to thinking of the nation as the natural unit offoreign policy The United States negotiates with nations trades with nationsissues sanctions against nations and makes war on nations But the UnitedStates has begun to realize that it lives in a very different kind of worldone filling up with what policy types call nonstate actors and whatmoviegoers recognize as James Bond villains The nonstate actors range from cent thugs such as Miller who has merely shanghaied a small island toworldclass dastards such as Bin Laden who runs a supranational organizationhas loyalty to no government owns a vast fortune and an armory of hightechweapons and is engaged in an elaborate conspiracy so secretive that we werenot aware of it till it smacked us in the head Habituated to presidents andprime ministers we are now dealing with autonomous mysterious charactersdriven by motives that baffle us and who are unchecked by any government BinLaden may not be quite as masterful as Blofeld and Miller may not be quite assinister as Mr Big but theyre closer to them than we might think            Nonstateactors are not of course an invention of the s The United States foughtits first war against the Barbary Pirates who terrorized US shipping in theMediterranean at the turn of the  th century More recently YasserArafats stateless Palestine Liberation Organization and terrorist groups suchas Hamas and Islamic Jihad built organizations that have shaken governmentsaround the world But there is no doubt that the variety and power of nonstateactors is greater now than it has been for centuries Bin Ladens worldwideterror network is currently dominating headlines but other terrorist groupsare thriving as well Colombian Mexican Caribbean and Southeast Asian druglords have neutralized or purchased governments and recruited private armiesHong Kong triads have established themselves as autonomous powers in much ofAsia What was Soviet Central Asia is now a freefire zone Drug mineral andarms barons compete for power while legitimate governments of the region arepatsies by comparison Even corporations are getting into the Bond businessExecutive Outcomes a South African mercenary business recently invadedstabilized and controlled Sierra Leone for a yearinterrupting a longwagedcivil warin order to protect that countrys diamond mines            One reason why this Bondification seems to beproliferating is the decline of the nationstate As Robert Kaplan chronicledin The Ends of the Earth  environmental collapse tribal conflictsoverpopulation and urbanization have undermined Third World governments Formost of this century colonial rulers or nationalist dictators dominatedcountries monopolizing power with mighty central governments But centralauthority has vanished in much of Africa and Asia and nonstate actors havefilled the vacuum Where anarchy reigns dollars can buy a private empire Itsno surprise that Bin Laden chose Sudan and Afghanistan as bases Neithercountry has had a functioning government for  years Bin Laden paid theTaliban a few million dollars a year and guaranteed himself cover Drugdealers similarly have purchased fiefs throughout Latin America and theCaribbean The difference between yesterday and today is the differencebetween Grenada and St Kitts Fifteen years ago the United States invaded aCaribbean island to get rid of a Communist government we didnt likeToday we could invade a Caribbean island to get rid of a drug dealer wedont like This is government privatization twisted beyond recognition            Thisanarchy has so far limited itself to marginal countriesAfghanistan SudanSierra Leone etcbut soon warns Kaplan a major nation like Pakistan willcollapse And when that happens who knows what nutters will emerge Pakistanhas  million people So if it goes there will be a lot of crazy lunaticsloose says Kaplan            There is another more artificial reason why America isincreasingly challenged by Bond villains We create them The American publicgenerally yawns at the rest of the world The tried and true method for ginningup excitement about a foreign entanglement is to demonize to focus on a singleforeign scoundrel We battle Saddam Hussein not Iraq Muammar Qaddafi notLibya Manuel Noriega not Panama Similarly its easier to pin Americas drugproblem on Pablo Escobar or to blame global terrorism on a single nefariouspuppeteer such as Bin Laden It was astonishing how rapidly Bin Laden emergedas Americas most hated man One day a few State Department operatives knewhis name The next day we all did and we were mad as hell at him            Demonization creates adilemma for American foreign policy makers The best way to generate popularsupport is to personalize the fight And yet US policy forbids America fromactually trying to assassinate the chosen villain Here is the heart of thedilemma of Bondification We know how James Bond neutralizes Bond villains buthow does a great power do it The cruise missile strike against Bin Ladeneerily mirrored the latest Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies  which openswith a cruise missile strike against a terrorist gathering in Central Asia Butyou cant rely on Bond tactics forever We bombed Bin Laden once Can we keepdoing it Is it acceptable to pluck Little Nut Miller off St Kitts Or doesthat violate the islands sovereignty These are questions to which we dontknow the answer            More worrisome is that therise of Bond villains encourages Americans to mistake the enemy for the issueAmerican and Colombian drug warriors concentrated obsessively on destroying thewicked Escobar and his Medelln cartel But while they pursued Escobar thecocaine market opened for the Cali cartel Enemy eliminated but problemintact Bin Laden is a fearsome enemy of the United States and the sooner heskilled the better But even if he dropped dead today there would still bemillions of underemployed undereducated alienated men in the Middle Eastready to follow a charismatic militant antiAmerican leader In a Bond moviewhen  kills the archenemy the crisis disappears In the real world it maynot
