                      Where To Go        The Southeast        A land of rolling hills and deciduous trees tiny hamlets        and green meadows the Southeast is the most popular area of the Lake        District if not the most dramatic visually Youll have to go farther        north to reach the rugged fell landscapes  The reputation of this        area was guaranteed when the Victorian railway was built Workers from        the cities in northern England came to enjoy the fresh air and rich        industrialists built large lakeside houses surrounded by pleasant        landscaped gardens Many of these manors have now been converted into        hotels known for comfortable accommodations and stunning views        Lake Windermere        The largest of the lakes at  km  miles north to south        Lake Windermere has always been the most accessible and therefore not        surprisingly it is now the most developed During the summer you will        have to share the shoreline with many thousands of other visitors        Ferry services plying the lake provide one of the best ways to view        coastline and the thickly wooded hills above Boats are available for        rent and waterskiing and powerboat racing are very popular        pastimes        Among the several islands of interest on the lake is Belle        Isle still privately owned by the Curwen family descendants

way back to England living        out his life on Belle Isle protected by his family Several local        residents are said to have caught a glimpse of him but there is no firm        evidence to support this claim        Bowness and Windermere        Originally separate settlements these two towns have now        merged to the point that visitors cant tell where one starts and the        other finishes Genteel Windermere is more modern having grown up        around the railway station after the line was opened in  If you        travel by train to the Lakes this is where you will arrive Just        around the corner from the station is the Tourist Information Centre        which will supply all the information you need about touring        accommodations and restaurants The town has a number of art galleries        and many fine period hotels and although it has few attractions it is        a good base for trips farther afield in the Lakes        Bowness began as small fishing village on the lakeside but        today it is a resort Its still modest in size but it becomes full to        the brim on summer weekends when families head here for fresh air The        town has many hotels and a number of shops where you can buy souvenirs        or outdoor clothing        Everyone seems to congregate around the lakes edge where        feeding the ducks and swans is a

theater is The World of Beatrix Potter an        exhibition that provides a comprehensive introduction to the woman and        her work The presentation begins with a short video about the Potter        stories and how they relate to the Lake District landscape A        delightful series of dioramas then introduce Peter Rabbit Mrs        TiggiWinkle and Squirrel Nutkin among others set in scenes

summer season youll share the town with        many thousands of people all jostling to stay on the narrow sidewalks        In the Victorian era the town expanded northward from its original        site a Roman settlement at Waterhead the commercial center now lies        approximately  km  mile from the lake        Waterhead Amblesides harbor has a few shops that cater        to the ferries

bubbling waters of Stock Ghyll now serves as a National Trust        Information Centre and pickup point for the National Trust tour bus        Across the main road from the house are several small

    Stock Ghyll Force was one of the most popular visitor        attractions during Victorian times The m ft waterfall was        easily accessible from the town even by ladies wearing the large heavy        skirts of the time Today people still take the same route to the force        signposted behind Barclays Bank in the town center and to Stock        Ghyll Water Mill The Armitt Library and Museum Centre just a little        way beyond Bridge House offers an interesting view on the life of the        Lakes through the letters and books of local people Founded by Mary        Louisa Armitt

       had been its most famous member and the Ruskin Library which included        many of Ruskins private letters Over the years the collection has        grown to incorporate many objects and works

directory        Troutbeck        Sitting on the slopes of the Troutbeck Valley high above        Bowness and Ambleside Troutbeck is a tiny village of traditional farms        and barns The village is

A perfect example of a statesman farmers house this        structure had been in the hands of the same family from the time it was        built until it was taken over by the National Trust in  There

long and Grasmere village        lie below a circle of rounded hills Access to the lakeside is        restricted but the view from Loughrigg Terrace is one of the best in        the Lake District and an easy walk from the village Rydal Water the        smallest of the lakes in the entire Lake District sits beside it        thousands of rushes line its banks Grasmere village is one of the        prettiest communities in the Lakes but also one of the busiest A        settlement of stone cottages founded by Norse settlers it became home        to William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy in  The surrounding        landscape with drystone walls farmhouses and the Rothay river        valley became a source of inspiration for their artistic endeavors        Dove Cottage was their first home Wordsworth loved the place and wrote        some of his most memorable poetry while living here The house has        changed little since then it has been faithfully preserved along with        the garden the siblings faithfully tended Much of the furniture inside        belonged to the family        In  William married Mary Hutchinson the cottage became        their family home Eventually there wasnt enough space to house their        children and their many visitors so in  the family moved to a        larger home on the other side of the village The Wordsworth Trust now        manages the property and offers a guided tour of the cottage that        provides insights into the life of the writer his family and his        friends Behind the cottage the Wordsworth Museum displays many of        Wordsworths original manuscripts and other personal objects        Headphones allow you to listen to some of Williams works while you        view images of the landscapes that inspired him The poet and many        members of his family are buried in the graveyard of the Parish Church        of St Oswald in the heart of Grasmere The church itself is worthy of        investigation The structure dates from the th century but a rather        dull stucco finish was added in the th century A rushbearing        ceremony see page  is held here each August At the corner of the        churchyard is Sara Nelsons Gingerbread Shop which is still making        gingerbread and other goodies just as Sara herself once did for        Victorian visitors who came to find Wordsworths house The tiny shop        was once the village schoolroom where children would sit with chalk        and slate board        The Wordsworth family made one more move to Rydal Mount at        the eastern tip of Rydal Water and it was here that William lived for        the last  years of his life It is a much grander residence than Dove        Cottage yet it remains true to the poets philosophy and world        viewits neither too imposing nor too lavish Still owned by        descendants of the poet it is a family home rather than a museum        though it has been open to the public since  There are many        personal pieces and family portraits in the house along with original        Wordsworth manuscripts The grounds are also very much as Wordsworth        and Dorothy landscaped them with four acres of sculptured lawn and a        natural environment in which animals and birds thrive The house has        beautiful views of Lake Windermere which must have brought the poet        great pleasure in his later years        The whole area around Grasmere and Rydal Water is full of        gentle walks in beautiful deciduous woodland For a wonderful walk that        fills a whole day try

of narrow alleys that link the houses        can be confusing as there are few street signs to guide you but the        Tourist Information Centre provides an invaluable guide Park in the        main car park and walk the few meters into the village There are many        gems to be discovered tiny leaded windows gargoyles in the eaves and        flowerfilled boxes on every window ledge        The

The fledgling poet carved his name in one of the        plain wooden desks which proves that even a literary giant can once        have been a naughty schoolboy During this time he and his brothers        lodged with Anne Tyson in a little house in the village        The Beatrix Potter Gallery is housed in a tiny building on        Main Street that was once the office of William Heelis Potters

retreat is on the western        shore of Lake Windermere at the village of Near Sawrey The house was        bought with the royalties she earned from her first book The Tales of        Peter Rabbit

enjoyed        the life of a lady farmer tending her crops and breeding Herdwick        sheep a breed which was at that time waning in popularity but of which        she was very fond It is said that one of the conditions of her bequest        to the National Trust was that Herdwick sheep must always be bred on        her farms The Tower Bank Arms a pub that was featured in The Tale of        Gemima Puddleduck is very close to the cottage and a good place to        stop for refreshment Nearby is Esthwaite Water a quiet lake that has        a reputation for go od trout fishing

gave land        to build a priory at Cartmel and during the Middle Ages it was a large        and very wealthy concern In his original covenant Marshall stipulated        that money would be available for the priory only if a part of the        church were opened to the people of the surrounding countryside for        worship Thus in effect the priorys church became a parish church        even though it was tended by a closed religious order This clause        became important at the time of the dissolution when Henry VIII        destroyed other monasteries and priories Cartmel church was saved only        because it also served as a parish church for the community Wander        around the church thth century to find some interesting        artifacts of local history Look for the

   Coniston was a true working town and this heritage sets it apart from        the other major towns in the Lakes Less sophisticated than Ambleside        and less commercial than Bowness it has a simple charm that many        visitors find more appealing The remains of mining and quarrying sites        on the face of The Old Man of Coniston the mountain above the town        are a reminder of its history John Ruskin whose house sits on the        eastern shore of Coniston Water chose to be buried here in the        graveyard of the parish church rather than in Westminster Abbey in        London The town in turn has honored him with a small museum        Coniston Water        Coniston Water is long and narrow the straightest of the        Lake District lakes It was this feature that attracted speedboat racer        Donald Campbell Hed had a series of victories in various types of        powered vehicles including a victory on land at Daytona Beach in        Florida before coming to Coniston in  to attempt to break the        world record in speed boating His efforts at Coniston ended in        tragedy however as his boat left the water at high speed and broke        into several pieces on shore Campbells body was never recovered        Happier experiences were recorded by Arthur Ransom in his        book Swallows and Amazons  The lake and its islands were his        inspiration for the story about the adventures of a group of children        who are left to their own devices one summer in an age when innocence        and security were taken for granted        A pleasant way to enjoy the lake is to take a trip on the        Victorian steamer Gondola The National Trust runs the boat which        resembles the Venetian rowboats and the plush interior takes one back        to the genteel times when tourism was just in its infancy when this        steamer ride would have been just one part of a European Grand Tour         The whole journey on this steamer takes about an hour        One port of call for both Gondola and the other local boat        service Coniston Launch is Brantwood on the eastern shoreline This        was the home of the thcentury artist critic and reformer John        Ruskin one of the preeminent men of his time Author of over  books        and a prolific artist and art collector he is perhaps best remembered        as a social theorist in this century many prominent figures including        Mahatma Gandhi have been inspired by his writings Ruskin lived at        Brantwood from  until his death in  and in that time the house        became a leading center of artistic and literary energy much as        Wordsworths in Grasmere had just a few years before Ruskin funded        educational programs on the role of women in society and research into        environmental pollution long before these issues became fashionable        Sadly he became mentally unstable in his later life and died a broken        man        The house which contains Ruskins study and examples of        his drawings and paintings has magnificent views of the lake and the        town of Coniston The gardens laid out by Ruskin himself cover nearly        one square kilometer  acres Each year numerous exhibitions and        openair performances are held on the estate and a commercial gallery        on the grounds has an excellent selection of contemporary arts and        crafts        The Langdale Fells        If you have limited time in the Lake District and want to        experience the high fells do a little beginnerslevel hiking or        simply drive through some breathtaking countryside then this is the        place to visit The Great Langdale and Little Langdale areas can be        said to be the true heart of the Lake District lying as they do in the        very centre of the National Park Interestingly enough although        possibly the best loved landscape in the Lake District for walkers and        artistsWordsworth described it as unity austere but        reconciledthere is not a lake in sight Their beauty and        accessibility being only a short drive from Ambleside make them a        must for all visitors        The initial approach route along the A from Ambleside        is characterized by rocky knolls rising from the valley bottoms The        River Brathay runs alongside the main road carrying water from the        fells that eventually flows into Lake Windermere At Skelwith Bridge        turn right on to the B The road leaves the valley floor and takes        you past the small villages of Elterwater and Chapel Stile before        offering the first real views of the Langdale Fells The beautiful        valleys and magnificent volcanic peakswith such whimsical names as        Harrison Stickle and Crinkle Cragsproduce some of the finest vistas        in the Lakes No matter what the weather is like the landscape is        dramatic and breathtaking If there is only one place where you get out        of the car and do a little walking this has to be it Make a stop at        Blea Tarn only about a tenminute walk from the car park this        beautiful body of water surrounded by the high fells offers one of        the most beautiful views in the National Park On a quiet day youll        feel as if you have the world to yourself        From Blea Tarn the road drops sharply down to a Tjunction        with signs right to Wrynose Pass Take a left towards the tiny village        of Little Langdale You will need to take care here as there may be        walkers on the road especially at lunch time when everyone gathers in        the village for a pint and a sandwich Finally once through the        village of Colwith you will reach the main road the A and a right        turn will lead you back to Ambleside        Wrynose Pass and Hardknott Pass        West from Little Langdale toward the coast of the Irish        Sea there is only a single routeand it is one that tests the nerve        of even the most experienced driver The road climbs up through the        tree line and into bracken fell plateaus with thickets of shrubs and        sheep country until you reach the most difficult stretch of road in the        Lake District over the passes of Wrynose and Hardknott        Wrynose Pass comes first a singletrack road with        gradients of  will have you dodging sheep and other motorists around        blind bends As the road climbs though it offers spectacular views        back to Little Langdale in the east get out at the small car park at        the top of the pass and take photographs The Three Shires Stone at the        roadside marks the meeting place of the historic shires of Lancashire        Cumberland and Westmoreland The road then drops down to Wrynose        Bottom a plain bereft of human life The road shares the valley bottom        with the Duddon River flowing west to the sea The fell has an eerie        beauty about it clouds frame the peaks here even on sunny days        Hardknott Pass with gradients of  is the mother of all        Lakeland passes the road is narrow and steep and twists like a        switchback ride At the height of the season it can be choked with        traffic and there are few passing places Its a challenge but many        say that you havent seen the Lakes unless youve traveled this road        Try it early in the day when theres much less traffic or if you        really dont want to test your own driving skills you can arrange for        an organized tour with a driver contact the Cumbria Tourist Board for        more details see page         The Hardknott Castle Roman Fort called Mediobogdum by its        builders sits on a shelf near the summit of the pass The thick walls        still clearly outline the forts boundaries Take a walk around the        perimeter for breathtaking views of the valley below Even on the        warmest day a stiff cold breeze blows steadily up the fell Just        imagine the kind of homesick letters a Romanborn legionnaire would        have written back home        Eskdale        Once you make it over the high point of Hardknott Pass        Eskdale opens up in front of you Its almost like catching sight of        Shangrila the vibrant green vall ey contrasts starkly with the        rustcolored high ground High drystone walls curb the narrow roads and        rugged farmhouses nestle in the bottom of the valley The tiny village        of Boot two hundred yards from the main road is the first sign of        civilization youll encounter after coming over the passes The two        dozen or so housesincluding some of the best selfcatering lodgings        in the Lakesare clustered in a peaceful setting surrounded by the        higher fells of Birker and Eskdale        The Eskdale Corn Mill sits at the very top of the village        over Pack Horse Bridge This thcentury mill is still powered by the        force of Whillan Beck the water that comes racing down from the fells        above There are many signposted walks from Boot into the surrounding        countryside including a km mile walk to the waterfalls of        Stanley Force across the valley        A little way along from Boot youll find the terminus of        the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway or Laal Ratty as its        affectionately known A cm in narrowgauge railway it carries        a tiny engine and even smaller carriages through rolling countryside        towards the coast at Ravenglass Opened in  to carry iron it been        operating as a recreational railway since  a favorite with        railroad enthusiasts it runs all year round        Wast Water        The deepest of all the lakes at  m  ft Wast Water        is bounded on the east side by steep slopes of gray scree small loose        stones that tumble into the watery depths and on the west by        stretches of bracken The lake itself lies in the shadow of several        high mountains including Scafell Pike the highest in England at  m         ft        This remote area is reached by a single long route from the        central lakes at the end of which youll find the scattered buildings        of the village of Wasdale Head The rocks in this territory are        volcanic and relatively young compared to the hills of the north They        have produced a stark and uncompromising landscape with few trees        breaking the lines of the mountaintops A total contrast to the pretty        rolling hills of Derewentwater and Grasmere it is a stark beauty        though no less alluring On fine days the sunshine and shadows chase        constantly across the water and rocky wastes but stormy fronts that        form in the Atlantic Ocean are caught by the mountain tops here as a        result of which they are almost always enveloped in clouds        Wasdale the birthplace of British fellwalking is still        very popular with experienced fellwalkers because its rocky crags give        access to some of the most challenging hiking in the Lakes Many who        have their sights set on the Alps and Himalayas come to train on the        peaks in this area There are few easy walks on the higher ground but        around Wast Water and in the valley bottom you can enjoy footpaths that        offer panoramic views of the mountains The Wasdale Head Inn is a        traditional meeting place resting as it does in the lea of all the        sheer ascents Youre bound to meet some hardy outdoor types in the        bar        A curious competition is held in Wasdale each November The        Biggest Liar in the World Competition is an amateur storytelling        contest open to all comers Fishermen and anglers seem to have the edge        over most but politicians and journalists are actually banned from        taking part since they are regarded as professionals        Ravenglass        The Lake District National Park encompasses a short area of        coastline where the tidal estuaries of the North Sea meet the streams        and rivers flowing down from the western lakes The main settlement on        this coast is Ravenglass a curious town of one main street with a        hundred or so neat cottages huddled together against the prevailing        winter winds First settled by the Romans it sits on a wide estuary        created by the confluence of three rivers The Romans called their town        Clanoventa the town on the bank All that remains of the original        settlement are the ruins of a Roman bathhouse just a little ways from        todays town Walk under the railway line and turn right down a farm        track This is the headquarters of the Ravenglass and Eskdale        Railwaythe little trains spend the night in the sidings here The        station has a bar and a collection of railway memorabilia        The tidal estuary harbors a number of islands that serve as        important breeding grounds for seabirds It can be dangerous to explore        the open sandy areas on these islands since the tides rise very        quickly be sure to check the tidal tables before setting out        Nearby is Muncaster Castle a structure offering much in        the way of English history Built on Roman foundations the castle was        erected in the late th century to keep the Scots at bayits        strategic position affords good views of the surrounding lowland Since        the th century the castle has been owned by the Pennington family        who feel that their tenancy is protected by the terms of an ancient        royal gift In  after the Battle of Hexham King Henry VI wandered        the countryside and many of the landowners unsure whether he was        victor or vanquished refused to give him shelter Sir John Pennington        however invited him into Muncaster When Henry returned to his duties        he gave his drinking bowl to the family saying that as long as the cup        remained unbroken the family would remain at Muncaster Needless to say        the bowl which is still in one piece is kept under lock and key at        all times        Over the generations the castle has been expanded but it        is still essentially a family home full of furniture books and        family portraits Visitors can tour the house with a taperecorded        narrative that gives detailed information about each room The         hectares  acres of garden are equally pleasing Rhododendrons and        other exotic plants imported from China during the th century have        created one of the finest gardens in northern England The castle        grounds are also home to The Owl Centre a conservancy devoted to        saving the  species of owl found around the world Calling itself a        Noahs ark for owls the Owl Centre hosts a bird flight event every        afternoon at         Muncaster Mill  km  miles north of the castle started        operating in  although the present building dates from the th        century It is still used to grind oatmeal and wholewheat flour which        is available for sale The mill sits on the River Mite and Laal        Ratty makes a regular stop here        Duddon Valley        The Duddon Valley and the rolling hillsides around the        village of Ulpha were much favored by Wordsworth He wrote Sonnets on        the River Duddon in praise of the area This is true moorlandopen        stretches of heath that contrast sharply with the high peaks in the        background The views of Scafell and the Cumbrian Mountains from the        road that crosses Ulpha Fell in the direction of Eskdale and Eskdale        Green are splendid And if you really cannot face the excitement and        exhilaration of crossing Wrynose and Hardknott passes this road offers        a far less taxing way to reach the coast and the far west of the        Lakeland        The Northeast        Boasting some of William Wordsworths favorite haunts as        well as an old Roman road that is now a very popular hiking route the        Northeast is spectacular walking country transitional terrain between        the Lake Districts high fells and peaks and the lowland passes around        Penrith and the Eden valley These passes were used as a gateway to the        Lake District by armies of marauding Scots All of these passes and        many kilometers of walking trails surround the regions single though        impressive large lakeUllswater At the eastern reaches the high        ground gives way to undulating farmland        Kirkstone Pass        Leading northeast from Lake Windermere to Ullswater        Kirkstone Pass on the A is the highest in the Lakes m         ft The Kirkstone Inn an old coach house and now local landmark was        built here to shelter travelers on the hazardous trip between Penrith        and the central lakes area Despite the high altitude Kirkstone Pass        is in fact the easiest of the Lake District passes to traverse since        the valley floor is very wide even at the highest level Watch for a        car park just beyond the summit where you can stop and enjoy the        aweinspiring view north over the diminutive Brothers Water so called        because two brothers were said to have drowned in its depths        The road then follows the valley bottom through the towns        of Patterdale and Glenridding Both towns once centers for mining are        good starting points for walking hiking and pony trekking into the        surrounding fells and mountains        Ullswater        Ullswater is the one major lake in the northeast corner of        the Lake District At  km  miles in length it is the        secondlargest lake after Windermere but it does not have the        commercial development of its big brother and is far less busy The        character of the lake changes as you travel along its length the shape        of the valley constantly alters the perspective a fact that has not        been overlooked by generations of painters and photographers Many        people visit the area to take advantage of the water sports it is        particularly popular with canoeists Both Glenridding and Patterdale        offer boat rentals The road from Ambleside to Penrith A runs        along the length of the north shore From here it is possible to stop        and admire the view Those who dont want to drive or walk around it        can take the ferry which travels down the whole length of the lake        from Glenridding to Pooley Bridge        Gowbarrow Park        Just beyond the turning for Dockray is Gowbarrow Park        which rolls across the hillside above Ullswater This is the spot where        Wordsworths sister Dorothy was stopped in her tracks by what she        believed were the most beautiful daffodils she had ever seen her        astonishment inspired Wordsworth to write about this host of golden        Daffodils in one of the bestloved poems of the English language I        Wandered Lonely as a Cloud  The park is at its very best in        spring when you can walk through a carpet of flowers surrounded by the        fresh green leaves of the newly awakened woodland        Here youll also encounter one of the most popular        waterfalls in the Lake District Beautiful at any time of year Aira        Force is a m ft waterfall spanned at its peak by a narrow stone        footbridge It is a favorite subject for photographers in part        because of the wonderful woodland setting with rare mosses and        fantastic Monkey Puzzle trees The car park from the A offers the        shortest route to the falls        At the northern tip of Ullswater there is a right turn to        Pooley Bridge the northernmost stop for the lake steamer The road        leads farther along the eastern shore of the lake to Martindale with        its pretty Elizabethan church St Martin Though the road eventually        reaches a dead end there are a number of marked hiking routes back        towards Ullswater or south over higher ground to Patterdale About  km         miles farther down the road is the Sharrow Bay Hotel the first and        arguably still the best countryhouse hotel in the Lake District Try        lunch or afternoon tea on the terrace        Dalemain Country House        This distinguished house is remarkable for its longevity        and conglomeration of architectural styles Behind the fine Georgian        faade made of local sandstone is a genuine Tudor structure        including the Fretwork Room with its magnificent thcentury oak        paneling a manor hall dating from  which now houses the        restaurantcaf and a Norman pele tower In the th century when        the house consisted of little more than the pele tower it was owned by        the de Morville family one of the more infamous members of this        family Hugh de Morville was one of the four knights who murdered        Thomas  Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in  Since  it has        been owned by the Hasell family who built the Georgian extension and        who over the generations have carefully managed the treasures that fill        the house Visitors today can examine the traces of the houses        complicated architectural legacy and explore such fascinating        historical oddities as the priests hiding hole built during the        Reformation as an emergency escape route for Catholic priests who had        been invited in to say Mass Access to the chapel and the hiding hole        was through the fireplace which would be lit to help confound        pursuers There are also a number of museums in the magnificent        grounds including a Fell Pony Museum and the Yeomans Museum        Rheged        This attraction an amazing adventure in an ancient kingdom        opened during the summer of  and offers a chance to take a journey        through the history of Cumbria There are displays exhibitions and a        massive multiscreen cinema experience complimented by speciality        shops restaurants cafs and an indoor play center All this is in a        fantastic fivestory building in the middle of an old quarry The roof        is covered in grass making it the largest earth covered building in        Britain        Penrith        The gateway to the Lake District for those traveling from        the north Penrith was often at the center of battles between the        English and the Scots for control of this frontier territory The town        center is a curious tangle of winding streets laid out that way some        say to confound enemies The many little alleys or yards as        theyre called were used to protect herds of sheep brought down from        the fells during times of crisis Today it is a thriving market town        not yet in the full grip of the tourist boom The lively cattle market        makes Penrith a center for the economic activity of the area The        Tourist Information Centre and a small town museum are housed in a        plain sturdy building from Elizabethan times known as Robinsons        School Above the town across from the railway station are the        remains of Penrith Castle built to protect against raids from the        north Traditional home of the Neville family the castle fell into        royal possession after a series of skirmishes King Edward IV granted        the castle and land to Richard of Gloucesterwho later became King        Richard IIIand it stood as a bastion of the English crown Later as        it fell into disrepair the walls were dismantled and used to build        other structures in the town You can see the characteristic red stone        on almost every street        Askham        South of Penrith is an area of farmland that forms the        eastern boundary of the National Park With its wealth of pretty        cottages Askham is a true farming community The long village green is        a wonderful place for a stroll and an even better place to take a        break thanks to number of good pubs A little way from Askham village        is Lowther Park This large estate once centered on a fairytale        castle the remains of which can still be seen from the outside its        not open to the public The vast grounds have been turned into a        leisure park open summer only which has more than forty attractions        Set in grassland and rolling countryside is a deer park a birdofprey        attraction a circus and a theme park Theres lots for children to        do and there are some wonderful spaces for secluded picnics        Haweswater        This windswept area of water is close to the central lakes        as the crow flies but it takes a long time to reach by car Many        people walk the distance using High Street the path of an old Roman        road that cuts across the fell tops from Lake Windermere toward        Penrith Gentler footpaths radiate from it on to the vast commons of        Brampton and Martindale but the main part of this route is not for the        inexperienced or the unfit        The Haweswater that you see today is manmade The km        mile long reservoir was created in  The road travels to the        head of the reservoir and footpaths lead through wonderful undulating        countryside all around the lake and onto Mardale Common The area gets        crowded in summer partly due to interest in the nesting golden eagles        which have been returned to the area because of the efforts of        environmentalists There are no facilities here so bring food and        drink with you        Caldbeck        The northernmost village in the National Park and once a        mining town Caldbeck with its pa stel cottages on either side of        Chalk Beck is now rather sleepy The only remaining evidence of        industry is Priests Mill which has been a corn mill a bobbin mill        and a sawmill The water wheel and sluice gate still operate in summer        and there is a small display of artifacts used over the years the mill        buildings themselves have been converted to a gift shop and caf In        the churchyard of St Kentigern church opposite the mill is the grave        of John Peel A landowner and leader of the local hunt Peel was a        largerthanlife character well known throughout the region in his        day One of his friends the poet Robert Graves wrote a poem about his        antics The verses were set to music in the midth century and since        then the song Dye Ken John Peel have been taught in every English        school You will also find the grave of the Beauty of Buttermere        nearby see page         The Northwest        With forests and fells a valley of breathtaking beauty        and the most spectacular lake setting in the National Park this area        has a greater variety of views than any other in the Lake District        Keswick        This town of sturdy Victorian houses made of gray Lakeland        stone has a stunning setting nestled as it is in a natural bowl on the        shores of Derwentwater and surrounded by green hills The biggest town        in the National Park the population of Keswick pronounced kezzick        swells each summer as hikers boaters and sightseers arrive Keswick        makes a good base for touring the National Park and the Northwest A        working town through much of its history with the wool and mining        industries as major employers Keswick also aroused the interest of        writers and artists Coleridge and Southey two of the more prominent        Lake Poets both lived here and raised the profile of the town and the        surrounding area Greta Hall once the home of Southey and his family        and now part of Keswick School is unfortunately not open to the        public Moot Hall a slate structure built in the early th century        and used for Church of England services when the community had no        church sits in the center of town surrounded by the bustle of small        shops and on Saturdays market stalls You will find the tourist        information center here Century Theatre offers a program of        performances ranging from drama to Gilbert and Sullivan to English        pantomime Originally a traveling group the company has found a        permanent home in Keswick The box office is next to the Tourist        Information Centre        The Cumberland Pencil Factory a leading producer of        pencils in the world would appear to have little to offer the visitor        but the Pencil Museum provides fascinating insights into the history of        pencil production in the area It all began in the th century when        an important seam of graphite was found in neighboring Borrowdale        There are displays and videos including excerpts of the famous video        The Snowman which was producedas were the original book        illustrationsusing Cumberlands Derwent line of color pencils        Visitors also learn how Cumberland pencils helped some prisoners escape        from Nazi Germany during World War II When entering the museum        children are offered worksheets that keep them busy seeking out        information from displays and diagrams they seem to relish the        challenge as do many of the parents At the back of the exhibit is an        area set aside for activities such as drawing brass rubbing and        finger painting        The Keswick Museum and Art Gallery in Fitz Park is a        treasure trove of artifacts collected in the area with the atmosphere        of an old professors study A collection of stuffed birds and        preserved butterflies sits alongside rock samples and Stone Age axes        Perhaps the greatest collection is housed in the small Art Gallery A        series of neat wooden display cases hold manuscripts and personal        articles of the luminaries of the Lakeland regionscripts from the        hand of Robert Southey and letters written by Ruskin along with objects        such as their tea cups clogs and purses        Fitz Park itself is a fine example of the philanthropic        attitude of the Victorians who created green spaces in almost every        town for the people to enjoy Although many parks around the country        have been allowed to fall into decay Keswick has kept its park tidy        and in good repair with neat flower beds and pretty borders        Castlerigg Stone Circle        Just above Keswick sitting in the shadow of the mighty        Blencathra or Saddleback mountain to the north is a late        Neolithicearly Bronze Age circle of  stones Its impressive setting        on a rounded hill just below the high peaks and out of sight of modern        buildings allows the visitor to gain an impression of times past when        the circle was used in ancient and mysterious rituals        Derwent Water        Its wooded shores delightful islands and beautiful        setting have earned Derwent Water the epithet Queen of the Lakes  At        just  km  miles in length it is more manageable than some of the        larger lakes Surrounded by rounded fells rather than high mountains        the countryside here is restful rather than challenging and the        walking is easy Footpaths along the waters edge lead to pretty wooden        bridges and reed beds which are home to a wealth of bird and water        life In the distance are Skiddaw Peak to the north and Cat Bells in        the west        Lakeside is just a fiveminute walk from Keswick via a        footpath that leads along the shore line This is where the Derwent        Water ferry moors The lake ferry provides a relaxing way to take in        the beautiful setting and get a closer look at some of the islands If        you feel more energetic you can rent a rowboat at the dock and set out        under your own steam St Herberts Island was named after the saint        who lived here as a hermit after his death in  it became a place of        pilgrimage        On the northwest shore of the lake is Lingolm historic        home of Lord Rochdale Beatrix Potter spent many happy holidays here as        a child with her parents who were friends of Rochdale It was during        these holidays that her love of the Lake District was born The house        is famed for its gardensparticularly its rhododendrons which were        highly prized at the end of the th centuryand its beautiful        setting from here you can marvel at panoramic views of the lake and        Skiddaw Peak and Blenthcathra beyond        The B road which runs south from Keswick along the        eastern shore of Derwent Water leads you to some of the best gems of        the Lake District Its worth taking a days drive or a few days of        walking to seek them out After leaving Keswick the road finds the        lakes edge and leads you to wonderful views of Cat Bells peak on the        western bank Your eye will be drawn right but be sure not to miss the        left junction at the sign for Watendlath Take this small road which        climbs up through wooded hillsides about a kilometer mile from        the main road is Ashness Bridge a tiny stone bridge spanning a modest        little beck Its become very popular though because from it you can        enjoy a splendid view of Derwent Water and the fellsits an almost        perfectly framed natural composition something no photographer        professional or amateur can resist        A few kilometers farther south youll come upon Surprise        View a lookout that offers a panoramic vista of Derwent Water with        Bassenthwaite Lake in the distance Its an aweinspiring sight but        beware of the sheer drop especially on a windy day As the road climbs        higher youll reach a hidden valley left behind as the glaciers of the        Ice Age melted Watendlath Norse for the barn at the end of the        water is one of the best places to enjoy the stark fell landscape        without much exertion The walks lie along the stream bed on a plateau        high above Derwent Water The tiny village of Watendlath is        beautifula small farming community beside a small tarn set in a        natural bowl surrounded by stark fells it seems to lie far away from        the th century Travel over the thcentury packhorse bridge to        reach footpaths that lead to the surrounding valleys Its difficult to        believe that this little spot was once a major junction for traffic in        the lakes before motorized vehicles were invented For a wonderful        afternoon walk of about  km  miles you can leave your car at        Ashness Bridge and walk up along the path of the beck to        Watendlath        Return to the B and continue toward the southern tip        of Derwent Water In the Lodore area its worth taking a detour to see        Lodore Falls situated behind the Lodore Hotel The impact that the        falls make will depend to a certain extent on what kind of weather the        area has been experiencing after a spell of rain theyre a spectacular        torrent but in dry weather the flow can slow to a mere trickle Park        in the Kettlewell car park which is just beyond the Watendlath        turnoff        Borrowdale        The B moves along the shores of Derwent Water and then        follows the beautiful green valley of the River Derwent where families        gather to swim and picnic This is Borrowdale the most famous valley        in the Lake District The twin span bridge at Grange marks the start of        the valley Filled with deciduous woodland green fields small        villages and farmhouses this is the epitome of northern English        landscape        Near the village of Rosthwaite is the Bowder Stone a        giant lump of rock left behind by glacial ice that receded at a very        slow pace Its said to weigh  tons  millionkg million        pounds Standing on a small narrow base in a gully surrounded by        trees it looks like an upsidedown iceberg The stone was much loved        by Victorian visitors who would have their photographs taken with        hands outstretched against the rock face as if to show that they were        strong enough to hold up the massive stone        Just before the village of Seatoller is a junction with a        sign for Seathwaite said to be the wettest settlement in Britain The        rainfall recorded here is almost one third more than in nearby valleys        since the actual number of rainy days is no higher for Seathwaite its        believed that it must be the setting of the village that accounts for        the higher volume Seathwaite is the gateway to Scafell Pike a        kmmile footpath connects them and the mountain may attract more        clouds and more intense rain than other peaks in the lakes        Seatoller village is home to the Seatoller National Park        Visitor Centre From here the road turns out of the Borrowdale valley        to begin a steep ascent westward through Honister Pass This is one of        the most difficult passes to ascend but also arguably the prettiest        Grey scree slopes dominate both sides of the pass which only sheep        seem to be able to move across with ease The narrow view creates a        tunnel effectthe eye is drawn directly ahead towards the peaks of        High Stile and Red Pike which cradle the lake and village of        Buttermere        Buttermere        Buttermere is one of the pearls of the Lake district        Small and accessible it is possible to walk around its shoreline in a        couple of hours Most of the route is relatively flat and all of it is        picturesque The small copse planted here has created a photographers        delight Water hills and trees combine to offer some of the most        memorable views in the National Park Buttermere Lake is one of the        homes of Lake District char relatives of the salmon that were trapped        here by the changes in sea and land levels after the last Ice Age        The tiny village of Buttermere has a number of restaurants        and cafs that are good for lunch Its a popular little spot though        so there are usually problems with parking on all but the quietest        weekends The village was made famous in the th century when a        writer named J Budworth encountered Mary Robinson the beautiful        daughter of the landlord of the Fish Inn In his book A Fortnights        Ramble in the Lakes Budworth christened her the Beauty of Buttermere         For years after the book was published devoted and curious readers        came from all around to see this beauty for themselves Mary succumbed        to all the attention and was swept off her feet by one these admirers        a certain Colonel Hope MP Despite his exalted station the good        Colonel turned out to be an imposter and a bigamist and after their        marriage was sent to jail But Mary managed to make a new life for        herself with a local man and gave birth to seven children She is        buried in Caldbeck see page         Just a little farther along the valley to the northwest        joined to Buttermere by a stream lie two other lakes Crummock Water        lies in the shadow of dramatic Mellbreak Peak From its western shore        you can gain access to Scale Force at  m  ft the highest        waterfall in the Lake District It is  km  miles to the falls by        footpath from Buttermere village Loweswater is the smallest of the        three lakes and never crowded With footpath access and picnic sites        it makes a restful place to spend an afternoon        Bassenthwaite Lake        Bassenthwaite Lake just under  km  miles in length        lies to the northwest of Keswick It proved to be an inspiration to        Alfred Lord Tennyson when he was writing his poem Morte dArthur         Tennysons description of the lake into which an anguished Arthur        throws his sword Excalibur is based on Bassenthwaite At the time the        poet was staying on the eastern shore at Mirehouse the imposing family        residence of his friend James Spedding The house is now open to the        public with limited hours Its large garden has a number of different        environments from a formal herb garden to open pasture land On the        grounds is the tiny Church of St Begas which is always left open for        travelers Public footpaths link the gardens with Dodd Woods and the        peak of Skiddaw behind        Bassenthwaite is not as frequently visited as some of the        other lakesthere is no ferry service and water activities are        restricted It is well known by anglers however who value it for its        good supplies of sport fish such as char        The village of Bassenthwaite spreads out across the valley        to the north of the lake Trotters and Friends Animal Farm was a        working farm that now opens its doors to visitors and offers        opportunities to feed pet and pick up the animals Some of the        creatures here are decidedly exoticincluding lizards and        snakesbut others are old Lakeland favorites like Herdwich sheep and        native cows and pigs that can be found all across the countryside        Animal feeding takes place every day during the summer and there are        also tractor rides weather permitting With a caf and picnic area        its a great place for children of all ages        Skiddaw        At  m  ft Skiddaw is one of the major peaks of        the northern Lakeland area and one of the three highest in England        Its rounded form testifies to the fact that it is also one of the        oldest The whole mountain was once blanketed in forest and designated        as a royal hunting area In the th century it was a favorite haunt of        Coleridge and other English Romantics It is the easiest of the big        peaks to climb but the effort will still take up an entire day The        car park near Ormathwaite is the best place to start Or for a        somewhat easier ascent you could try scaling Latrigg another peak a        few kilometers to the south closer to Keswick This climb offers        panoramic views of Derwentwater and Borrowdale        Whinlatter Pass        There are two roads to Cockermouth in the far northwest        corner of the Lake District The fast road travels the length of the        eastern shore of Bassenthwaite Lake the slower and more picturesque        route leads through Whinlatter Forest This dense pine forest looks        spectacular against a blue summer sky and there are picnic sites and        trails through the trees The Whinlatter Pass Visitor Centre is a hub        for many cycle paths and walks        Cockermouth        A nononsense working town with a wide

the M is the Scottish        village of Gretna Green which is famous throughout the land for one        thing weddings In  new legislation in England made it illegal        for anyone under the age of  to marry without the consent of their        parents or legal guardians This act did not apply in Scotland        however where  remained the age of consent so many young couples        took to eloping to Scotland and most stopped to tie the knot in Gretna        Green the nearest town over the border        The blacksmiths shop in the center of the village became        the focus of this activity because it was the blacksmith who often        officiated at these ceremonies striking his anvil with a hammer to        signify that the union was official Getting married over the anvil        soon became a stock phrase used to refer to the marriage of young        couples Although the laws on marriage changed over the years the        anvil weddings continued still performed by the amiable blacksmith        Pressure from the church and state eventually forced a ban on anvil        weddings in  Today couples who are nostalgic for the more        romantic days of Gretna Greens past still come to The Old Blacksmiths        Shop to exchange their vows though they now participate in a legal        marriage ceremony Visitors to the center can view the marriage room        complete with anvil along with a small museum that has preserved the        tales of angry parents who descended on the shop to interrupt weddings        in progress You may be lucky enough to see a
