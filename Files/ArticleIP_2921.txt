                                 No Cigar             The austereinstallation of Chuck Closes big portraits at the Museum of Modern Art in NewYork City begins where any artist wants the narrative of his career to beginwith fully achieved art No juvenilia no hesitant casting about no findingof the voice You walk into the first white room and bam Theres the BigSelfPortrait of  staring right at you This unforgiving imageglories in its sheer seediness A trickle of cigarette smoke takes a detouraround the caterpillar mustache before negotiating some nose hairs The stubbleon Closes closeup cheeks and neck is so magnified that the hairs are anunshavable inch long The whole portrait is a celebration of hairfacialnasal chest eyebrow headthe freak flag as David Crosby called it of thelate s            ButCharles Thomas Close took a while to turn into Chuck Close the disheveledunmade bed of a man with the black glasses Born in Monroe Wash in  hewas the only child of a failed inventor and plumber who died when Charles was Charles mother taught piano and encouraged his interest in painting Heattended the University of Washington and did graduate work at Yale from to  His Yale classmates included such current artworld stars as thepainters Brice Marden and Jennifer Bartlett and the sculptor Richard SerraAfter teaching at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst for a couple ofyears he returned to New York wherewith a brief interruption in  whena paralyzing seizure left him in a wheelchairhe has worked ever since            During his early s Close experimented with a variety ofprovocative styles In  obviously inspired by Jasper Johns he cut upAmerican flags sewed them up in new shapesa mushroom cloud for exampleandpainted over them At Yale he learned to paint de Kooning ripoffs with suchfacility that he once told de Kooning that hed painted more de Koonings thande Kooning had By the mids like others of his generation hed left thegestural art of Pollock and de Kooning behind though Pollock could havepainted the swirling chest hair in Big SelfPortrait  and begun usingphotographic images as the basis for his cooler less openly expressivework            In the campus police at U Mass dismantled Closes first solo exhibition whichincluded drawings loosely based on photographs of album covers One showed BobDylan exposing himself Close left for New York that summer where he paintedhis footlong Big Nude  an impressive blackandwhite image of areclining woman with a bikini suntan based on photographs hed taken inAmherst In November he started his Big SelfPortrait  Three yearslater an Artforum interview referred to Close by his nicknameChuckwhich an assistant had scrawled on some photographs for the pieceandthe name stuck as his professional moniker            None of Closes inyourface s shockersthe desecratedflags the oversize nudes the rock stars genitaliais included in the MoMAshow though Big Nude is reproduced in the exhibition catalog nor forthat matter are some largescale photographic nudes he made during themids Closes career of deliberate provocation is airbrushed out Whatthis means is that the Big SelfPortrait of  seems to come out ofnowhere One is left with the somewhat misleading impression of anestablishment figure the artist who plays an artist in Six Degrees ofSeparation as Close did who paints pictures of his celebrity friendswho takes a formal photographic portrait of Bill Clinton  in thecatalog            Thisinterpretation of Close is reinforced by MoMAs focus on his technical andformal innovations to the exclusion of his subject matter The paintings anddrawings are grouped in such a way that we follow Closes progression from theblackandwhite enlargements of the late s to his puzzling attempts duringthe s to reproduce in paint the chemical process by which Polaroid camerasmake color images Instead of mixing his colors on the palette Close built uphis images by applying thin layers of primary colors directly onto the canvasMany of these color portraits have a faded pallor like old snapshots but theexuberant Linda  has a dispersed energy derived from thespidery network of Hendrix hair crowsfeet wrinkles fissured lips and eyecapillaries While moving into color Close found ways to engage the crisscrossgrid that had always been part of his procedure for enlarging photographicimages First he made the grid an explicit element of his compositions Thenhe experimented with different ways to fill that grid pointillist coloreddots blobs of papiermch fingerprints and finally the colorful Symbolistdoodles he now favors            All this focus on technique while fascinating in itselfis a distraction from the emotional impact of the paintings And the mostinteresting and dramatic technical transition from gestural de Kooningisms toPop cool is missing from the show MoMAs coy refusal to identify thesubjects of the portraits wall panels give title date and medium suggeststhat their identities dont matter even while firstname titles imply thatthey dothat intimacies are being explored and revealed The result is thatthe show has an insiderly feel Many will recognize that Phil  isthe composer Philip Glass or that Roy II  in a rare Closeanprofile to show off the ponytail is the late Roy Lichtenstein But how manywill know as I do that Marge R   is a realtor in Amherst            An exampleof this coyness is the pair of paintings hanging side by side in the firstroom Nancy  could be a still from a s film noir She looks asif she has just caught sight of a stalker on the stairs The sharpfocustreatment of certain detailslight glinting on the uneven Ali McGrawish frontteeth the asymmetrical eyes the squashed nose that looks as if its

violent tensions in thismarriage which ended in divorce            Nor are Closes experiments with filling his grids asmerely technical as the MoMA show makes them seem In several unsettlingportraits Close fills his grids with his own fingerprints inked on a stamppad These works have none of the fingerpainting naivet of kids art that youmight expect though two of them portray Closes young daughters Rather withtheir clearly indicated whorls they look like police fingerprints used foridentification Is it an accident that two of Closes favorite media are mugshots and fingerprints MoMAs newwaystofillthegrid narrativediscourages any such speculation about the buried themes of criminality andviolence beneath Closes cool images            Closes work from the sand the s loses something of his earlier provocativeness Lucas II of the painter Lucas Samaras has a wildman intensitypart Ezra Poundpart Jerry Garciaaccentuated by Closes onetime experimentation with aradiating circular grid But most of the other recent paintings are jeweledengaging userfriendly The colorful little symbols filling the grids remindme of Gustav Klimt whom Close studied in Vienna in  especially whenClose is luxuriating in the dark tangle of the artist Kiki Smiths hair Kiki   If you take a closer look though you notice that insteadof Klimts erotic glamour which hints at dangerous passions unleashed by theunconscious Closes doodles depict doughnuts hot dogs and lozenges Thecandystore colors that Close reined in for decades return here with avengeance but they seem more frivolous than emotionally charged Thesetopdollar portraits of artworld luminaries look good enough to eat
