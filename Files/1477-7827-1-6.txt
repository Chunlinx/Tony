                    Background        That maternal undernutrition can affect fetal ovarian        development has been documented     Experiments using        the sheep as a paradigm indicate that meiotic maturation of        germ cells is delayed by feed restriction             putative molecular mechanisms which mediate this effect are        unknown We hypothesized that fetal oogonia distressed as a        result of nutrient deprivation express the tumor suppressor        protein p Cells respond to p by cycle arrest at the        GS or GM genomic checkpoints Outcome is dictated by        the intensity of the affliction The apoptotic pathway is        invoked in cells subjected to a severe trauma that causes        irreparable damages In the presence of sublethal        disturbances to DNA p affords the time necessary for        enzymatic repairs and proofreading Thus p the        socalled guardian of the genome serves to maintain        genetic fidelity               There is a lack of fundamental information on potential        influences of undernutrition on the functional morphology        of ovaries of pregnant animals The corpus luteum provides

          The primary objective of this investigation was to        compare p responses of germ cells in fetal ovaries of        ewes receiving adequate or restricted diets Alterations in        p

relative to maternal ovaries and jugular        plasma sex steroid hormone determinations are compiled in        Table  Weights of maternal ovaries and dissected        corpora lutea were not influenced by nutritional status        Numbers of corpora lutea and fetuses diagnosed by        ultrasound matched the number of fetuses retrieved at        slaughter ie no embryonicfetal losses occurred during        gestation or due to treatments Ovaries of control ewes        contained more follicles  mm or greater in diameter than        animals receiving restricted diets albeit there was no        significant difference in jugular venous concentrations of        estradiol Likewise there was no differential effect        of treatments on peripheral progesterone Luteal        progesterone and tissue areas occupied by blood vessels and        large and small steroidogenic cells were similar between        groups                    Discussion        Results of this study indicate that in underfed ewes        p Bcl and polymerase  are upregulated in fetal        oogonia containing elevated contents of oxoguanine        Oxoguanine has become the benchmark for oxidative DNA        modifications it is arguably the most important mutagenic        lesion in DNA mispairing with adenine during chromosomal        replications causes GC  TA transversions     It is        suggested that untoward oxidative stresses to DNA prompt        cellcycle delay antiapoptotic and repair responses        Indeed p controls the lowlevel damagedependent        premeiotic checkpoint which facilitates DNA repair during        spermatogenesis     Gametogenesis is inherently        errorprone    and subject to mutations            Nevertheless it is imperative to avoid genotoxic        complications that could become integrated into the        germline        Bcl belongs to a family of cellular proteins which        arbitrate decisions in lifeordeath situations In the        presence of Bcl irregularities within the DNA sequence        are corrected before the p suicidal program is executed        Bcl impedes the subcellular trafficking of p inhibits        downstream adapters necessary for stimulation of the        apoptotic caspases and can act as an antioxidant                    Polymerase  is a penultimate mediator of mammalian DNA        baseexcision repair The baseexcision cascade is        characteristically limited to the repair of small lesions        in DNA eg single nucleotide modifications Shortpatch        reconstruction is initiated by a proofreading glycosylase        that hydrolyzes the Nglycosylic bond linking an improper        base to deoxyribose The abasic sugarphosphate backbone is        then cleaved by an apurinicapyrimidinic endonuclease or        lyase Polymerase  fills the nucleotide gap created in DNA        with the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate complementary to        the template Finally the nick is sealed by a DNA ligase            The baseexcision pathway is a principal contributor        to the amendment of oxoguanine corruptions in DNA                   Unlike males which continue to generate sperm cells by        mitosis throughout their reproductive lives mammalian        females are generally born with their full complement of        meiotic gametes     The normal chronology of ovarian        development follows a definitive pattern Critical windows        of activity in the sheep include somatic ovarian tissue        differentiation from the gonadal ridges of the        mesonephros and growth up to Day  of gestation germ        from yolk sac endoderm and pregranulosa derived from the        ovarian surface epithelium cellular migration into and        colonization of the ovaries Days  clonal expansion        of oogonia Days  onset of meiosis and arrest by        Day  at the dictyate stage of prophase the first        division of meiosis is not completed until ovulation and        ovigerous cord regression and primordial follicle emergence        Days         It seems apparent that germ        cells are particularly vulnerable to a metabolic insult        when in the phasic transition between mitosis and meiosis        I        Relatively innocuous base damages to DNA caused by        oxidations are an inevitable byproduct of physiological        metabolism eg leakage of radicals associated with the        reduction of oxygen to water during mitochondrial        respiration     The etiological basis for the        formation of abnormally high levels of oxoguanine adducts        in oogonia of lambs of undernourished ewes is unknown        Altered placental vascular dynamics and shifts in fetal        organ blood flow precipitated by nutrient deficiencies are        of possible significance     Ischemiareperfusion is a        well known stimulus of free radical formation            Micronutrient imbalances or insufficiencies also can        negatively impact the functional capacities of antioxidant        vitamin C E and enzymatic superoxide dismutase        glutathione peroxidase catalase defense systems                   While cellular proliferation is a generic feature of        normal germline development so is programmed physiological        death In fact the apoptotic demise yielding        doublestranded DNA breaks of female germ cells throughout        gestations of most vertebrates will encompass more than        onehalf of precursor populations      Day  is the        approximate timepoint when a maximum number of oogonia is        achieved in lambs a nearly fivefold loss then occurs        between Days  and      In some cases of        nutritional deprivation cellular losses are accelerated           and reproductive performance of the female offspring        during adulthood is attenuated     Prenatal exposure to        famine  Dutch cohort did not affect subsequent        fertility of women     Numbers of oogoniaoocytes and        weights of midgestational fetal ovaries of sheep were        increased     or not influenced by undernutrition             present study It has been suggested that oogonia        which have matured to oocytes are less susceptible to        degeneration as pregnancy advances     A prominent role        for the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor eg which is        responsive to polycyclic ligands present in environmental        toxicants in promoting apoptosis during fetal oogenesis        has recently been identified in mice             Prospective endocrineparacrine modifiers which are        altered by nutritional regimen of the fates of fetal germ        cells include glucocorticoids thyroid hormones insulin        growth hormone insulinlike growth factors and leptin                    The physiological relevance if any of the diminution        in numbers of surface antral ovarian follicles in dams of        the restricted nutrition group is unclear  this was not        reflected by a perturbation in circulatory estradiol        Structural and functional properties of ovine corpora lutea        of pregnancy were not altered by plane of nutrition        Moreover maternal nutrient restriction during the middle        third of gestation in pigs had no effect on ovarian        progesterone production or fetal survival            Morphometric data for sheep corpora lutea are consistent        with previous reports summarized by Sawyer     It        therefore appears that maternal ovaries are comparatively        resilient to repercussions of undernutrition        In conclusion we surmise that oxidative base damages to        the DNA of fetal oogonia of pregnant animals faced with a        nutritional adversity are a potential threat to the genetic        character and reproductive capacity of their progeny the        predicament can evidently be reconciled by response        mechanisms of cellcycle arrest survival and repair        Evolutionary pressures to resist or adapt to the stresses        of caloric constraints have almost certainly served to        assure the successes of mammalian reproduction natural        selection
