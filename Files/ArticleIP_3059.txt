                                 Long Division            Tony Horwitz has donesomething remarkable He has written a book about the Civil War that willinterest not only war enthusiasts but also people who find the subject avexation or a bore Speaking as one of the latter I discovered that Horwitzmade me confront my aversion in a way that was both troubling and revealingLet me explain            I wasborn in the South of two Southern parents but raised mainly on Army postscurious nonplaces that even when located in the South feel more like Ohiothan like Alabama or Georgia or North Carolina Growing up on an Army post webrats looked at the civilian world with a wary eye particularly in the Southwhere we were doubly different not just outsiders and transients but alsoGoddamn Yankees            If we went offpost to school we adjusted to Southernfolkways standing at football games for the national anthem as Dixie wascalled even though we knew that our anthem was the one heard at theparade grounds on weekends More important in those preintegration days weattended lilywhite classes and witnessed racial barriers that were absent orat least being dismantled back on the forts            Tied tothis Jim Crow order was a social reality that seemed as peculiar as any I hadexperienced overseas Years later reading Walker Percys superb essays on raceand civil rights I had it spelled out for me The South at least the whiteSouth before integration was one big kinship lodge And it was preciselybecause the public realm was taken to be an extension of family that whiteSoutherners took any effort to bring blacks into it as a direct attack on theirmost intimate social space            Idimly sensed this whenever as a boy Ivisited my Southern relatives People I barely knew talked to meand did forme as they say down thereas though I were their brother or cousin I wastouched by these kindnesses but also suspicious Why were they doing thisWhat did I owe them Beyond the suspicion lay a Puritan sense that this was alldreadfully wrong            That iswhy this semiSoutherner does not like to think about the Civil Warparticularly about the way Southerners fetishize the whole Lost Cause businessIt takes him back to memories that lie uneasily at the base of his identity Icant help but think that many white Americans share this queasyambivalence            Horwitz turns out to be an oddly perfect guide for usdivided souls A descendant of Russian Jews born and raised in the North tothe extent that Maryland is the North he would seem to have little reason forinterest in that war But this is America and when Horwitzsgreatgrandfather Poppa Isaac made his way from czarist Russia to the EastSide of New York one of his first purchases was a book about the Civil WarThe interest was passed on and Horwitzs father a physician kept his son uplate at night reading from the volume Photographic History of the CivilWar  By third grade Horwitz fils was completing his own highlyderivative history of the war and commencing a Sistinescale project a muralof the war proRebel in slant that would soon cover every inch of attic wallspace            Horwitz soon put aside suchchildish things As a Wall Street Journal reporter he covered both theGulf War and Bosnia and returning to the States settled with his wife in theshadow of Virginias Blue Ridge Mountains There he lived in tranquilexpectation of their first child until one day a band of Civil War reenactorsstumbled into their yard in search of water            Thisencounter with hardcore reenactorswhose dedication to authenticityincludes camping out under thin blankets and huddling spoonstyle to share bodyheatbrought Horwitzs curiosity about Civil War mania to a head Where did itcome from Some people who were thus obsessed were so because as Horwitznotes roughly half of modernday white Southerners descended fromConfederates and one in four Southern men of military age died in it Butthere was a greater prod to Southern memory defeat Losers dont forget Nordo their children The only Southerners who want to blot it out are blackSoutherners who wish that all the noise and symbolism would go away            These are generalities of course The strengthof Horwitzs book lies in his gift for fleshing them out through preciselyrendered encounters with Southerners of all walks and all colors united onlyby the common Southern compulsion to answer a question with a story Suchmeetings spontaneous and arranged punctuate Horwitzs zigzag journey throughthe Old Confederacy with stops at battlefields museums redneck barsgatherings of the Sons of Confederate Veterans an Afrocentric school and theliving rooms of countless affable Southerners            If thismakes Horwitz sound like a journalistic Sherman he wears his Yankee biaslightly Yall always do the same says the white mayor of  percent blackSelma Ala at the end of their interview Come in here smiling and then gohome and write a dig at us Not only does Horwitz not do this but he alsounderstands that the mayors remark was the real point of the interviewthatand the jocularly aggrieved way in which he made it            What comes through repeatedly is not just grievance butalso the pride vulnerability and sometimes desperation of people who seetheir lives and daily predicaments as having been shaped by a cataclysm thatoccurred more than  years ago Theres probably no staler chestnut than theSouthern alibi that it wasnt slaverys defense but honor and loyalty to placethat made most Confederates take up arms to fight the Northern aggressorsYet in the mouths of the white townsfolk of Salisbury NC it soundsconvincing Horwitz makes us see that the pinched circumstances of their livesare not so different from the conditions of their ancestors dirtpoor yeomanfarmers who seldom saw much less owned a slave For such people then andnow a sense of place and community is not merely the most sustaining fact ofdaily life it is the most dignifying            Not muchfurther into the book we are treated to a more workedup intellectualizedversion of the alibitoday called the neoConfederate ideology But becauseit is put forward by a fatuous Charleston SC college professor we hear itfor what Horwitz rightly calls it a clever glide around race and slaveryrather like the slicktongued defense of the Southern way of life made byantebellum orators South Carolinians in particular Horwitz doesnt leave itthere Hes neither immune to the professors charm nor untroubled by what theprofessor says about the Northern agenda a culture war in which Yankeesimposed their imperialist and capitalist will on the agrarian South just asthey had done to the Irish and Scots            Many moments in the book are indelible Theresnothing but tragedy in the trial of a young black man who has killed a whiteman for driving on Martin Luther King Jrs birthday weekend with a Confederateflag flying on his truck an incident that has thoroughly riven the once fairlyharmonious town of Guthrie Ky Almost as unsettling is the conversationHorwitz has with the bright black woman who founded an Afrocentric alternativeschool in Selma a conversation that soon breaks down in a venomous exchangeover Louis Farrakhan Dont tell us who our leaders should be she snaps            Poking around the Civil Warcan lead both to such impasses and to bleak comedy What more need be saidabout the name given to Selmas allblack housing project the Nathan BForrest Homes than what Horwitz dryly observes an odd choice givenForrests notoriety as a slave trader and Imperial Wizard of the KKK            This is outstandingjournalism artfully constructed and unfailingly vivid as good a rendering asIve seen of the mysterious pull at the heart of American identity Beingfascinated by the Civil War is central to what Robert Penn Warren called thevery ritual of being American If so there may be no more fitting conclusionthan Horwitzs tentative insight into his greatgrandfathers attractionPoppa Isaac came from learned rabbinical stock Maybe he sensed that theCivil War was an American Talmud that would unlock the secrets of his adoptedland and make him feel a part of it
