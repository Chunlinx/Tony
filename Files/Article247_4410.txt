                                 The Lagging Income of the Middle Class                        The Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Prioritiesissued a joint study today called Pulling Apart that shows on a statebystate and nationalbasis that income inequality in the United States has continued to worsen inthe past decade building on a trend that began in the late s Although thereport focuses attention on the huge gap between the top fifth ofincomeearning families and the bottom fifth a gap worthy of Brazil the morestriking numbers delineate the widening gap between the top fifth of incomeearners and within that group the top  percent in particular and everyoneelse            Between the late s and the late s for example the top fifth sawits average real income rise by about  percent while the fourth fifthclosest to the top saw real income rise  percent and the middle fifth sawreal income rise just  percent As a result the top fifth now averages abouttwice as much as the second fifth and three times as much as the middlefifth            Now you might say to this so what In the first place these groups arenot static Not everyone in the top fifth in  the last year of the studywas there in  nor will everyone there in  be there in  Though amuch higher percentage will be than wont In addition inequality itself is atricky problem If remedying inequality comes at the expense of overall growththen its possible that the poor and middle class will end up worse in absoluteterms even if their relative position improves            In general after all the best remedy for poverty and the best way to liftpeople into the middle class is not income redistribution but rather economicgrowth Although many critiques of globalization and free trade depend atleast implicitly on Marxs immiseration thesis which held that growth in acapitalist economy inevitably impoverished most while enriching a few theexperience of most capitalist economies and especially those in the ThirdWorld has demonstrated exactly the opposite A  World Bank study of morethan  fastgrowing economies showed that in nearly all of them growth didnot meaningfully change income distribution and that even the poorest fifth ofincomeearners reaped absolute benefits from economic growth The study didshow that in countries that adopted land reform growth was more equitable            Unfortunately the United States does not fit well into that study On thecontrary the remarkable thing is how narrow the benefits even in absoluteterms of the boom of the last  years have been Remember the middle fifthof incomeearning families saw its real income rise just  percent in  yearsand just  percent in the last decade The second fifth saw its real incomeactually drop since the late s while the poorest fifth saw itsincome stay relatively steady            These statistics are of course subject to question If the Consumer PriceIndex really overstates inflation then those real income numbers should behigher Aftertax numbers because the federal income tax is progressive wouldnot be as striking And the past couple of years have seen realalthough stillsmallwage increases for most workers increases they did not enjoy for mostof the s            Still the economic inequality we now have in the United States is of amagnitude we have not witnessed since before the New Deal And whatsremarkable is that its happening at a time when unemployment is at historiclows and when economic growth is much faster than most economists thoughtpossible Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute poohpoohing the new study saidthat the best solution to the problems it raisesassuming they areproblemswould be to cut the capitalgains tax spurring greater investmentBut it seems implausible that putting more money in the stock market or inventure capital funds will affect income inequality at all More to the pointif the economy grows any faster than it is now Fed Chairman Alan Greenspanwill just slam on the brakes In terms of growth and employment this isprobably as good as it gets And as good as it gets is actually making incomegaps wider rather than narrowing them            Whether economic inequality of the magnitude the United States now hasshould matter to a society is of course a matter of principle and not logicPaul Krugman made a good case for itsimportance And we should not let concern over inequality obscure thelessons of the last  years the virtues of deregulation competitionentrepreneurship and above all the allocation of capital by markets notplanners But as Congress heads into its latest round of budget planning andas Dubya tries to offer up his latest middleclass tax cut its probablyworth remembering whos actually in the middle class and whether those who area long way out of it really need yet another break
