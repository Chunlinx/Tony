                                 Wash This Way            I do not have a fleet ofwashing machines in which to conduct my tests I dont have a radiationspectrometer for measuring the whiteness of whites the way ConsumerReports does But I do have tools formidable in their own right at myservice in my search for the best laundry detergent            I have a laundromatright across the street from my apartment I have skin sensitive to thefaintest of soapy residues and an equally sensitive nose But my biggest assetis New York City at my doorstep The dirt grime spit and fouler substancesthat regularly adhere to ones clothing here make this fine metropolis averitable fantasia of filth            But first let me rule out a few of the myths and scams ofthe laundry world                           LaundryBallsRings                Strange hard balls or rings to apiecethat purport to wash clothes without detergent by means of generatingions or an undefined substance called structured water An apparently bogusproduct Both Good Housekeeping and Dateline NBC have suggestedthat they wash clothes no better than plain water and one manufacturer wassued for false advertising                           UltraConcentrates                Remember how  years ago laundrydetergent came in huge boxes Dont they seem small these days This was notechnological advance Under pressure from environmentalists detergentmanufacturers simply removed the fillers with which theyd been bulking updetergents to give an illusion of value The same thing happened withliquidsthey just eliminated the water                           Powder vsLiquid                In  a Consumer Reports studyshowed that powders outperformed liquids on all fronts The one exceptionTide With Bleach Alternative Conventional wisdom as doled out on laundry Websites and detergent hotlines has it that powders are better in hard water andfor groundin dirt while liquids are good for grease but this was not backedup by CR s study            Heres the dirt on detergent There are two keyingredients surfactants and builders Surfactants reduce the surface tensionof the water and increase its ability to rinse and wash Whimsical chemists saythey make water wetter Builders create the proper pH balance and deactivateelements in the water that would reduce the effectiveness of surfactantsDetergents differ in the way they balance these two elements and in theirvarying use of added ingredients such as bleach enzymes fluorescentwhiteners perfumes foam control products or fabric softeners            This all presents an analytical conundrum If eachbrand merely offers the same basic ingredients in different proportions plusor minus a few bells and whistles how was I to determine which was the best Idecided Id take each detergent on its own terms The most common label claimsboasted of keeping colors bright removing stains eliminating odors and beingfree of skinirritating perfumes and dyes            To the laundromat            C olor                Fastness Test Since thearrival of detergents with bleach and bleach alternatives color fading hasbeen a concern of many launderers various brands have accordingly begun toclaim color hold bleaching or even that they brighten brights whilewhitening whites Normal chlorine bleach removes color indiscriminately Itattacks stains and dyes alike and converts them into particles that yourdetergent can easily wash away It can also damage fabrics especiallyproteinbased materials such as silk and wool In general colorsafe bleachjust means oxygen bleach which is much milder than chlorine bleach It worksby releasing hydrogen peroxide to break up or remove the color from organicmaterials but is gentle enough that it wont affect most fabric dyes Thatstuff about brightening brights generally just means the detergent has somedyetransfer inhibitors which help to stop bleeding dyes from staining otherclothes Theres nothing in detergent that can make your clothes brighterother that its inherent ability to get dirt out of them            Of the detergents with colorsafe bleaches I testedAll and Wisk both in powder form setting them against Liquid Tide WithBleach Alternative which was rated the most effective detergent overall byConsumer Reports  but which made no claims to color safety orbrightening I hit the infantwear section of Kmart and picked up four cheapsets of clothing Each included a tiny red Tshirt a blue turtleneck pinklong johns and two pairs of socksone lime green one vibrant purple I feltas if I was the mother of Smurfs I then washed three of the sets  timeseach in hot water with each of the fine household products I mentionedabove            After  washings thewashed sets of clothing had lost significant amounts of color as compared withthe unwashed control set The socks that started out a deep royal purple werenow lavender and covered with whitish fuzz The differences among All Wiskand Tide were not great but they were noticeable and surprising Tide whichmade no claims to color holding actually resulted in the least fading Allcame in second Wisk just a shade behind These differences were onlynoticeable under bright light and on close inspectionindicative of thegeneral irrelevance of the claims on detergent labels One way to prevent thistype of color loss is to wash clothes in colder water but all detergents workpoorly in cold water and many bleaching agents are completely ineffective incold temperatures So while the colors may fade less your detergent is alsocleaning less            S tain                Removal Test For the stainremoval I needed a way of getting the clothes to be tested as dirty aspossible and what is dirtier that the streets of New York I figured Id throwthe test subjects in the street and let cars run over them But this presenteda new testing challenge namely that anything in the street in New York City isfair game I was faced with either standing guard over the clothing and shooingaway wouldbe thieves or picking as my test candidates attire that was anatural people repellent I picked underwear both mens and womens in themost gargantuan sizes Kmart carried and with the help of a friend threw pairs into Second Avenue under cover of darkness Unfortunately while no onewanted the clothing the act of tossing it into the street drew no littleattention Questions from the crowd that gathered included What the hell areyou doing Are you guys artists Can I have your number Im in a bandcalled Bag of Panties Will you take a picture of us with the underwear forour album cover            It was all verydiverting but it wasnt getting our underwear any dirtier So we dragged eachpair through the gutter which was still full of street runoff from a rainstormearlier in the day This combined with the occasional big rig and regularThursday night taxi traffic did quite a number on the briefs After an hourthey were gray and covered with skid marks and street custard            But they still werent dirty enough So into a plastic sackthey went and into a cab we hopped headed for the Cowgirl Hall of Fame aWesternthemed restaurant in Greenwich Village The cooks there were kindenough to donate a large platter and a vat of spicy barbecue sauce but balkedat putting BBQBrief sandwiches on the menu Even sitting on the platterthoroughly sauced the briefs still looked like they needed one more goodstain So off we went to Krispy Kreme for a dozen raspberry jelly doughnuts tosquirt all over them With that final abuse we called it a night and I sealedthe subjects in a large plastic bag and left them to fester in the corner of myroom for two days            After dividing the briefsinto four equally soiled piles I washed one set in Cheer one in Tide one inDynamo and one in American Fare a Kmart store brand After one wash and aspin in the dryer I compared the results Cheer worked the best overall Itremoved the road grime the best and there was little trace of the orangegrease left in the waistband by the barbecue sauce There was no visibleraspberry jelly doughnut filling remaining at all Tide did a good job on thegrease but was not quite as effective as Cheer on the road grime which wasstill visible in patches It also completely removed the jelly stains Thirdplace went to Dynamo which did a poor job on the jelly and whose heavy scentcouldnt completely mask the odor of barbecue sauce Worst of all was Kmartbrand When I opened the dryer the spicy smell of barbecue sauce almostknocked me over and the briefs were still covered in splotches of orangegrease and jelly stains            O dor                Removal Test For this test Ienlisted the help of a friend who is a fitness instructor She was kind enoughto donate three loads of sweaty crusty clothes to my cause Using myincredibly sensitive nose I divided her clothing into three piles of equalstink factor and threw in the stillspicy undies from the Kmart detergentload I then washed each in a detergent marketed as odor removing Gain Surfand Fab Aside from just having more fragrance than other varieties which thecompanies admit could they actually remove serious stink from clothing            Fab and Gain both did agreat job and removed the odors completely There was no difference instinkremoval effectiveness between these two aside from the perfume left inthe clothing Fabs was plaina light clean scentwhile Gains was vaguelyvanilloid Surf came in last It did not completely remove pit stink and theperfume was a cloying grape scent Worst of all the toxic underwear from thebarbecue sauce ordeal still smelled spicy            My conclusions Tide faded colors a bit less but it wasnot enough to make me want to switch brands Cheer did a great job removingdirt and grease but how often are my clothes run over by cars and slathered inbarbecue sauce About once a year            The differences among the name brands werenegligible The various claims on the packaging are not so much false as trueof all the detergents With the exception of the cheap store brands they allremove odors stains and dirt well Youre better off picking your detergentby its scent or if you ask me lack thereof than you are judging it bywhats on the label But among the topshelf brands it doesnt really matterwhich one you choose Itll all come out in the wash
