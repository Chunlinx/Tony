                     How are you doing today                     Im doing fine                     You ready to tell a story                     Yes                     OK                     Im trying to think of a story I should tell                  OK         Well I worked as a police officer for the town of Matthews for about four and a half years until recently         And Ill tell the story of one of my chases and if that doesnt go enough time Ill tell the story of another chase vehicle chase         Um         one night after I had arrested my second DWI I took the DWI down to the intake center thats the jail in downtown took him down to the jail and him processed and got him in         And on my way back home I take Independence Blvd on the way back into Matthews         And about at probably Idlewild Rd no probably at Albemarle Rd I got in behind uh this is still in Charlotte so it wasnt in my jurisdiction I got in behind a uh an old like  or  Oldsmobile Cutlass that had a paper tag         And I didnt think anything about it                  I did I did notice it and that it had a paper tag and that it was primer primer black black primer                     Paper tag                     Paper tag a day tag                     OK                     And which you can track them but its real hard to because its so its common to switch them         And I we we were headed outbound on highway on Independence Blvd Highway  and I noticed he was running about  miles an hour           So I got in behind him or not behind him but I was in the lane beside of him and he was little bit ahead of me for the turn for the vehicle was a little ahead of me         And I didnt think anything about it         Well uh I noticed he he sped up to  miles an hour         And so I sped up to  just to see what he was doing just to kind of let him know Hey youre speeding         you know         And and we were still headed outbound we cross over um we cross over Idlewild and um no actually no this is right prior to Idlewild and hes running  miles an hour         And then he goes he starts going  as we as we cross over Conference         And so Im going          And um I got on the radio with Charlotte thinking he might be impaired or you know drunk or something like that         So I try to get in get on the the radio with Charlotte         And as Im going down the road  miles an hour I see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of uh um that shopping area right right prior to Conference                     Is that where the HarrisTeeters at                     Yeah         Hes hes sitting right back up there         And I try to tell Charlotte that we just passed an officer and needless to say uh they didnt get up with him         And so I called my my sergeant and let him know that I was coming inbound         By this time we were running  miles an hour         Were passing um the roads were wet it had been raining that night         And um we pass um we pass uh uh the car dealerships on our left hand side         Were running  as we come past probably the probably at Harris Blvd         And so I went ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews hes getting blue lighted         And I felt that he was impaired to go ahead and start another unit then         And so were running  probably  a good  miles an hour and we go we pass over Sardis North and right as we get into Matthews about where uh Crown Point Executive Dr is I uh told them I was initiating a stop         So I flipped on my blue lights and it was on         He took off and was running about  miles an hour and Im right in behind him um Im keeping radio contact with um with dispatch and the other units         And um Rich Brian Rich evidently came up uh Sam Newell and got in behind me         I didnt see him because I was worried about this guy         Were running were heading past were probably at at the Pep Boys now maybe where the Boston Market is         Were running probably a hundred         Um we got up to the fastest we got up to on  was about          And um hes still getting on along and uh Im still sticking with him and I felt uncomfortable on the wet roads         And um my sergeant of course was asking me during the chase thats uh Sergeant Stevens was making sure that the traffic was was OK and that I felt OK with the chase         And the the the what the driver was doing you know keeping up with all the locations and landmarks which I I do pretty well I was ready with that         And dispatch is you know telling me whenever Id call out Id say OK         Independence and Winter Square Dr And theyd say four Independence and Winter Square Dr And I said Still continuing eastbound on Highway          And um so were running were booking on along about  or so and I say uh Headquarters the roads are wet         I dont feel comfortable anymore         Im going to go ahead and  the chase          is Disregard the Chase you know go ahead and and let back         I had already called  which is Pursuit          The minute you call   basically all radio traffic ceases and you are the youre the main person         Rich evidently had gotten in behind me and I ed the chase probably about the Highway  bridge maybe a little past it         And so as Im backing off Im Im still keeping an eye on him if hes slowing down a little bit and he goes to highway to MatthewsMint Hill and  makes a left hand turn         And so I went ahead and uh got back in the chase again because I figured um you know I just figured Id go ahead go ahead and chase him because I knew that he couldnt keep up that kind of speed on the uh on the MatthewsMint Hill         And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down MatthewsMint Hill we probably running around  or  miles an hour         We get to uh Providence or uh Im sorry we get to Highway  to MatthewsMint Hill and he makes that right turn and he slows down for that and so Im right in behind him blue lights and sirens all the way         Give them my location and Brian Rich is behind me         And uh were heading out on Idlewild Rd were or were on  MatthewsMint Hill both being the same now         We get to the Petro we get to the Petro now the BP station at Idlewild and  he makes a right heading towards Union County         And uh so we start heading down that way and uh were going on down Idlewild Rd keep right on going cross over  construction which it was under construction at that point and um were were running a good clip         And uh by that time what I had done was you know at about  or so I had switched over I was talking to Charlotte Mecklenburg and the Highway Patrol on my main car radio and talking to Matthews dispatch on my hand held as as Im driving         Um Rich Brian Rich is still behind me and as we didnt have our new radio tower up had we had the radio tower up I would be able to maintain contact with Matthews on my handheld but the handhelds dont transmit very well         Um so I mean I was still maintaining contact and they could still hear me on uh Mutual Aid but the thing was I should have been on Matthews uh main channel on my car radio because it transmits stronger         Uh         Brians still behind me and um so Im getting on with the Highway Patrol trying to have the Highway Patrol come and and meet with me because were heading towards Union County         Not that I cant chase into Union county but Id much rather have the Highway Patrolman out there myself because theyll ram somebody off the road in a heart beat                                          Not really but uh theyre better at chases theyve had training in chases         And um so we start going over some hills down Idlewild Rd and Brian Rich loses me         Um or I should say both of us lost him         Im still maintaining contact with with Highway Patrol and uh theyre hearing me fine and uh theyre trying to get somebody out there to me         But as we down to were heading were getting into Union County a good ways and we get down to we cross over Stevens Mill and theres the next road pass Stevens Mill I think its Union Mill or Indian Trail Rd Im not exactly sure         And theres a BP station right there         They lost me and Im still transmitting on Mutual Aid because I didnt see any units around me and I knew we were headed towards a Highway Patrol station because theyre down there on Seacrest Short Cut and pretty soon Unionville Rd or Idlewild I think turns into Seacrest Short Cut I believe         And uh so my sergeant gets on the radio and says uh you know  if you can copy me          your chase          your chase         And so I disregarded my chase and parked at the BP station and uh advised Highway Patrol that I was being ed by my sergeant         And uh so I parked there and kind of calmed down for a few minutes and here comes Rich and here comes Sergeant Stevens         And so he both pulls in they both pull in you know and I let them know that I lost him and then a Highway Patrolman comes up and uh asks Which way did he go         and I say He went down that way         And so he heads out that way spinning tires trying trying to catch up to the guy         My best guess is what he did was when I ed he probably took a side road and uh headed headed out into the county somewhere                     So he was never caught                     No         Never caught         My I probably he was either it probably wasnt a stolen car or anything like that         Probably what had happened was his license was revoked or he was DWI or something like that and uh but but the whole thing about it was had I maintained contact with Matthews on my main radio we would have probably caught him or at least been able to get the Highway Patrol up there and they could have assumed the chase         And of course I would have to have been the secondary unit because I I started the chase         So                     Did you get into trouble                     No Harris just told me Next time be on your radio         And Glenn one of the dispatchers up there he goes We didnt have to do anything         Uh you were contacting Highway Patrol and you were contacting us and basically you were doing our job for us         But I knew that was wrong thing to do         But at the time I didnt know where any of my other units were         I knew Rich was behind me but I had lost sight of him         Pat said he was just afraid that I had uh that I had wrecked or something like that         That I was you know in the woods somewhere up against a tree in my patrol car after running  miles an hour down Idlewild Rd as it gets curvy         But that was the story of my one chase                     Thank you                     Youre very welcome
