                                 Id Fixes            Bad things happen to theordinary people in Ian McEwans novelsthings that initially seem bizarrelyeven comically out of proportion with their lives In The Innocent a newly engaged couple comes home from a party and goes to bed to makelove only to discover that there is an intruder asleep in their wardrobePanicstricken unsure of how best to get rid of him they begin to argue Thewoman is smoking a cigarette and she accidentally sets herself on fire Theintruder wakes up A terrible fight breaks out Bones are broken testicles arecrushed one man bites through another mans cheek And then things get a wholelot worse            The sceneis vintage McEwanin its suspense its violence and the sickening swiftnesswith which it unfolds But perhaps its most emblematic characteristic is itsability to provoke a flustered and ambivalent response in the reader ahorrified sympathy that alternates with a deep desire to distance oneself fromthe nightmare at hand Could this grisly encounter have been prevented Was itmerely bad luck or did the couple somehow bring it on themselves Andmostimportantcould anything like this ever happen to me McEwan is a Freudianwith an Orwellian sense of decency and his novels often trigger this sort ofunsettling examination of both ones unconscious and ones conscience Hesalso fascinated by the infectious nature of calamity The success with which hesimultaneously analyzes and communicates its uneasy intimacy is his geniusThomas Hardy was another great master of morality psychology andcircumstance but his tragedies never make you nervous McEwan makes younervous            In his latest book Enduring Love  this struggle tomake sense of misfortune is an explicit enterprise a contentious necessity forthe novels three main characters The worst one senses has already happenedand the narrator Joe Rose is returning to his storys beginning just as areader might in order to understand what went wrong Joe is a science writerwho has made a successful career of elucidating complex phenomena black holeschaos theory for the general reader His commonlaw wife is Clarissa Mellon abeautiful Keats scholar with whom he lives in North London Then oneafternoon during a celebratory picnic in the countryside near Oxford theyhear a shout of distress A middleaged man is entangled in one of theanchoring lines of an enormous hotair balloon while his passenger a terrifiedchild is unsuccessfully attempting to escape from the basket            Joeinstinctively sprints to the balloonists aid as do four other men who happento witness the event two farm laborers a motorist named John Logan and JedParry a daytripper from London In hindsight Joes description of hisactions signals the undertow of bewildered culpability that will run throughoutthe novel We turned to look across the field and saw the danger Next thingI was running toward it As it turns out this altruistic instinct provesfatal not for the narrator but for one of the other rescuers After ahairraising and chaotic collective attempt to retrieve the boy a sudden gustof wind lifts the men into the air the others drop away but Logan a localdoctor and father of two holds on as the unburdened balloon shoots suddenlyskyward A few moments later he falls to his death as the others look onguiltstricken and disbelieving Which of the survivors let go first therebycausing the rest to follow suit How could they have managed itdifferently            When Joe and Clarissa return to their apartmentin London they find themselves obsessively reiterating the afternoons eventsin an attempt to contain and absorb them We were prisoners in a cell Joeremembers running at the walls beating them back with our heads Slowly ourprison grew larger They sit at the kitchen table for hours grinding thejagged edge of memories hammering the unspeakable into forms of words By thetime they turn in for the night they have already forgotten Parry the awkwardyoung hiker who had wanted Joe to pray with him over Logans shattered body Hehas been relegated to an anecdote and dismissed But Parry as it turns outhas not forgotten Joe Quite the opposite and just as the couple is driftingoff to sleep he phones Joe to declare his undying love I just wanted you toknow I understand what youre feeling I feel it too Rattled anddisbelieving Joe hangs up on Parry and tells Clarissa its a wrong number Andfrom that moment on their interpretations of events diverge and theirrelationship begins to crumble            In thedays that follow Parrys fixation intensifies Joes paranoia correspondinglydeepens and Clarissa becomes increasingly alienated Joe has done nothing toencourage Parrys attentions and yet even before he realizes that Parry isstalking him he feels apprehensive hunted It is almost as if Joes guiltover Logans death has brought Parry into being Why doesnt Clarissa ever seeParry if he is stalking Joe daily and why did Joe erase all Parrys messageson the answering machine instead of saving them as evidence Before long theapartment is awash in Parrys letters and Clarissa has moved into the sparebedroom And as Clarissas support for Joe is withdrawn we too begin to haveour misgivings To be sure Joes narrative is intelligent and persuasive butthen again so are Parrys letterstwo of which are included in the text forour inspectionand we know that hes insane Baffled and disoriented we pickour way among these versions of the truth straining for a synthesis that wouldpermit some hope for the couples future Meanwhile Joe lurches from oneunnerving mission to the next a trip to Oxford to meet Logans furious widowa Kafkaesque visit to the local police station a sinister expedition to buy agun from some aging hippies And there is an expensive birthday lunch withClarissa and her godfather which begins with a lively discussion of DNA andKeats and ends in a fine spray of blood            One of the initial frustrations of Enduring Love isthe eclipse of the balloon accident Parrys fixation feels like a bluntinstrument in comparison and one begins to long for the delicate moralcomplexity of the tragedy that produced him in the first place Five strangersconverging in the center of a field to save a child and killing a man insteadBut that sort of balletic patterning is precisely what McEwan is calling intoquestion At one point Joe muses that Diracs early theory of quantumelectrodynamics was slow to gain acceptance because it was aestheticallyunappealingAcceptance withheld on grounds of uglinessand this phrasecould well serve as the novels ironic motto for its plot is littered withexamples of this prejudice When the balloonist yells perfectly reasonableinstructions to his wouldbe helpers in the field they all ignore him becausehe appears incompetent The police dismiss Joes warnings about Parry becausethey have a neater theory Logans widow becomes convinced that her husband wasadulterous because after his death she finds a womans scarf in his car Butis the elegant embodiment of an idea ever the entire story On Keats Grecianurn perhaps or in Einsteins theory of relativity or even in a love letterBut real life lived in real time requires us to push a lot harder for thetruth as does any love thatunlike Parrysevolves between two people Theconclusion of Enduring Love  appropriately enough proves impossible toforesee Ingeniously rewarding and unusually contingent on the intellectualcuriosity of the reader it offers a playful reprimand to anyone who assumesthat they know where the real story of this novel begins and ends
