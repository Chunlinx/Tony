                okay well hello Frances   hello Paul   um  yeah i guess when i uh first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh   screening uh uh screening for potential problems good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then ive been hearing uh   yeah   well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the     yes uhhuh   the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis   well the reliability seems to   not be too great um i dont know   im kind of like you i have mixed feelings but all in all i think im for it  uh  i really do um   yeah   because we lose so much time and what have you with the the drug problem and its just so prevalent nowadays that uh i think its only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh have some kind of guidelines to go by   uhhuh   but like anything else this can be misused   yeah theres a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems theyve had with employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if youre driving a train or plane or something of course thered be increased need for it   uhhuh   one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh theres they most of them dont test for actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse   right   and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh i i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country       so it seems kind of too bad that that ones tolerated while other ones are are you know are the ones that they focus on   well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more harm with the uh i dont know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh     well see now in Texas uh didnt they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago   yes yes but we arent very uh we arent very hard even on the you know when theyre picked up for drunk driving time after time again   oh really   this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two DWIs   oh man   and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone     yeah   and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so weve got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh   uhhuh right yeah yeah i expect possibly in Texas its uh you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well ive done that before or hes just a good old boy you know   the good old yeah good old boy stuff  you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect     yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the highway   yeah and i im afraid you know it may come out with some of these other drugs too that uh i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know its they use cocaine   uhhuh   and its acceptable its becoming acceptable to them that well you know theyre not   um   theyre not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this before  and im afraid thats what we may be   uhhuh   facing in the very near future   umhum   other than that i dont know because i dont  drink and i dont do drugs and its uh so neither is really acceptable to me   well same here   yeah yeah   but uh then the work place its just i dont know what is well we really infringing on other rights or their
