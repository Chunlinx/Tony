                                 The Book Industrys BestSeller Lists            These days it seems as ifhalf the books in bookstores have the word best seller or some variant on thecover or the flap copy as in the bestselling author of  But what doesthat mean About as much as the phrase original recipe does on a jar ofspaghetti sauce Neither the government nor the publishing industry regulatesthe use of the term and besides there are many different kinds of bestsellerlists published every week in the United States There are the major nationallists the New York Times  the Wall Street Journal  USAToday  and Publishers Weekly  and the major regional lists theWashington Post  the San Francisco Chronicle  the Los AngelesTimes  the Boston Globe  and the Chicago Tribune  There arelists that compare sales at chain stores with sales at independent storesThere are romance lists business lists AfricanAmerican lists religiouslists health lists and childrens lists            What is abestseller list It is a ranking of the relative sales of particular kinds ofbooks at certain groups of stores within a oneweek period Bestseller liststell us not which books sell the most in absolute terms but which fictionnonfiction or advice books sell the fastest at the bookstores list makersthink deserve attention A howto book that sells  copies in one weekwill shoot to the top of the bestseller lists whether or not those are theonly copies it ever sells A novel that sells  copies a week for  yearswill never appear on the lists because each week it will be beaten byfasterselling books            Why do bestseller lists matter so much Because they arethe most convincing form of publicity around which gives them the quality ofselffulfilling prophecies If a book is a best seller bookstore clerks willbe more likely to put it in the front of the store and readers to buy itPublishers will also be eager to publish more books like it since bestsellerlists also stand in for industrywide sales data Most book publishingcompanies are privately held and keep this information secret even when thecompanies are publicly traded it is nearly impossible to find out the unitsales of individual books            This helpsaccount for the uniformity in the books that top all these listsbooks bybrandname or celebrity authors inspirational and selfhelp books Someauthors will do anything to try to break this vicious cycle In Business Week ran a story about two authors who purchased  copiesof their own book The Discipline of Market Leaders  and got theircorporate clients to buy  to  more in a successful plot to getonto the New York Times list Click to read about the legal tricks bookeditors employ to try to place their books on the Times list            These days what bestseller lists are mostlikely to reflect is the amount of money spent to publicize the books that windup on them Superstores now allow publishers to pay to place a book up front orin the window or to display advertising That plus an author tour orappearance on national TV shows can propel readers into stores fast enough toget a book on the list Wordofmouth or good reviews dont generate thedramatic concentrated sales required            Somelists gather sales figures from more stores than others do The New YorkTimes boasts the most stores reporting plus wholesalers TheVoice Literary Supplement list which tells you what the seriousbohemians are reading asks only about  highend independent storesincluding San Franciscos City Lights Washington DCs Politics and Proseand the Harvard Bookstore Some list makers rely on statistical sampling andextrapolation to provide an estimation of what is selling at the stores that donot report some dont Some lists such as the Wall Street Journal sonly track sales in big chain stores Others such as USA Today sinclude online booksellers Some follow only independent stores            This may seem haphazard compared with the way the musicindustrys main bestseller listpublished in Billboard magazineiscompiled It tracks every single album sold at every single music store in theUnited States SoundScan Inc the company that began tracking CD and tapesales with a barcode system has in fact tried to get booksellers to employ acomparable system called BookScan but with little success The problem ispartly that BookScan is too expensive for many booksellers But the real issueis that BookScan misses the point Book industry people dont want a singlecompilation of whats really selling best throughout the country they want avariety of lists that break down sales figures in ways beneficial to them            Here aresome of the most closely watched lists in the publishing industry                                             NewYork Times                                       The New York Timeslist is the industry standard Its the most prestigious appearing as it doesin the premier book review in the country And its the widestreaching basedon data from the largest number of stores Many bookstores sell New YorkTimes best sellers at a discount thereby generating even more sales forNew York Times best sellers Publishers regularly write bonuses intocontracts to factor in the possibility that a book will makes the Timeslist This clause is typically phrased  for positions   forpositions  and  for positions             TheTimes divides its best sellers into hardcover and paperback lists andthen divides each of these into fiction nonfiction and a third categorycalled Advice HowTo and Miscellaneous This last category has led some toaccuse the straight nonfiction list of being a useful fiction designed togive publicity to books that would otherwise fail            One significant but littleknown fact about theTimes bestseller list is that it does not follow every single bookpublished each year Instead the Times sends a list to bookstoresindicating which books they are tracking as potential future best sellers andasks for sales information on those books and any others the bookstores wantto report on The Times says this tracking list is drawn up frominformation from bookstores but publishers say they routinely call up theTimes to tip them off to books selling with increasing momentum so thatthey can be added to the tracking list            TheTimes Web site publishes another list Chains vs Independents whichcompares how books in all three categories are selling in these two differenttypes of outlets This list was a concession to independent bookstores many ofwhich were outraged when the Times created hot links between everysingle book on its Internet bestseller list and Barnes  Nobles onlinebookstore which then gave a  percent discount to all the listed books Someindependent bookstores were so angry about this that they boycotted the listand early in  about  bookstores in Northern California refused toreport their sales to the New York Times list The Times claimedthat the number boycotting never reached a critical mass that would havethreatened the integrity of its list                                             SanFrancisco Chronicle                                       The San FranciscoChronicle bestseller list tracks sales at about  stores in the Bay Areagathering data from a larger percentage of independent stores than the NewYork Times list does This doesnt mean the Chronicle list doesntcontain traditional mainstream commercial titlesit doesbut it includesbooks too esoteric for the chains and books that people are willing to pay fullprice for Occasionally books thought of as backlist titles or classics willpop up on this list and many less flashy books that are quality reads startout on the independentheavy lists such as the Chronicle s            TheChronicle list is most valued by publishers for what is considered itspredictive value Recent national best sellers such as Snow Falling onCedars  Cold Mountain  and Divine Secrets of the YaYaSisterhood appeared on the Chronicle list long before they made itto the New York Times  AS Byatts Possession was on theChronicle list for six weeks before it appeared on the Timeslist                                             USAToday                                                      USA Today s list isthe most inclusive one around It lists  books  on its Web site andmixes all categories fiction nonfiction hardcover trade and mass marketpaperbacks Its authors gather data in a straightforward fashion They recordactual sales no statistical sampling at  bookstores and include onlinebooksellers which many other lists dont This results in an unusual list thatpits the paperbacks of successful literary novels such as Arundhati RoysThe God of Small Things against hardcover celebrity health books such asMarilu Henners Total Health Makeover and inspirational titles such asChicken Soup for the Pet Lovers Soul  The list even includes theoccasional childrens title Literary books rarely appear in the first positions                           USAToday s list shows how different types of books that are separated on otherlists rank against one another For example Ron Chernows Titan  abiography of John D Rockefeller Sr held the ninth position on the NewYork Times nonfiction list the week of Aug  On the USA Todaylist it was not even in the top  The often ignored murky bottom of theUSA Today list also makes interesting reading It is peppered withliterary books such as The Catcher in the Rye and To Kill aMockingbird  which are probably selling well because of
