                    Background        The cells response to hormones is a dynamic process        that requires the efficient transmission of signals from        the extracellular environment to specific intracellular        sites For PKA and PKC the primary signal is generated at        the plasma membrane and proceeds through intermediary        Gproteins that stimulate adenylyl cyclase    or        phospholipases    to generate the second messengers cAMP        and diacylglycerol respectively The diffusion of these        soluble second messengers leads to the activation of PKA        and PKC at specific subcellular locations      The two        families of the regulatory subunits of PKA RI and RII        have distinct cAMP binding properties and phosphorylation        states      Each family has two different isoforms a        and  resulting in four distinct types RI RI RII        RII The different R isoforms have distinct tissue and        subcellular distributions suggesting that they may be        selectively targeted by scaffold proteins eg AKAPs        anchored through different anchoring proteins      PKC        has at least  isoforms     The physiological role of        the individual PKCs has not been elucidated because most        cells express multiple isoforms having nearly identical        ligand binding properties and substrate specificity        Compartmentation of PKC isoforms has been suggested as a        mechanism for targeting selectivity near their        physiological substrates      Consistent with this        theme of selectivity work with isoformspecific antibodies        demonstrated that PKC isoforms have distinct subcellular        locations            It has been known for the past decade that        compartmentalization of PKA can occur through association        with Akinase anchoring proteins AKAPs This association        ensures specificity in signal transduction by placing        kinases close to their appropriate substrates where they        can swiftly respond to second messengers     Another        advantage of compartmentation to specific subcellular        locations is to restrict accessibility to certain        substrates Selected AKAPs have been identified that can        interact with both PKA and PKC      For example it        was shown that AKAP  maintains PKA PKC and protein        phosphatase B at the postsynaptic density of mammalian        synapses      Likewise gravin a second PKAPKC        anchoring protein targets these kinases to the membrane        cytoskeleton     AKAP gravin and its mouse homolog        clone  thus belong to the recently identified class of        scaffolding proteins that coordinate multiple kinase        activity by bringing them to one site        For PKA binding it was thought for a long time that        only RII subunits bind to AKAPs However a new class of        AKAPs was discovered when two dualspecific AKAPs DAKAP        and DAKAP were cloned using a fusion protein of the RI        as the bait in a yeast twohybrid screen             Therefore the contrasted distribution pattern between RI        and RII may in part be due to selective association with        different compartmentalized pools of AKAPs        Only recently has the subcellular distribution of PKA at        neuromuscular junctions NMJs and the adjacent muscle been        systematically studied      ImaizumiScherrer and        colleagues demonstrated that RI is localized at the NMJ            but whether RI associates with a DAKAP in this        region of muscle is not known However a recent study        showing the colocalization of DAKAP with RI at the NMJ        supports the prediction that localization of the R subunit        there requires interaction with an AKAP     RII has        been shown to be associated with mAKAP in heart and        skeletal muscle      however little is known        regarding the expression patterns of RII and AKAPs in the        perijunctional regions More information has accumulated        concerning PKC expression associated with the NMJ and        skeletal muscle PKC was shown to localize to the        presynaptic terminals of NMJs      whereas PKC        plays a postsynaptic role at the NMJ     In skeletal        muscle PKC was found in human muscle fibers    and        with Ttubules in rabbit skeletal muscle     However        it is unknown whether tethering to a PKCanchoring protein        mediates the localization to these compartments        The work reported here was undertaken to further        understand the compartmentalization of PKA and PKC through        association with AKAPs Because RI was observed in close        association with the NMJ postsynaptic membrane     we        probed for DAKAP expression and possible colocalization        with this and other regulatory subunits We also        investigated the distribution of gravin at the NMJ because        this AKAP is an autoantigen for myasthenia gravis a        degenerative disease of the NMJ                    Results        Western blot assays confirmed that the antibodies used        are monospecific fig  The blots show that PKC the        major PKC isoform present in muscle is not detected by the        PKCII antibody and that there is little overlap between        the specificities of the PKA regulatory subunit antibodies        As with a previous report studying different groups of        skeletal muscle     the soluble fraction contained        most of the RI A band for RII was detected in contrast        to a report of no RII detection in soleus or extensor        digitorum longus muscles     which might be explained        by the presence of nerve fibers or adipocytes wherein RII        is prevalent     The blot for the affinitypurified        DAKAP antibody is shown because the proteinA purified        antibody displayed additional unexplained bands however        no difference in fluorescence labeling was observed when        using antibodies purified either way        A previous report using immunofluorescence demonstrated        colocalization of RI with the nicotinic acetylcholine        receptor nAChR at the NMJ postsynaptic membrane            We used immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal        microscopy to acquire detailed information as to the        intracellular localization of DAKAP in the several        regions of the NMJ and adjacent intercostal muscle to        compare with that of RI Rhodamineconjugated        bungarotoxin was used to delineate the postsynaptic        membrane of the NMJ because it binds tightly to the nAChR        found at this membrane Because DAKAP was shown to        associate with mitochondria     doublelabeling with        markers for this organelle either antilipoic acid or        anticytochrome c was used to examine whether RI or        DAKAP are associated with mitochondria in the NMJ        We found partial overlap of the RI label with        synaptophysin which labels presynaptic vesicles fig a        Importantly RI was observed to be concentrated in other        vicinities of the presynapse as well In the postsynaptic        region RI immunoreactivity showed partial overlap with        the mitochondrial marker lipoic acid overlap with        mitochondria in muscle fibers was also observed fig b        In muscle labeling of the Iband by anti RI was dominant        The Iband contains actin and is where mitochondria are        located but has no myosin        The distribution of DAKAP at the postsynaptic NMJ and        the adjacent muscle is similar to that of RI although        there is no codistribution at the presynaptic region        between these two labels fig a DAKAP is expressed in        both NMJ and intercostal muscle DAKAP codistribution        with cytochrome c mitochondrial marker is significant        fig a but not as pronounced as the RII association        with mitochondria compare with fig  We observed an        enrichment of DAKAP at the postsynaptic membrane as        shown by codistribution with nAChR fig b As with RI        labeling of the actin region by antiDAKAP was dominant        fig a c Because the labeling patterns for RI and        DAKAP appear similar in the muscle fibers and at the        postsynaptic membrane DAKAP may anchor RI in these        regions which further supports the cloning and biochemical        evidence of interaction between these proteins             Phalloidin was used as a positive control for the actin        region of muscle fibers fig c The noprimary control        was clean fig d Because the antibodies to DAKAP and        RI were produced in rabbit and mouse respectively        doublelabeling confocal experiments could be performed        with these antibodies on the same tissue slice in order to        test for colocalization The same applies for antiRII and        antiRII We found that the labeling patterns for these        two antibodies in muscle tissue counterstained with        bungarotoxin and antiDAKAP data not shown was not        modified from that found when counterstained with        bungarotoxin and a mitochondrial marker see below        indicating partial colocalization of DAKAP with RII but        little if any overlap with RII In contrast the RI        labeling was invariably almost completely abolished when        counterstained with bungarotoxin and antiDAKAP in        multiple experiments data not shown This suggests to us        that antiDAKAP may be occluding RI bound to DAKAP to        the extent that antiRI has little access to its        antigen        As shown in figure  RII is found in the postsynaptic        region of the NMJ and did not precisely overlap with the        bungarotoxin label but instead encompassed a broader area        of this region RII immunoreactivity appeared to be        punctate in the cytosol yet contrasted with the punctate        distribution of mitochondria The presence of labeling at        the NMJ is consistent with the prevalence of RII in        neuronal tissue     The lack of staining in the muscle        fibers is in agreement with the report that RII did not        show significant hybridization with skeletal muscle                   Triplelabeling immunofluorescent staining patterns        fig  suggests that RII is concentrated in the        postsynaptic vicinity of the NMJ but is not colocalized        with the nAChR RII immunoreactivity exhibited significant        overlap with mitochondria in the postsynaptic region of the        NMJ and with mitochondria in skeletal muscle fibers        Labeling of the Iband was dominant Interestingly intense        immunoreactivity was found to be consistently localized        with the zline Of the  kinase and AKAP labeling patterns        shown in this paper RII is the only one that strongly        associates with the zline contrast with the phalloidin        labeling shown in fig c        The labeling pattern of DAKAP fig  differs from        that of DAKAP Even though the striated labeling in the        muscle fibers appears similar to the striations noted for        DAKAP and RI and is where actin is prevalent the        overlap with the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c is        poor in contrast with observations of close overlap in        cells     In the NMJ the DAKAP pattern is rather        diffuse being present in both postsynaptic and presynaptic        vicinities and appears dissimilar to the mitochondrial        pattern        Intense PKC immunoreactivity was found in both        postsynaptic and presynaptic regions fig  consistent        with enhanced PKC and PKC labeling in the NMJ            Over a background of more diffuse staining two stronger        bands can be observed One band codistributes with nAChR        The other band is in the presynaptic region and parallels        the nAChR band In addition to these bands there is strong        immunoreactivity in other areas of the presynapse The        labeling pattern of PKC is sufficiently different from        that of the mitochondrial label to indicate that there is        no association with this organelle in either the NMJ or        muscle fibers PKC labeling in the muscle fibers is faint        which corroborates the report that PKC and PKC are the        predominant PKC isoforms in skeletal muscle     with        PKC being more abundant in the membrane fraction of muscle        and PKC being more abundant in the cytosolic fraction        As with PKC gravin codistributes with nAChR fig         Immunoreactivity is predominantly in the postsynaptic        region and doesnt overlap particularly well with the        mitochondrial marker The strongest labeling is at the        plasma membrane This labeling is consistent with the        report that gravin possesses several targeting motifs that        direct it to the membranecytoskeleton     In the        muscle fibers striations of staining are noticeable Even        though there is partial overlap of these striations with        those typical of mitochondria labeled with cytochrome c        the staining occurs where actin is prevalent Because        gravin has a putative actinbinding domain it is likely        that the association is with actin Tables and summarize        the compartmental localization and mitochondrial        association in the NMJ and intercostal muscle of the        several AKAPs and kinases studied based on the        immunofluorescence work reported here                    Discussion        The work presented here adds to the emerging evidence        that PKA and PKC signaling at the NMJ and adjacent        intercostal muscle is compartmentalized Differential        compartmentation of these signaling molecules in cells and        tissues is being recognized as a mechanism to regulate        their specificity reviewed recently by     A Kinase        Anchoring Proteins AKAPs can direct their subcellular        localization by binding directly to regulatory subunits of        PKA or to the catalytic core of PKC Many AKAPs have been        identified although information about their subcellular        distribution in different tissues is largely lacking        Because we produced antibodies to two novel dualspecific        AKAPs DAKAP and DAKAP and gravin we were uniquely        positioned to use immunofluorescence to investigate their        possible roles in kinase signaling in and around the NMJ        Our interest in PKA and PKC activity in the NMJ derives        from  a report that RI not only is enriched there but        also appears to be tethered to the postsynaptic membrane             the rich literature describing selective PKC        isoform activity and functional compartmentalization in the        NMJ and skeletal muscle  our discoveries that DAKAP        and DAKAP bind to and appear to colocalize with RI and        often mitochondria       and  our finding that        gravin binds to both PKA and PKC            We found that DAKAP appears to colocalize with RI at        the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ which houses the        nAChR but not in the presynaptic region This observation        is supported by previous work that demonstrated RI        codistribution with nAChR    and DAKAP           suggesting that this AKAP is the anchoring protein        recruiting RI to this membrane This putative association        is strengthened by finding for the first time that        targeting of RI requires the AKAP binding surface            Yotiao is another AKAP enriched at the NMJ but appears to        bind only RII     PKA phosphorylates the nAChR when        stimulated at the synapse by the neuropeptide CGRP and by        adenosine from muscle responding to acetylcholine reviewed        by     This phosphorylation may regulate the        degradation of the nAChR     Consistent with the        action at the presynapse it was shown that PKA        facilitation of acetylcholine release is dependent on nerve        endplate calcium concentration     Based on our        observation of colocalization with synaptophysin at        presynaptic vesicles RI may be the isotype that        influences this release of neurotransmitter        We found that RI occupies the same region as        mitochondria in intercostal muscle The presence of RI in        soleus muscle was shown with Western blots by Hoover and        coworkers     but was not seen with immunofluorescence        of tibialis anterior muscle      Reinitz and        coworkers    provided evidence suggesting that RI        associates with membrane fractions in cardiac muscle when        it is not associated with the catalytic subunit The same        may be true for intercostal muscle in which case        association with the sarcolemma mitochondria or other        organelles is possible Furthermore RI was shown to bind        to cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb a mitochondrial inner        membrane protein which faces the matrix in a        cAMPdependent manner     How RI passes across the        mitochondrial inner membrane is not known Previously we        observed that DAKAP mRNA and protein expressions are high        in muscle     In situ hybridization showed consistency        of DAKAP and RI staining in tongue muscle indicating        that in vitro association can indeed predict in situ        interaction for these molecules Consistent with the        observed mitochondrial staining by antiDAKAP it was        shown previously that one of the two alternative        NHterminal motifs of this AKAP is necessary and        sufficient for targeting to mitochondria            Interestingly another AKAP governs voltagedependent        potentiation of Ltype calcium channels through anchoring        of PKA in transverse tubules     Because this        potentiation is not dependent on RII it is thought that        RI is capable of this AKAPdirected modulation of calcium        channel activity            The labeling pattern of DAKAP is diffuse in the NMJ        yet localized to the actin region in muscle In our        previous immunofluorescence work examining DAKAP        subcellular localization the protein displayed a diffuse        background in addition to mitochondrial staining            It was thought that the combination of specific and diffuse        labeling indicated the presence of more than one pool of        DAKAP inside the cells examined Whereas DAKAP appears        to colocalize with mitochondria in muscle fibers DAKAP        shows no such association This observation is not        surprising because it is not expected that their targets        need to be in the same organelle or even subcellular        region Whether DAKAP binds specifically to actin remains        to be determined        RII localized quite well to mitochondria in both NMJ        and muscle regions PKA association with mitochondria has        been well documented         In mammalian        sperm it was found that nearly all RIIspecific labeling        was with mitochondria     Furthermore in bovine        heart PKA activity was detected in the matrix or the        matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane             However the work of Halestrap and coworkers provided        little evidence for intramitochondrial protein        phosphorylation by PKA but gave some evidence for outer        membrane phosphorylation both integral and loosely bound        proteins       The localization of RII to the        postsynaptic region beyond the postsynaptic membrane is        consistent with part of the immunostaining of NMJs in the        soleus muscle     yet differs in part because there is        no overlap with the bungarotoxin label however this is in        agreement with another study            PKC colocalizes with gravin at the postsynaptic        membrane where the gravin staining is strongest PKC has        been suggested to play a role in synapse stability and        signal transduction at the NMJ     When calcium influx        through the nAChR occurs acetylcholine appears to activate        PKC phosphorylation of this receptor reviewed by            Phorbol ester activation of PKC causes loss of synapses and        nAChR     Because the presynaptic PKC fluorescence        band parallels the nAChR band see fig  it may be        labeling the presynaptic membrane consistent with reports        of PKC localization to the presynaptic terminals of NMJs             PKC initially associates with the cytoskeleton            Phosphorylation at two places on the kinase core is        required first to activate PKC and second to release it        from its cytoskeletal anchorage Our immunofluorescence        results may be the visualization of two pools of PKC The        observed bands may represent kinase anchored directly to        the cytoskeleton perhaps on the presynaptic side where        little gravin staining was found or anchored to gravin        perhaps on the postsynaptic side The more diffuse staining        found in both pre and postsynaptic regions may represent        released hence activated kinase        As with PKC gravin was seen to be directed to the        postsynaptic membrane Strong labeling was also seen at the        plasma membranecytoskeleton see fig  consistent with        the report of Nauert and coworkers     Interestingly        a homology search of a database revealed a MARCKS homology        actinbinding domain in gravin In addition to acting as a        scaffolding protein for kinases and phosphatases gravin        forms a dynamic complex with betaadrenergic receptors            The same report also showed that the association of        betaadrenergic receptors with PKA could be blocked by the        Ht peptide which blocks AKAPkinase binding In addition        to a PKC binding site gravin contains a PKA binding site        Hence the betaadrenergic receptor may be tethered to PKA        via gravin PKC may bind to this anchoring protein through        displacement of the pseudosubstrate thus inhibiting the        kinase activity by analogy with a functionally similar        scaffolding AKAP AKAP                        Conclusions        The distinctive labeling patterns of each of the seven        kinase and anchoring antibodies investigated argues for the        existence of microdomains of signaling pathways It appears        that several AKAPs may be in close proximity yet it still        needs to be determined if waves of cAMP would turn on        signals in a local or global way Moreover the signals        that cells in tissues receive from the surrounding matrix        may provide a different microenvironment of kinase        anchoring from that of cultured cells An example is the        association of DAKAP with mitochondria in cultured        myocytes    that is not present in muscle tissue fig                            Materials and Methods

anticytochrome c or          antilipoic acid cofactor  overnight at C The tissue          was washed extensively with working buffer after the          overnight incubation Secondary antibodies and          bungarotoxin were added for  hour at C in the dark          Afterwards the tissue was again washed extensively with          working buffer before mounting on glass slides and          coverslipped with gelvatol antifade medium The          slides were stored in a refrigerator until imaged A          noprimary control was used to select conditions that          blocked the nonspecific labeling of secondary antibodies          Laserscanning confocal microscopy was performed as          described previously     Experiments were repeated          at least once to confirm the fluorescence patterns Each          fluorophore was recorded separately using narrowband          filters centered at  fluorescein  rhodamine          and  nm cy Zseries were recorded with each          fluorophore with xy pixel size of  microns and          zstep of  microns Each series comprised between           and  optical sections Zseries were deblurred using a          blind deconvolution algorithm from Autoquant                            List of abbreviations        AKAP  A kinase anchoring protein        DAKAP  dual RI and RIIspecific AKAP        KLH  keyhole limpet
