the press is always asserting that he is doing so reluctantly for thefirst time and so on He blabs about the Wound in the  and  editionsof Unlimited Partners Our American Story  his book with wife Elizabethand his reflections on the Wound and the aftermath consume a great chunk ofRichard Ben Cramers nonpareil book about the  campaign What It TakesThe Way to the White House  And he discussed it

  Philadelphia Inquirer  Aug              The medias misperception about the Wound pairsnicely with their other blind spot that a new sensitive Dole has emerged toreplace the mean hatchet man When Dole misted up at the conventionreporters wrote as if the Midwest stoic had finally found his heart when infact a sluice of his tears courses its way through his recent career He sobbedwhen he paid a recent visit to Ikes boyhood home in Abilene Kan when heretired from the Senate earlier this summer when he visited his hometown ofRussell Kan in March when he helped plant Nixon in Whittier in

as a New Age s guy who is finally making the bighug with the inner child who was ravaged by the Wound            Dont blame Dole He hasnt exploited his war record forpolitical purposes any more than did John PT Kennedy or George GrummanAvenger Bush And while he hasnt rubbed his game wing directly in Clintonsdraftdodging face in pursuit of votes hell probably do whatever it takes towin if hes woefully behind in October            Neitherexploiting the Wound nor shunning it Dole has folded it into his lifeestablishing the Dole Foundation to help the disabled pushing the AmericansWith
