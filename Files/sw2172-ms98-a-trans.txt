           okay do you um have a garden   um i have several outside shrubs that i maintain take care of   umhum do you enjoy working out in the yard   yeah i certainly do uh i planted uh a rosebed last year   umhum   and uh they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink   uhhuh ive had some roses out in my backyard too and theyve done real well i was surprised i we had some in Virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the Texas climate better   uh yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh lot of uh oh  some some plant food once a month   right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain because our soil is so bad where i live do you live in Texas or   yeah im in uh Plano   Plano oh yeah im out in Rowlett and we have that brown clay soil  and its real hard to grow anything here   yeah ive got a well my roses are on the west side of the house i asked my neighbors what they wanted to see outside their uh front door   uhhuh   because its right by their entryway and they they wanted roses so  thats what i planted   oh  thats accommodating   umhum yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the the freeze this winter   yeah   ive got quite a few dead shrubs some  and oleander   right weve got a few things too its hard to tell if theyll come back or not   yeah the trees are all doing really well ive got a nice Japanese maple out front that uh looking really nice right now   well thats good we we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies were going to something else   uhhuh   but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully itll drain this year   yeah yeah every year uh theres some freeze damage and i lose different uh variety of shrubs   yeah   have to go replace them with uh something a little hardier   yeah its hard to find something thatll take the heat as well as the freezing   umhum   that we get down here i have a few little flowers i plant around the trees out front ive enjoyed doing those i put uh pansies out in the winter and they pretty much last all winter and then i put uh moss rose out in the summer and it just goes crazy you dont really have to do anything to it   uhhuh   puts a lot of color out there   yeah i dont do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of evergreen evergreen type shrubs some uh   all year right   some uh dwarf Burford hollies and Yaupon hollies   oh yeah those do pretty well here dont they   they do very well umhum   weve got my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of make a little cut so that the kids wouldnt come marching through the yard and everything   yeah they make a nice hedge uh   yeah   and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you dont have to trim them uh into a boxy type hedge you can just let them uh grow their natural uh shape   right yeah the only thing i dont like about them is weeding around them because they get so sharp pricky things get in your hands   oh yeah oh ive got some Chinese Hollies that are just outrageous they they are very sharp   oh really   do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that   yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff   yeah i do that myself too i i really dont appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me   yeah we get something on the door about every week   because ive got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only forty five by ninety feet   uhhuh   its what they call low maintenance yard and these uh uh maintenance uh companies call up wanting to uh uh put put the uh weed killer and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge forty or forty five dollars per application for my size yard i i dont spend that much in a year   yeah really oh our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and i dont think it looks any better than what my husband does so   uhhuh   im not really tempted to do that either if   it doesnt take much work   yeah i can mow the backyard but theres something about the grass in our front yard is so dense   huh uhhuh   that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it   yeah ive got a little electric mower and i i will never buy another one of those again   oh really   its fine for my size yard but uh it really doesnt have the power of a gas motor   huh i would like a selfpropelled one i think   umhum   that might make it easier   its better for for a large yard   yeah ours is not that big but like i said if i had to mow the front id be stuck because i cant get it to move   yeah before i moved down here when i was up uh north in Wisconsin living with my folks they lived on uh three and a half acres of land and uh we started mowing that with a push mower   oh   uh they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big improvement for for us  us kids who had to go out there and uh mow the the grass every every week   oh im sure yeah thats a pretty large area   it it still took a few hours even with the riding mower   really did people up there edge as pri as strictly and stuff as they do down here   um not nearly as much as here uh i think its probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and uh there just wasnt the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice   yeah yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in Virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didnt get into like they do here in Texas wasnt a source of pride or something like it is down here   yeah a lot of people do but then again there are a lot who do nothing   yeah   my street uh is kind of in between there are a couple of uh neighbors who are are really good about planting flowers and trees   umhum   but there the majority really havent done anything with their yards this neighborhood is is four years old   yeah   and you would think that uh in that time theyd uh get their lawns and and gardens established   yeah its hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband tilled it up in the fall and then weve been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of a bout a dollar and uh he has never got it to us so it just sits out there kind of dug up and doesnt look too good so i cant say anything about anybody elses   umhum yeah id like to see the the neighbors put some trees in the front yards anyway just to get something started   yeah itd seem like theyd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer   right youd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree   yeah yeah   its nice when the builders plant trees for you when when they build the house   yeah did they not put any in in your neighborhood   no uh my builder was Gemcraft and they didnt put uh trees in at all   we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so thats where we keep putting that pecan keeps dying we have uh i think its a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that thats hung on out there   yeah the trouble with with builders planting the trees is they they get the weaker varieties ones that arent as desirable   right   and uh those include Arizona Ash and in some cases silver maples   yeah hope ours continues to live its been there about four i guess almost four years now so maybe its established established enough that itll go on and survive   yeah thats probably true ive got a live oak in front uh i i really like the oaks a lot   i like an oak oak trees yeah   theyre very hardy for this area   my um husbands father has a place out in East Texas so hes always digging up little red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but   umhum   so far we havent had much luck   oh i had a red oak a few years ago that i bought from uh from a guy who sold trees off the back of a trailer  and that was a mistake for uh well two reasons one thing it wasnt insured   uhhuh oh   and the other reason was that i bought it in spring and it was a balled and bur lapped tree uh right before summer the heat of summer it couldnt uh take the heat and it died   oh yeah well thats too bad weve got all of our trees from Calloways and luckily theyll take them back any time for any reason if they die   yeah i usually go to Callaways or Wolfe   umhum   Callaways tends to have nicer shrubs uh more fully developed   uhhuh   and uh i dont think theres a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their uh warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years   yeah i know the guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less   yeah   but Calloways has kept theirs forever so   really well thats good for trees i dont think they do that for shrubs   yeah yeah i dont know we havent bought   i think its still a year or less for uh for shrubs   uhhuh we havent bought any shrubs shrubs yet hopefully i think weve almost waited this too late this year now to start putting in anything of any size   oh its never too late to plant something unless unless well for trees if theyre balled and bur lapped its recommended to plant them in the fall or winter   yeah   but for uh just shrubs say five gallon or one gallon shrubs any time of the year is fine   oh really it wouldnt matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer   right just have to take care of them and water them uh so they get established put some uh uh some uh uh   root stimulator yeah   right right some uh stimulator down so uh yeah its never a problem to plant things in the summer   oh well thats good to know maybe theres still hope for our front yard this summer then   im just waiting for a sale   uhhuh   they havent really had any good sales on plants yet   yeah ive ive noticed that they havent had anything great   so but once they uh drop the prices a little bit ill be out there uh picking up a few more shrubs to fill in where were  where my dead shrubs are right now i havent even pulled them out of the ground yet   right yeah yeah last year we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them way back and and was able to save them but this year they look even worse   you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles   umhum   because theyll look really bad like theyre dead and all of a sudden theyll bud out   yeah   ive got several crepe myrtles that look just awful and uh there are buds coming out all over the place now   huh ours havent done anything yet this year   i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasnt done anything and im kind of wondering what kind of shape its in right now   yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color   have to make sure they dont get out of hand   in the summer oh we havent had that problem yet theyre pretty ours are pretty small   they they can tight they can get out of control   oh really   but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i havent had that problem yet   yeah   but i do have some really nice Boston ivy on the west side of the house   oh does it grow along a fence or something   grows on the on the brick   oh   on the house itself   uhhuh   that you have to really watch uh to uh keep it under control because they will take over a house if you dont uh tend to it   uhhuh   uh those things grow about an inch a day
