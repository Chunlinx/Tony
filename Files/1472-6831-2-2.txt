                    Background        Over the last  years the widespread usage of        fluoridated water and fluoridated dentrifices have been        cited as major reasons for a decline in caries since the        early s     and for the appearance of a significant        association between oral hygiene and caries experience              An inverse relationship exists between salivary        fluoride concentration and caries experience in the        deciduous and permanent dentition     but fluoride        concentration is excluded from most caries prediction        models      Acids in bacterial plaques cause caries in        pits fissures and interdental regions of teeth but they        also enhance the inhibitory effect of fluoride on        demineralization confounding the ability to predict caries        from the salivary fluoride concentration             The greater the consumption of dietary sucrose the        greater the fall in pH and fraction of acidogenic acid        tolerant bacteria in tooth adherent plaques      The        number of these bacteria mostly mutans streptococci and        lactobacilli and the fluoride content discriminate        between severe and mild caries in  yearold children             Acidtolerant bacteria require Dalanyl glycerol        lipoteichoic acid Dalanyl LTA in their membranes and        cell surfaces     Dalanyl LTA is made by esterifying        carboxylactivated Dalanine to glycerol in membrane LTA by        means of a Dalanylcarrier enzyme DCP     Strains of                Streptococcus mutans in which DCP is        inactive do not initiate growth at below pH  and make        glycerol LTA without Dalanine     In the DCP active        strains soluble DAlanyl LTA is extruded into culture        fluid         in vitro     or plaque         in vivo     The Dalanyl esters        are stable at pH  at C but hydrolyze to free        Dalanine and LTA with a halflife of  h at pH             Healthy gingival sulci have a pH of    and        inflamed sulci a pH of             About  of young adults have serum IgG antibodies that        precipitate with Dalanyl LTA but not with Dalaninefree        LTA      It is likely that plaques induce these IgG        antibodies from gingival sulci that contain more        acidtolerant bacteria An elevated IgG antibody response        to Dalanyl LTA may therefore indicate the subjects in whom        an inhibitory effect of fluoride on caries is enhanced The        fluoride concentrations of plaque and saliva are related to        whether the drinking water is fluoridated    and to        oral hygiene which nearly always involves using a        fluoridated dentrifice The aim of this study was therefore        to determine whether elevated antibody responders to        Dalanyl LTA show a association of DMFT with fluoride        exposure and gingival health not apparent in low        responders                    Methods                  Subjects          Antibody was obtained from blood from four sources            dental students   patients seeking dental          treatment   volunteer blood donors volunteers          and   siblings aged  through  from six Amish          families The dental students and patients were attending          the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center between           and  The volunteers and Amish family members          were attending centers elsewhere in the US at the same          time All subjects consented to provide blood for          antibody analysis according to local Institutional Review          Board procedures see Acknowledgements The student          patient and volunteer populations  subjects were          used to determine what IgG concentration constituted an          elevated antibody response to Dalanyl LTA to ensure          that these antibodies were not unique to dental or          Oklahoma populations and to examine whether the antibody          concentration was sex or ageassociated The Amish family          siblings were selected to determine the frequency of high          antibody concentration in children and young adults Each          sibling had at least one parent high responder to          increase the likelihood of exposure to an          antibodyassociated oral microbiota from birth          The clinical study participants consisted of  dental          students  male and  patients  male who          were medically healthy All had  or more natural teeth          and were aged  and  years Of these          participants  dental students and  patients provided          information that permitted an estimate of exposure to          fluoridated water residences from birth through age           in the  Fluoridation Census Subjects not using the          public water supply or resident outside of the US for          more than  months were excluded Exposure to water          fluoridation scored  for each of five year age          cohorts     and  to give a fluoride          exposure score F Score of  no exposure to           complete exposure described previously              Most dental students had mild caries and gingivitis          and most patients had moderate to severe caries and          gingivitis Exceptionally healthy or exceptionally          diseased subjects were therefore increased compared to a          similar number of subjects obtained as a random sample          This wide distribution of clinical measurements provided          more stable estimates narrower confidence intervals of          regression coefficients  than would be obtained from a          similar number from a random survey of the general          population Regression lines are more robust when a          greater range of measurements is used                              Clinical measurements          Dental caries experience was the number of Decayed          Missing and Filled Teeth DMFT excluding third molars          and teeth reported missing for other reasons Decayed          teeth DT were also enumerated separately from missing          and filled teeth MFT DT indicates a combination of          delay in seeking therapy and faster development of new          cavities Fluoridated dentrifice use is related to oral          hygiene but not toothbrushing frequency in adults aged as          in the present clinical study    and young enough to          have likely used fluoridated dentrifices from early          childhood Sensitive staining for plaque accumulation             was therefore used with measures of gingivitis and          pocket depth at the mesiobuccal buccal distolingual          and lingual surfaces of the six teeth employed for the          simplified oral hygiene index     substituting          adjacent teeth as necessary  sites sampled          Gingivitis was determined by whether a site bled          within  sec of gentle probing BOP     and pocket          depth by measuring the distance mm from the free          gingival margin to the base of the sulcus or pocket          Finally each subject was asked to suck an erythrosin          tablet for  sec and the sites examined for stained          plaque     For each subject the mean prevalences of          plaque PL and bleeding on probing BOP and the mean          pocket depth PD were calculated across all sampled          sites The clinical measurements were made by two          experienced clinicians who were calibrated for this          study The clinicians agreed strongly with respect to all          measurements correlation coefficients r   p            except gingival bleeding index for which a          weaker correlation was noted r   p            The data reported are the mean measurements from the          clinical examiners                          Antigen purification          Dalanyl LTA but not Dalaninefree LTA is present          in culture filtrates of           Streptococcus mutans GS              Bacteria were grown at C in trypticase soy broth to          late stationary phase  h when the maximal amount of          antigen is extruded into the culture fluid     After          centrifugation to remove the bacteria culture fluid            was concentrated fold over a YM Diaflo Membrane          filter Amicon Corp Beverley MA DAlanyl LTA in the          concentrate was detected by immunoelectrophoresis using          a standard human serum identified previously              DAlaninefree LTA does not react with this serum IgG                The Dalanyl LTA was purified by passing the          concentrated culture fluid over a    cm Sephacryl          column in  M NaCl buffered with  M sodium acetate          pH  Antigen in the fractions was collected After          equilibrating with  mM sodium acetate buffer pH  it          bound to a short Sephacryl S and eluted by adding           mM NaCl as described previously                              Measuring antibody content and determining high and          low responders          IgG antibody content was measured by          enzymeimmunoassay employing a Fast Assay Screening Test          System at room temperature     Pegs protruding from          a lid were placed over a well plate or trough          containing  ml of  gml Dalanyl LTA in acetate          buffer pH  for  h Becton Dickinson Lincoln Park NJ          The pegs were blocked with  ml of phosphate buffered          saline PBS pH  in  Tween and immersed in          wells containing  ml serum After overnight          incubation excess IgG antibody from the serum was washed          away by thrice transferring the pegs to troughs          containing  ml of PBS containing   Tween           PBSTween for  min each time The pegs were then          immersed for  h in a trough containing  ml of          antihuman IgG Fab fragment conjugated to alkaline          phosphatase in PBSTween and developed with nitrophenyl          phosphate Sigma Chemical Co St Louis MO          The concentration of antigenspecific IgG in standard          serum was obtained by measuring the optimal amount of          protein immunoprecipitated     and a standard curve          of absorbance against concentration was obtained Fig           The greatest range of absorbance occurred when sera          were measured at a dilution of      Replicate          antibody assays were performed on each serum and the          concentrations read off the standard curve The antibody          concentrations are shown ranked in Fig                           Data analyses          The amount of IgG antibody to Dalanyl LTA varies with          no obvious cutoff Fig  However the sera containing          precipitating antibody should tend to have high IgG          antibody contents The IgG antibody measurements were          alternatively divided into clusters using the unweighted          pair group method with arithmetic averages    and          NTSYS a package of multivariate statistical computer          programs     A low response supremum was obtained by          taking the antilog of the mean IgG content of the          nonprecipitating sera plus one standard deviation or          the antilog of the highest IgG content of the cluster          grouping containing the least antibody          The effect of age was determined after splitting the          subjects into decile cohorts Table  and comparing the          fraction of high antibody responders in each cohort The          youngest cohort was composed of Amish family siblings who          were younger than any dental students patients or          volunteers          A multiple linear regression procedure was utilized to          examine the relationship of caries DMFT with age F          score and measures of gingival health obtained in this          study PL BOP and PD The regression on DMFT was used           to estimate the partial regression coefficients           coefficients within the high and low antibody response          group  to test each  coefficient for significance          after accounting for the effects of the other four          variables and  to examine for significant differences          in  coefficients between the antibody response groups A           coefficient is interpreted as the change in disease          response DMFT per unit change in one of the independent          variables after adjusting for all the other independent          variables in the model Within each antibody response          group the multiple regression coefficient R  provided          an estimate of the proportion of variance in DMFT          explained by the combination of variables tested          Stepwise regression then identified the best estimate of          the variance in DMFT that was explained by multiple          variables in the separate and combined high and low          responder groups These multiple regression analyses were          repeated using gingivitis BOP as the dependent variable          and OHPI PD DT and MFT and age as independent          variables All of the clinically examined subjects were          included because F score was not an independent variable          for BOP          To ensure that obtained relationships were robust          influential points outliers were identified using a          statistic DFFITS which measured the change in          coefficients caused by removing the data for each          subject If this change exceeded pn where p was the          number of independent variables and n the number of          samples     the point was influential Repeating the          regressions with all the influential points removed          determined the degree to which these points had affected          the results                            Results                  Definition of high antibody response          IgG antibodies were initially detected in sera          irrespective of whether Dalanyl LTA was          immunoprecipitated Excluding the Amish family group          there were  subjects whose sera failed to          immunoprecipitate

classified as low responders          if their log IgG antibody content exceeded  rather          than  The odds ratio for a serum from a high          antibody responder immunoprecipitating Dalanyl

a          slightly greater fraction of siblings aged  years          who were high responders  compared with the general          population          High antibody responders accounted for a similar          fraction of subjects irrespective of whether they were in          the clinical study or dental students or patients          Table  Men were  of the  students patients          and volunteers

variables tested for association with          DMFT and the observed  coefficients in high and low          antibody responders It was immediately apparent that the           coefficients from PL were similar in both groups          whereas those from BOP and F score were only significant          in high responders and those from PD were only          significant in low responders Comparison of

DMFT with plaque prevalence in both high and low IgG          antibody responders but significant associations with          only F score and BOP prevalence in high responders and          with only PD and age in low responders In high          responders DMFT increased as plaque and BOP prevalences          increased and fell as fluoride exposure increased The          equation obtained was DMFT

Association of DT with gingivitis in high and low          responders          Because caries experience associated with fluoride and          gingival health in high responders poor gingival health

    responders and two high responders When these subjects          were omitted the respective regression coefficients or          their significance were little changed indicating that          the different partial linear regression coefficients in          high or low responders were not artifacts of influential          or outlying points                            Discussion        This study has demonstrated that IgG antibodies to        Dalanyl LTA are widespread in US adults The fraction of        high responders was essentially constant from early        adulthood through middle age but reduced in children         years and old age  years Within the        adults ages  years a change from low to high        response or         vice versa was found unlikely from        repeated measurements over  months A similar lack of        change in this IgG antibody concentration was reported         months after an additional  similarly aged patients had        received oral hygiene therapy in another study            Finally the family studies established that a high        antibody response was probably induced during the        midteenage years In order to apply the results of this        study to children and young teenagers longitudinal studies        of the antibody response in relation to age and the        clinical measurements in this study may need to be        undertaken        Despite few investigations of caries risk in  year        old subjects compared with a younger or older group            the association of DMFT with PL in this study agrees with        that obtained from  year old Norwegians     Plaque        simplified oral hygiene index measurement accounted for         of the variance in number of decayedfilled teeth        surfaces in that study and for  of the DMFT variance        within all  clinically examined subjects in this study        ignoring age antibody and all other variables Other        studies have shown that the amount of fluoride applied from        dentrifices is measured better from oral hygiene or plaque        accumulation as in this study and not from the reported        frequency of dentrifice use      Finally because        subjects aged more than  are unlikely to have used        fluoridated toothpastes until later in life they were        omitted to avoid confounding the results        The rationale behind this study was that acidic plaque        environments increase the amount of Dalanyl LTA and        promote its immunogenicity Accordingly cariesprotection        by fluoride in the water supply and dentrifices was strong        in high IgG antibody responders accounting for just over         of the variance in DMFT In addition gingivitis BOP        prevalence associated strongly and significantly with the        number of decayed untreated teeth suggesting that        preventing gingivitis increased fluoride exposure from        dentrifices and reduced the number of decayed teeth        Increased exposure to fluoridated water and dentrifices        associated with good gingival health may result in        fluoride inhibiting enamel remineralization at the acidic        plaque pH likely present in high responders        In low responders the fewer antibodies to Dalanyl LTA        suggest less colonization by acidtolerant bacteria and a        weaker cariogenic attack DMFT associated with age as        reported for other subjects whose sera did not precipitate        Dalanyl LTA     and also with pocket depth An        increase in pocket depth is caused by periodontopathic        bacteria that associate with an alkaline environment in the        sulci over many years    and a microbiota that is        neither acidic nor acidtolerant     The coefficient        of DMFT association with PD in low responders therefore        differed significantly from high responders within whom F        score and gingival health were stronger covariates                    Conclusions        An increased mutans streptococcal challenge accompanying        low plaque pH high antibody response to Dalanyl LTA        allows much of the variation in caries experience to be        controlled by water fluoridation and by the use of        fluoridated dentrifices associated with maintaining oral        health High IgG antibody responders are therefore better        protected from caries in an optimally fluoridated        environment The concept that fluoride protects better from        caries in a low pH environment    was recently used to        explain why there is a poor association between caries        experience and pH fall after a  sucrose rinse            In low responders increased fluoride exposure from        dentriflce use to maintain oral health or from water        fluoridation associate relatively poorly with caries        experience Although this study has indicated that the IgG        antibodies to Dalanyl LTA do not become elevated until        after age  when much caries may have already developed        they may be elevated to a lower level in children who        eventually become high responders The Dalanyl LTA        antibody response is not detectable in saliva unpublished        studies but it can be measured from only a thumbprick of        blood Longitudinal studies of the Dalanyl LTA response in        children could improve current efforts to predict caries        susceptibility by relating it to fluoride or the fluoride        ion product for fluoroapatite in saliva and the pH change        after a sucrose rinse                           Competing interests        None declared
