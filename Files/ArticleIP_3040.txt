                                 Brit Noir            Martin Amis has long evincedhis fascination with American culture so it should come as no surprise that hehas brought out an American novel Or anyway a simulacrum of an Americannovel The work is of course an hommage to the policeprocedural genrefor which Americans are principally known overseas This is true of mostentries in the fiction wing of the body of Americanculture simulacra producedby aliens Like most items in the music department of the same phenomenon itis a riff            Somemight glance at the book and decide that it is meant to be Amis Elmore Leonardmoment recalling his praise for that master of fibrous plots and lowkeysociology But Night Train is light on plot and nearly Martian in itssociology so it might better be seen as Amis Mark Knopfler moment Like thelead guitarist of the erstwhile Dire Straits Amis is a stolid middleclassNew Briton blessed with considerable chops torn between worldly cynicism and acertain nostalgie de la boue  whose wish to get down and dirty isundertaken professionally but stops a bit short of conviction They are bothsmart enough to notice you noticing this and their answers are identical moresixteenth notes In Amis case what this entails is cascades and arabesques oflanguage            Night Train is a monologue delivered by one Detective MikeHoolihan a physically intimidating seenitall toughbuttender veteran ofevery rotten assignment in the police precincts of Anytown USA Hoolihan isalso a woman as she reminds the reader no more than once per paragraph Policesalaries being what they are she lives in a comically tilted slum flat down bythe railroad tracks where deep in the night the titular conveyance roars byand sets the coffee cups arattling She shares the dump with her latest in aseries of hulking morons or so she alleges She only alludes to Tobe failingto introduce him to the reader who is tempted to conclude that Tobe belongs tothe race of foottall rabbits            On thisday Mike has got her worst job yet She has to notify next of kin in asuicide and not just any suicide The corpus delicti was once JenniferRockwell who was both bodacious gorgeousness personified and the essence ofbraininess an astrophysicist in her day job Mike has known Jennifer sincethe latter was a tyke Jennifer was a sprout of the local cop dynasty the onlyone not to wear the blue herself All her brothers are cops and her dad issuch an overwhelming cop of a cop they made him a colonel Colonel Tom as heis called throughout has taken Mike under his capacious wing and seen herthrough detox and depression and all the rest of it as if she were anotherdaughter of his            So Mikes heart is heavy but she is still apolice as she likes to put it She takes a quick look at the situation and heranalytical mind snaps to In addition to beauty and brains the deceased hadcharm wealth and a fulfilling lovemachine relationship with a fellow doubledome Professor Trader Faulkner a roguish but loyal wearer of tweed jacketswith leather patches on the elbows Does that sound like a recipe forselfoffing Not to our Mike who starts investigating pronto although thefield of potential murderers is as thin as the motive directory At length herresearches lead her into terrain that is nearly spiritual or something CouldJenniferwho apparently managed to put three bullets into her lovelybrainhave killed herself because of the absurdity of the simultaneouslyexpanding and contracting universe            Dontcount on finding out Amis game is sixteenth notes or in this case a runthrough the candy store of American slang Like the blues as played by suburbanvirtuosos the story itself is little more than a structural excuse for a showof wizard dexterousness Mike is the only character Background noise issupplied by other members of her department but they are cut and pasted from avague memory of Barney Miller  After Faulkners cameo he presumablyreturned to the Folgers Crystals commercial from which he was borrowed Mostothers like Tobe and Col Tom are flickering wraiths The MacGuffin JenniferRockwell might occupy center stage as a corpse but the reader doesnt believein her previous existence for a minute She joins the parade of other scarilyperfect not remotely credible womanobjects in Amis fiction such as NicolaSix who plots her own murder in London Fields             Is Night Train intended to be the record of MikeHoolihans dtinduced hallucinations You tell me What is certain is that itrepresents Amis tabulation of his own verbal pink elephants He wouldexperience them in this form anyway since here as elsewhere in hisoeuvre  he appears curiously absent of any visual sense He wallows inAmericaness especially cop talk He likes the idea of hollow cant beingdelivered in clipped cadences by a broad especially one under emotionalstrain Sometimes you dont know whether he did his research by letting himselfbe washed by television for endless stretches or whether he went so deep heknows expressions youve never heard or havent heard since fifth grade Docops ever refer to a perp as a hoody            He savors verbal dandruffstateoftheart parameters and jargon the verbs to badge and to berigored but mostly he likes the rhythm the tattoo of fuck s andshit s and excuse me s This doesnt prevent him from dishing outthe fine writing though he has Mike get pretty fancy to the point ofspouting Latin Anyway the language business is the only conceivable motivefor this book Perhaps foreigners will thrill to the exotica as a sort ofhighlit gloss on Jerry Springer territory Otherwise it goes nowhere for noreason has no friction and no ending A pint of the fortified wine thatshares the books name would make a better investment
