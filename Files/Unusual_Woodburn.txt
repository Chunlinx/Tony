Unusual Woodburn office helps indigenous MexicansMonday October   Alex DavisWOODBURN Ore AP  The boss refuses to pay me My wife andkids are sick and dont speak English We dont understand the lawabout pesticides in the fieldsFor decades Oregon farmworkers have raised these issues inSpanish But what if the questions come in Mixteco Triqui orZapotecA small legal office in downtown Woodburn is offering an answerThe Indigenous Project a new program run by the Oregon Law Centeris one of only a handful of places in the United States whereindigenous farmworkers from Mexico and Central America can findfree and confidential legal aidThe project aims to reach the growing number of people who arefollowing the agricultural migrant stream to Oregon but dont sharethe language and culture of the Spanishspeaking farmworkermajorityJulie Samples a lawyer with the program estimates the statesMexican indigenous population at around  people a dramaticincrease compared to a decade ago Most are from Oaxaca a state ofrugged mountains and extreme poverty in southern MexicoSamples a  graduate of Lewis  Clark Law School spentthe summer traveling to dozens of labor camps throughout theWillamette Valley to talk with workers about their legal rightsShe says indigenous farmworkers driven north by economic hardshipare more likely than Spanishspeakers to be denied wages or forcedinto substandard housingMost are Mixtecs a people familiar with injustice towardIndians in their native country The bias continues in the UnitedStates sometimes from the larger Mexican mainstreamMost of them have never had a fair shake from the outsideworld said Mark Wilk director of the Oregon Law CentersWoodburn office Theyre not familiar with the Mexican or USlegal systemWilk says the indigenous program is at the same point wherelegal services were two decades ago for native SpanishspeakersThe teams office in a heavily Hispanic area of downtownWoodburn is a testament to the difficulty of reaching theindigenous communityA sign on the front door indicates the building is abierto oropen in Spanish A coffee table inside is stacked with copies of ElNoticiero Legal or The Legal News But few materials are availablein Mixteco or other indigenous tongues in part because they barelyexist in written formInstead Samples is creating audio cassettes of legalinformation She works with Valentin Sanchez an Oaxaca native whospeaks English Spanish and Mixteco They spend most of their timetraveling to housing camps  few workers own cars  and setting uppresentations in schools and community centersThe project was modeled after a similar effort created in by California Rural Legal Assistance Irma Luna a community workerwith that program said its not uncommon for indigenous laborersto perform piecework for  hours a day and be paid  orlessStudies in California show that most Mixtecs follow the tomatolettuce and chile harvests from the Central Valley to the fruit andberry harvests of Oregon and Washington Most are highly mobileyoung and male Language is often a major stumbling block forrecent arrivalsThere have been a handful of highprofile cases in whichindigenous workers were charged with crimes in Oregon and detainedfor lengthy periods due to communication barriersIn the early s a Mixtec worker named Santiago VenturaMorales spent four years in an Oregon prison before his murderconviction was overturnedSeveral years later a migrant worker named Adolfo RuizAlvarezwas released from a state mental hospital after two years ofpsychiatric evaluations and drug treatments He had been chargedwith trespassing and public indecency near Mount Angel but didntunderstand the interpreters who interviewed him in Spanish Anative of Oaxaca he only spoke an Indian dialect called TriquiThe majority of the cases in Woodburn today are far simplerCommon issues range from wage claims to poor working conditions tosexual harassment Most are settled with a phone call or a letterthreatening litigationSanchez the Indigenous Projects trilingual employee said thenumber of Mixtecs has grown considerably since he arrived in Oregonin the late s He sees Mixtecs playing basketball shopping inWoodburn grocery stores and speaking his language on publictelephonesA downtown shop called El Oaxaqueo offers a place whereMixteco speakers can find Oaxacan newspapers and beaded jewelrymade by indigenous people From behind the counter employee DavidLopez who is Mixtec can call out prices to customers in MixtecoSpanish or EnglishIm working on my fourth language now said Lopez referringto his Russian classes at Woodburn High SchoolSome Mixtec immigrants also have formed native groups orhometown associations that send money home for projects such astelephone lines or street paving The informal associations selectmembers at random to return home for periods of service  workingas a volunteer mayor for example or town clerkNot all Oaxacans classify themselves as Indian Some trace theirancestry to the influence of SpainThe state of Oaxaca is the fourth most common source of studentsfor Oregon public schools which suggests a growing trend ofindigenous people moving hereThe Oregon Law Center is one of a few legal groups that cater tofarmworkers The project is funded by a twoyear fellowship from the nonprofit Academy for Educational Developmentalong with grants of  each from the Spirit MountainCommunity Fund and the Campaign for Equal Justice and a grant of from the PacifiCorp Foundation for LearningThe money goes toward language resources transportation andlegal research It also provides a salary for Samples who speaksEnglish and Spanish and Sanchez who also speaks MixtecoLegal Aid Services of Oregon runs a similar office in Woodburnnext door to the Indigenous Project but is restricted in theclients it serves  usually workers with legal documents only because it receives federal fundingNargess Shadbeh director of the Oregon Law Centers farmworkerprogram said the Indigenous Project will continue into the futureif more funding can be raised The center has applied for severalgrants since the first fellowship was awarded to Samples in August
