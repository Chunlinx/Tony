                            As mothers get older and assisted conception becomes more common in developed countries        the incidence of multiple birthsprimarily of nonidentical siblings but also of identical        oneshas dramatically increased Multiple pregnancies are highrisk pregnancies with        preterm delivery and monochorionicity shared placenta the major problems Consequently        efforts are underway to optimize the management of these pregnancies        While identical monozygotic twins are much less common than dizygotic ones        monozygotic twinning events are increased after induced ovulation and in vitro        fertilization Monozygotic twins can be diamniotic dichorionic two amniotic sacs two        placentas monoamniotic monochorionic one amniotic sac one placenta or diamniotic        monochorionic two amniotic sacs one placenta The last type accounts for approximately        twothirds of all monozygotic twins        Monochorionic twins are at higher risk because they share a common placenta they are        primarily at risk from circulation abnormalities like twintwin transfusion syndrome the        smaller twin donor does not get enough blood while the larger twin recipient becomes        volume overloaded and intrauterine growth restriction However the majority of diamniotic        monochorionic twin pregnancies do not develop such complications        Nicholas Fisk and colleagues have studied records of  seemingly uncomplicated        diamniotic monochorionic pregnancies and found a surprisingly high rate of fetal death ten        unexpected intrauterine deaths occurred in seven of the  pregnancies with no prior signs        of complications All deaths occurred within two weeks of a normal scan at a median        gestational age of  weeks and  day        The authors conclude that despite intensive fetal surveillance structurally normal        monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies without twintwin transfusion syndrome and        intrauterine growth restriction are complicated by a high rate of intrauterine death As        the deaths occurred predominantly after  weeks gestation the authors suggest that the        prospective risk for fetal death in these pregnancies might be eliminated by elective        preterm delivery after  weeks        In an accompanying Perspective DOI journalpmed Jane ClearyGoldman        and Mary DAlton agree that despite the limitations of the study its retrospective        nature small numbers and lack of dichorionic controls it highlights a critical question        for obstetricians namely when is the ideal gestational age to deliver apparently        uncomplicated monochorionic twins As ClearyGoldman and DAlton discuss at  weeks of        gestation many of the risks associated with prematurity have abated but the remaining ones        are not negligible Until larger prospective observational studies have been conducted        balancing these risks remains challenging
