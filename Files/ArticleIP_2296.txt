                                 Heres an Idea            Talk to a Democraticpollster or consultant these days and youre likely to hear a lament about theshortage of politically potent ideas Looking toward the midterm election in President Clinton and his party have no rabblerousing answer to theRepublican promise of sweeping tax overhaul Sure they can point out that themost familiar conservative proposalDick Armeys Flat Taxis a hoax It wouldproduce a huge revenue shortfall for the government andor a big tax hike forthe middle class But you cant beat a horse with no horse Republicans have ontheir side populist ire against the IRS lobbyists lawyers and accountantsAnd filing your return on a postcardor not having to file one at allis apretty appealing notion            In facttheres a perfect Democratic answer to Armeys tax reform Its called taxreform good tax reform The shared idea of both kinds of tax reform iscleaning the Augean stables of the tax code You make everyones life simplerand you get lower rates by getting rid of loopholes and making the law neutralamong different kinds of income you promote economic efficiency Resources gowhere the invisible hand directs them not where they can get the mostfavorable tax treatment Under the reform championed by Bill Bradley whichpassed in  the corporate rate dropped from  percent to  percent Forindividuals  brackets and a top rate of  percent shrank into threebrackets and a top rate of  percent            But the  tax reform has been gradually undone by threeintervening budget bills in   and  Preferences have crept back inshelters are returning see                   Slate               s doityourself taxshelter and figuring out your taxes is more complicated than ever Yetfor some reason the only major politician who has tried to latch onto theissue is Richard Gephardt Gephardt who was a sponsor of tax reform in thes the original bill was known as BradleyGephardt has proposed to do itagain He points out that higher tax rates for higher incomes arent what makethe tax code complicated You can get  percent of the flat taxs simplicitywithout giving up the principle of progressivity Gephardts version of taxreform would make the code more progressive A basic rate of  percentwould cover  percent of taxpayers Four other rates ranging up to percent would cover the rest Gephardt would get rid of all deductions exceptthose for homemortgage interest charitable contributions and state and localtaxes            Some version of this idea ought to be a naturalfor Clinton As he made clear in an interview with the New York Timeslast week hes fishing around for a tax proposal to include in his JanuaryState of the Union address Unfortunately the reports trickling out suggestthat he is likely to suggest some modest tinkeringa small tax rebate paidfor by possible future budget surpluses or more targeted incentives topromote the right kind of investment Clinton seems to have no interest in boldand sweeping tax reform Why not            The mostcommon explanations you hear are  Dick Gephardt  Bob Rubin and  theinterest groups The Gephardt theory is based on political rivalry Clinton andAl Gore dont want to be accused of copyright infringement Under the mostMachiavellian theory the election of a Democratic Congress in  would bebad for Gore since he would have to run against Speaker Gephardt in This supposedly makes Clinton want to avoid excessively good ideas untilafter the midterm election The Rubin theory is that the Treasury secretary haspersuaded everyone to let well enough alone With the economy swimming along sonicely why meddle The last theory the most malignant is that the Democratsare too much in the thrall of interest groups and fatcat campaign contributorsto assault their cherished tax preferences            None of these explanations fully adds up In politicsplagiarism is not only legal but also often effective If Gore and Gephardtwere both for tax reform Gephardt would lose his best issue I thought of itfirst is a pretty weak line in a debate The Rubin argument may have a littlemore substance Tinkering with the tax code is always hazardous When lobbyistssee the hood open they all come running with their monkey wrenchesyou neverknow what may get fixed But thats a better argument against the grab bag ofbreaks that Clinton is likely to propose which will encourage specialpleading than it is against sweeping reform The power of moneyed interestsdoesnt explain much either All the industries that benefit most from taxloopholesreal estate oil and gas financegive much more money toRepublicans Only the unions worried about the deduction for employerpaidhealth care cut much sway with Democrats            A betterexplanation for the failure to jump aboard tax reform is the wider politicalpredicament of liberals In the present climate it is nearly impossible tospend money on new spending programs But it is sometimes possible to disguisespending programs as tax breaks Of course a dollar of government revenue lostto an investment tax credit is a dollar added to the national debt as surely asa dollar spent on food stamps In fact the cost is usually higher sinceindirect incentives tend to be less efficient than direct expenditures ButRepublicans tolerate governmentbyincentive so Democrats rely on it A cleantax code would foreclose this dodge            Since he was a governor Bill Clinton hasrecognized the tax code as an excellent hiding place for social policy If hehas any appreciation of the economic value of tax neutrality or of thepolitical appeal of simplicity he has never shown it In the  campaignClinton proposed not only higher rates on the rich and a new business tax tosupport worker training but also augmented research and development credits alongterm capitalgains exclusion and various other bounties intended tosupport education and the environment Although Clintons  budget planindisputably strengthened the economy by reducing the budget deficit it trulyundid tax reform It turned four rates into six and created a powerful bias infavor of capital gains vs ordinary income In  Clinton drove dozens ofnails into the coffin The bill he signed created six different capitalgainsrates two kinds of IRAs and so on Many of these were actually Republicaninitiatives pushed by the very politicians out there denouncing the complextax code and demanding a flat noloopholes system            The president obviouslyisnt an economic purist But you still have to wonder how such a smart policywonk can fail to be bothered by the perversities and complications of the taxcode The only other explanation is something we learned about Clinton duringall that Whitewater business Hillary does the taxes
