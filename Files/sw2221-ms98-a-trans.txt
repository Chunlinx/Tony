                 what do you think about um the way the criminal justice system handles trials   well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers     yeah   but you know its pretty hard to try lets say the man down the street thats living on Social Security or somebody thats on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that ive served on are businessmen   uhhuh   okay now they dont understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven   yeah   okay they dont understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you cant really do it       ethnically you know but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer but then theres another thing that i disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve   yeah yeah   and i dont know why they do that do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that   well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and thats mostly to decide whether or not the persons actually going to stand trial or its whether theyre acquitted or whether theyre actually going to be accused of   okay i see   you know and held over for trial   okay i dont know much about the Grand Jury how do you feel about the in Texas i noticed since ive been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial   yeah i dont know i i think that uh i know that judges arent supposed to be crooked however   well we know theres a few out there   yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it you give it to one person youre letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could   umhum yeah its yeah would be pretty hard well i dont think you know i dont think that if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be and i think its not only that its a waste of our money we have to have a trial for this person then two weeks down the road we have to sentence sentence excuse me set a sentencing date so now were back in court again and thats more money spent   umhum its not so much that i that i havent seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges what bothers me is that uh they really dont mean anything   no   someone could be sentenced to thirty five years and yet you know the the parole system uh its going to let them out in in three years for good behavior   and its not working either   no its not   it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders i know i dont know how you all are there where youre at but where were at now our jails are overcrowded we just built a brand new one two years ago   umhum oh i think theyre all overcrowded   and its overcrowded   theyve uh i think i heard Fort Worth that uh   so now they start turning them loose   theyve been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded theyre not allowed to accept any new inmates now what are they supposed to do   they turn them loose   well no i mean theyre not allowed to accept any new inmates   yeah   so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail you know   well the way it it seems the way its been working heres   there yeah   go ahead it seems the way its been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life   umhum something that is working and i i i really like the system of house arrest where uh a someones wear someone wears a bracelet   yeah they yeah and they   like a ankle bracelet thats a monitor and they are not allowed i mean the some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time   they keep   theyre instructed uh so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts   yeah all right   and uh they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house and when the parole officer calls to check on them theyre instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it   all right   so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what theyre supposed to be doing and thats working rather well thats a good system that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while   yeah it would allow the   theyre   yeah instead of being completely penned up   you know paying back for whatever crime theyve committed   and that way it would give you know the probation department and parole department theyve got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in Lubbock   oh yeah   and that would give you know at least they dont have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people   yeah umhum ive ive really i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it but   sometimes its pretty messed up isnt it   well something that i really dont understand is when someone goes to jail   umhum   and they have a job in jail and they work that they should i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes i mean theyre in jail for crying out loud what do they need cigarettes for   yeah well see and theres another thing about the justice system that i dont like and theres a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong i came from California   umhum   and when youre in jail they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else in what they call a chain gang and they clean the city parks   umhum oh i think thats a wonderful idea   and they clean the city streets but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that dont make that much   more than that more than that i know   and theyre not you know theyre not doing anything to support themselves while theyre there   the thing that the thing that gets me is that while were supporting them theyre working when they get out of jail they get handed all that money   yeah yeah   that really ti cks me off i think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages should go like i dont know they could uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board   yeah yeah well   figured on um a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year   umhum see now i also believe in   and when they get out they should have uh i dont know you know some reasonable amount of money   yeah   to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State anything that theyve earned while theyre in prison should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with   yeah to help yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own   exactly absolutely thats the part that i really think we need to change   and something else that i would and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail and theyre working theyre getting paid but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know our our victims are victimized period and the law has no   has nothing right   no uh regulations to deal with that they they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal but they dont know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess havent laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect   absolutely yeah   but its but i sure dont i i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself there that   umhum i think it works much better if its if its the actual jury   yeah because well the see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge but you know if if they figure theres   umhum   maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge does just doesnt care you committed this crime so im just going to throw the book at you whereas the jury may have a little   uhhuh   shall we say sympathy you know he did this but you know why did he do this is there is there a basis for it   yeah in some cases that it it would work that way in some cases it would work the other way   yeah in some cases where the judge says okay ill give you you know two to three years and then   the jury would would slam them and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time   yeah well they have a stronger debate too because theres twelve people there they have to decide whether or not hes guilty and then they can sit in the at the same time and decide what his punishment would be and youd have more than one persons input on it   uhhuh yeah i think thats probably a much fairer way   and you know were supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence     yeah   and a lot of jurors not that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah hes guilty but i dont have to deal with it from here you know so the judge takes care of all of that   yeah it might be more it may would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it   yeah it would uh serving yeah serving on the jury would be definitely more responsible youd have to be a definitely more responsible person   the thing that i i dont really like i i dont know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that ive seen have been a
