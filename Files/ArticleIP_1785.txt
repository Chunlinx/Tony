                                 Plagiarism            An indignant BarbaraChaseRiboud filed a  million copyrightinfringement suit against StevenSpielberg and the makers of Amistad in October claiming that the moviecontained characters and scenes unique to her historical novel about the slaverebellion In  she brought a similar suit against a playwright and wonLast week the New York Times accused ChaseRiboud herself of pinchingseveral paragraphs from a nonfiction work for her  book Valide A Novelof the Harem  ChaseRiboud acknowledged her debt to the previouslypublished work but claimed that she had done nothing wrong because the bookwas a reference and her novel was intended to be a seamless narrative usingboth documents and fiction                           When DidBorrowing Become Theft                        Prior to the  thcentury writers borrowed freely from each other without shame or punishmentThe Latin word plagaria referred only to the act of physicalkidnapping Shakespeare borrowed passages from Plutarch and contemporariesBooks were copied by hand prior to the rise of the printing press andamanuenses were given liberty to rework texts England passed the firstcopyright laws in  as mechanical reproduction of works and new ideas aboutindividuality became widespread These laws provided legal remedies forauthorswriters and composers mainlywho believed their works had beenunfairly lifted The US Constitution required Congress to pass similarcopyright laws            Copyright laws prohibitplagiarism The courts have ruled that a work cannot be legally copied if it is an original creative productnot merely a fact or something found innature like the sound of the wind or  written or recordednot just anidea Fifty years after authors die their works enter the public domain andare no longer protected by law                           Plagiarized Prove It                        Proving plagiarism in theUnited States requires the plaintiff to show that  the defendant had accessto the earlier work and  the defendants work bears a substantialsimilarity to the plaintiffs original It sounds like a legal blur because itis Different courts have different opinions on what constitutes substantialsimilarity For example jazz drummer Bernard Pretty Purdie filed acopyrightinfringement suit against a rapper who lifted a lone cymbal crashfrom one of Purdies recordings He claims that his cymbal crasha singlebeatis so recognizably his that any use of it violates his copyright                           When IsBorrowing Just Borrowing                        Parodyas long as it isimmediately recognizable as parodyis largely exempt from charges of copyrightinfringement Also the doctrine of fair use allows writers to quote limitedsections of a work as long as it is germane properly attributed and doesntundercut sales of the original The courts ruled that The Nationexceeded its fairuse rights in  when it excerpted key sections of GeraldFords memoir in an article that was published slightly before Fords bookreached stores The courts can be as fuzzy about what constitutes fair use asthey are about what constitutes substantial similarity                           I ThinkIve Been Plagiarized and I Wanna Sue What Are My Chances of Winning                        Slim In practice thecourts find infringement only in instances where language images or musicwere lifted wholesale They rarely consider cases in which a character wascopied or a plot was stolen Thousands of writers bring suit each year claimingtheir copyright has been violated but almost none win satisfaction in courtHowever the courts strictly police the unlicensed sampling of music theinsertion of a passage into another artists musical collage Book andsoftware pirates are prosecuted under the copyright laws but pirates are notreally plagiarists                           WhosMinding the Store                        Most professional andacademic groups Writers Guild of America American Bar Association AmericanHistorical Association etc investigate formal charges of plagiarismReprimands can come from the associations or from colleges and universitiesthemselves Accusations of plagiarism seem to be the greatest deterrent            Some say accusations ofplagiarism fly too freely In a celebrated case Abraham Lincoln biographerStephen Oates was said to have ripped off a widely read  Lincoln biographyby Benjamin Thomas In  the American Historical Association criticizedOates for not adequately footnoting his use of Thomas book No legal chargeswere brought Click for a comparison of passages that the historiansconsidered most damning                           Plagiarism on the Silver Screen                        Most copyright suits in theentertainment industry are nuisances but not all A biographer of WilliamRandolph Hearst claimed that Citizen Kane screenwriters Orson Wells andHerman Mankiewicz plagiarized him The author of a  nonfiction book aboutswindlers filed copyrightinfringement charges against the screenwriter ofThe Sting in  Look Whos Talking screenwriterdirector AmyHeckerling was accused of stealing whole passages of dialogue from a screenplayshown to her three years before her films release These cases like mostcredible suits brought against the studios were settled out of court            To ward off lawsuitsdirectors and producers avoid signing rejection letters making it difficult toprove that they had prior access to the material a legal prerequisite to provecopyright infringement As a gesture of kindness the actorproducer MichaelLandon signed rejection letters some of which became the basis for expensivelitigation against him Still examples of Hollywoods sloppiness anddisrespect for intellectualproperty rights abound as Film Commentmagazine proved with this prank in the s It shipped the screenplay ofCasablanca to  agents Only  of them recognized it as the basis forthe Bogart film  agents offered to represent it                           Psychoplagiarism                        Many alleged victims ofplagiarism are later accused of having plagiarized For instance David Lodgeaccused a romance writer of stealing the plot from his novel Nice Work Later he admitted that he had borrowed it himself from a th century novel            Author Thomas Mallon arguesthat plagiarism is pathology akin to kleptomania Accused plagiarists areoften repeat offenders Stephen Oates faced accusations of plagiarism inhis biographies of Lincoln William Faulkner and Martin Luther King Jr PoetNeal Bowers was plagiarized by a writer who submitted a halfdozen of his poemsto different publications Plagiarists want to get caught  Most stealfrom obvious sources from their colleagues or authoritative works Academicsplagiarize more regularly than nonacademics prompting Mallons theory thatprofessors are let off the hook to plagiarize again because their colleaguesare too embarrassed to punish them                           Meanwhile Back at the Amistad Case                        ChaseRibouds suit claimsthat the films screenwriters read her historical novel about the slaverebellion Echo of Lions  and appropriated its fictionalized charactersand plot twists In a legal brief her lawyers claim that             Credited screenwriterDavid Franzoni received a copy of Echo of Lions              Franzoni worked withPunch Productions for six to eight months as a writer on the Echo ofLions Project while Punch was licensed to use ChaseRibouds book andhelped pitch this project to Warner Bros             Franzonis screenplay forAmistad contains historical errors also contained in Echo ofLions including            a a letter from QueenVictoria to President Martin Van Buren            b the portrayal of theinterpreter as a person that speaks nearperfect English and            c the number of childrenCinque had             Amistad andEcho of Lions contain the same fictional charactera wealthy eruditeblack man involved with the printing of abolitionist literature             An early Amistadshooting script was titled The Other Lion            A motion to block theopening of Amistad was shot down by a US District Court judge whofound that  the similarities between the two works were not substantial fictional characters cannot be copyrighted and  Amistad sscreenwriters rendered the similarities irrelevant            The judge ruled that thesuit has virtually no likelihood of success
