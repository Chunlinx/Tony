        okay as far as uh universal health care um     umhum   i guess im all for it i think its time that we start looking at um getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh theres people that to me its the fundamental uh life life of a person um it it doesnt matter if you have money or no money or all the money in the world um you would   you should still be   everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal   well they really are even for even when youre not talking about surgery if youre just talking about basic care weve   yes   weve got four children and you know in the past month they it just they pass things from one to one and it just can devastate your budget you know um   umhum oh sure and your constantly exactly yeah the only i i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and theres some pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh how can i say it um over like in Poland uh where my fatherinlaw lived for years their their health care system is um because no financial gains are available for doctors uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain   yeah   they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i dont have to do this i can do this and i can you know   can still make big bucks   yeah or plastic surgery or uh if i become a uh heart specialist im gonna make this kind of money uh and theres you know financial gains toward that and in a universal system i dont think there is a financial gain for the doctors   do you think that the quality um it would would be as high   the quality i think goes down umhum when you have a universal system um   yeah yeah   the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um likes the ability ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated uh i guess thats the whole US concept is to come here and   right more motivation   yeah and i dont know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know theres a way of working that out but i know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and thats it thats what they look at it as theres no     yeah   uh and thats sad because if thats the case if if doctors arent going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldnt be in that area anyway but   right yeah   that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind   thats true yeah i uh   so but i i think we have to head toward that way   well were going to have to do something because theres just too many people in the country that are uninsured and and you know you cannot i mean its just   uhhuh im worried when i get older  you know and uh lets say for instance you uh   oh sure   get fired or or not fired but maybe laid off from your job you no longer have insurance   right   i mean and youre sixty some or uh fifty some years old you try try to find insurance   umhum oh yeah   i mean youre youre uninsurable unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance   thats right yeah   and how they can do it i have no idea um i know working for small corporations and health insurance um myself um it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a medcenter uh health plan um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck so   yeah well ours  ours is three hundred for our family and i mean we that is we pay that instead of a car payment you know i mean im driving a piece of junk you know   see yeah well we do the same i mean its i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know its getting harder and harder to survive   right   and uh and thats why uh if they dont go to a universal system somethings going to happen were gonna have uh   see yeah   uh larger amount of people dying
