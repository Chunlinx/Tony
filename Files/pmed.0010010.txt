                            As an intern I took care of the first patients with HIVAIDS at San Francisco General        Hospital and so I grew up with AIDS in the early days of my medical career We struggled        through the confusion about what was making people so sick and each new day brought a new        discovery about the disease and its consequences I went through that evolutionary process        along with everybody else and it shaped me in many profound ways Before long I        recognized that this wasnt a disease of those people over there This was a disease that        could strike anyone anytime And as physicians we had to adjust our thinking about our        own vulnerability to occupational risk and to emphasize prevention because there wasnt        going to be a cure for a long long while And not only physicians had to rethink        thingsAIDS has reshaped societys very notions of the most basic human behaviors        I was in Uganda in  early in the AIDS epidemic there We knew then where that        epidemic was going to go absent an effective vaccine or cure but few of us could have        imagined that it would evolve so quickly without an end in sight While the people of        Africa have achieved a huge amount in tackling HIVAIDS particularly in Uganda the        epidemic is far from being under control on that continent and is spreading through other        parts of the world with alarming speed                    The Crisis of Human Resources        The theme of this years International AIDS Conference in Bangkok was Access for All        Over the past few years it has become increasingly apparent that a critical component of        assuring access to care and treatment is human capital Like fiscal capital human        resources are essential to ending the AIDS pandemic I visited Africa with US Health and        Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and many AIDS experts last December and we saw        evidence of this critical need in every country we visited The miracles of modern science        are meaningless without systems and people to deliver them to those in need        The World Health Organization estimates that of the  million people worldwide infected        with HIV  million need immediate lifesustaining antiretroviral therapy Fewer than         people in developing countries have access to such treatment Figure          There are too few skilled health care workers to provide reliable delivery and        administration of these lifesaving therapies According to a recent Institute of Medicine        report and a study sponsored by the US Agency for International Development the number of        health care workers in many African countries is actually shrinking as they are lured to        developed countries by better pay and professional opportunities Box   Reversing        this brain drain is essential over the longterm as HIV treatment and care will be        required for decades In the shortterm the Institute of Medicine called for expanded        efforts to bring qualified volunteer initiative medical professionals into both urban and        rural areas to support prevention care and training programs  I could not agree more        that addressing the human resource needs will be essential as we move forwardand not just        for HIVAIDS programs but for all aspects of public health and health care        It has now been shown beyond any doubt that even in resourcepoor countries with the        most basic health infrastructure people get the same benefit from treatment and prevention        interventions as those in the rich world  In fact surveys in Cape Town Kampala        Khayelitsha and Senegal found rates of adherence to antiretroviral therapy of         compared with estimates of  in developed countries                     When You Have Seen the Faces        We hear the numbersthe millions upon millions infectedand we grow numb That is why we        must go to the front linesthe households and communitiesand start focusing on each        individual living with HIV I was at the dedication of an AIDS clinic in Kenya It was        raining and we were waiting outside with our umbrellas A yearold girl in front of me        turned around and leaned her head against my belly and said Could you take me to America        I need drugs If you take that girls face and multiply it a thousand timesthat is the        memory I bring home from Africa the faces of the children and their asking Why are so        many of our parents dying Why are we dying        We visited a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC program in the very        remote areas of Uganda where there are no roads and it is impossible for people to come        into population centers to receive HIV testing and other services Young staff from the CDC        are working with Ugandans and community organizations in that area to deliver        antiretroviral therapy Some may think that the difficulties of delivering antiretroviral        therapy into such a remote area are overwhelmingand some may question whether this is a        sustainable intervention But once you see firsthand what miracles are possible your world        view changes almost overnight        What we saw was the success of a wonderful homebased treatment and care program for        people who dont have access through other means And when I say homebased care picture        a hut without running water or electricity where only motorcycles are available to deliver        medications The first step of the program is to provide clean water Coliforms and other        pathogens in the water supply for the household are removed through an inexpensive water        vessel fitted with a filter and through a chlorination process In addition a        cotrimoxazole tablet is given every day which in one patients words changed his life        because he began to feel well almost immediately Not only do the cotrimoxazole prophylaxis        and the water treatment improve diarrheal illness but malarial parasitemia also drops So        that is a very positive unexpected consequence of just two very simple and inexpensive        interventions Many patients with HIVAIDS in Africa also have tuberculosis and are put on        tuberculosis therapy in addition to cotrimoxazole As a result they begin to feel better        even before they begin antiretroviral therapy        We spent time with one of the patients in the homebased care program As she began to        participate in these programs tests became available to measure her CD count She        explained to me what her CD count was what it meant and how it improved when she started        the cotrimoxazole and tuberculosis therapy She had begun taking three antiretroviral drugs        and held up her pill box to explain her regimen in detail Every week a Ugandan health aide        delivered her supply of pills on a CDC motorcycle and monitored her adherence to the        treatment Not only was she extremely reliable in taking her medications but she also knew        more about them and their side effects than most of the patients I treated at San Francisco        General She was also an expert in HIV prevention I asked her What do you do to protect        your three young sons from this infection She replied Every day I take them by the        hand and I go out of the house and I say Do you see that mound of dirt That is your        fathers grave Your father acquired this fatal infection through sex Be careful And        then she talks to them about the ABCs A for abstinence B for being faithful C        for condoms        So when you see a story like that unfold in the middle of Africa its impossible not to        be hopeful And yet its also very sobering because we are reminded of our responsibility        The question is not what the international health community is accomplishing in these        countries now but what we could accomplish if we joined together to really fight this war        on AIDS Such a story also inspires hope because you can see the multiplier effect that        comes from taking on one problem and can see the way that effort can expand to encompass        and address a much greater set of problems                    Beyond ABCsDiagnosis and Responsibility        When we think about successful prevention models in Uganda ABC certainly stands out         However at this point in the epidemic curve other letters must also be considered        Most HIV transmission is accounted for by infected people having risky sex with uninfected        people Both in the US and in Africa studies show that most infected people engaging in        risky sex are unaware of their infection status and that when their infection is        diagnosed they usually take steps to protect the others with whom they are having contact         So lets add the letter D for diagnosis In fact improving efforts to help        people choose risk avoidance and to diagnose those who are already infected is the        cornerstone of the CDCs new domestic HIV prevention strategy Diagnosis is extremely        important in many African communities especially where the number of discordant        coupleswhere one individual is infected and the other is notis high Sadly many couples        being faithful now do not realize that one partner is already infected and are not being        reached with diagnostic testing programs So ABCD is a concept that I would like to put        out on the table as food for thought Of course there is another letter that we need to        stress the letter R for responsibility personal sexual responsibility is a critical        component of HIV prevention Many women and girls become infected after being raped by men        or because their social circumstances rob them of the power to refuse sex Men must be held        accountable for greater sexual responsibility and for ending sexual violence and        degradation of women and girls HIV prevention programs need to emphasize responsibility        but not lose sight of the fact that responsibility can be practiced only with personal        autonomy which many women and girls simply do not have                    Expanding the Team to Meet the Needs        The innovative programs and ideas emerging in Africa can change the picture of the AIDS        epidemic The purchase of antiretroviral drugs for Africans is not the big challenge        Access to drugs will improve in Africa The real challenges are delivering drugs in a safe        and effective way monitoring therapy and sustaining the pipeline of drugs so that ongoing        treatment can be guaranteed In the example of the homebased program in Uganda we have        seen that these challenges can be overcome Expanding access to prevention care and        treatment services isnt going to be easy but it is certainly possible It will take        unprecedented commitment by people in the public sector the private sector faith        communities and community organizations and perhaps most importantly individual        volunteers who make up their minds to contribute in any way they can        Last fall the US Peace Corps announced that it was activating programs in some        countries that allow volunteers to help communities fight the AIDS epidemic but this is        just one of many steps that are being taken The US presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS        Relief will provide  billion including almost  billion in new funds over five years        for international AIDS assistance  and I am part of the team that is charged with        making this plan happen I look forward to learning from others in the global health        community how we can best expand our impact and collectively find a way to support the        delivery of prevention messages and lifesaving medications to everyone in Africaand        especially to that little girl at the Kenyan clinic who touched my heart
