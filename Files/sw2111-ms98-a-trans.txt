                our community doesnt really have any organized recycling drive   where do you live   i live in San Antonio   San Antonio   umhum   well um i live in Garland and were just beginning to we we just built a real big recycling center   umhum   that recycles everything imaginable but as far as that um trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing   umhum   theyre testing that so theyre really not full full force into it but theyre trying so were attempting it but i wish we could do more   yeah theres theres been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio i used to work for the power company here and there was discussion for a while about uh building a garbage burning   umhum   uh electric generation plant but it just wasnt cost effective at the time   oh   and theres theres a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isnt any um advertising campaign theres just not any push to recycle i recycle my newspapers and uh aluminum my aluminum stuff   huh right thats what i do   but uh they make it as hard as possible its not very convenient to do     right where they put centers and stuff like that   umhum   yeah well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans i dont know if you all have those around   yes   and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because theyre in almost every shopping center and you can just stop by now  everything else like the trash um paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but   umhum   but for aluminum thats real nice and i started doing that at work  um i put out a a trash can and and for people to put their aluminum cans in   umhum   and thats really helped a lot i mean everybodys pitched in and   yeah   you know it doesnt bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can   yeah   so i really i really like that but people are really concerned its just that sometimes its not the right people   yeah   which is really really sad because i wish we would do more  at work we started um all the recycling stuff theyre really trying i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year   yes   and um that really started a lot of stuff off but you know sometimes it dwindles down   yeah where i work now we recycle all the computer paper   thats good   but thats about the extent of it   well thats well at least your trying something   yeah yeah   its just yeah it would be nice if it could be more   and im sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so we sell the paper back to   oh do you really   the uh to a paper manufacturing company   well thats a neat idea   well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think i not by much but it does defray it some   uhhuh right   enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building   sure well thats thats really good i mean at least theyre trying   yeah   yeah i know a lot of companies that waste so much that im even trying you know that was one thing we  noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building and  you know the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes   yes   and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster and i thought i dont understand this you know were trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff and   yeah   and here we are wasting and i dont understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it   well the last time uh someone moved offices in my building and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around   uhhuh   i i took several home because im moving pretty soon and theyre good boxes and they were just going to throw them away     thats exactly what i did thats exactly what i did exactly because i didnt want to waste that and its hard enough to find good packing boxes though   yeah humum right and and these boxes are you can unfold them   right   so you know there they dont take up much storage space   thats exactly right well thats very good   yeah yeah i i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away so   uh right right i found about   and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them   i found about five um about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes   yeah   that were in the dumpsters and i was like oh gosh so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes   umhum   when you know these are perfect so   yeah the ones at the grocery store half the time theyve pulled the lid off so you cant use it anyway   right right  right   those and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away   uhhuh right   and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes   thats exactly what i do   those are those are perfect boxes to put files in   uhhuh theyre good for storage and stuff like that thats what i do with a lot of my daughters things is ill store her you know like her out dated cards or out of out of season clothes in them and theyre just perfect   what what ive done in the past i dont have any now but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids   uhhuh   and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even   and they look just as good thats a smart idea   umhum yeah   i think i have to that thats really cute     yeah well you know its cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever   and now they theyre the exact same thing   umhum   thats all they are they just made them look fancy   yep   save you some money       and youre recycling   yes   well thats neat well do you all have um we have places that um pay for paper to recycle i know you do yours at work but for newspaper   umhum   but ours are real hard to find thats the one thing that really discourages me i saved paper you know i recycle paper but they its almost like they dont want the paper because they dont pay at all i mean theyre real hard to find the places that pay and thats really discouraging i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where its you know they just accept it   uhhuh   but they um i think they should you know they want people to recycle i think its a you know like the aluminum you know it gets people to uh doing it you know you might you dont have to pay them a lot   yeah i live near a WalMart and theres a big uh uh huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front in fact i think theres two of them that have several openings   umhum   and its for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category i dont maybe theres two for aluminum      uh uhhuh   and you dont get paid but its real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there   well thats thats good   yeah   thats good i the one thing i dont like about the newspaper also is um like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash  but in uh   umhum   in the paper one you have to separate you have to make sure you dont throw away any of the slick paper like magazines   umhum   you cant throw any of that away and you cant throw certain file type things away and i just think its such a hassle it seems like it would be be easy to take it all i dont know of course i dont know all that about   umhum   recycling so probably it is a hassle but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know we   umhum it gets to be uh i guess you have to make it a habit i mean you have to get so used to doing it that its a habit   right right we had uh a write up in our paper uh this last time at work about um they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash   umhum   and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um dumped all the trash in the same bin   oh   and when they were questioned about it they said well were running late or we didnt have time to do those bins or something and thats real discouraging thinking youre sitting there working to separate it and then they   and someone else isnt going to take the time to put it in two separate bags   right right so theyre theyre really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about you know separate them because that is discouraging when you when you do that it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans   umhum   but luckily thatll all get straightened out and and theyll theyll start separating them because i dont mind doing that i feel like im doing uh doing something for the community when im doing that   yeah   but anyway   well ive enjoyed talking to you   you too   well thank you bye bye   bye
