                                 Bare Bones                           The Blair WitchProject demonstrates that theres nothing scarier than nothing The moviehas no ghosts or witches on display and its lone bit of gore is a piece ofcloth containing a mottle of indeterminate organic material It has nosurprises either since you know going in that the ending wont be happy Themovie opens with a placard declaring that three film students went into thewoods near Burkittsville Maryland to make a documentary and were never heardfrom again and that their footage was discovered a year after theirdisappearance The placard doesnt mention who edited the footagetheghost of Hitchcock Cassavetesbut thats a minor point I could tell you thestorygive away every detailand The Blair Witch Project would stillfreeze your blood Working on a budget thats chump change and a script thatslittle more than a framework for actors improvisations directors DanielMyrick and Eduardo Sanchez have harnessed the most irrational fears of everyhuman alive They have reanimated the genre not by adding to it but subtractingfrom itby cooking it down to its bare bones and then rattling those boneslike fiends            The first thing theyvedone is remove the omniscient point of view With the important exception ofthat opening title card there is no larger perspective The film studentsawoman Heather Donahue and two men Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard thecharacters bear the actors namestote their own video and movie cameras sothat we see what they see and no more Actually we see even less since welack their peripheral vision and are cruelly limited to whatever passes throughtheir lenses Thanks to firstrate sound equipment though we hear everythingthey hearespecially a snapping of branches in the dark outside their tentthat escalates into an omnidirectional clatter When they yell into thedarkness Hello the darkness remains dark A light illuminates theforeground but the blackness beyond that pool seems if anything blackerThere might be no more irrationally terrifying shot in the annals of film thanthe one in which the camera hurtles behind Heathera hazy white streak in thecenter of the screenamid crackling sounds as she throws a look into the treesand shrieks What is that What the fuck is that  We never see whatthe fuck that is If we did some part of us would probably relax because itwould look like a special effect But no part of us is allowed to relaxEver            Is The Blair Witch Project a work of art Not bymy definition Art rarely tortures you so singlemindedly After the firsthalfhour in which the students interview Burkittsville residents about thehistory of the Blair Witch one Elly Kedward found guilty of sorcery in and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter the remainder of the movie istheir increasingly desperate odyssey through the woods They trudge one waydouble back pore over maps and compasses whine trudge some more come uponmysterious piles of rocks or bundled twigs and whine even louder The actionunfolds in a season halfway between autumn and winter and the washedout tonessuggest that the Blair Witch took the forests colors with her when she diedThe grueling monotony is broken only at night when the students go into theirtents and the sounds come again and the very celluloid seems to shiver withcold and fear The camera twitches incessantly The lone stationary shot iswhen Heather sobs an apology to her parents for having dreamed up the projectand the way shes framed and halflighted she looks like Lon Chaneys Phantomof the Opera with nostril hair I dont apply the adjective visceralcasually The shaky camera summons up our fightorflight responses Leavingthe screening my wife was convinced she had food poisoning from an earliermeal when we stopped and analyzed her symptoms we realized that she hadmotion sickness The movie had literally made her sick            The power of that cantbe slighted however I love horror pictures and am a tough scare but Istarted having nightmares about The Blair Witch Project before I evensaw itsolely on the basis of its preview I slept even less after I did seeit When I caught an interview with the superbly nervy Heather Donahue ontelevision the first thing I thought was Thank God shes alive Then shesaid This movie must be working because people come up to me all the time andsay Thank God youre alive  The other day an envelope arrived at my doorwith a bunch of sticks lashed together in the familiar form of the Blair Witchtalisman I rushed to the phone and called the movies publicists to make surethis was a promotional gimmick When they said yes I started breathing againotherwise I might have called the policeor an exorcist            What is it about The Blair Witch Project that tapsinto such primal emotions Consider its antithesis The remake of TheHaunting has the bad fortune to open in the same month and what might havebeen dismissed as just a lame overstuffed bigstudio scare picture will now beheld up as a counterexample Robert Wises  original based on ShirleyJacksons The Haunting of Hill House  is overrated but it manages toevoke the eeriest aspect of Jacksons fiction the way the characters neurosesacquire an inexorable life of their own and threaten to eat them alive Nothingmuch happens in the empty mansion but when something doesfor instance athunderous pounding on a pair of big doors as if all the charactersaccumulated nervous energies had been focused on one spotthe moviesreticence pays off like gangbusters or ghostbusters In the new versiondirected by Jan De Bont  Speed   Twister   thatpounding comes early and serves as an overture for a bunch ofcomputergenerated special effects ghosties that swirl around like Tinkerbellstatues that spring to life and grab people Everything is exasperatinglyoften laughably overexplicit and once a dread becomes material a ghost storybecomes a monster moviea different far less terrifying beast            Here are sound effects so hammy that they mighthave been borrowed from one of those old hauntedhouse party albums Doorsdont creak they CRRRREEEAAAKKK and then close with a reverberantKERCHUNGGGGGG From the second Liam Neeson and his subjectsCatherineZetaJones Lili Taylor and Owen Wilsonset foot in the farcically garishHill House its clear that Something Evil is watching them You can tellbecause Something Evil respires so loudly that hes either Darth Vader or anasthmatic By the time poor Taylor stands up to the big bad ghost on behalf ofa lot of little good ghosts people in the audience are holding onto theirstomachs to keep from retching with laughter Writing directing actingthisis one of the most maladroit ghost movies ever made            But even if the script werent so tineared and thedirection so clunky The Haunting still wouldnt come within screamingdistance of The Blair Witch Project  The reason is philosophical DeBont a lavish materialist who thinks that movies can do anything if you throwenough money around wants to scare you by showing you stuff Myrick andSanchez want to scare you by not showing you stuffand by reminding you howmuch you cant see and will never know With all those cameras onscreentheyve liberated horror from the realm of moviesfrom the realm of thelightand nestled it back into the dark where it was born
