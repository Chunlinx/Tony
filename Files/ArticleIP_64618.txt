                                 Is Video Campaign Spam the New New Thing            Upstairs from Samsons Vitamins and Herbs at the corner of  th andChurch streets in northwest Washington DC theres a funky little eaterycalled the CyberSTOPCafe For  per halfhour you can rent time on a PC or an iMac while yousip an espresso and take in the zany decor chairs upholstered in leopard skina painting of the Mona Lisa holding a coffee cup Last week Al Gore dropped bywith some campaign staff and a few reporters in tow trudged up a narrowstaircase and had a campaign aide shoot a video with a rented digital camerawhile he read a letter to Bill Bradley Then Gore downloaded the video onto oneof the CyberSTOP computers and emailed it to the Bradley campaign He put downa  tip and left            Itwas of course a gimmick But all technological breakthroughs begin asgimmicks Does video campaign spam have a future            Beforeanswering that question lets examine the somewhat flimsy substance of Goresmessage to Bradley This wont take long In the video email Gore askedBradley with great sobriety about an oversight in Bradleys campaignliterature concerning the Medicare trust fund For my part the flickeringimage of Gore intoned I have proposed dedicating a significant portion of thebudget surplus to Medicare to extend the life of the trust fund By contrastBradleys campaign literature doesnt propose similarly fencing off funds forMedicare Since independent experts agree that more resources will benecessary to assure Medicare is strong for the future Gore continued myquestion is What specific measures do you propose to compensate for notdedicating any of the surplus to strengthen the Medicare trust fund  Inessence Gore said that Bradleys plan to expand health coverage to uninsuredAmericans which is more ambitious than Gores plan would bankrupt theMedicare trust fund unless Bradley raised taxes But the relevance of thisattack is severely compromised by the reality that  Bradley had alreadyadmitted he might have to raise taxes if circumstances warranted it and during his cybercafe appearance Gore himself told reporters that youhave to have flexibility on the fiscal side When asked about Gores queryEric Hauser a spokesman for Bradley pointed out that Gore was no more willingthan Bradley to rule out a tax increase For more on Gores recent maumauingof Bradley and the strategy that lies behind it click             Somuch for substance Turning to technological matters Hauser admitted thatBradley never got around to viewing Gores email Neither did Hauser andneither did anyone Hauser knew of in the campaign though they were familiarwith its content from reading a transcript Apparently the video message gotlost somewhere in the maw of Bradleys campaign Web site But obviously thevideo wasnt really intended for Bradley its target was the national press acouple hundred of whose members received email press releases with the videoattached Thanks to its novelty the stunt won Gore some coverage from theNew York Times  Salon  Scripps Howard and a few other outlets            Onedoesnt have to be a visionary to imagine where this might go The largestsingle expense that political campaigns face nowadays is TV advertising Gorefor instance has dropped a couple hundred thousand dollars on ads in Iowa andNew Hampshire Video emailing is much cheaper No wait Make that much muchmuch cheaper Even figuring in Gores  tip the tab Gore ran upsending his email to Bradley and a bunch of reporters probably came in at wellunder  It would have been even cheaper had Gore been able to use thevideo camera already in his personal possession but campaign finance rulesmade that too difficult Sending that same email to  times as many peoplewould have cost precisely the same amount            Fornow the Gore campaign has no grand plans to start spamming unsuspectingcitizens with video messages It does plan however to start sending videoemails to people who have already indicated on the campaign Web site thattheyd like to receive such material They number in the tens of thousandsIts not too great a leap to envision that in future presidentialracesperhaps even in this onecandidates will take the next step and startbuying lists of email addresses so they can send targeted video messages oradvertisements If push technology makes a comeback such video ads could beforcefed to the public at large at a cost that compared to current mediabuys would probably be microscopic These ads probably wouldnt be aseffective as conventional TV adsremember most homes in the United Statesstill arent wired to the Internet But theyd be so much morecost effective that they might still transform the way campaigns dobusiness
