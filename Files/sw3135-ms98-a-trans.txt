              okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell   oh yes im an old experienced hand i started back when it wasnt stylish to do that at all my daughter thats seventeen now   uhhuh   i worked even when she was a baby   oh   and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist   uhhuh   right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place   uhhuh uhhuh i see   so it worked well how about you   oh well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   and uh  weve just been real lucky  i think anyway to not   uhhuh its not hard to find anything thats parttime so many of the churches have really strong   right like half day programs uhhuh   preschool and childrens day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas   uhhuh   but they were so  seemed cold and impersonal i just couldnt hack it   uhhuh   and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there   oh oh my gosh   so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and   uhhuh oh my goodness   real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and im really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that   right right yeah   that if they hadnt had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff   uhhuh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here   uhhuh   you know to your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do  you get them once a week or something you know   or pay for it after school our Emilys in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and   oh is that right i had no idea   you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools     oh my goodness   rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah   and with our budget cuts im sure thats not going to   well thats the only way theyre yeah thats the only way theyre going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes   not going to change anytime soon oh my goodness yeah thats true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten you know its like wham  culture shock its just   yeah yeah put the colors away  which is too bad   yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well thats hard its so difficult for them um   uhhuh uhhuh   did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone elses home   until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house   uhhuh so you were able to have somebody come there   and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and id practically give my paycheck away to do it so  yeah   yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you   yeah well no she didnt live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money   oh oh my goodness   and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did  more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead   uhhuh yeah oh   so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so   oh gosh uhhuh uhhuh i have uh a   i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center   uhhuh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the Home Show but they were talking about uh a new uh  oh i cant even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um its some kind of advisory board theyve put together for parents and children   umhum umhum   and theyve now moved it to Washington DC and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i cant imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there   yeah oh that would be hard   you know so um   well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or   uhhuh   are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off fulltime longer of you can phase your schedule in so that its not fulltime   uhhuh oh boy thats great   for up to six months its really neat ive ive had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or theyve you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint   uhhuh uhhuh   we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you dont have to just wean wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again   yeah right right   and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals ive of course its too late for me so ive ive not tried them to see how effective they are but   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   i think were finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast   gosh its amazing   and for our age group its too late too little too late   right right   but i  i do think its an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay   uhhuh uhhuh well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do   uhhuh   you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so its only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh   right yeah oh sure you retain employees and keep them longer thats that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that   uhhuh uhhuh   well they want us to be happy and wa nt us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces   right right right   so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back fulltime because thats hard   oh thats good thats good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh you know a private a private home to take their children to when theyre young until they hit the preschool age and they   uhhuh uhhuh   usually you know youll find a a woman thats keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future future sisterinlaws mother does that too fulltime   uhhuh well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area   uhhuh   and i kept finding neighbors and friends and theyd move she ended up being in a different home every year   oh too transit uhhuh   and i finally decided i didnt like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then shes old enough to   and her surroundings too yeah
