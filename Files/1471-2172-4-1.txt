                    Background        The tetraspanins are a family of cellsurface proteins        with four transmembrane domains two extracellular loops        and conserved cysteine residues at key positions in the        second extracellular loop     They facilitate a wide        array of functions including cell activation        differentiation adhesion morphological changes and        motility which may all relate to the promiscuous        associations of these molecules with integrins and other        signaling proteins within the cell membrane and the        cytoskeleton        CD a defining member of the tetraspanin superfamily        is widely expressed on human hematopoietic and other cells            It associates on B cells with a signaling complex        that includes CD and CD     as well as associating        with MHC class II molecules    and other tetraspanins             On T cells CD interacts with CD CD CD and        selected integrins               An antiCD antibody was first isolated for its ability        to induce cell death in B cell lines     This is        likely dependent upon CDs association with MHC class II        molecules which can transmit deathinducing signals in B        cells     CD crosslinking can also induce adhesion        in B and T cells apparently by multiple pathways              Triggering of the CDCDCD complex on murine B        cells has been shown to lower the threshold for B cell        activation via the immunoglobulin receptor            On murine T cells and thymocytes CD costimulates T        cell receptormediated activation through a pathway        independent of CD     On human T cells CD        costimulation results in increased IL production and        LFAmediated TB cell adhesion     Murine CD also        appears to play a role in thymocyte maturation as shown in        fetal thymic organ cultures            Finally CD signalling has been shown to have an        effect on the ThTh balance of immune responses In cell        cultures of CD T cells and B cells from allergic        individuals addition of antiCD antibody enhances IL        production from the T cells     In mice either        complete lack of CD or lack of CD on B cells leads to        impaired humoral and Th immune responses             Allergeninduced airway hyperresponsiveness is also        decreased in CD nullmice     Finally lack of CD        on murine T cells diminishes IL production with reduced        expression of ICOS GATA STAT and phosphorylated STAT                   In this report an attempt is made to reconcile the        findings of general T cell costimulation versus specific        Th biasing by CD in human T cells Shortterm CD        crosslinking on normal human T cells is shown to        costimulate T cell activation via antigen or        superantigen extending previous findings in mouse        splenocytes    and human PBMC     The effect        appears to be a direct consequence of CD triggering on T        cells Of interest production of both Th and Th        cytokines is augmented by CD costimulation However        during longerterm stimulation of T cells the presence of        CD costimulation leads to a disproportionate increase in        ILproducing cells This is due to increased induction of        proliferation Thus CD signalling provides shortterm        costimulation of cells producing Th or Th cytokines but        results in a disproportionate increase in Th        cytokineproducing cells during longterm activation                    Results                  CD crosslinking costimulates CD expression and          IL induction          Two early events in T cell activation are the          induction of CD expression and the stimulation of IL          production by the T cells To determine whether          costimulation through human CD affected these early          activation events peripheral blood cells from normal CMV          seropositive donors were incubated for  h with a          superantigen SEB or the viral antigen CMV in the          presence or absence of an agonistic antiCD mAb A          As seen in Figure  over a range of antigen or          superantigen concentrations the addition of A          increased the number of CD cells as well as the number          of ILproducing cells measured by intracellular          staining The effect of antiCD mAb was often greater          than that of the classical costimulatory antibody CD          The effect of antiCD was also greater for CD T cells          A B E F compared to CD T cells C D G H It          also appeared to be more dramatic for CD ACEG than          for IL BDFH As such essentially no effect was          observed on CD CD CD  T cell IL production          panels D and H Stimulation with A alone in the          absence of SEB or CMV gave consistently            cytokinepositive T cells in such experiments data not          shown These results confirm and extend the findings of          VanCompernolle et al    on CD costimulation of          SEBinduced CD expression          Similar to results obtained by VanCompernolle et al              CD costimulation was also found to increase          SEBspecific proliferation as measured by BrdU          incorporation data not shown                          Effect on Th and Th cytokines          Since CD signaling has been implicated in the mouse          to be preferentially important for Thdominated          responses     it was examined whether CD          costimulation in human T cells preferentially induced Th          cytokine production over Th cytokine production To          examine this  h stimulation with SEB or CMV was carried          out in peripheral blood cells of normal human CMV          seropositive donors in the presence or absence of          antiCD mAb A followed by intracellular staining for          IL IFN or IL As seen in Figure  addition of A          approximately doubled the number of cytokineproducing          cells for each cytokine at these doses of SEB  gml          or CMV  gml There was no preferential          costimulation of cells producing IL versus IFN or          IL                          CD exerts a direct effect on human T cells          To determine whether the effects observed in the above          experiments were due to direct stimulation of CD on T          cells or whether indirect effects of ligation of CD on          other cells were involved the following experiment was          carried out PBMC from a normal human donor were depleted          of nonT cells by magnetic bead separation then T cells          and nonT cells were independently incubated with A          antiCD mAb washed and recombined in the presence of          SEB As seen in Figure  only when the T cell fraction          was incubated with A was costimulation of CD          expression and cytokine production observed Thus direct          ligation of CD on T cells was sufficient to induce          costimulation of T cell activation                          Effect of CD ligation on longterm T cell          activation          Another possible way that CD could affect T cell          cytokine production is by directing T cells towards Th          cytokine production during longterm stimulation Other          investigators have shown in mouse systems that          commitment to Th or Th cytokine production by nave T          cells requires prior cell proliferation     and          reversal of Th or Thcommitted cells requires at least          several days of proliferation     When normal human          PBMC were stimulated for  days with SEB the presence of          A antiCD mAb resulted in a modest increase in          ILproducing T cells when those cells were          restimulated with PMA and ionomycin Figure A No          significant change in IL or IFNproducing T cells was          seen Similar results were seen when PBMC were stimulated          with platebound antiCD mAb rather than SEB for           days in the presence of A antiCD mAb Figure B          These results were more dramatic when CDRO cells were          first isolated by magnetic bead separation and then          subjected to  d stimulation by antiCD in the presence          or absence of A antiCD mAb As seen in Figure C          the percentage of CD T cells producing IL upon          PMAionomycin restimulation was increased more than          fold when A antiCD mAb had been added to the          initial antiCD culture No significant change in IL          or IFNproducing cells was seen A less dramatic          increase in ILproducing cells was seen for CDRO          cells Figure D The results for CD T cells mirrored          those for CD T cells except that the overall number of          ILproducing CD T cells was lower data not          shown          Because the effect of CD on ILproducing T cells          was most dramatic with CDRO cells Figure C it was          hypothesized that CD costimulation was affecting the          number of ILproducing memory T cells over time To          determine the effect of CD costimulation over time on          the absolute number of IL or IFNproducing T cells          the experiment of Figure was carried out CDRO T          cells were stimulated with antiCD  antiCD mAb as in          Figure  but cells were restimulated with PMA           ionomycin after   or  d of culture The absolute          number of IL and IFNproducing T cells was then          quantified using intracellular staining and TruCount          beads As seen in Figure  the number of ILproducing          CD T cells increased much more significantly over time          in cultures incubated with antiCD mAb than in those          without The number of IFNproducing CD T cells          increased similarly in cultures incubated with or without          antiCD mAb Thus CD costimulation appeared to          preferentially induce the accumulation of ILproducing          T cells over time          To further test whether CD costimulation was          inducing preferential proliferation of ILproducing          memory cells experiments with CFSE labeling were carried          out As seen in Figure A the percentage of          ILproducing cells increased preferentially over time          in longterm antiCD stimulations that received CD          costimulation relative to stimulations in the absence of          antiCD mAb Although CFSE content was equal in all          cells on day  Figure B the mean level of CFSE          fluorescence of ILproducing cells became lower over          time in the presence of CD costimulation versus          antiCD stimulation alone Figure Band C This          indicates that ILproducing cells had divided on          average more times with CD costimulation than without          The difference was apparent after one day of stimulation          and did not increase over time consistent with a greater          initial induction of proliferation of ILproducing          cells in the presence of antiCD There was no such          difference in CFSE levels for IFNproducing cells in the          presence or absence of antiCD Figure D However          antiCD costimulation induced lower levels of CFSE in          all cells including IFNproducing cells after  days          of antiCD stimulation p   data not shown          Thus CD costimulation appears to uniquely induce          greater proliferation of ILproducing cells relative to          other memory T cell populations                            Discussion        In this study it was shown that CD ligation on human        T cells costimulates the induction of CD expression the        production of cytokines and the proliferation of both CD        and CD human T cells Greater effects were seen on CD        T cells compared to CD T cells The costimulatory        effects were documented using two antigenic systems a        superantigen SEB and a conventional viral antigen CMV        The effects were determined to be a direct consequence of        CD ligation on T cells as antiCD mAb pretreatment of        purified T cells but not nonT cells induced the        costimulatory effects        In a previous study Van Compernolle et al showed that        the enhancing effect of CD on SEBinduced activation was        inhibited by antibody to LFA     The current results        are consistent with the model proposed by VanCompernolle et        al whereby CD ligation induces an increase in LFA        avidity for ICAM on accessory cells resulting in an        indirect activation effect on the T cells However in the        current study antiLFA was found to only partially block        cytokine production induced by either SEB or SEBantiCD        data not shown This suggests that CDs effects on        cytokine production may not be uniquely mediated by LFA        In fact other investigators have shown that antiCD mAb        can directly costimulate purified murine T cells            in a presumably LFAindependent manner        CD costimulation increased in equal proportion the        number of T cells producing IL IFN and IL Using        CD nullmice CD was found to be required for effective        Th but not Th immune responses        But        CD has also been found to generally costimulate T cell        responses in mouse    and human     Thus the        costimulation of T cell cytokine production by CD need        not necessarily be biased towards Th cytokines The        current results bear this out        More recent results have shown that CD expression on T        cells is indeed important for their induction of IL        production    in a mouse system The current study        complements these results by demonstrating that CD        directly influences the number of ILproducing T cells in        cultures of stimulated human memory T cells The effect of        antiCD mAb was to increase the absolute number of        ILproducing T cells over time relative to cultures not        costimulated with antiCD mAb Furthermore the CD        costimulation appeared to cause a greater induction of        proliferation of ILproducing cells relative to that        seen in the absence of CD mAb        The effect of CD costimulation on the number of        ILproducing T cells could occur through several        different mechanisms First it is possible that CD        induces recruitment of nave cells to the Th pathway This        did not appear to be the case as the effect of CD was        most prominent on CDRO cells which do not include nave        T cells However CD signalling could induce the        switching of some IFNproducing Th T cells to        ILproducing Th T cells over time This is a difficult        mechanism to test due to the low number of ILproducing        T cells in human PBMC relative to IFNproducing T cells        Experiments attempting to deplete ILproducing T cells        prior to antiCD stimulation were attempted but could not        be accurately interpreted since depletion of  of        potential ILproducing cells could not be documented        data not shown It was thus impossible to rule out this        mechanism as possibly contributing to the accumulation of        ILproducing cells over time although it did not appear        to be the major mechanism see below        Second it is possible that CD costimulation        preferentially rescues ILproducing T cells from        apoptosis and thus they accumulate to a greater degree        over time This did not appear to be the case as        ILproducing T cells were no more likely to be apoptotic        than IFNproducing or ILnegative T cells in longterm        stimulations data not shown        Finally it is possible that CD induces preferential        proliferation of ILproducing T cells relative to other T        cells This indeed appears to be the case as seen by        proliferation experiments using CFSE see Figure  As        cells divide this cytosolic dye is diluted such that        cells express lower levels of CFSE with each successive        division Indeed after just one day of stimulation        ILproducing cells in the presence of CD costimulation        had lower mean levels of CFSE than did ILproducing cells        in the absence of CD costimulation This was not true for        ILnegative or IFNproducing cells The relative amount        of CFSE in CDcostimulated cultures versus        noncostimulated cultures did not change further over time        Thus it did not appear that ILproducing cells were        continually proliferating faster in the presence of CD        costimulation Rather they appeared to be more readily        induced into proliferation as the maximum difference in        CFSE levels was already observed after one day of        stimulation Thus the primary mechanism by which CD        costimulation induces Th bias in longterm stimulation        appears to be a greater induction of proliferation in        ILproducing cells This complements the findings of Deng        et al     in which the lack of CD in a murine        culture system correlated with decreased expression of        signalling molecules critical for activation and IL        production This effect of CD is not shared by other        classical costimulatory molecules such as CD which has        been shown to induce the proliferation of both Th and Th        cells data not shown and references                      It should be noted that the present study due to        limitations of working with human PBMC could not address        the results of withdrawing endogenous CD signalling        Rather CD costimulation could only be increased over        basal levels by application of an agonistic mAb A        Because endogenous CD costimulation could still occur in        cultures without A added the differences due to addition        of A might actually underestimate the full potential of        CDs effect This caveat of the experimental system also        implies that there could be considerable donortodonor        variability in the effect of antiCD mAb as different        donors could have different levels of endogenous CD        costimulatory activity The natural ligand for CD has        never been identified                    Conclusions        In conclusion CD costimulation appears to have        multiple effects on T cells including costimulation of Th        and Th cytokine production in shortterm assays and        preferential induction of Th cell proliferation in        longterm cultures of human memory T cells These results        expand upon and help to explain the Thbiasing effects of        CD in mouse      and human    systems                    Methods                  Cells and cell separation

The number of          cytokineproducing cells per ml were then calculated as          number of gated cellsnumber of gated beads           number of beads per sample                          CFSE labeling          PBMC magnetically enriched for CDRO cells were          labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate          succinimidyl ester CFSE Sigma as follows A  mM          stock solution of CFSE in DMSO was aliquoted and stored          at C Just prior to use an aliquot was thawed and           l of stock solution were diluted into  ml of PBS          CDRO cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in           ml of the CFSEPBS solution After incubating  min at          room temperature the cells were washed once with  ml          of RPMI medium   fetal bovine serum supplemented          with Lglutamine and antibiotics They were then plated          in wells of a well plate as under Long term          stimulations above
