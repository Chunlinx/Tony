        what are you cooking for supper     oh boy thats a good question i havent figured that one out yet personally im thinking of making a goulash   that sounds pretty good   but im publishing a cookbook right now so or getting it ready to go to the publisher   what type of food   all types   yeah   different nationalities theres going to be a different section for each nationality it ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese theres some Scottish theres some Scottish in it some Scottish dishes that i know some Russian some for babies you know how to make baby food instead of buying it because its so bloody expensive   yeah yeah well im kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday thats about the only thing   im a housewife   huh   im a housewife   yeah   everyday too   and   ive got two little boys   today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i dont have some sort of dessert in the house     yeah i made banana bread two days ago and its gone everything i make disappears real quick so i guess people like it   yeah sometimes i i make things and they dont work so i kind of throw them away before anybody sees them         but im a i i dont know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that ive cooked over and over and over   yeah well see a lot of people do live by cookbooks not just house husbands but like bachelors and stuff they dont know how to cook anything you know unless they have a recipe to follow   yeah   thats why im publishing this cookbook because its simple recipes its nothing thats hard   yeah   its just everything in it is really simple you are   sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes and where ive got to read it reread it and then keep it out while im cooking   yeah   and you know something new not something im going to fix every day or something   just something for a special occasion   right but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and its really really strong with garlic and black pepper and weve always thought nobody would like it       and uh we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe   oh really   yeah and i didnt go easy on anything   that must have made you good   yeah its its delicious its like when it when its like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and   yeah   its just its very pungent thing and and we just didnt think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and ive already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so   huh       well my husband went to chef school before we got married and he can cook all kinds of fancy dishes and i can because i went to cooking school too but i   maybe   i favor the Midwestern kind of cooking because i grew up country so thats what i like to   yeah where did you grow up in the Midwest   well i grew up in Arizona   okay   on a ranch on a ranch and it was a horse ranch and we cooked country style you know i mean you dont peel your potatoes when you cook them in the country you just cut them up and there you go   right       i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks theyre theyre from Midwest from Iowa from her background   yeah   because thats where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area so its especially when were baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know theyve been tried and tested and and everything so   yep well my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad which was about ten years ago but um and she published hers so now its my turn im trying my luck   uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and   anywhere near Alamogordo   uh no we lived up at Los Alamos   oh   so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh Santa Fe type dishes and uh   yeah   thats usually what well fix if companys coming because they uh they expect it   theres some really good food that comes out of there ill tell you   yeah we dont even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants around here     there is none around here thats really Mexican theyre all fake   yeah well   you know and when you taste the food you know it theres just a difference   in this part of the world theres you know theres a lot and theres some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so   oh really   you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe that id rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and     yeah well i live in San Diego and its right near the border   yeah   but youd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here they knowing how close we are to the border i mean you only have to drive five minutes to get to the border youd think that thered be good Mexican cooking here
