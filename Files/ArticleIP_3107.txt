                                 Is It Real or Is It Clairol            The other day as I wassitting at a Paris cafe watching all the summery people sitting around orsauntering past something struck me Blondes were everywhere their brightthatches catching the sun but until that minute I hadnt taken proper noticeof the fact that not one of them was a natural A few flaxenheaded childrenunder  were maybe But I saw no teenage adult or elderly blondes whoseblond hair actually covered their scalps all the way to the roots Everybodyhad abundant streaks or sizable tracts of blondness all supported by darkroots under the outer layers of golden glow            I furtherrealized that this had been the case for years in Paris and New York and that Ihadnt seen a real blondethe kind with pale lashes to matchsince the lasttime I was in Amsterdam If you remain a pure blonde at  these days you haveto dye your hair coppery red or pitchblack or give up all hope of chicNatural blondness once the badge of physical and moral perfection now marksyou as hopelessly trueblue whitebread straightarrow old hat Youre nolonger enticingly innocent and desirable but boringly earnest naive andsolemn            True blondes used to thank providence for their hair thenpaint their brows and lashes dark to create enough smolder to match itsconventionally sexy shimmer Darkhaired girls could dye their hair blond butno trace of the original color was permitted to show Popular fiction of thes and s was full of scathing descriptions of women whose deceptiveblondness was dark at the roots It was the visual evidence of feet of clay aheart of sloth a general moral degradation Blondness could be false butintegrity dwelt in keeping it perfect Dimming natural blondes wouldscrupulously dye the blond back in and touch up all traces of shadow at theroots weekly            Todaysober or smoldering brunettes leave their natural roots in place and addblondness to taste as a patent ornament and sophisticated reference Hair dyethat proclaims itself as such used to be marginal and nonfashionable theexclusive privilege of prostitutes actresses strippers drag queens andanybody who didnt mind being taken for them Now it is modish for both sexesDennis Rodman undoubtedly had a lot to do with this Lately we have all wantedto resemble exciting quasimarginal celebrities We want to show that we arenot afraid of their beauty secrets and can appropriate their willful blondnessor other visual caprices for our own ends            One popular scheme for hairtop half blondbottom half darkseems to have originated in the punk styles of the lates when kids bleached the top half of their spiky hair so they could dye itgreen or purple When the colors washed out the bleachedblond effectremained and when the whole thing grew out the dark roots showed up under thepale spikespresto a new avantgarde fashion contemporaneous with the startof body piercing These evolving styles were much deplored by the mainstream atthe time and have duly been adopted by all and sundry            Intriguedby all this I looked at a recent Paris Match for some pictures ofdesirable female blondes There was Kelly Preston the wife of John Travoltaher blond pile of hair covering only the top half of her skull her nape andtemples brown There too was the French actress Julie Delpy with a flowingblond mane and an inch of dark roots the new ideal of perfect blond youngwomanhood And there on the next page was the old ideal It was the Grace Kellyof  every bright golden hair on her head springing straight through herscalp out of her pure mind and elegant soul and reverently coiled into atriumph of gleaming sculpture            Next I looked at blondes from the more distant past Titianis the most famous for painting golden hair along with his many VenetianRenaissance followers and its also well known that ladies in RenaissanceVenice dyed their hair blond Theres a famous engraving showing them doing itwith a detailed description of the method            What were the results Manybeauties portrayed by Titian Palma Vecchio and Paris Bordone catch the eyewith their rippling cascades and looped braids of brilliant yellow hair But acloser look shows they all have dark eyes and dark eyebrows and that their hairspreads from a center part where at least an inch or two of dark roots isclearly visible on either side You can usually see more darkness along thehairline behind the ears too So these Venetians were theoretical blondesjust like Rodman and Delpy Their dyed hair was meant not to deceive but tofunction as a sort of witty allusion to an outworn creed            In thehumanist High Renaissance golden hair brought to mind the secular andclassical beauty of Venus and her mythological colleagues whom such beautiesoften posed as At the same epoch a Virgin Mary by Titian would beforthrightly darkhaired But his errant and penitent Mary Magdalene would useVenus skilled hairdresser            To find the Grace Kelly of European paintingyou have to go back to the  th century in central Italy Franceand especially the Netherlands There you see breathtakingly pure and candidgolden hair flowing down from the Virgins head in a natural veil suggestingthe descending rays of an ultimate blessing from above Eve wears it too as domany female saintsthe wayward Magdalene includedand many princesses Noartifice assists these honeylike waves This is celestially ordained blondnessthe mark of Gods favor affirming the signal beauty of the old pagan deitieswho had already given all blondestorrid or chilly fake or realan edge for years            Its a sign of a permanentlyaltered world that natural blondness should have such sacred power no longerInstead we have reinvented the much more flexible and imaginative Venetianblondness We have a new awareness of how limiting and unfair the cult of fairhair can be Natural darkhaired beautydespised or exoticized for eons byEuropeans Britons and Americanshas at last been universally recognized andwelcomed Its varicolored roots have grown in for all to see and for all toreckon with Blondness has become just one of the many attractive ways to adorndark hair
