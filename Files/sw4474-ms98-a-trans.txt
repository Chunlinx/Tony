            any uh child care situations or experiences   i i have had um i did a stint as a single parent for awhile and my circumstance dealt with kids who were in school and i thought that that was probably more difficult to deal with because finding someone who would fill those small time slots early in the morning and after school what you were left with were uh high school girls or boys   right   and uh never mind that they had all those noble uh qualities like you know you know the same philosophy of raising children that you did you were probably lucky to get anybody because you werent paying them very much and uh it was just a short period of time so     indeed yeah   uh it was really kind of someone who would sit and watch TV with them it it wasnt the kind of thing that you would get involved in if you had small children and you had child raising thoughts in mind it was kind of a temporary um babysitting kind of thing have you dealt with that   yeah right well ive got three kids the oldest is nine and the youngest is three and we have actually a live in child care worker here that we you know a nanny that lives here and that makes it very easy for us   oh are you pleased with the situation   yeah weve had um were on our um our third our second our our second longterm person you know its been  just about two years for each of the two people that weve had   hm   and prior to that we had you know to take child care we took the kids to somebody elses home and that worked out okay but it wasnt that great   it wasnt convenient   well we you know it was just it was partly the convenience and partly you know the woman the women that took care of our kids also had kids of their own and  the households were a little hectic you know how it sometimes is   hm i understand from people who have live in help au pairs and and you know just people who live with them that very often you end up involved in their personal problems and theyre taking care of your kids and youre taking care of them do you find that   oh yes definitely without a doubt im  you know its like having a a a young adult in the family just about   uhhuh   but thats okay i mean you you know as long as as their problems dont get too far out of hand well   you said you have a couple of changes do the kids get attached to one person and then its a problem to wean them off them   a little bit of a problem but you know thats just reality of it and you know you have to work with them and tell them ahead of time that somebodys leaving and somebody else is gonna be coming in and help them adjust to the situation   how old are the kids   oh the youngest is three and the oldest is nine and the middle one is six and the after school school situation is great its really convenient to have somebody whose job it is to make sure theyre that they get home and and you know are taken care of properly   hm i imagine that is a luxury of sorts   oh yeah  it its expensive itll itll probably have to change when they get you know all old enough to go to school have to use some after school service our local YMCA has something like that   uhhuh have you ever discussed with your caretaker how you want your children raised what your philosophies are   but it   well yeah to a certain extent um i guess you know my wife does more of that sort of i mean she she and the and the caretaker have intense discussions about that and i suppose im sort of a slug for not getting more involved but thats the way it is   you just appreciate the situation oh   oh it works out pretty well i think its a good plan um i think its kind of disgraceful that its so hard for so many people   well i you know i think this the thing is um your situation is what i would call ideal       but its probably taking both you working you know you and your wife working to afford this person isnt that so   well yeah oh no doubt if one of us got laid off shed be gone in two seconds im afraid im or have to   right when i was home by myself and i had a uh an eight year old and a six year old um there arent that many choices and thats the scary part youre just happy to get someone you know you really are in such desperate need and if your childs sick theres the panic its like i cant stay home what do i do and you know you import grandma from the other town to come over it was an emergency you know Christmas vacation comes around and then youve got to fill in that block of time   oh weve got those situations and you know weve got to deal with that kind of stuff but but its absolutely you know situation like ours you know where we could make enough money to cover it properly you know both we both work and then we pay the pay the nanny and we pay the compensation workers compensation insurance and we pay the the withholding taxes we
