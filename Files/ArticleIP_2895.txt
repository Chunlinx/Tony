                                 Our Last Cigarette            The earliest smoking songIve ever come across is Tobaccos But an Indian Weedfrom the late swhich seems a bit slow off the mark Sir Walter Raleigh had brought the firsttobacco leaves back from the colonies to Queen Elizabeth almost a centuryearlier On the other hand he also brought back the potato and how many greatpotato songs had anybody written by then But sooner or later everything windsup in the ashtray of history and  years after that first entry it seemsalmost certain that the Cigarette Songbook has no new leaves to turn over Forthat reason alone kd langs Drag will prove a useful anthropologicaldocument rounding up as it does some of the smokiest songs of the centuryfrom Smoke Rings the old theme of Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra fromthe s to Steve Millers s rocker The Joker Im a smoker Im amidnight toker            The firstthing to be said is that Miss langor maybe its miss langlives up to hertitle Drag is a deep languorous inhalation Its orchestrationsespecially David Toms guitar loops are as near as anyones ever come to thesensation of smoking even if by the time she gets halfway through the HolliesThe Air That I Breathe click to hear itPeace came upon me And itleeeeeeeaves me weakshe seems to be unwinding from a heavy night at theopium den rather than down to her last Marlboro Light            The second thing to be said is that Drag is a punOn the cover lang is wearing pinstripes and a ruby cravat like Oscar Wildeheading out clubbing Its as much about sexual role play and smoking as ametaphor for love every popular singers real addiction If any male vocalistis looking for an equally adroit album title encompassing both cigarettes andsexuality may I suggest at least for those versed in the divergences ofBritish and American slang Fag  Incidentally Wilde in The Pictureof Dorian Gray  writes A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfectpleasure It is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied What more can onewant This would seem to be kds view of love an addiction that mustinevitably disappoint            In a way its the album shes been working up to foryears Shes covered Im Down to My Last Cigarette and Three Cigarettes inan Ashtray and best of all Black Coffee click to hear it a smolderingPeggy Lee favorite that climaxes            Now man was born to goalovinBut was woman born to weep and fretAnd stay at home and tend herovenAnd drown her past regretsIn coffee and cigarettes            Im moanin all themorninMoanin all the nightAnd in between Its nicotine             You get the idea Thatby the way is the first use of nicotine in a Tin Pan Alley lyric langsbestknown original song Constant Craving speaks for itself Herbestwritten song Miss Chatelaine from the CD Ingenue  is about loveas an exhilarating high and the next track on that album begins You swimthrough my veins  Artistically speaking kd lang is addicted toaddiction            Shes not the first of course Harry Warren and Al Dubincovered most of the bases in a song for  nd Street in italics mine            Evry kiss evry hug            Seems to act just like adrug                        Youre getting to be a habitwith me            Let me stay in your arms            Im addicted to yourcharms            Youre getting to be a habitwith me            I used to think your love wassomething that I            Could take or leave alone            But now Icouldnt live without my supply              Only in the final eightbars do the writers pull any punches            I must have you evry day            Asregularly as coffee or tea                            Tea  You meanafter all that were talking about hot beverages here Well probablyCoffees addictive so are reefer Cab Calloway Fats Waller and coke ColePorterI get no kick from cocaine But in most pop songs cigarettes aremerely a stylish accessory            The best example of stylish smoke comes at the opening ofone of the most recorded songs ever Eric Maschwitz a BBC radio producermoonlighting under the name Holt Marvell wrote the lyric as an attempt to comeup with his own Youre the Toplike laundry list As it happens I think heimproved on the original His is one of the most quoted lines in all popularmusic            A cigarette that bears alipsticks tracesAn airline ticket to romantic placesAnd still my heart haswingsThese foolish things Remind me of you             In the cold light of dayits an image thats as likely to make you feel icky as nostalgicahalfsmoked fag with some cheesy lip gloss on it But set to those notes itsa fine example of the transformational properties of musicthe perfect openingfor Maschwitzs rueful accumulation of sophisticated memoryjoggerswildstrawberries only seven francs a kilo the waiters whistling as the last barcloses and so on            Since then the singing cigarette has dwindled away toisolated outposts of adolescent rock like Smokin in the Boys Room One ofthe consequences for an album like Drag  is that the most innocuoussongs now paradoxically pack more of a punch than ostensibly more searingstuff like My Old Addiction kd lang is never more brazen than when dustingoff Smoke Rings click to hear it from             Puff Puff PuffPuff yourcares awayPuff Puff PuffNight and day             langs great quality isthat she can pull off even the most anachronistic trifle without patronizingit The songs emerge as charming and dated yet somehow contemporary Herapproach which shes used consistently since recording Cole Porters So inLove seven years ago is to honor the broad parameters of the originallayouttempo arrangementwhile using pareddown guitarbased rockorchestrations The only surprise is that more singers havent picked up onit            Id be interested to see if you could apply that techniqueand the arrangements to older material such as Victor Herberts  nod toKipling A Woman Is Only a Woman But a Good Cigar Is a Smokethough thatsprobably an unlikely sentiment for kd lang Still its these older songs thatseem the correct assessment Smoking is a consolation for the vicissitudes oflife a prop for losers Thats how Sinatras been using cigarettes for years dimming the lights and getting them out for Angel Eyes or One for MyBaby sad songs for guys with nothing to do but drown their sorrows Its apersona that found its apotheosis in  on the cover of She Shot MeDown  his darkest album Sinatra hunched in a leather jacket wreathed insmoke Its not an image the tobacco companies care for When a Britishcompany back in the s tried the saloonsinger approach in a TV adwith amoody reflective loner and the tag line Youre never alone with a Stranditwound up putting itself out of business The Joe Camel approach is unlikely toproduce any decent songs but it undoubtedly sells more cigarettes            Whatever happens to tobacco sales under the new settlementbetween the states and the tobacco companiesor more accurately between thetobacco lobbyists and some enterprising tort lawyersits bound to result inthe further withdrawal of cigarettes from the mainstream of popular cultureincluding songs That being the case maybe like the fatalistic protagonist ofthe  operetta Algeria  we should light up one last time            Fragrantclouds then from us veilEvry sorrow evry doubtTill we wake at last tofindThat our cigarette is out
