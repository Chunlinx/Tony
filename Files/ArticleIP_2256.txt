                                 Losing It            Bob Dole at least seems tohave wrestled with his conscience before opting to launch bitter attacks onPresident Clintons character That does not appear to be the case with NewtGingrich On Inauguration Day theyre breaking the law and doing drugsGingrich told an audience at a restaurant in Roswell Ga a few days agoreferring to unspecified members of the Clinton administration Two dayslater theyre in the White House This must be the most disciplined set ofaddicts in the world because none of them has ever used drugs once since theyjoined the White House staff The accusation that the White House is filledwith drug addicts is a classic political smearugly utterly unsubstantiatedand almost certainly false            Itsunderstandable of course that conservative frustration levels should berunning high these days For a party that thought it was leading an unstoppablerevolution less than two years ago it cant be much fun to be saddled with anold gray mare of a presidential candidate like Dole or to be faced with thepossibility of losing control of Congress to an opposition they believe to benot just wrong but on the wrong side of history That said many Republicansare acting like sore losers already becoming unhingedtheres really no otherword for itat the prospect of a Democratic resurrection Someincluding inrecent days the Republican nominee himselfare drumming up scandal in such abiased and hypocritical way that they risk sacrificing both their credibilityand their dignity for the sake of a lost cause            The charges are flying fast and furiousmisappropriatedFBI files drugs even money laundering Bill Bennett said a few days agothat a second Clinton term could produce something like we went through in theWatergate era adding I believe this administration is one of the mostcorrupt in recent American history Only the weasellyqualifications something like  one of  recent save this remarkfrom transparent falsehood by leaving it meaningless But the implicitcomparison to Watergate is a shoddy historical absurdity coming from MrIntellectual Standards            In thelast week Dole and his surrogates have focused on two new issues that purportto embody the flawed ethics of the administration What these lines of attackhave in common is that for all the hysteria with which they are beingexpressed they have yielded little evidence of presidential misbehavior letalone deep problems of character            The most recent and bitter accusation has todo with campaign contributions from Asians Heres Gingrich again speaking onMeet                the                Press just after the Los                Angeles               Times broke the story that an Indonesian couple had given nearly half amillion dollars in soft money to the Democratic Party This makes Watergatelook tiny Gingrich said I mean this is a potential abuse of the Americansystem on behalf of an Indonesian billionaire in a way we have never seen inAmerican history The speakers wording was sly as everwhat isnt apotential abuse Doles campaign manager Scott Reed used the same weasellylanguage when he issued a statement attacking the administrations potentiallycriminal actions in squeezing money out of the Indonesian Lippo conglomerategoing on to ask the president Why have you used US foreign policy inIndonesia as a fundraising tool to help secure illegal campaign contributionsfrom a foreigner Dole himself then scored the administration for failing toanswer this and other whendidyoustopbeatingyourwife questions In factreporters who have been trying very hard to unearth evidence that thecontributions were illegal or that the Clintons connection to the Riady clanhas had an effect on American foreign policy have so far come upemptyhanded            Ofcourse it would be nice if we lived in a country where the political partieswere not allowed to take halfamilliondollar contributions from anyone Underour current system of campaign finance however the Indonesian connection ismerely and sadly typical As recently as the last presidential electionRepublicans faced a similar embarrassment when Michael Kojima a Japanesebusinessman gave them  which it turned out he owed to creditors andin childsupport payments Neither the Democrats nor the press made nearly thisbig a deal about it Since contributions from foreign nationals residing herelegally are allowed its hard to see whatother than a whiff of yellow perilin this casedistinguishes them from big donations by domestic interestsWilliam Safire has been carrying on about rich aliens in a truly ugly wayThe Democratic Party did accept and subsequently return an apparently illegalcontribution in a separate instance from a South Korean businessman who lackeda green card But then returning funny money is par for the course inpresidential campaigns Back during the primaries Dole accepted and returned in illegally bundled money from a company called AquaLeisure whosechief has since pleaded guilty to two felony charges in the case            The real difference between foreign and domestic soft moneyseems to be that American companies get better value in exchange Dolesbiggest backers include the CEO of Archer Daniels Midland the agribusinessconcern whose executives recently pleaded guilty to price fixing and the Gallowine family In those instances unlike in the Indonesian one there is strongevidence of a quid pro quo or at least mutual backscratching Dole has doneexplicit and valuable favors for both companies sponsoring the notoriousethanol boondoggle for ADM and helping the Gallos who have given various Doleorganizations more than  million since  with familyspecific tax breaksand regulatory fixes For some reason no one considers these to be Dolecharacter issues If Dole were ahead and Clinton behind theres little doubtthat the details of these relationships would now be frontpage news Butbeing the underdog Dole is so immune to such assaults that he can send outCharlie Blackwhose professional specialty is lobbying on behalf of corruptThird World dictators like the late Ferdinand Marcosto spin the press on howthe Democratic Partys taking Indonesian money demonstrates Bill Clintonsflawed character            Thecampaign contributions are at least in the realm of the troublesome The pardonfuss on other hand is simply absurd Heres how to succeed in obstructingjustice William Safire wrote in a recent column in the New                York               Times   publicly disparage all investigators as partisan miscreantsas Clinton now does  encourage coconspirators to resist prosecutorialpressure by arranging for hush money and  hint at postelection pardonsThe only problem here is that  is an unsupported fantasy and that  issimply wrong Clinton has done nothing to hint at pardons He has never broughtthe matter up publicly and theres no evidence hes done so in private Whenasked hes said he hasnt thought about it and wont discuss it            In the first presidential debate Dolecomically demanded that Clinton say no comment when asked about pardonswhich is more or less precisely what Clinton has done Dole later changed hisposition and demanded that Clinton explicitly promise to rule out pardons ifreelected He better make it very clearno pardons no pardons to anybody hedid business with who may be in jail Dole said on the eve of the finaldebate Doles spokesman justified this turnaround by arguing that Clinton hadobviated his no comment with an answer a couple of weeks earlier on theNews Hour With Jim Lehrer                        Heres what Clinton actuallysaid My position would be that their cases should be handled like othersthey should go throughtheres a regular process for that and I have regularmeetings on that and I review those cases as they come up after theres anevaluation done by the Justice Department In no significant way does thatcomment differ from a no comment Of course a nopardon promise would bemeaningless Clinton could simply break it on his last day of office And ifhis character is as bad as some Republicans contend theres no reason for themto think he would hesitate to do so It might also be pointed out that Dolesupported the political pardons meted out by Gerald Ford when he served asFords running mate in  Likewise in  he applauded the Bushadministrations lameduck pardons of Caspar Weinberger Elliott Abrams etal            These people are sopowerhungry and so shameless theyll do anything to win Dole said at a rallyin Glendale Calif the day after the debate before leading the audience inthe chant Its Our Money Its Our Money Its Our Money Its hard to saywhether this is really true of Bill Clinton But in the closing days of thecampaign it stands as an apt description of his faltering Republicanopponents
