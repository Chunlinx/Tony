                okay do do do you work outside the home or  you a student   i do im im a student and i work at Nu Skin   youre a student oh okay so you have a wardrobe to choose   so yeah   do you wear more dressy type clothes or casual or   um were allowed to wear we just we just cant wear jeans um every Monday through Friday we just have to wear you know nice slacks or um just something that looks nice and then on Fridays and Saturdays we can wear jeans so   uhhuh uhhuh oh oh   like jean day   oh does your does it change pretty much from does it change from season to season or is it pretty standard   um its pretty standard i mean just more sweaters and stuff of course in the winter but   uhhuh well it seems like  you know warmer warmer even in the winter you go from your warm car to your warm building so there really isnt that much of a of a difference or in the summer its its mostly airconditioning course  you do wear cooler things but i um dont work outside the home right now i have four little ones and so my   right oh wow   my clothing doesnt need to be probably as fancy as yours  but um you know mostly during the day i wear the the casual type things and and i have the sweaters and the in the winter and fall and   umhum   and cooler things in the summer but i for my husband he wears pretty standard all year round because its so climatized his work situation but we just recently done something that we found really helpful with his wardrobe and that is um we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry cleaners and we hadnt been doing this previously i was you know washing them and ironing and taking care of them at home and we found that it makes them wear and look so much better to have just everything dry cleaned i dont know whether you   oh really and you dont find that gets too expensive or   well we uh figure its pretty much worth the expense  just because um   really   the the dry cleaner comes right to his place of work and picks the articles up and takes them and drycleans them and brings them back the next day and then they give the company a fifteen percent discount so it really   wow   it really is not that expensive and we figure you know what it saves on wear and tear and then and saving me having to do it and they look so much better when theyre drycleaned   umhum   than when i do so that it does it does and thats kind of a   that makes it really nice   uh just just a you know thing weve recently started thats that we found really helpful   uhhuh does he have to wear suits and ties and   no he doesnt he he wears if he has an meeting a meeting or an important thing he wears a suit and tie but most of the time its just dress slacks and and you know white shirt usually and a tie   uh huh   so that now thats interesting do you wear when when on the days that Monday like Monday through Friday do you wear slacks mostly or dresses or   um i  i rarely wear dresses   do you  youre not a dress person   yeah i mean it doesnt it doesnt have to be that dressy guys have to wear ties at work but shirts and ties at Nu Skin but   uhhuh oh uhhuh even even during the week they do huh or i mean on weekends do they   other than that oh no no no   not on the weekend   but um the guys seem to get to have to dress up a little more than the girls   oh   for some reason we can get away with more   oh huh what about like shoe type things do you wear mostly dress shoes or do you wear tennis shoes or what   um no we cant wear tennis shoes during the week either so   oh well i guess you couldnt because you wouldnt have jeans on   yeah we cant wear tennis shoes but i its pretty casual i i found i mean it it would be what i would wear to school anyways most of the time so   oh so can you wear right what you wear to school to work you dont have to change   yeah yeah i well i work in the mornings from six thirty to ten thirty so   well thats oh   i get up pretty early and then school comes after that so i just dont bother to change for school unless i really want to be casual  but   uhhuh oh oh well thats interesting okay well can you   yeah how long have you been doing this TI thing   um lets see about two weeks is all   really how did you find out about it   my uh my brother   hes in is he in Dallas   he yes well hes in Plano thats just outside Dallas yeah   oh really thats where im from   oh
