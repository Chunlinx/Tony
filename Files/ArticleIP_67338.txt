                                 The FiveMinute Activist            BillBradley has raked in more than  million from his Web site That sounds prettygood until you consider that its less than  percent of what he has raisedoverall Jean Elliott Brown a novice Democratic House candidate in Floridahas raised only  for her challenge to Rep Mark Foley But she hascollected  of itmore than  percentonline            Brownhas done this with the help of Moveonorg  an online grassroots PAC Moveon first madeheadlines in September  as Censure and Move On Launched byhusbandandwife software entrepreneurs Wes Boyd and Joan BladesBerkeleySystems the company they founded is most famous for the Flying ToastersscreensaverCensure and Move On was an online petition campaign urgingCongress to call off impeachment proceedings censure President Clinton andget down to more important business            Everyonline enterprise strives for viral marketing Censure and Move On was TyphoidMary It signed up  folks in a week and  in a couple of monthsThe campaign delivered hundreds of thousands of petitions to House membersswamped congressional switchboards with  calls and won meetings withmore than  representativesall through what Boyd and Blades call word ofmouse Originally this was all intended to be part of a flash campaign thatwould end with the  election But Boyd and Blades were outraged when HouseRepublicans impeached Clinton after the election so they converted Censure andMove On into a we will remember campaign Between December and the end of thetrial in February visitors to the site pledged  million and volunteer hours to oppose proimpeachment members of Congress            Thingswere quiet for a while Then in June Moveon reemerged as a PAC Boyd Bladesand their advisers endorsed five candidatesall Democrats In addition toBrown who is a Moveon volunteer and public relations entrepreneur the othersare California state Sen Adam Schiff whos running against House ManagerRep James Rogan Nancy Keenan a Montanan seeking the seat of extremelyconservative Rep Rick Hill Missouri Gov Mel Carnahan whos challenging SenJohn Ashcroft and Rep Rush Holt DNJ who in  defeated Rep MikePappas a congressman who had gleefully caroled Twinkle twinkle KennethStarr on the House floor            Moveonemailed solicitations to the  folks who had pledged as well as to others on its mailing list Donors contribute online through MoveonsWeb site the organization then delivers the cash to the candidates ThisInternet bundling is the first of its kind It is modeled on the snailmailbundling practiced by organizations such as Emilys List Moveon raised in five days and has harvested another  since without anyfurther solicitation The contributions are tiny percent of them are or lessbut there are nearly  of them This kind of cash cant replacethe  donors who are the backbone of every campaign but its enough tomatter in House and Senate races We thought it might be interesting butprobably not really worth more than the time says Carnahan adviser RoyTemple It has way exceeded our expectations For Holt Schiff andKeenan the Moveon money comprises  percent to  percent of total fundraising            Moveonmoney made the biggest difference for Brown turning her from a nochancechallenger of a rich incumbent into a credible candidate The Moveon infusionallowed her to report more than  in contributions by the FederalElection Commissions June  filing deadline Now she says both Emilys Listand the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are considering supportingher which they would never have done without the Moveon money For JeanElliott Brown Moveon is far more important than the Florida Democratic Partyor any interest group says Phil Noble who runs PoliticsOnline The only realcatch is that Moveon money exposes candidates to the charge that they arebought by outofstate interests or Clintonloving liberals Ashcroft and Roganare using their opponents Moveon endorsement to help fundraise fromconservatives            According to Blades Moveon will also add more candidates to its roster thiswinter and will begin trying to direct those who volunteered time to campaignsAnd Blades says the organization will ask for campaign contributions everymonth from now till Election Day in hopes of reaping the entire  millionpromised But even if it never collects as much as  million Moveon will be alandmark the first empirical evidence of the power of grassroots Internetpolitics Its success all but guarantees that other political movements willimitate Moveons style of flash campaign which far outstrips the sluggardlypace of direct mail It is easy to imagine that an Internet movement couldspring up to oppose for example Vermonts gaymarriage ruling A drivetargeted at conservatives could collect thousands of electronic petitions in notime and solicit contributions for antigay marriage politicians Over timesome of these flash campaigns may begin to evolve into new kinds of politicalcommunities and quasiparties            Fiveminute activismBoyd calls this It may become the fastest fieriest method ever devised forchanneling citizen outrage
