          camping uh is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of of uh shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent   umhum   go up to state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like hotels with uh       uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh  they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little hotel air conditioning room at night   right umhum   so uh ive been through most all of that ive not done much of the no provision survival type but ive done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones  with more entertainment than uh survival in mind   huh   uh one of the times that we were at a uh state park we went up into Oklahoma and went to a place called Broken Bow and rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at   umhum   and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the the uh river part there and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been a couple of weeks prior   umhum huh   so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water   huh   well thats encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about youll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about ten hours so we we got in our car half way and and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the Guadalupe down in South Texas its got some real nice uh   umhum   canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much   umhum i mostly do uh back packing uh as opposed to any of the other sorts   umhum   um though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type   thats true   uhhuh the uh yeah ive done things uh i guess mostly upstate Michigan the Adirondacks White Mountains um Appalachian Trail kinds of things uh i prefer going out either with one other person or by myself for about a week and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and   hum   kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i havent gone survival camping where i scrape together all my food ive always carried it with me but uh   umhum   still its you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and   yeah   enjoy the wildlife   i wonder if uh being from uh Dallas area i i wonder if if its just this area thats doesnt encourage that type of camping i i seems like back packing goes well with mountain and sceneries sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so   umhum huh   uh unless you go over toward East Texas where theres a considerable considerable amount of woods or if you go uh extreme south part where theres some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where youre youre looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a   umhum   a either a lake that youd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh   umhum   but theres not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the the eastern part of the state where theres woods worth worth seeing but uh thats interesting i hadnt   umhum   all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to Colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of uh camping   umhum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for just one or two nights uh its not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the uh particularly in the uh the fall and spring when the insects havent come out yet uh where theyre already gone uh you know i spend almost every weekend up in the mountains and i guess i live about five hours away from some place to go hiking where i am now   thats not too bad   um pardon me   thats not too bad at all   no no its not bad and uh yeah i mean if its if you can find somebody whos uh you know willing to go out for several days you know and can handle that sort of thing uh which isnt everybody you run across obviously whos willing to   umhum      you know put seventy or ninety pounds on their back and go hiking uh  but uh it can be a lot of fun     yeah   and uh i theres certainly other people who go out uh canoeing i mean theres usually lots and lots of ponds particularly uh for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and park and theyve got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but uh you can also just you know bushwack or go on semi trailed areas and just get three days from any place thats civilization   huh   and thats kind of fun   yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was   umhum   oh the campsites were uh not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasnt just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some   umhum umhum   you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but thats usually a little windy on a lake edge and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and its eleven oclock at night and its you know by the head lights of the cars and   umhum   and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said huh yeah yeah doing doing just fine you know its a little windy but im doing all right and and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadnt fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh       then it started to rain so we didnt get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and woke up a little late the next morning but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the the radio and they clocked a ninety sev en mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and theres really nothing to stop it its uh thirty or forty miles wide its a huge uh   oh boy   lake right on the border of Texas and Oklahoma there and and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with uh nothing blocking us from this wind its a wonder we didnt lose a lot more than that but uh im sure that was just   huh umhum   the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our tents out   yeah its funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time im telling somebody about like a camping trip and ive ive done quite a few say with my sister is the stuff that you remember isnt you know really so much the uh the normal everyday you know oh this is a nice scene or something like this its its remember when are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we kept sliding down to the bottom of the tent or you know when the tents blowing down or when you wake up in the middle of the night and theres a hurricane and you know its     yeah yeah   we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then too much i mean you know afterwards its its its kind of a nice memory to think gee i survived that  well always need the uh feather bed as it were   yeah thats for sure yep thats true on that same lake theres another portion of it thats uh real uh carved out the the the shoreline shoreline is uh up against rock and its its pretty far cliff id say shirt or forty feet worth and the campsites are up top and then you go down and theres a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach   umhum   and that was uh a that particular campout
