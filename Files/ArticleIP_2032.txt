                                 Texacos Uncompensated Victims            Suppose the management of alarge corporation call it Texaco discriminates against blacks in hiring andpromotion Who are the victims of that discrimination The most obviouscandidates are the black workers who are denied suitable positions But theresa second class of potential victims the corporate stockholders who are deniedthe services of those black workers            You mightguess that when there is discrimination stockholders suffer less than theblack workers do In fact its more likely to be the other way around forreasons I will explain as I go along In that light boycotting Texaco productswould be cruelly ironic Boycotts lower corporate profits which punishes notthe discriminatory management but the innocent stockholdersthat is not thesinners but their victims There is even greater irony in the reports thatmanagement will atone for its sins with a  million payment to blackemployeesall of which will come directly from the pockets of those now doublyvictimized stockholders            To see why the stockholders bear many of the costs ofdiscrimination lets think through a few alternative scenarios                           Scenario  Supposethat jobs at Texaco are pretty much interchangeable with jobs at say ExxonMobil and other competing companies suppose also that discrimination is aproblem only at Texaco Then its easy for Texacos black employees to escapediscrimination by taking jobs elsewhere The positions vacated by Texacosblacks will be filled by whites presumably of about equal competence Becauseweve assumed that Texaco jobs are interchangeable with Exxon and Mobil jobstheres a large pool of workers at those firms for Texaco to draw on In thisscenario Texaco ends up with an allwhite work force but no harm is done toanybody Blacks who would have worked at Texaco end up in equally desirablejobs at Exxon Texaco stockholders who would have profited from the wisdom ofblack executives end up profiting from the equal wisdom of whiteexecutives                           Scenario  Supposeagain that jobs at Texaco are interchangeable with jobs at Exxon and Mobil butsuppose this time that discrimination is rampant throughout the industry ThenTexaco can treat its own black employees badly but no worse than the industrystandard if conditions at Texaco get worse than conditions at Exxon and Mobilall Texacos black employees will move to Exxon or Mobil Similarly if thereare comparable jobs available in other industries the oil industry as a wholecannot treat its black employees any worse than the standard set by those otherindustries So in this scenario blacks can be harmed by discrimination ingeneralbut they do not suffer any additional harm from Texacospolicies in particular            In thissecond scenario its the stockholders who suffer for the sins of themanagement To see why consider this example Suppose that throughout the oilindustry white executives earn  while otherwise identical blackexecutives earn  because of discrimination Then Texaco could slash itspayroll by firing all its white executives and hiring blacks to replace themat say  each If the management is too blinded by discrimination topursue that option then the stockholders end up paying an unnecessary per executive per year            You might want to argue that paying blacks to do a  job is itself a form of discrimination Id want toargue otherwise because in the case Im envisioning the wage differential isdriven not by racial preferences at Texaco but by profit opportunities createdelsewhere in the market But that is just a matter of definition and we can atleast agree on this No matter how you define discrimination hiringblacks at  is surely less discriminatory than refusing to hireblacks at  And again no matter how you define discrimination thebottom line is this If Texaco discriminates less than everyone else it endsup with lots of black executives and a tidy profit for the stockholders but ifTexaco discriminates as much as or more than everyone else that profitopportunity is thrown away So when Texacos management is highlydiscriminatory Texacos stockholders are the big losers                           Scenario  Suppose that contrary to the first and second scenariosits not true that a job at Exxon or Mobil is pretty much the same as a job atTexaco Suppose instead that each job requires skills so specific that thereis a single best person for each job and a single best job for each person Inthis scenario discrimination at Texaco is indeed costly to those blackemployees who are thereby excluded from their ideal jobs or forced to acceptlower wages in order to remain in those jobs But in this scenariodiscrimination becomes even costlier to stockholders who now own shares in acompany that does not make the best possible use of its black talentand evendrives some of it away            To summarize In Scenario  there are no victims inScenario  the stockholders are the only victims and in Scenario  the blackworkers and the stockholders are victims The truth is probably somecombination of these three stylized scenarios So if Texaco has indeeddiscriminated against blacks and its worth noting that the evidence for thatproposition is shaky but Ill accept it for the sake of argument its quitelikely that Texacos stockholders have borne most of the cost            If Texaco executives hadindulged their personal tastes for Van Gogh oil paintings at amultimilliondollar cost to the stockholders it would be selfevident that thestockholders had been plundered If Texaco executives indulged their personaltastes for racial discrimination at a multimillion dollar cost to thestockholders the same conclusion should be equally obvious            If there was enoughdiscrimination at Texaco to merit a  million settlement with the employeesthen there was enough discrimination to merit a commensurate payment to Texacostockholdersnot from corporate coffers but from the personal assets of thecorporate executives who bilked their investors by failing to hire the bestbargains in the labor market
