        i i assume i assume you have kids   uh we have one shes only nine months old   oh well she she doesnt have to worry about public schools yet   right well my degree is in teaching so   ah   so i   well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year   oh really   yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it   umhum   and they uh in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me   did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or   yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong   umhum well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but i taught junior high         and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasnt that bad i taught remedial reading kids   um   and well they dont call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time thats what i taught and um   um yeah   you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way   hum hum   when you have your slow readers but it it wasnt too bad we we got along real well     well i i sometimes wonder if i didnt mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can if you have to you can get mean with them       those little kids dont understand it   yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach elementary lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i dont like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth grade and so thats what i got my certification in   umhum   but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools   yeah   um and my reason for that was i dont like the uh whats the right word the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools   well thats a nice way of putting it           you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard but i dont think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis   exactly exactly and two most people dont have that option   yeah   you know and plus it also depends on the district youre in as i mean on the ive seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesnt matter what you do   umhum   uh accept for the private ones of course were talking about public   right   i dont know back when i was going to school  uh you just didnt get away with things these kids get away with now   umhum   i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principals office and usually bending over to get five of the best   yeah   um but now nowadays they cant even they can barely scold the children for something you you know without getting sued   and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools   oh yeah well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class and uh this kid comes to school with his lunch box and inside this lunch box hes got easily two id say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills   um   and i asked him uh what are you doing with that he says my father gave it to me and i didnt believe it for a minute   umhum   um so uh but uh you know the not a lot i could do about it   right   cant stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants   crazy for him to but   well i have i ive fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing he was a uh well lets just say he was one of those types that you wouldnt doubt that he was selling something   umhum yeah   but not a lot i could do about it   well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there   umhum   and you dont know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was better trying to teach them was better than have them taken out   yeah because uh that just that doesnt do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesnt do anything for them   yeah right uh most the time if they were they were some of them were even better behaved ive only had two instances where i could it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were um i dont know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but it ended up better   uh i dont know guns and   but     i dont know thats something   i think theres a problem too with teachers trying to um to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know theyve been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics   umhum   and uh and im not completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there does does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such   oh yeah yeah oh sure i mean its its its indicative across the board that we weve done something wrong   but right   and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs and you know here we are we cant we cant balance a checkbook without a calculator   umhum   um i dont know   well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and ive seen how their sc hool system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything   umhum   and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be   yeah   so i dont completely agree with that either   no   but there there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere     yeah thats thats a great deal what law schools like   oh is it   yeah   is that what you ended up going into   um yeah   oh   and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester   umhum   and its how well you can remember it all   how how much you can stuff in your brain   yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying   yeah   um i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize   umhum   and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories   umhum   but they couldnt put two and two together as far as the law was concerned   yeah   so uh it didnt show me anything a year and a half i gave it up   yeah   i wasnt really want i didnt want to be a lawyer anyway  just wanted the degree   umhum yeah   so   yeah well   well i dont know what can we do about it   good good question       probably taking   money money is not the answer   no theres plenty of money in the system its just   yeah i mean theyre theyre throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse   i think its uh like a lot of things in the in the the United States weve got so much built up in um in the state in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and theres no way that that can be done   umhum umhum umhum   not without  wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so   yeah yeah   maybe on smaller smaller scales   well i dont know i uh as much as i didnt like school when i was going through it from my perspective now i can see that its a lot better than what we have now   umhum   and i think part of it is that theyve got to give authority back to the local school   yeah   you know i mean its its silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline   umhum right into the classroom it needs to be   yeah exactly i mean i   be able to be enforced   i i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something   umhum   to students because theyre going get theyre going to get complaints or theyre going to get sued or something   its like doctors in lawsuits you know theyre kind of fearful of everything   oh yeah   well lawyers help create that   thats thats true ive well at least ive heard that i i i havent fortunately been in a situation where its been applicable to me but       but   well i think i think i i mean what weve turned the schools into now are just day care centers   umhum   you know somebody okay were going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and hes out of our hair   right   and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents   umhum   you know they just   oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home   oh sure i mean mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you dont get anything anything at home then its its not going to help either   yeah right   so i i dont know i dont know what the i dont know what the answer is   umhum   its an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it   yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that youre teaching them something you have to follow   umhum   a preferred curriculum um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you dont have to   umhum   and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be theyre kind of monitored       you know they they will allow you to i cant think of any examples  but certain religious groups dont want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i dont think theyre is in in this area but   umhum   um they they are monitored by the uh by the state school board   hum   so     thats interesting i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when  some people first tried that and they got sued   umhum   got taken to court by the school system im glad the parents won i mean thats seems silly that uh i mean we started thats the thats the way you got your education in this country   umhum   and then uh
