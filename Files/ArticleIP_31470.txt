                                  And Sos Your Old Man            Stories about Republican Presidentdesignate GeorgeW Bush invariably note that he has spent most of his life doing exactly whathis father former President George HW Bush once did This is not quiteright W has spent most of his life doing exactly what his father did butdoing it worse  He is a chip off the old block chipped            Poppy Bush starred atAndover W lazed his way through the prep school The father motored throughYale in two and a half years earning a Phi Beta Kappa key along the way Theson squeaked through old Eli Poppy like his own father Sen Prescott Bushbefore him captained the Yale baseball team and joined the secret societySkull  Bones W wasnt good enough to play ball for Yale And though hejoined Skull  Bones he whiled away his nights with a much less refinedgroup the harddrinking frat brothers of DKE            The elder Bush enlisted in the Navy in  became theservices youngest fighter pilot flew  missions in the South Pacific wasshot down over enemy waters and won the Distinguished Flying Cross The sonalso became a fighter pilotfor the Texas Air National Guard He spent theVietnam War flying missions over the Texas scrub            W followed his fathers path into the oil businessBoth abandoned New England for West Texas to strike it rich Both relied onrich friends for a head start but whereas the old man scored in his oilfieldsthe son struggled George HW ran for Congress and won George W ran forCongress and lost Come middle age the father threw himself into publicservice UN ambassador China ambassador CIA director The son threw himselfinto baseball as an executive for the Texas Rangers            Americans tend to forgetthe heroic life of President Bush This was one of his unfortunate talents Hecould make the extraordinary seem mundane            There are competing theories about what the sons paleimitation of a rsum signifies The first popular among Gov Bushs fans isthat hes a late bloomer It took him till his mids to settle down but nowthat he has he is making up for his lost years and surpassing the father he hasso long trailed After all he has won a statewide race in Texas twice Poppylost both his statewide campaigns in Texas Junior has already vanquishedformer Texas Gov Ann Richards the woman who ridiculed his father in  Nowhe will topple Al Gore half the team that battered Dad in  The otherless charitable theory surmises that just as W has tried to equal his fatherand fallen short so hell find some way to choke in the presidentialelection            Its far too early to take sides on this questionor to draw grand psychological conclusions about how the father will shadow thesons presidential campaign But there is another way to look at Ws knockoffrsum as a documentary of a generational change in American politics            Brookings Institutionscholar Stephen Hess author of Americas Political Dynasties  notesthat American political dynasties come in all sizes and flavors In some afamily from humble origins uses political success to make itself rich andsnooty In some a dynasty is stolidly consistent across generations The Taftsof Ohio for instance have been steady Republican burghers for more than acentury            The Bushes started as a noblesse oblige dynasty PrescottBush began his forgettable service as a senator only after a long career as agentleman banker He viewed his political activity as an obligation and heinstilled that sentiment in his son George Poppy was dutiful in pursuit ofoffice compiling the requisite experience almost mechanically adding lineafter line to his rsum until America had no choice but to elect himpresident Politics was always a duty never a pleasure Remember the horrorof hearing George Bush ingratiating himself with voters by calling them mymain man and the like            But what began asnoblesse oblige has morphed into something different during this generationThe Bushes are a microcosm of the transformation of Republican politics fromNortheastern elitism to Western populism The sons failure to match his fatherreflects this smallD democratization Bush the elder came of age when NewEngland Republicans led the party and patrician manners were boons to aRepublican But in an era when a politicians ability to communicate trumpsanything else and the balance of Republican power has shifted west the preppyAnglican ethos that defined the old man is suspect George W Bush spent his congressional campaign excusing his fathers membership in the TrilateralCommission In todays politics the sons checkered rsum signifies successBy choosing DKE over Skull  Bones drinking over studying baseball overthe United Nations George W compiled a record that suits our populistage            W has bartered the highstatus accomplishments of hisfather for something more precious regular guyness He is warm and impulsivewhere his father was distant and calculating Every story about the sonapplauds his democratic instincts his ease with all kinds of people hisebullience and physicality his informality His passionate Methodism contrastswith his ancestors chilly Episcopalianism            The Gore dynasty oddly has followed the oppositepath Al Gore Jr has outdone his senator father in the calculus of politicalachievement but the veep is stiff and awkward and dutiful in a way that hisimpulsive backslappy dad never was George W Bush jokes that his fathersidea of a perfect son is Al Gore Jr This may be Americas choice in  theGeorge W Bush who isnt George HW Bush or the Al Gore who is
