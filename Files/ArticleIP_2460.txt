                                 LBJ Sounds Off            The president of the UnitedStates had a problem His pants didnt quite fit That was by no means his onlyproblem It was after all the summer of  Lyndon Baines Johnson had beenpresident for nine months Already he had signed the Civil Rights Actaccelerated the war in Vietnam and watched entire neighborhoods in Harlem goup in smoke Now on Aug  Johnson telephoned Joe Haggar president of aclothing company from the Oval Office If you dont want me running aroundthe White House naked Johnson told Haggar you better get me someclothes            ThenJohnson described in detail how he wanted Haggar to make six new pairs ofpants Now another thing the crotch down where your nuts hang its alwaysa little too tight said Johnson So when you make them up give me an inchwhere I can let it out there because they cut me Theyre just like riding awire fence The image of Johnson in the White House nakedor as hepronounced it nekkidis not one I am anxious to ponder Do your ownpondering click for an audio excerpt Yet it floats up from the sea ofrecently released recordings of conversations that Johnson taped secretly inJuly and August  Most of us who were alive back then remember what thepublic LBJ sounded likeponderous fauxsincere amazingly awkward for a manreputed to be one of the most persuasive politicians of the age The privateLBJ revealed on the tapes may be no more lovable but he is at least moreunderstandable            As I pursue my research on the Johnson family in mycagelike cubbyhole in the LBJ library in Austin Texas I listen to his voiceand remember how it sounded when I was a kid growing up in a forlorn littletimber town in Texas Then Johnson seemed allpowerful Jehovahlike in theexecution of his swift and terrible authority Everything about himhis bodyhis ranch his Lincolns his bear hugs but most of all his voiceseemedridiculously out of proportion Even at  I understood that when the rest ofthe country heard Johnsons voice it thought immediately and bitterly ofTexas where John F Kennedy the president with the graceful voice wasmurdered God I used to think every time Johnson grabbed another microphonewhy does he have to sound like such a hick            His was the unapologeticvoice of those who used to be called yellowdog Democrats country people whobragged that they would rather vote for old yellow dogs than Republicans Texasis mostly urban now and the yellowdog Democrats are all gone doomed toextinctionas Johnson knew they would beby the passage of the Civil RightsAct in  Texas has a Republican governor and it has two Republicans in theUS Senate and for the most part all its people talk as if they grew up inCalifornia and are auditioning for the latest CocaCola commercial We arenthicks anymore            Johnsonwas the last of the really big hicks Yet as you eavesdrop on him inrecordings he left for posterity like Dorothy peeking behind the screen at theWizard you find not a giant but a fearful and uncertain man with a very bigvoice            In a conversation with Bill Moyers July  thepresident sounds like a tyrant one moment a confused child the next Dontjust lope off says an exasperated Johnson speaking to Moyers as if he were ahorse I want to know where I can reach you on a minutes notice Then hisvoice drops an octave or two and he becomes more subdued He warns Moyers notto let the War on Poverty go too far and to keep it out of the hands ofKennedys men Eventually Johnson would go on to surpass the early New Dealbut at this moment he didnt know how to proceed            What hewanted he told Moyers was a poverty program that would hire highschoolstudents who were about to drop out and put them to work picking rocks offhighways or sweeping the floors of government buildings Now I never heard ofany liberal outfits where you could subsidize anybody Johnson tells MoyersIm against all that If you want to do it in the Peace Corps then thatsyour private thing and its the Kennedys but my Johnson program Im againstsubsidizing any private organization Beneath the bellow click  you cantell how baffled he is by the enormity of what he had earlier promised thenationan end to poverty and racial injustice in our timeand picture thedeep furrows of anxiety on his brow            Or listen to him talk with Robert Kennedy whose familystill holds the nation in thrall The conversation took place July   Itwas a courtesy call but tensions between Kennedy and Johnson were at analltime high Kennedy was still attorney general but was pressing to be namedJohnsons running mate in that year Johnson however wanted nothing more thanto dump Bobby He placed the call from his ranch in Johnson City            Higeneral Johnson says straining to be polite Hows Texas asks Kennedyhis accent as thick as his barely concealed resentment toward Johnson Brieflyhe tells Johnson that he believes the Chamber of Commerce in Jackson Misshad agreed to follow the law and desegregate schools but he doesnt reallyseem too interested in the problem The following year Kennedy would becomemore committed to civil rights but in  he was still equivocal partlybecause he was worried about whether Communists had infiltrated the civilrights movement On this particular day he just sounds tired all worn outDo you want to talk to one of your girlfriends he asks Johnson trying toget rid of him            A few seconds later Jackie Kennedy comes onthe line As absurd as it may seem she and Johnson sound like a couple ofsuitors click to listen in on the courtship Did you have a good dayJohnson asks the widow who coos that her day was just fine Johnson then tellsher he has been on his new ski boat all day and has become a little sunburnedYoull look marvelous with a sunburn she tells him sounding all airy andbreathless It is a mesmerizing moment one that shattered my childhoodillusions Clearly the Kennedys loathed Johnson but they were as hypocriticalas he was            Twentyfive days after that conversation Johnson invited Kennedy to the OvalOffice and told him face to face that he didnt want him as a running mate Inlate August Kennedy announced for the US Senate race in New York but notbefore he had had a conversation with Johnson in which he admitted his owninsecurities about making the race I think its damn tough Kennedy toldJohnson sounding whiny Id like to run If I lose then its a reflection onthe whole family            Johnson encouraged Kennedy to run and promised to dowhatever he could to help him Im prepared to say what is desirable hetells him I have said that I highly regard you and that you have a brightfuture and that the things about our relationship were without foundation Youknow New York better than I do It might be desirable for me to say nothingThis was Johnson at his most evocative trying to ease Kennedy out of his waywhile sucking up to him It is the side of Johnson that we are most familiarwith Johnson as the brilliant conniver trying so diligently and withoutsuccess to free himself from the spell of the Kennedys            Hecouldnt free himself of course not from the Kennedys not from anyone Herewas a man who whispered terrible dark things about himself under hisbreath            On Aug  after the Democratic convention hadopened in Atlantic City NJ Johnson then  years old threatened in threerecorded conversations to withdraw from the presidential race Johnson actuallydrafted a withdrawal statement and read it to his press secretary GeorgeReedy To hear Johnson read a statement he never gave click             Thepresident was overcome with doubts which he expressed later that day to WalterJenkins a quiet gentle man who served in effect as his chief of staff Idont think a white Southerner is the man to unite this nation in this hourhe told Jenkins I dont know who is and I dont even want thatresponsibility  Ive had doubts about whether a man born where I was bornraised like I was raised could ever satisfy the Northern Jews Catholics andunion people He worried that he might be going crazy and fretted overrunning against Barry Goldwater I really I do not believe Walter that Ican physically and mentally  Goldwaters had a couple of nervous breakdownsand I dont want to be in this place  and I dont I do not believe I canphysically and mentally carry the responsibilities of the bomb and the worldand the Nigras and the South and so on and so forth To hear Johnson whineclick  To hear him whine some more click             Johnson does not really mean what he is saying of courseIf he had withdrawn from the race Bobby Kennedy would have run somethingJohnsons pride could not have tolerated What he wants from Jenkins is pityFive minutes later in another conversation Johnson can be heard givingJenkins instructions on how he wants Hubert Humphrey to work the floor of theconvention Yet in this conversation with Jenkins it is possible to perceivethe depth of Johnsons despair            I dont see any reason Iought to seek the right to endure the anguish of being here said Johnsontearfully They think I want great power What I want is great solace and alittle love thats all I want He presses down hard on the word love toohard and it comes out in an apoplexy of twang Luv he tells Jenkins alittle luv            You have a lot of that MrPresident Jenkins tells him softly
