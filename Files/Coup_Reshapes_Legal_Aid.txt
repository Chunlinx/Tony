Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles Countysfederally funded legal aid communityThe two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted froma decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doledout by an unsympathetic GOPcontrolled Congress That era wascapped in  when the Legal Services Corp forced  legal aidproviders nationwide to combine into To comply with the orders from their main funding source a newspecies of poverty lawyer emerged  a techsavvy and buttondownbreed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for tollfree phonelines selfhelp kiosks and Internet access to legal adviceWhile some organizations made the dramatic change lookeffortless for others it did not come easy And few programsprovide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls ofgovernmentfunded legal services than Los Angeles Countys twolargest providers of federally funded services  Legal AidFoundation of Los Angeles and Pacoimabased Neighborhood LegalServices of Los Angeles CountyFrom his offices in Koreatown Iwasaki a softspoken formerOMelveny  Myers attorney quietly engineered a merger betweena much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program theLegal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles The merger was completedpeacefully within a year of the federal orderToday the programs operate seamlessly offering new innovations including tollfree multilingual phone advisers expanded hoursfor domesticviolence clinics and renewed immigration and consumeraid  built on the foundations of the old program The organizationis Los Angeles largest governmentfunded group with a budget of million leveraged into  million in legal services to thepoorIwasakis careful respect for the Long Beach program and itslawyers earned him the political capital he needed to complete histakeover in a matter of weeksThe Long Beach program had strong support in the community soin a situation like that one has to recognize that its not like atakeover where I have all the answers and I know best Iwasakisaid The people in the community who are working there have thecontacts and the knowledge that will allow service tocontinueThings have gone less smoothly across town There Dudovitz alongtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San FernandoValleys yearold legal aid program continues to struggle withhis hostile takeover of the neighboring San GabrielPomona Valleysservice area one year after it was accomplishedOn the bright side Dudovitz has extended his respected programto clients in the San GabrielPomona Valley and he now operates ona much larger budget  million last year However his clashwith the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation bitterfeelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused onserving poor peopleIt was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled byeveryone a longtime observer of the public interest communitysaid of the San Fernando ValleySan GabrielPomona Valley mergerThere are very few people who come out as the heroesPersonalities got involved when they shouldnt have Things weresaid that caused bad feelings and couldnt be unsaidIwasakis merger with the smaller yearold Long Beachprogram was friendly and fast and no one  not even Long Beachboard members  lost a jobWhen it was over Iwasaki had  million more in federal dollarsand two new offices Long Beach clients regained services they hadlost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grantsreduced the staff of  lawyers to five and cut immigration andconsumer law programsIwasaki said I judged the transition better than I couldhave hoped forFormer Long Beach Executive Director Toby Rothschild now apolicy wonk in Iwasakis outfit agreedTo some extent I did look at it and say We are the littlestkid on the block and we dont want to get beat up so we need abigger protector Rothschild said Once we got past that itbecame a real positive for the Long Beach program and Long BeachclientsBut to the San GabrielPomona Valley legal aid program thepositives of merging with Dudovitzs program San Fernando ValleyNeighborhood Legal Services were never obviousA meeting in late  between Dudovitz and the SanGabrielPomona Valley programs board showed how little the twoprograms had in common and how difficult bridging the gap betweentheir ideologies would be Dudovitz recalledAlthough no merger plans were discussed board members at thesmaller program knew of Dudovitzs preference for impact litigationover direct servicesWe had a discussion about what our separate views wereDudovitz said The message we got was that they wanted theirprogram to stay as it wasLauralea Saddick former executive director of the SanGabrielPomona Valley program said her board simply did not shareDudovitzs desire to spend money influencing social policy andparticipating in highprofile litigation over povertyrelatedissuesOur boards philosophy was that the money given by the federalgovernment was to help people with basic everyday needs Saddicksaid It might take a little bit of humility to take those kindsof cases Impact work is very important  but what was the goodof getting the law changed if no one is there to help theindividualBefore the San Gabriel program was subsumed by Dudovitzs groupit offered to merge with the Legal Aid Society of Orange CountyThe boards of both organizations eschewed impact litigation infavor of the s model of providing direct client servicesSupported by resolutions from the Pasadena San Gabriel Easternand Foothill bar associations the two programs drew up plans tomerge and submitted them to the Legal Services CorpDudovitz won Iwasakis backing to oppose the deal and LegalServices Corp the national funding source overruled the proposedSan GabrielPomona ValleyOrange County merger On Jan  the federal agency awarded the San GabrielPomona Valley servicearea to Dudovitz under the umbrella of an expanded San Fernandoprogram citing the location of both programs in Los Angeles whichwould allow better coordinated and more effective advocacy oncounty government policiesThe San GabrielPomona Valley program sued Legal Services Corpto stop the takeover claiming the federal program based thedecision on favoritism for the politically active Dudovitz and thepolitically powerful IwasakiThough the federal suit accomplished little it effectivelysuspended the end of the old program and the start of the new onefor nearly a year Hundreds of case files as well as two officesin Pasadena and Pomona remained under the old programs controluntil the litigation ended in August We werent being uncooperative in the matter they were notreasoning the transition out like lawyers former SanGabrielPomona Valley board President Jerome Applebaum saidDuring this period Dudovitz did what he could to claim his newterritory  a huge area bounded by the Ventura Kern SanBernardino and Riverside county lines and state Route  Herenamed his program Neighborhood Legal Services of Los AngelesCountyHe set up a temporary office in El Monte advertised histollfree phone line through the radio local elected officials andthe courts He sent paralegals and staff attorneys to conductseveral daylong educational clinics at local churches schools andcommunitybased organizations And he accepted city officialsinvitations to analyze and comment on a lowincome housingordinance in Pasadena along with other housing advocatesNeighborhood Legal Services participated in several cooperativeefforts with homeless advocacy and health care agencies in his newterritoryDudovitz said that he is halfway to his goal of reorganizing hisnew territoryStill untaken are several steps that required goodwill fromlocal bar associations and others who had opposed thecombinationI am not a fan of Neals admitted John Peck a former boardmember of the San GabrielPomona Valley program and a Pasadena BarAssociation board memberPeck says bad feelings still linger among allies of the oldprogram who feel left outThey really screwed us We had a good program Peck saidAn observer familiar with the reconfiguration debate whorequested anonymity wondered why Dudovitz had not spent more timemending fencesHe ought to be bending over backwards for reconciliation butif you want to do impact work and people in the San Gabriel Valleywant direct services you have to accommodate that or change yourapproach the observer said Neal would never consider doingthatMore than a year after he officially incorporated the SanGabrielPomona Valley Dudovitz had not placed a local resident onthe board of Neighborhood Legal Services or made the rounds of theprivate legal community to recruit the volunteer lawyersOur emphasis has been on having our potential clients knowabout us and deliver services to them Dudovitz said We havedone that spectacularlyHe did not hire any of the old programs nine lawyers and hasyet to permanently place any of his  new hires in the SanGabrielPomona Valley The lack of a legal aid presence in Pomonaprompted the bar association and court officials to start their ownoncemonthly family law clinicAfter learning of the effort Dudovitz sent personnel to staffthe clinic for three hours per week and is helping to write a grantapplication to fund a selfhelp kiosk for Pomona patterned on thecenter he pioneered in Van NuysThe help although late has earned Dudovitz someappreciationThere has been a transition and the clinic has helped to fillsome void said Deni Butler administrator for the EasternDistrict Superior Court But we are working together quite nicelycontrary to what the other side issue isScott Wheeler president of the Eastern Bar Association of LosAngeles and an ally of the old program said he mobilized his members to staff the clinic after watching the ranks of unservedpoor grow over the past yearWe felt we needed to take care of something that haddisappeared We established the program because we were concernedabout the changeover Wheeler saidWhile acknowledging that building the new program from theground up has been slow going Dudovitz expects to serve up to percent more clients in the San GabrielPomona Valley than hispredecessorsOf the  to  million people who are eligible for legalaid services in his combined area Dudovitz estimated that he willserve more than  annually During his first year in the newterritory he served  in the program  a  percent increaseover his caseload for San Fernando alone Dudovitz saidThe reality is we have to make the transition step by stepDudovitz said We need to establish some infrastructure before wego out One of the worse things that you can do is promise servicesthat we cant deliverDuring his year tenure as a public interest lawyer Dudovitzhas proved that he can deliver on some of the Legal ServicesCorps key objectivesBy  he had diversified funding sources for his thenmillion budget so that just  percent came from federal programsHe got the rest from private funds and state and local governmentcontracts and grantsHe hoped to do the same thing for the San GabrielPomona Valleyprogram whose  million budget was derived almost entirely ofLegal Services Corp grantsHe had learned the importance of reputation to private sectorfundraising after the Federal Emergency Management Agency citedhis program before Congress for excellence in cases stemming fromthe  Northridge earthquakeAfter that we were able to raise funds he said Peoplegenerally want to give to programs that do quality work becausethey get results We are creative and effective advocatesCompetitive bidding also became easier with a reputation to backup his grant proposals and Dudovitz soon was raising enough todevelop slick promotional materials and to share funds with otherpublic interest programs to cement collaborative efforts on healthcare policy advocacy homelessness domesticviolence assistanceselfhelp and technology developmentHe developed a reputation as an innovator with amultimilliondollar grant from the California Endowment to fund acountywide health advocacy program called Health Consumer Center ofLos AngelesThe yearold program connected  poor people with healthcare and earned Dudovitz entre to legislative committees andelected officials grappling with how to provide medical servicesfor the poorLong before Legal Services Corp advised legal aid programs torecruit more privatesector attorneys Dudovitz in  establisheddomesticviolence clinics in four San Fernando Valley courthousesin a partnership with the local bar associationHe tapped that relationship again in  to create twoselfhelp legal access centers one at the Van Nuys courthouse andthe other at James Monroe High School in North Hills  where legalmagnet students assist pro per defendantsOne of the things that is clear is that we could throw  or lawyers out there and we could never approach the need in regardsto providing oneonone service Dudovitz said But we can beeffective if we are thoughtful about how we employ staff and thebalance of the service we provideDudovitz acknowledged that the acrimonious transition may nothave been ideal for clients but said the range of services nowavailable to them will more than compensate for any lapse ofservicesAlthough he lauds his counterpart Iwasaki and the Long Beachcommunity for their ideal marriage Dudovitz had no regrets abouthis own stormy rise to powerThey were one of probably a handful of places in the countrywhere that happened he said We have an opportunity to grow aprogram based on  years of experience  we arent stuck with theold way Thats an opportunity that very few people have had
