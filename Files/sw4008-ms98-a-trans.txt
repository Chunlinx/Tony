        so um do you have a PC     yes i have a Macintosh SE thirty   umhum yeah one of my friends are into Macintoshes i have a um PC my a IBM PC myself   umhum   a two eighty six but im probably eventually gonna get a three eighty six um   what do you use yours for mostly   um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal uh   uhhuh   but im um i think eventually ill start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for   well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh im just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now ive just today ordered a fax modem so ill be able to   umhum   send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you dont have to make a hard copy that way     umhum   uh are you using windows   no i i think i im planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to Windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah   uhhuh uhhuh well its getting to be more and more like a Macintosh   yeah its just um i want it i want it you know well  i just i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a Macintosh um   umhum well the one thing i used to use a ive never used an IBM actually i used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now   umhum yeah i used thats what i learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school   but i dont have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now i dont have uh any compilers   umhum umhum   so im uh  wanting   well do you use your computer for uh just things around the house or in the in the   i use it in my business   i see what do you do   i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs   oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um are they are they based on on a on a um other language or are they based are are they based like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world and the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding   thats uh exactly what yeah thats the kind of thing im working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that   umhum well it was just uh when i was high school i worked for the community school and they had a English second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time   umhum   imagine its a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you dont have as many cues you cant dont have hand gestures and things like that   right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive   umhum umhum   and then i use it for testing uh data analysis on testing so   oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that   well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh   umhum   you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing   umhum   and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones arent find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so its involves a lot of spread sheet use   umhum yeah id imagine so um so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E   well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly  and with smaller files  i cant believe you know ive got uh       five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two E i had a hundred twenty eight K   umhum it its amazing yes it its amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a TRS eighty with four K on it     yeah   and you know and then then i moved and then i started playing with Apples you know and and those had forty eight or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four K you know   oh the old the old Apple uh the the the original Apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didnt it   uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them       is all and theres i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight K and there was only one computer that had forty eight K on it at the time   my goodness uhhuh   and you know its just so amazing that generally you know if you if you im not sure about about um Macintoshes but i know in IBMs you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time     umhum   you know thats thats your low thats the low end um   well the SE thirty goes up to eight   umhum   but i havent upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i dont know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory   umhum yeah imagine just to support
