        okay     well   well what kind of music did you all listen to   oh my goodness now see we think of classic rock that they you know have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul i mean it was   uhhuh   thats a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles i mean we were there   no now well then you was in the uh or i am sorry i am going to make you sound like youre eighty something   yeah i was well i was i was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out i fourteen years old Woodstock   okay Woodstock what was yeah what was you doing during Woodstock   well i wanted to go i was in Chicago and i guess i was close to eighteen or something i i it was like i think the summer between my uh high school and college somewhere around in there i cant quite remember the year and um   umhum you would have had a ball   uh yeah   i i kind of liked would have liked to have been there   we couldnt we couldnt get it together to drive i mean you know wed never driven outside of you know ten miles out of town at that time and here we were all hep to go to Woodstock you know   yeah dont you wish youd been able to though   i really do you   oh that would have been such a great memory   it would have been incredible i i think of um you know all the social changes that were going on around that time   yeah   and and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising peoples consciousness everything from well i mean i remember we had the first Earth Day back then you know we got out of school at at uh the university and we celebrated Earth Day   yeah you went and planted a tree or something   yeah planted trees and stuff and we didnt realize you know the implications of all that then and a lot of the stuff that goes on today   well well growing up with when i grew up it just wasnt we did not have any causes   well   to me it didnt doesnt seem like weve got much you know what i mean   well you do youll you i mean there was there was no name to it it was everything that was started in the sixties you had you had to fight for racial equality   well i do remember demonstrations over busting   and busting themselves it was like just a continuum you know everything sort of had a seed in the sixties and womens rights i mean things for women were totally different for you by that time   yeah well right by the time i was born even now you know womens rights uh we just   just assume   we are totally equal now there is not really a lot to fight for now i saw something on TV last night on Twenty Twenty you know men uh fathers or daddies now wait a minute daddies are people too it is about a lot of men you know all right   yeah   going through divorces the judge will usually uh give custody to the mother ninety seven percent of the time because they go through the female and   yeah well we learned that from Kramer versus Kramer didnt we   yeah  something like that but it does seem you know   it seems unfair   yeah it really does   but it see men are coming into their own now too   yeah they are well i thought about that i thought well now men you know have to fight to be equal and i think thats only right though really he one guy said the judge looked at him and said well now mister so and so he says ive have never seen uh calves follow a bull they always follow the heifer that is why i always he said that is why i always give custody to the mama       and he said well he said does that mean you are going to shoot them if they break a leg and you know butcher them if they get fat he said my kids are not cattle     yeah   you know but that that is the way most people feel that women should get custody   well are you married and do you have children   yeah i am married and ive got two kids   two kids and and how does your husband respond to all the new social um changes   my husband is not a conformist at all he is still back there in the seventies   well see bless his heart you know  um   well i mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jeans not bell bottoms but flared pants and       and he well i do not like them but you know to him   theyre going to be back in style any day now   yeah any day now  well he just you know he is he is his own person he you know he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes but he wears what clothes he wants to which we are both that way   oh   if something is out of style i dont really care if i like it im gonna wear it   yeah   but uh my husband is not a conformist at all   oh well see that thats the spirit of the sixties and whether we are talking about the rain forests i tell you you know the situation you have right now and and all of our generations is what to do with the children because both   uhhuh   mother and father have to work now   well uh we are trying to keep away from that my husband works for the railroad we have got it real tight but ive got a four month old baby and i do not want to work i want to tend to her i want to raise my kids   oh okay thats thats see that is your commitment you do not know what you are changing when you do something like that you dont understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent   umhum well right well when he grew up he grew up with his we both grew up with single mothers   ah   and my mom had six kids   uhhuh   so she had to work and you know i was raised by my sisters and stuff and i can i cant see the difference but i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us   that one person that you could always count on being there   right right and my husband was the same way and we just i want to raise my kids i do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them   well   i want to be there to make sure that well they need guidance and they do need parental guidance   they definitely do   twenty four hours a day   they definitely do i   do you stay home with yours   uh well see i if i had some i would i i havent i had an unfortunate thing happen and im you know and it is not going to happen that way but my my uh friends are having babies right and left so i get to see the different ways that they   uhhuh they raise them   um all raise them and and one gal she started a business in her home and she she hired an au pair which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house   well but see now   and the guy lives in with her you know i mean you know it is a family sort of unit sort of thing and the   yeah okay sweetie let mommy talk   and so   well i think thats neat   so that is a different way and then my other girlfriend just you know tears her hair out and goes at it you know twenty four hours a day watching both kids all the time and i think there is a point where you just have to get away   right   and its good for the kid and it is good for you to develop you know your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time   umhum well i know the family is really going through changes but now were trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home   yeah   or that what do they call it the nuclear family yeah but uh   yeah do you have any um do you have your mom or anybody around you that helps you   um well my family is Kentucky now my my one of my sisters is down here her husband happened to get a job at TI they moved out here but well his family lives here and my husband was in the service when i met him   yeah umhum   and so we weve been all over  okay Kyle   he sunburn in the kitchen so i keep having to scratch his back     oh   the uh i would love to get a business going out of my home outside of i mean going   right   yeah id would work at home if i could   well thats well see and and that is uh the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home   yeah thats the trend yeah they are bringing offices i mean just i mean big businesses into their homes bringing their computers home and working from there   right and i think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we have into what that whole system is going to look like because thats thats our choice now too thats thats our cause   well i think for i think one that would be uh its uh kids could see their parents you know how hard they work   yeah   they would understand more when uh we first moved down here i was working i was working a twelve hour shift it was three and four days a week   umhum   and uh oh my little boy just   oh   he went wild you know i mean because because he had been used to me   being there all the time yeah   being there all the time yeah and hes just now well when i got pregnant i went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home and it was costing too much at home than more at home than i was bringing in so   yeah see the the the economic situation on the whole thing and then uh well its see we do have things that were  concerned about here this generation i dont know   uhhuh   social change is always going to go on but i think we have taken a big leap in the last you know twenty thirty years and um nothing is the same   no it seems like its totally different of course i do not have much to compare it to to me our causes dont seem as important as you alls were do you know what i mean   well yeah but we we grew we passed them on to you you know i mean i said we passed them on to you i mean you know because it takes a lot of hard work it takes writing letters to congressmen and   you you what we passed them on to us   and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future and and u you know um did we make the right choices we do not know we will never know   no   i mean you know i i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today yeah i think we made some big wrong choices and i think business got in the way i think the greed of the eighties got   okay yeah
