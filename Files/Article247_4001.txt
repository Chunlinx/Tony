                                    Three decades after enduring one of the more agonizing rituals ofadolescence Chatterbox has no difficulty recognizing in Dr Josh Spritzerthevaguely caddish Beverly Hills orthodontist who seduces and abandons AdeleAugust played by Susan Sarandon in the justreleasedmovieChatterboxs own orthodontist By this Chatterbox doesnt meanthat Simpsons novel captures certain universal truths about BeverlyHills orthodontists Rather Chatterbox means that Simpson captures onespecific Beverly Hills orthodontist named Nathan Seltzer who straightenedChatterboxs teeth during the Nixon administration                           Anywhere But Here is of course a novel and a very good one themovie is only soso That said it should be noted that Simpson like mostpeople who create works of the imagination has been suspected now and then ofdrawing on the lives of real people Her mother Joanne Simpson is widelyassumed to be a prototype for Adele August the exuberantly selfish mother inAnywhere But Here  her brother Apple Computers Steve Jobs issimilarly thought to be a prototype for Tom Owens the biotech mogul in herlast novel A Regular Guy  To read an ambivalent

has likelygiven any consideration to Simpsons apparent use of Dr Nathan Seltzer as aprototype for Dr Josh Spritzer Here is how in the novel Adele Augustdescribes to her teenage daughter Ann her first date with Dr Spritzer thescene in the movie is nearly identical                                             He did something last night that grownups do sometimes that show youreally really care about someone                              What               Oh honey its something adults do in bed But not many people ever do itIt means you really really like the woman Youll know when youre older Itjust means theyre really really serious about you They wouldnt do it withjust any woman                        But a few chapters later Ann overhears her mother talking on the phone toDr Spritzer and                                             I could tell from the way her voice rose in waves of enthusiasmtoo muchmusic nerve and lightthat Josh Spritzer didnt want to be listening Herbreath gathered as she began each sentence                                       A few chapters after that Adele is taking Ann on rides past Dr Spritzersapartment and saying things like Id like to tell his psychiatrist a thing ortwo A few chapters after that Ann observes Josh Spritzer seemed to bedropping my mother And a few chapters after that he does In the movie DrSpritzer hangs up on Adele the morning after their first date because she tellshim she loves him            Although Dr Spritzers reluctance to get enmeshed in Adele Augusts life ispresented in both book and movie as entirely rational given Adeles extremeneediness both emotional and financialAnn cant wait to be old enough toleave homethere is also the sense in both the book and the movie that DrSpritzer is a little bit of a jerk Since first encountering the novel a dozenyears ago Chatterbox has assumed the sexual relationship in the book wasentirely made up but nevertheless has wondered how Dr Seltzer felt aboutbeing portrayed as a loveemandleaveem s swinger Chatterbox figuredDr Seltzer would be flattered to be described in the book as handsome andeven more flattered by the hunky portrayal of him in the movie by an actornamed Hart Bochner But Chatterbox also figured Dr Seltzer wouldconsider the moral dimension of the Dr Spritzer character somewhat wantingHere was a man whod devoted his life to making crooked thingsstraight  Was Simpson taking something straight the uprightnessof Dr Nathan Seltzerand making it crooked  The more he thought aboutit the more it seemed to Chatterbox that Dr Seltzer no less than LisaBrennanJobs had a right to tell his side of the story            The morning after seeing the movie Chatterbox excitedly rang up DrSeltzers office where according to the phone book Dr Seltzer was stillstraightening teeth on Wilshire Boulevard But the receptionist who answeredannounced the office as that of another orthodontist named Joseph Cannon DrSeltzer she explained had passed on eight or nine years agopossibly noteven aware of the literary fame that Simpson had foisted upon him
