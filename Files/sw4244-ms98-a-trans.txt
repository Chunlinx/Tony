                     okay i think were all set there hopefully      well uh care of the elderly is something that is hitting pretty close to home at me uh right now my fatherinlaw has uh been diagnosed with terminal cancer and my motherinlaw is in a wheel chair so this is something that ive been thinking quite a bit about lately and uh im i feel pretty strongly and the rest of my family does that is long as someone is able to care for uh someone else that they shouldnt be put in a home but theres theres a very hard question of of what happens when someone isnt able to provide that care for themselves um in the case of my motherinlaw shes not able to to bathe herself but shes sharp as a tack at this point and what sort of facilities are available for that person its hard because you think of a home and youre really thinking of of uh old people left somewhere to uh you know fairly forgotten and thats thats thats a hard thing and im sure not all of them are like that   well unfortunately thats the typical picture though      yeah        so its its very hard to find a facility that would allow uh allow someone of fair degree of autonomy in their life but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services      is your motherinlaw currently uh living in a nursing home or anything   no shes not um        shes still at home and her son has has moved back into the house uh which which was not as inconvenient as it sounds because uh um my fatherinlaw and my brotherinlaw have a dental lab in the basement so he was working out of the house anyway uh so it its a little less uh its its not all that inconvenient for him but the rest of the kids are scattered uh throughout the northeast and he doesnt want to feel that hes uh hes going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my inlaws      have you guys thought about the financial burden of caring for your motherinlaw as far as putting her in a nursing home down the road   that that has weve all thought about that fortunately uh that doesnt seem to be a big problem but        that we theres some thought that has to be given to to uh to the property for instance they have about four three or four acres in Connecticut and what no one wants to see is uh that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what wed like to do is uh find the sort of place where i try described before where  shed be able to have uh a place of her own but yet also have someone come in a couple of times a day to help her with various various things and have someone there in case she falls or something      well my mother my grandmother is in a place similar to that where she has emergency buttons throughout the throughout the house or actually the apartment   umhum      and shes about eighty one and she lives she has her own little area for gardening and so forth its in the  housing authority up here   umhum      and its   thats great      when she first moved up here she ended up living in  uh tall apartment building a complex that was very similar to a hospital   umhum      a very negative feeling when you walked in the building   right   and now shes been very fortunate        in that shes almost almost like living in a small home   thats thats great   and she she still has an a large maintenance staff take care of the place look after her        provide uh basic busing services and travel   umhum             uh   im hoping that the trend is toward places like that        as the population in America uh lives for a longer period of time uh i i guess thirty years ago when when you were that age and you werent able to really care for yourself you really werent going to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required was was different but now people are are living longer and can uh can have injury
