                    Background        The lower urinary tract serves to store and periodically        eliminate urine The activity of the urinary bladder and        the external urethral sphincter must be properly        coordinated in order for continence to be maintained and        timely micturition to occur Effective micturition requires        the coordination of central and peripheral nervous system        structures that activate sympathetic parasympathetic and        somatic motor pathways innervating the bladder and the        urethra for a recent review see            Pathophysiological conditions and pharmacological        manipulations that affect central andor peripheral nervous        system structures involved in micturition may alter the        function of these two organs            Atypical antipsychotic neuroleptic agents are favored        over traditional antipsychotic medication eg        haloperidol because of their lower incidence of        extrapyramidal side effects their greater efficacy in        improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia and their        effectiveness in treating schizophrenic patients not        responding to conventional neuroleptics     However        side effects continue to pose a challenge to effective        treatment     These novel neuroleptics display a        complex pharmacological profile with affinities for several        receptor systems but are generally characterized by a        greater affinity for the HTA receptor than for the        target of the traditional neuroleptics the D receptor                    We have shown recently that the atypical antipsychotic        clozapine and to a lesser extent haloperidol markedly        influenced several micturition parameters in anesthetized        rats     Clozapine decreased the micturition volume        while increasing bladder capacity thus increasing residual        volume     Moreover clozapine profoundly depressed the        activity of the external urethral sphincter EUS        Clozapine abolished the electromyogram EMG recorded from        the EUS during the rising phase of a bladder contraction        before urine is voided similar to the guarding reflex             In addition clozapine also abolished the high        frequency oscillations in the bladder pressure and        accompanying bursts in the external urethral sphincter EMG        that are present during the expulsion phase of the        micturition profile of the rat     In the clinical        literature clozapine therapy is associated with a high        incidence up to  in a recent study     of urinary        incontinence and enuresis        Olanzapine is a newer atypical antipsychotic agent with        a pharmacological profile very similar to that of clozapine            In human brain tissue olanzapine displays very        high affinity for the H histamine receptor high affinity        for HTA and HTC receptors     In addition it        also shows affinity for D muscarinic and alpha        receptors with lower affinity for alpha HTD and        HTA receptors Table             Olanzapine therapy is associated with a number of side        effects including somnolence agitation nervousness        headaches dizziness weight gain constipation and dry        mouth     Olanzapine however does not produce        extrapyramidal side effects postural hypotension or        hemotoxicity a particular problem for patients on        clozapine therapy     Although urinary retention as a        result of olanzapine therapy may be predicted from binding        studies due to olanzapines antimuscarinic activity           only  case report of micturition disturbance associated        with olanzapine has recently appeared     On the other        hand several reports of urinary disturbances due to        clozapine can be found in the clinical literature                     Risperidone another novel atypical neuroleptic shows        very high affinity for HTA receptors with lower affinity        for D receptors In terms of profile risperidone binds        HTAalphaHDalpha Table              Risperidone displays little or no affinity for the        muscarinic receptor      and yet risperidone        therapy has been associated with urinary incontinence         in some cases              We undertook this study to examine the effects of        olanzapine and risperidone on the cystometrogram of        anesthetized rats These two novel atypical neuroleptic        compounds are used in clinical practice and it might be        important to identify possible side effects that may have        an impact on compliance to therapy or adversely affect the        patients quality of life eg persistent urinary        incontinence Based on our previous findings with        clozapine and given the similarity in pharmacological        profiles between olanzapine and clozapine we hypothesized        that olanzapine might also result in changes in urodynamic        variables andor external urethral sphincter EMG        Risperidone provides an interesting comparison to        olanzapine since it has a similar pharmacological profile        to olanzapine but without the antimuscarinic activity In        this study olanzapine had greater effects than risperidone        but both decreased micturition volume and increased        residual volume in anesthetized rats In addition they        inhibited the activity of the external urethral sphincter        Olanzapine but not risperidone also had peripheral        effects that reduced bladder contraction amplitude to        electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve                    Results                  Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on single          cystometry parameters Tables and           Olanzapine had no effect on bladder capacity Fig A          and risperidone increased BC only at the highest dose           mgkg Fig IJ A when the bladder capacity was           ml SEM   Table  compared to  ml           for vehicleinjected control          Micturition volume however was decreased by both          olanzapine and risperidone The mean micturition volume          in the olanzapine group after administration of vehicle          was  ml  However after  and  mgkg          the micturition volume dropped to  ml  and           ml  respectively Fig B Table           Similarly the risperidone group had a mean micturition          volume of  ml  after vehicle injection but          there was a significant decrease to  ml  and           ml  after  and  mgkg of risperidone          Fig B Table  At  mgkg of risperidone the          micturition volume was  ml   which was not          statistically different from the control values          Consequently the residual volume showed significant          increases after  and  mgkg doses of olanzapine             and    respectively Fig C and after all          doses of risperidone maximal effect at  mgkg             Fig C          Olanzapine had no effect on pressure threshold          however risperidone at  and  mgkg resulted in a          significant increase in the pressure threshold             and    mm Hg respectively Fig A          compared to the value observed during administration of          vehicle    mm Hg The peak pressure during          contraction was not changed by any of the doses of          olanzapine tested in this study Fig B Interestingly           mgkg of risperidone showed a modest but          statistically significant increase in peak contraction          pressure    mm Hg compared to control value of             mm Hg Fig B          The contraction time was not affected by either          olanzapine or risperidone Fig A but the expulsion          time the time during which the HFO occur was          significantly decreased by both Fig  Fig  Fig          B Olanzapine decreased the expulsion time from            sec after vehicle injection to   and           sec after  and  mgkg respectively Fig B The          risperidone group had an expulsion time of            sec after control and it decreased to   and            sec after  and  mgkg of risperidone Fig          B At  mgkg of risperidone the expulsion time was             sec          Similarly olanzapine significantly decreased the          amplitude of high frequency oscillations HFO from a          control value of   to   mm Hg at           mgkg and abolished the HFO in all animals tested at           mgkg Fig  C Risperidone also reduced the          amplitude of the HFO from   to              and    mm Hg after   and  mgkg          of risperidone Fig  C                          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on the          external urethral sphincter Tables and           The EMG recorded from the urethral sphincter during          bladder contractions also showed changes after          risperidone or olanzapine Phase  of the EMG occurring          during the initial rise in bladder pressure during a          contraction was significantly decreased by olanzapine at           and  mgkg to   and   percent of the          control value Fig FH A However risperidone had          no significant effect on the EMG during phase  Fig          A          Phase  which corresponds to the occurrence of high          frequency oscillations showed significant decreases in          the integrated EMG following olanzapine or risperidone          administration  mgkg of olanzapine significantly          decreased the overall EMG during this phase to            of the control value and  mgkg of          olanzapine abolished the bursting pattern of EMG Fig          GH Fig B While risperidone also decreased the          Phase  EMG the maximal decrease was   at           mgkg when compared to control Fig B and the bursting          pattern was not abolished At  mgkg of risperidone          the phase  EMG was     and was not significantly          different from vehicle          Phase  of the EMG during a bladder contraction also          showed significant changes following olanzapine or          risperidone Fig C Both drugs significantly decreased          the amount of integrated EMG but  mgkg olanzapine had          a more profound effect Fig C reducing the EMG to             of the control value at  mgkg compared to             of control after a similar dose of risperidone          At  mgkg of risperidone the EMG was     of          vehicle          Finally while risperidone had no effect on the          amplitude of the EMG bursts occurring the expulsion phase          Fig  Fig D olanzapine abolished bursting of the EMG          at  mgkg in all animals tested Fig H D                          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on blood          pressure          Both olanzapine and risperidone decreased mean          arterial pressure MAP in anesthetized rats Fig           Risperidone produced significant effects at all the doses          tested with a maximum drop in MAP of approximately  mm          Hg at  mgkg Mean   mm Hg SEM  Olanzapine          showed a significant decrease in MAP at  mgkg with a          maximum drop of approximately  mm Hg Mean              mm Hg In two animals where olanzapine was administered          at  mgkg there was no further reduction in MAP Mean              mm Hg however significant respiratory          depression was observed and therefore we excluded this          dose for the remaining animals receiving olanzapine                          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on bladder          contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the          pelvic nerve          Prolonged electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve          elicits a sustained bladder contraction with two          components An initial rise in bladder pressure Phase I          Fig A that is resistant to muscarinic blockade and a          sustained part of the contraction Phase II or plateau          phase that is very sensitive to antimuscarinic agents               Olanzapine at  and  mgkg reduced the          amplitude of Phase I to  and  of the control values          respectively Fig AB Risperidone on the other hand          significantly increased the amplitude of phase I after           mgkg  of control          The plateau phase or phase II of the pelvic nerve          induced bladder contraction was significantly reduced by          olanzapine Fig A C At  and  mgkg the response          was  and  of the control values respectively          Risperidone had no effect on Phase II amplitude Fig A          C                            Discussion                  Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on urodynamic          parameters and the external sphincter EMG          Both olanzapine and risperidone are compounds with          relatively high oral bioavailability Clinically          effective doses of olanzapine  mgday           ngml plasma concentration       or risperidone           mgday  ngml combined plasma concentration          of risperidone and hydroxyrisperidone              correspond well with the dose of  mgkg equivalent to           ngml in the present study          Both neuroleptics markedly decreased the micturition          volume expulsion time and amplitude of the HFO while          residual volume increased Most of the effects of either          neuroleptic occurred at doses of  and  mgkg          Olanzapine appeared to have a greater maximal effect than          risperidone At the highest dose of risperidone           mgkg there was less of an effect for the urodynamic          parameters mentioned above This is an interesting          observation that was not explored further in the present          study The physiological significance is unclear since          the  mgkg dose is well above the clinically effective          doses of risperidone          Olanzapine did not have an effect on bladder capacity          or pressure threshold while risperidone increased both          although only at the highest doses Clozapine on the          other hand was observed previously to increase bladder          capacity and pressure threshold      Olanzapine had          no effect on bladder peak pressure during contraction and          only the highest dose of risperidone showed an increase          in pressure  of control The increase in pressure          after the highest dose of risperidone was interesting and          was also observed following electrical stimulation of the          pelvic nerve suggesting a possible peripheral          mechanism          Olanzapine but not risperidone decreased the          integrated EMG recorded during the beginning of a bladder          contraction Phase  comparable to the guarding reflex          Both neuroleptics decreased the EMG during phase  where          high frequency oscillations occur in the bladder pressure          along with bursting in the EUS with the highest dose of          olanzapine  mgkg abolishing the HFO and the          bursting pattern The integrated EMG recorded during the          end of the bladder contraction Phase  was also          decreased by both neuroleptics with olanzapine reducing          it to  and  at  and  mgkg respectively          whereas the maximal effect for risperidone was observed          at  mgkg           Finally neither neuroleptic decreased the amplitude          of the individual bursts of EMG recorded during phase           except for the largest dose of olanzapine  mgkg that          abolished the bursting pattern          Therefore as was the case for urodynamic parameters          although both neuroleptics decreased the activity of the          external urethral sphincter as reflected in the          integrated EMG it appears that the effects of          olanzapine were greater than those of risperidone As was          the case for some urodynamic parameters the highest dose          of risperidone showed a parabolic effect for some of the          EMG parameters          Blockade of the external urethral sphincter in          anesthetized rats results in a disappearance of the HFO          from the bladder pressure recording as well as a          disappearance of the bursting pattern of the EUS EMG          observed during HFO       In addition there is          a decreased ability of the bladder to empty as evidenced          by a decreased micturition volume and an increased          residual volume       Therefore inhibition of          the external urethral sphincter as was the case for the          two neuroleptics in the present study and also for          clozapine in our earlier study     might provide an          important mechanism by which the bladder is rendered less          effective in emptying and therefore altering other          urodynamic variables resulting in decreased micturition          volume and increased residual volume in rats                          Possible neuropharmacological mechanisms for the          effect of olanzapine and risperidone on the lower urinary          tract          We tested for peripheral antimuscarinic actions of          both neuroleptics by examining their effects on bladder          contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the          pelvic nerve In this preparation olanzapine but not          risperidone reduced the initial contraction amplitude          Phase I somewhat and markedly depressed the prolonged          contraction phase Phase II Fig  that is thought to          be mediated by muscarinic receptors      During          cystometry however neither olanzapine nor risperidone          affected the peak pressure during bladder contraction          Therefore although olanzapine had a peripheral effect on          bladder contraction amplitude as might be expected from          its antimuscarinic effects this effect is not reflected          in the peak contraction pressures observed during          cystometry This discrepancy is probably due to the fact          that during a bladder contraction against a closed outlet          electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve higher          pressures were developed than were observed during          cystometry when the outlet was not obstructed Since the          clinically effective dose of olanzapine  mgday           ngml plasma concentration       is          greater than the first dose observed to produce          significant peripheral antimuscarinic effects in this          study  mgkg equivalent to  ngml plasma          concentration a possible peripheral antimuscarinic on          the bladder during olanzapine therapy remains a          concern          Muscarinic blockade with atropine decreased          micturition pressure and micturition volume while          increasing residual volume    and bladder capacity              Similarly central administration of atropine          decreased peak pressure and voiding efficiency while          increasing bladder capacity in awake rats     Thus          it is possible that central andor peripheral muscarinic          blockade by olanzapine may have contributed to some of          the changes observed in these parameters in the present          study          Muscarinic blockade was also reported to decrease the          EUS EMG in all phases of the bladder contraction              However another study showed no effect on the EUS EMG          following muscarinic antagonism     Therefore the          exact role of muscarinic blockade on the activity of the          EUS in the rat is unclear          It is tempting to propose that the greater effect of          olanzapine on the EUS may be due to its antimuscarinic          activity which risperidone does not have In fact          clozapine has a greater affinity for muscarinic receptors          than olanzapine    and clozapine was also able to          decrease the EMG and abolish the bursting pattern during          phase           Whether muscarinic blockade affects the activity of          the EUS by acting on central or peripheral sites remains          to be determined A direct inhibitory action of          olanzapine on the EUS muscle itself is not expected and          was not seen with clozapine     However          antimuscarinic effects alone cannot account for all of          the effects of olanzapine on the EUS since risperidone          had a similar effect although not quite as pronounced and          risperidone has little or no affinity for muscarinic          receptors     Therefore antagonism of other          transmitter systems eg D alpha HT remains as          an explanation of the effects of these neuroleptics on          urodynamic variables              Selective antagonism of D receptors only modestly          reduced the amplitude of HFO without affecting any other          urodynamic parameters      Therefore it is          possible that olanzapine and risperidone decrease the          amplitude of the HFO at least partly through antagonism          of D receptors          In anesthetized rats doxazosin alpha  adrenergic          receptor antagonist administered systemically increased          micturition volume bladder capacity residual volume and          micturition frequency while decreasing peak pressure              Only an increase in the micturition frequency was          observed after spinal administration of doxazosin              Both olanzapine and risperidone have moderate affinity          for the alpha  adrenergic receptor Table  therefore          it is possible that some of the effects observed in the          present study were due to central andor peripheral          antagonism of alpha  adrenergic receptors by these          drugs The decreases observed in MAP suggest a possible          peripheral alpha effect However we did not observe a          decrease in the peak pressure as would have been          predicted from previous studies using selective alpha           antagonism     In addition bladder capacity was not          affected except at the highest dose of risperidone          tested Urinary incontinence as a result of olanzapine             or clozapine    therapy was treated effectively          with ephedrine alpha adrenergic receptor agonist          suggesting a possible alpha effect However          alphaaadrenoceptor gene polymorphism was found to play          no role in clozapineinduced urinary incontinence                       In terms of the effects on the EUS alpha           antagonists have been shown to inhibit the EUS in the cat               but not in the anesthetized rat              Finally both olanzapine and risperidone posses          affinities to several serotonin receptor subtypes Table           In cats serotonin antagonists caused a decrease in          bladder capacity    however in anesthetized rats          serotonin antagonism did not have an effect on          micturition     Recently a selective HTA          receptor antagonist WAY was reported to inhibit          bladder contractions in rats    yet another report          only observed an increase in the pressure threshold              Olanzapine and risperidone have only low to modest          affinity for the HTA receptor and higher affinities          for the HTA and HTC receptors      Serotonin          HT and HT receptors facilitate pudendal reflexes in          the cat      therefore it is possible that          antagonism of these receptors may block the EUS in the          anesthetized rat Given the modest role of serotonin          receptors in micturition in anesthetized rats it remains          to be determined whether the effects observed here were          due to antiserotonergic effects of these          neuroleptics                          Clinical implications          While there are several reports of urinary          disturbances following clozapine therapy                there are relatively few reports of urinary incontinence          with risperidone or olanzapine In one report          twentyeight  of patients on risperidone developed          at least transient urinary incontinence compared to           before starting treatment     Other reports also          suggest urinary incontinence associated with risperidone          therapy               To date only one case report of urinary incontinence          with olanzapine therapy that resolved with ephredrine was          found in the literature     In the present study          olanzapine had more profound effects on urodynamic          parameters and the EUS than risperidone and therefore the          incidence of urinary disturbances in clinical practice          would be predicted to be higher Olanzapine is a newer          compound than clozapine or risperidone and therefore a          larger incidence of urinary symptoms with olanzapine          therapy may await a larger sampling          Finally possible side effects of neuroleptics such          as urinary retention may be predicted from binding          studies using human brain tissue    if antimuscarinic          affinities will correspond to antimuscarinic effects on          the bladder However olanzapine and risperidone may also          result in urinary disturbances by their influence on          central pathways mediating bladder contractions or          coordinating external urethral sphincter as may have          been the case in the present study Such effects may not          be readily apparent or predictable from receptor binding          studies                            Conclusions        Olanzapine and to a lesser extent risperidone altered        several micturition parameters and they inhibited the        external urethral sphincter in the anesthetized rat These        effects resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the        bladder to empty as evidenced by a decreased micturition        volume and an increase in the residual volume and a        decreased activity of the external urethral sphincter        Although olanzapine also showed peripheral antimuscarinic        effects on bladder contractions risperidone did not        Therefore peripheral antimuscarinic effects alone cannot        explain all the changes observed with these drugs and they        might reflect central effects on micturition pathways                    Materials and Methods                  Urodynamic Studies          The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to          air pressure for  minutes before beginning each          cystometrogram Room temperature saline was infused into          the bladder  mlmin while recording bladder          pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction          occurred Volume expelled was determined by placing          cotton gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before          and after micturition External urethral sphincter EMG          EUSEMG was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and          for sometime after the filling had stopped Cumulative          doses of olanzapine provided as a courtesy by Ely Lilly          Indianapolis vehicle    mgkg n   and          risperidone RBI vehicle     mgkg n            were administered iv at approximately  minute

with saline final pH            Cystometrograms were started approximately  minutes          after each drug administration                          Bladder contractions induced by pelvic nerve          stimulation          In order to determine the direct peripheral effects of          these drugs on the bladder the distal end of a pelvic          nerve was stimulated electrically to elicit a bladder          contraction n   Both hypogastric and pelvic nerves          were cut before they entered the major pelvic ganglion          and a tie was placed around the urinary meatus to          preserve isovolumetric conditions After infusing           ml into the bladder the distal cut end of the pelvic          nerve was stimulated with a long train  Hz  msec          pulse width  sec train  uamps to elicit a          prolonged contraction displaying two phases Phase I a          rapid contraction and Phase II a plateau phase               Phase I is resistant to atropine and therefore is          mostly due to nonadrenergic noncholinergic activation          whereas Phase II is highly sensitive to muscarinic          blockade     Olanzapine n   and risperidone n            were administered  and  mgkg iv and          the stimulations were repeated at  minutes intervals          At the end of each experiment all rats were overdosed          with urethane iv
