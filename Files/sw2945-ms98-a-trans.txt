            where are you from Tina   um im from Maryland and um i have one son whos       months almost sixteen months old are are you married or   yeah uhhuh i have i have two children i have a seven year old and a three year old   you are oh     and uh so i try to spend as much time as possible with them   thats good uh what kind of things do you do   well um we we do a lot of things with them you know Taylor Taylor my youngest is or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that   oh   how was it a big change in your life to uh  have a child   oh yeah um yeah its really nice uh my husband uh um is is working most you know most of the time hes working long hours but uh   uhhuh   im staying home   uhhuh   uh im just working a couple days a month and um   oh uhhuh what do you do during those those days   um we we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo and we go and we watch     yeah well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though what do what do you do   yeah yeah im a nurse   oh are you   so yeah so its its its real easy to work out my schedule you know to uh get in to to still   uhhuh   stay in with that an and to have enough time to spend with Matthew he   yeah yeah   hes uh just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things  so um   yeah i understand that yeah they really grow up quick especially at that early age   yeah   but my my wife was uh she worked part time when my oldest was was little and now shes staying home all the time but uh that worked out really well because its a big transition i think to have children   oh yeah   you know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night thats fine but when you have children it doesnt work that way anymore so   thats right and i think a lot of people are um are turning to well i think i think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first and its uh i think its really hurting the   yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i   the kids you know but   i i think that my wife leaned that way and im really glad she did and you know im glad shes staying home but you know i know there are some days when she wishes she wishes she was back at work   i know thats why i like to  to work to work a couple days i think its uh   yeah   it gives me a break   yeah well see thats thats why im glad my wife did too because she worked either two to three three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet shed get to spend you know three or four days with yeah yeah and so   most of the time at home yeah uh we had started out like that and um i think that was really ideal uh   yeah i do to i agree but then when you start having two of them its you know a little bit tougher   its yeah   because youve got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff   yeah yeah its difficult but   are are you from the Maryland area   uhhuh im ive ive lived here forever so   really   yeah im in i live in Germantown and uh are you where are you from   um uh im in Dallas Texas   in Dallas oh   yeah so uh im ive lived here like eight years or so my wifes from Fort Worth   oh uh   but yeah i work for Texas Instruments   okay oh  so that explains  well um i dont know i uh   yeah that explains it doesnt it   we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family but uh   yeah yeah   but as far as during the week its its usually uh you know just my son and i and were   yeah whats your husband do   uh he he works for CocaCola   uhhuh   so he uh he manages a plant out here an and it takes a lot of time   oh oh yeah im sure it does   but um it you know we take walks and  go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that but um   uhhuh yeah yeah what uh my wife did some teaching at like uh like a private tutoring place   oh   a Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that that got me to spend to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff   oh   because normally if if they need something they just go to mom   yeah   no matter what it is i mean i could im perfectly capable of doing it for them but   right   its so much easier to go to mom i guess they get used to it       so but you know wed go to the library and do things like that yeah but   thats good thats good i know my husband was real uh in the beginning when he uh he was transferred to a a larger plant and he um   but   he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home and uh so it takes him a little bit of time and   oh yeah   im not able to work during the week uh because of that he was i was working in the evening and he was coming home and i i could go to work but uh   uhhuh yeah   their relationship uh when i was able to work in the evenings uh really grew he you know just the time that they were spending together   uhhuh yeah   i think it it really it really helped to have that time together   uhhuh it really does because i think you you know you grow closer was your uh was your husband i mean naturally a child i mean had had he been around children   uh oh yeah he has uh he has seven other brothers and sisters and they have   oh   we have thirteen grand well his parents have thirteen grandchildren   uhhuh   so its uh you know theres a lot of kids in the family and and he really enjoys it but uh right now its kind of a difficult time but   yeah yeah yeah   and and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous  um   yeah yeah   its difficult uh to do it any other way   yeah i understand   yeah   um you know its its hard because then youre not getting to spend as much time with at home i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as hed want to   thats right   so yeah that thats a tough situation but then then again you know some you got to do what you got to do   yeah   you know to get along too so   yeah yeah at least i i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home  it uh   uhhuh well well like i said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids im getting out   i know   so shes shes had about enough during those days   i know   but but for the most part i you know ive really feel like thats led the way that you know what just like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people cant afford to get by on just one salary an   yeah   and wont   yeah   and so i think thats led tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially   oh yeah it has   and i really think that thats one of the problems the nations facing that you know we need to do something about but i dont know what   i believe that too and i think uh the kids are where they need to you know they need to really focus on the children in the world in this   yeah   country   yeah would would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think   no i didnt i didnt even really think about it that much i mean you know i knew i was aware vaguely aware of it but um i didnt it wasnt really that important to me and uh   uhhuh uhhuh its amazing how your whole focus on life changes after youve had a child   oh it it really does i  just the whole uh you know seeing how you really are creating are are forming this you know the mind   uhhuh   well you know in the next year or so youll see so many instances where you know hell mimic something that youve done and you see you know everything im doing hes learning from   thats right   and and you think if i wasnt here hed be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care   yeah   you know they thats how theyre developing their patterns and i think a lot of people either dont care or dont realize it you know thats   or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide i   yeah   ive seen a lot of people just say well you know hell learn everything when he gets into   yeah eventually   uh you know   yeah its true   but it um i i know even just this first year that ive been with uh my son here here um hes i can just see how much of of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of uh   yeah yeah plus plus i think it becomes part of you part of you too i mean you get to stay home i mean its not just for him but its also for you because youre both kind of bonding together there too i think so   yeah thats true yeah   well its been nice talking to you   well its nice talking to you too   okay good luck okay good bye   okay bye bye
