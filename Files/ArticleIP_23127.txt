                                 A Formula for Disaster             The                   Observer                of London pulled no punches in its assessment of the first  days of the Kosovo campaigndescribing them as a fiasco in an editorial Sunday At this stage Natoconfronts the real possibility that Milosevic may end up with de facto controlof an ethnically cleansed Kosovo while Nato takes responsibility for a millionor more refugees Nato would have lost before the challenge of a minordictator This cannot be allowed To lose would be to validate and entrenchMilosevic dangerously strengthening militant Slav nationalism in both Serbiaand Russia It would be a betrayal of more than a million people in Kosovowhose sole crime is their race The refugee crisis would destabilise Macedoniaand Albania Nato would be exposed as a sham and its military threat no morethan posturing The security of the West and the central prop of the westernalliance would be humiliated the paper said            Attacking NATOs lack ofcommitment the Observer opined that so far Nato has prosecuted thewar as if its aim was no more than to give Milosevic a salutary smack with theAmericans in particular rating the risk of one American military life beforethe lives of the thousands of civilians whose condition is the explicit reasonfor the intervention  Nato has to raise its game with all that impliesboth in terms of acting on the ground militarily and of relieving the refugeecrisis Surmising that British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reluctant topressure President Clinton to step up the US commitment the paper concludedthat if Blair wants to be a successful war leader like Churchill andThatcher he must learn to be as ruthless            The                   Sunday Times                of London agreed that NATO is at risk ofbeing humiliated and suggested that the only opportunity for success is theuse of ground troops The only way to ensure victory is for there to bemassive intervention  Nato will have to guarantee Kosovos independencemaking it in effect a protectorate The Serbs will undoubtedly challenge thisviolation of what they regard as their heartland It will be a form of peaceand justice but it will be fragile The West must accept that it is going tobe there for a very long time While Spains                   El Mundo                editorialized that Europe Must Mobilize To Help the RefugeesDawn Neeson articulated a much less charitable position in Britainsmasscirculation tabloid Daily Star  Its hard not to be moved by thepictures of Kosovan refugees streaming out of the war zone especially theterrified kids But have you spared a thought as to where theyll end up Makeno mistake theyre headed here Soon you wont be able to move forheadscarfed women clutching wideeyed babies and holding out their hands inyour direction Of course the majority have been through a hell we can onlyimagine but does that mean we have to swamp our already overburdened welfarestate            An oped piece in the liberal Israeli dailyHaaretz recommended a return to the Tito model for the formerYugoslavia Columnist Teddy Preuss concluded that a solution will only befound if the two sides will agree to implement the one and only model that canprevent a Balkan holocaust the model created by Yugoslavias great presidentwhich assured  years of peace in the whole of the Balkans autonomousprovince status for Kosovo Nevertheless even Preuss was pessimistic thatsuch an outcome would occur since common sense and the ability to see allsides are qualities as plentiful in the Balkans unfortunately as they are inthe Middle East  In an exclusive interview with Canadas                   Globe andMail                Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji who is due to arrive inthe United States Tuesday said in regard to the Kosovo conflict that whileChina respects human rights we do not think that we can possibly disregardthe sovereignty of a country in the world And if military interventionism isto be allowed in all the internal matters like a question of human rights ofany country that will open a very bad precedent in the world Zhu stressedthat China expects the same theory of nonintervention to apply to the situationin Taiwan which Beijing views as a breakaway province that must ultimately bereturned to Beijings control            Canada welcomed a new territory April  asNunavut was carved from the eastern part of the Northwest Territories In aneditorial Saturday the Globe and Mail saidAt a time when the international scene offers us too many horrific images ofthe intolerance and bullying that can govern relations between regions andethnic groups Canada is proving once again that intelligence and innovationwhen applied with good will can almost always permit the accommodation ofdifference The population of the new territory is  percent Inuit and inthe view of the Globe and Mail  This alone marks an important stepforward in relations between native and nonnative in this countryguaranteeing for instance that when federal provincial and territorialleaders meet there will always be someone speaking for an aboriginal majoritysomewhere in the country Writing in the conservative                   National Post                ofCananda David Frum was less optimistic He theorized that the territorys reliance on federal money fromOttawa will lead to misgovernment Nunavut will be misgoverned not because thepeople in charge are Inuit but because the territory has adopted the samesystem of governance as Boss Tweeds New York or Marion Barrys WashingtonDC  Revenue from outside sources minus an effective opposition plus acoopted population is a formula for disaster regardless of whether thegovernment is controlled by Inuit whites or South Sea Islanders
