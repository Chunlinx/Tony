Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu will always have the backing of the Congress of the UnitedStates            Thanks toGingrich Netanyahu is himself a player in Washingtons power gamesparticipating in the definition of American Middle East policy LeMonde said It described Gingrichs exploitation of his domestic politicalpower to make his own foreign policy as an unprecedented unhealthy anddangerous situation and added that by fighting against his countrysdiplomacy he had forfeited the right to be considered a statesman If heshould one day take his chance in a presidential election it should beremembered that he triedand alas with partial successto align AmericanMiddle East policy with the positions of an ultranationalist Israeliparty            There was another attack on Gingrich in the liberalGuardian of Londonwhich linked him with the recalcitrant Northern Irish Protestant leader theRev Ian Paisley because both are distinguished members of the internationalloony tendency In the last few days they have tightened the noose ofridicule around themselves completely unaidedPaisley by calling BritainsQueen Elizabeth her governments parrot for welcoming the Northern Irelandsettlement and Gingrich by calling Madeleine Albright the agent for thePalestinians in the Middle East peace negotiations But at least said theGuardian  Gingrich has refrained from taking the parrots name in vainParrots might repeat what other people say it explained but Mr Paisley MrGingrich and other megabores of the ultraright merely repeat themselvesagain and again and again

out on theforeign affairs front It said that his soft policy toward China wascontinuing despite Beijings repeated violations of international treaties ontransfer of nuclear and missile technology to countries like Pakistan andIran That was probably why the initial rush of condemnation of Indiasrecent nuclear tests has been followed by a chorus of voices in Washington insupport of New Delhis actions The editorial was written before Thursdaysnews of Pakistans nuclear tests            An oped article in the Financial Times of London said thatChinagate could turn into the most serious domestic scandal to hit BillClinton US President so far and could seriously damage the forthcomingsummit in Beijing that the White House believes is vital to USChinarelations The FT s main editorial Thursday was about the financialcrisis in Russia saying that a devaluation of the ruble should be avoided ifat all possible and that the IMF could use this crisis as an opportunity toimpose stricter
