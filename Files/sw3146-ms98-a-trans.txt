them both i really do i think theyre wonderful thats our favorite you know what wed really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houstons have you been there   no um but ive heard thats really good too and   its wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing youre going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and   oh   as long as you know that its okay but they have i think one just about the best prime rib   oh   um anywhere  in the area i love it   oh okay but uhhuh   and my husband really likes their ribs so its hysterical we go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we dont even look at the menu  i know right away what we what we want yeah yeah   you know right away what you want well we really enjoy prime rib too and uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here um weve gone to uh my inlaws also enjoy prime rib when theyve had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good   uhhuh uhhuh was it really ive never ive ive been there for like you know lunch but ive never been there for dinner and it was good yeah   uhhuh yeah yeah   oh thats great thats great another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Does   oh ive heard about that too but no  weve uh i guess we eat out even less than i realize   Maxwells nice have you been there oh and i didnt think we ate out very often  Baby Does is nice and one place id never been that i would really like to go to   oh   uh is Lawrys ive heard thats real good Lawrys Prime Ribs   yeah yes id i had heard that too um   ive ive never been there but ive heard its real good   have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway   yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that ive been to uh they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah   oh okay yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but uh during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup and or salad   really really   entrees and accompaniments and dessert and uh the my husband and i like veal uh a lot and their veal dishes have been good weve tried   uhhuh   different ones when theyve had them as one of the   the specials   umhum   have you ever been to Biffins       i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh its wonderful its wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know its supposed to be a family place   i yes no   over near Plano Super Bowl and uh ive ive not been there   right and i havent either uh one place and ive only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwins   ive been there   oh i we just we it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um   that was nice   and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert uh  which was a chocolate sack i dont know if you tried but or something     oh ive heard of it where where its made its like its like a its all chocolate like made like a paper bag and its filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something   yes it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry   yeah oh   uh puree and we shared one the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but uh i wished id had a camera it was beautiful   oh oh oh i bet it was i bet it was   uh   the last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Fathers Day and we took another friend with us and   oh   uh  for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves  and so we had they had uh like a berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom   oh   and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good   yes yeah oh it sounds wonderful well thats uh one of the things the that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant uh i love fresh berries and their uh their fruits are always exceptional i dont im know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmers Market uh you cant find them like that and   you cant find them yeah  yeah yeah yeah you know i im originally from Connecticut and uh i was home a few years ago and my sister and brotherinlaw were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real real pretty but they lacked the service and they lacked the atmosphere the just the i dont know the restaurants down here seem like they have uh i guess theres so much competition that they really have to be good   uhhuh   and i thought i would really miss that   i would too because well i guess because we dont go out very often when we do go out um in a way its like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is its a whole experience of course you want the fo od to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too   uhhuh and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that arent so good dont just dont make it   yeah um that reminded me of a place for lunch thats a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful its called Cafe Max and its at Plano Road and Campbell they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three   ooh really
