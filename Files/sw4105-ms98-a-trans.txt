            okay well lets see i i guess ill ill mention it i always one of the things i always considered was real important about job benefits i always uh i know they cant do anything about it but i always thought location and quality of life in the region was important towards a a job benefit at least it had a lot to do with what i chose is in in my job and and and besides uh you know uh i guess uh uh salary and uh the work but see those are the things that they cant really do much about   thats true unless its a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here at one point id interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to Boise Idaho and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me   umhum yeah the uh  i was uh i actually was from the midwest but i uh i always liked the uh concept of going to a warmer client climate uh so   umhum   uh i generally leaned towards the sun belt uh ive worked in uh San Diego and ive worked in Atlanta so you can see that ive moved moved father south since then  uh i used to live in Ohio when i when i was going to school and uh its still it it becomes a very strong benefit i uh i interviewed with uh companies in uh Baltimore and uh Boston and uh just the the amount of time that it shuts down that that winter shuts you down for activity always used to bother me because i really never got into the winter sports but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me   umhum   uh other job benefited uh job job benefits uh uh i like the idea of uh companies being flexible uh uh with uh time schedules as much as possible i mean i you cant do too much and i understand that   i agree with that uh i found though that that uh it it will benefit both the employee and the company i work for a firm that does have a very flexible schedule and i cant remember the last time that i just worked forty hours a week so the uh it it works out that if i have to go in late for a reason or i have to leave early for a reason no one raises an eyebrow but because of that im not a clock watcher  if i if i knew they were expecting me there at eight thirty every day and i couldnt leave until five i i think id be uh uh have a greater tendency to wait until the clock hit five and then say im out of here   youre out of there yeah  you then you then you punch in a clock and all you are is an hourly as needed person and then you say well you know why should i give them anymore   right   but what they uh if they respect you as a professional you treat them like a professional at that i i i take it then that you are also a professional a salaried employee   yeah thats correct thats correct   uh it usually they end up getting a lot more hours than i i i uh than the classic forty hours a week sometimes i hate to think about it if i would actually add up hours and       i figure if i were getting time and a half what i was really making per hour   right   oops  but uh well lets see what other i ive always liked ive always liked some vacation i ive ive been fortunate i actually had a     another umhum   uh the company i just just transferred jobs about a week ago so but uh for the last five years i was in a company that had four weeks vacation   wow   now that was a real nice benefit it gave me a lot of flexibility uh but of course now ive gone to zero amount of years in the company so now im back to the   umhum   to the uh original two weeks  that was a tough benefit to give up   right   uh the company im working for now starts everyone out at three weeks vacation   yeah that is a good benefit   and i i thought that was great except during the first year i ended up only being able to take about a week and a half of it   right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done   right i was i was so busy uh and it weve got a very small department and i was just uh wearing so many hats that it was very difficult for me to take time off and when i did take the time off id uh get calls from work anyway so its only been uh in the
