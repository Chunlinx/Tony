                                 FDA Smoke Rings            My father was the supremeregulator in our family promising each of his six children a  cash subsidyfrom the family treasury if they did not partake of nicotiana before age Dad was a Camel man and his offer usually came as he filled the air with smokeand ash He so despised his deadly habit that he routinely thumped any kidcaught sneaking puffs in the attic            Tomorrows parents wont have to regulate their tobaccotempted teens becausethe federal government has taken the job President Cigar I mean Clinton madeteen smoking a federal affair two years ago when he unleashed the Food and DrugAdministration on the problem And there is a problem A recent study showsthat  percent of highschool seniors now smoke compared with  percent ofadults            Clintons FDA commissioner David A Kessler inserted thefederal government into the fray by diagnosing teen smoking as a pediatricdisease Assuming regulatory control over the noxious weed for the first timein the agencys history he defined tobacco as a drug and tobacco productscigarettes cigars chew as drugdelivery devices under the Food Drug andCosmetic Act Discovering these regulatory powerswhich had escaped the noticeof other FDA commissioners for more than  yearsKessler issued a slew ofrules designed to suppress teen smoking most of which were upheld by USDistrict Judge William L Osteen Sr late last month Although Osteensdecision is currently under appeal he approved Kesslers ban on tobacco salesto anyone under  as well as the commissioners various prohibitions oncigarettevending machines selfservice cigarette displays and free samplesof tobacco He also approved the FDAs new warning label for cigarette packsNicotineDelivery Device for Persons  or Older            Of course the evil tobaccobastards recoiled from Kesslers rules In court they argued that the FoodDrug and Cosmetic Act limits the FDAs regulatory powers to drugs and medicaldevices that provide medical benefits  The tobacconists perverse logicheld that poisonous products like cigarettes for which no health claimis made should fall outside government regulation The tobacco bastards didntactually call their product poisonous in court but thats theirtakehome message Regulate us if our product heals but dont regulate us ifour product kills And make no mistake about it tobacco kills The averagecigarette smoker lives eight fewer years than the average nonsmoker            But justbecause the tobacco companies are evil doesnt mean that we should sympathizewith the FDA which has convoluted the law to wound its foe If the FDA wereconsistent it would leapfrog the Drug Enforcement Administration and startregulating marijuana The drug here is THC and the delivery system is ajoint Or it would police whiskey and shot glasses Or it would go after theBig Mac as an unhealthful fatdelivery device You laugh The FDA currentlyregulates that nonfat delivery device olestra            So how did the FDA succeed in regulatingtobacco In the guise of protecting children            Dont get me wrong Some ofmy best friends are childrenbut I dont want to live in a childproof worldand most kids dont want to grow up to inherit such a safe place either Thejoy of being an adult lies in the freedom to take chanceseven if you have topay the consequences Osteens decision proves that almost any liberty can benibbled away if suffering children can be associated with it But even thejudge approved only the most overt nannystate measures requested by the FDAacknowledging the agencys power grab by rejecting the proposals that dontdirectly deter teen smoking For instance the FDA wanted to bar tobaccocompanies from sponsoring sports events or placing Marlboro Man and Joe Camellogos on Tshirts caps and other gear            The FDAclaims that its adbusting rules are the best way to achieve theadministrations goals of halving teen smoking in the next seven years Butyoung Americans arent as helpless in the face of the tobaccoindustryjuggernaut as the Clintonites would like to imagine Black teenagers arealready hitting the presidents goals            A government study found that while  percent of whiteteenage boys smoke cigarettes only  percent of their black contemporariesdo Young black girls are even more resistant to tobacco Forty percent ofyoung white girls smoke vs only  percent of young black girls            It wasntalways so Just  years ago young blacks and young whites smoked in equalpercentages What changed One theory holds that young white girls unlikeyoung black girls subscribe to a cult of thinness and smoke to block theirappetite Some black teens tell researchers that they feel that society has sothoroughly stacked the deck against them with racial discrimination crime andpoverty that their very survival depends on resisting tobacco And still othersmaintain that young blacks are quicker to see through Joe Camels charms thanyoung whites To the sociologists speculations add mine Everybody likes alittle danger in their lives but perhaps most black kids are alreadyexperiencing all the hazards their psyches can take Meanwhile kids of allraces who live inside elaborately constructed safety conesairbags mandatorybicycle helmets mommy pagers homesecurity systems antidrug campaignsantisex propaganda and sanitizedforyourprotection suburbsyearn forsomething to rebel against At  cents per protest smoking is a cheap ticketto danger The buzz aint bad either            Another reason the FDA got away with the powergrab is because the Zeitgeist has been moving in the agencys directionfor some time Our culture now interprets nearly all pleasures asaddictionsor potential addictions Case in point Time magazinesreductive cover story of May  on the neurotransmitter dopamine According toTime  dopamine explains how and why we become addicted to sex drugsbooze gambling food cheap thrills and yes tobacco Shall we call in theFDA regulators to protect us from our addictive desires The FDA may have nocurrent plans to dispatch referees to our bedrooms to enforce safe sex butwhen it does you can be sure it will be in the guise of protectingchildren            My mom and dad eventuallyquit the cigarette habit as did my oldest brother and my baby sister Thejuvenile delinquent in the brood smoked for  years before he died in anaccident at the age of  Two of my brothers still smoke although both wouldpress the magic button and quit tomorrow if they could            I alone collected the bounty
