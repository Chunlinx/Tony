                            In the past  years advancing maternal age and greater reliance on assistedconception        techniques have dramatically increased the incidence of multiple births including        monochorionic twins see Glossary  Concomitantly there have been advances in our        understanding of these highrisk pregnancies                    Risks of Multiple Pregnancy        The offspring of multiple pregnancies are at greater risk for adverse perinatal outcomes        compared to their singleton counterparts predominantly due to increased risks for preterm        delivery and due to monochorionicity  The link between monochorionicity and adverse        perinatal outcomes has become increasingly strong  Monochorionic pregnancies have an        approximately  risk of developing the twintotwin transfusion syndrome TTTS which        can be associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity despite treatment  In        addition single intrauterine fetal demise IUFD in a monochorionic pregnancy may be        associated with a morethan  risk for multicystic encephalomalacia in the surviving        cotwin                     Managing HighRisk Pregnancies        Despite these advances in knowledge about risks there is very little consensus about        the management of these highrisk pregnancies In addition there is the temptation to be        reassured by increasing gestational age as the potential complications of prematurity        recede Recent studies suggest however that the offspring of a multiple gestation may        benefit from delivering prior to their expected date of delivery         Several studies have focused on the prospective risk of fetal death to help determine        by which gestational age a multiple pregnancy should be delivered  For twins the        prospective risk of fetal death appears to be equivalent to that of postterm singletons at        approximately  to  weeks gestation  The prospective risk of fetal death for        twins intersects with neonatal death at approximately  weeks gestation indicating that        it may be reasonable to consider delivery of uncomplicated twins prior to  weeks        gestation  These studies however did not address the impact of chorionicity on the        decision to deliver a multiple pregnancy                    A New Study of Monochorionic Twins        In this issue of         PLoS Medicine  Barigye et al report the prospective risk of fetal death        in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies derived from a cohort of        pregnancies that were managed at a single tertiary care referral center and that delivered        after  weeks gestation  Patients were excluded from the study if the pregnancy was        complicated by TTTS monoamnionicity intrauterine growth restriction growth discordance        structural anomalies or twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence Conjoined twins and        highorder multiples were also excluded All patients with uncomplicated monochorionic        twins were managed according to a standard protocol They received firsttrimester nuchal        translucency assessment and chorionicity determination a midtrimester anatomical survey        and fetal echo followed by growth scans amniotic fluid assessment and Doppler studies        every two weeks The rate of fetal death was derived for twoweek periods starting at         weeks gestation The prospective risk of fetal death was calculated by determining the        number of IUFDs that occurred within the twoweek block divided by the number of continuing        uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies during that same time period        There were ten unexpected deaths three double IUFDs and four single IUFDs in a total        of seven  of the  seemingly uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies        These IUFDs occurred at a median gestational age of  weeks  day range  weeks  days        to  weeks  days Between  and  weeks gestation the prospective risk of fetal        death varied between  and  pregnancies After  weeks gestation the prospective        risk of unexpected antepartum stillbirth was  In six out of the seven pregnancies the        fetal death was incidental and found on routine ultrasound One case presented with        decreased fetal movement There were no significant differences between the IUFDaffected        pregnancies and the unaffected pregnancies with regards to antenatal indicators of        intrauterine growth restriction and TTTS In three of the five pregnancies autopsy was        declined in two cases deaths remained unexplained after autopsy Two cases both double        IUFDs exhibited signs of TTTS The authors concluded that despite intensive fetal        surveillance uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies are at risk for        unexpected intrauterine death The deaths occurred in the third trimester and predominantly        after  weeks gestation As a result the authors suggested that after  weeks        gestation the prospective risk for fetal death in these pregnancies might be eliminated by        elective preterm delivery                    Implications of the Study        Despite the limitations of the study which Barigye et al elucidate well small        numbers retrospective nature lack of nonmonochorionic twin comparative data this study        highlights an important question that many practicing obstetricians are confronting        increasingly often         when is the ideal gestational age to deliver apparently uncomplicated        monochorionic twins The authors suggest that  weeks gestation may be reasonable At        that gestational age many of the risks associated with prematurity such as        intraventricular hemorrhage necrotizing enterocolitis and respiratory distress syndrome        have abated        Nonetheless the risks of prematurity are not negligible at  weeks gestation        Balancing the risk of iatrogenic preterm birth in an         apparently uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancy with the risk of        double IUFD or single IUFD with the concomitant risk of multicystic encephalomalacia for        the surviving cotwin is challenging In our practice we have been conducting antenatal        surveillance more frequently than once every two weeks and we have been using the        nonstress test in addition to ultrasound and Doppler studies Although in our preliminary        experience we have not had any unexplained IUFDs we are uncertain if the frequency of        testing could account for the prospective risk of fetal death found in the study by Barigye        et al In addition we have been offering delivery of these         apparently uncomplicated monochorionic twins at approximately  to         weeks gestation following antenatal corticosteroid administration and thorough counseling        regarding the risks of expectant management versus elective preterm delivery While we        acknowledge that our practice pattern is by no means a standardofcare requirement we        feel it is a reasonable approach to this dilemma until larger prospective observational        studies have been conducted to better elucidate the natural history of these highrisk        pregnancies and to better answer the question of when the ideal gestational age is to        deliver apparently uncomplicated monochorionic twins
