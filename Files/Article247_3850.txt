                                 Busting Bushs Biographer                           Fortunate Son               George W Bush and the Making of an AmericanPresidentBy JH HatfieldSt Martins Press             The newest Bush biographer JH Hatfield claims tohave the goods on the Republican frontrunners druggie past The Texasbasedfreelance journalist alleges that Bush was arrested for cocaine possession in but that his daddy got a friendly state judge to expunge the record inexchange for Ws performing community service in a Houston mentoring programcalled PULL The author writes that he discovered this scandal only after hisbook was in galleys which is why the accusation is tacked on as an afterwordto what is otherwise a shoddy clip job with no fresh news            Should we believe this story I dont think so Theauthor who has written for various Blist Texas publications and previouslypublished a biography of the Star Trek actor PatrickStewart has no actual evidence to support his charge And while essentiallyasking us to trust him he provides a multitude of reasons for thinking heshould not be trusted  Editors note  OnThursday St Martins Press announced it was suspending publication ofFortunate Son because of questions about theafterwords accuracy and the authors criminal record Click here for more            For starters Hatfield lacks all the kinds of detailsthat might make it possible to check the story Among other things he ismissing the name of the judge who supposedly let Bush off the name of thearresting officer the police station the date and circumstances of thearrest What he claims to have are three sources Naturally theyre allanonymous making this a good example of the kind of story that wouldnt meetthe evidentiary standards of the cheesiest newspaper but that presents noproblem for a reputable book publisher When I reached Hatfield at hispublishers office he told me that these sources are all old friends who havecontemporaneous independent knowledge of the alleged arrest but that nonewould provide specifics for fear of being identified by Bush Heres how hedescribes them in the book                            A Yale classmate and family friend who partiedwith the future Texas governor and presidential candidate in the late sixtiesand early seventies in Houston                A longtime Bush friend and unofficial politicaladviser who had known the presidential candidate for several years                A highranking adviser to Bush who had known thepresidential candidate for several years Hatfield says this source agreed toconfirm information in the book and spent three days bass fishing with him inEufaula Okla                                        Hatfield writes that he contacted these sources afterreading a story in Salon in August reporting on an email rumor Salon amplified its own unsubstantiated gossip by reporting onHatfields unsupported charges with another uncritical story this week Butwhat Hatfield claims these sources told him is implausible Why would threeBush supporters want to supply a hostile reporter with information that woulddestroy their friends candidacy More significant when I questioned Hatfieldabout his sources he acknowledged that some of what he says about them in thebook isnt true            For example Hatfield recounts calling Source No  toask him to confirm the story he has from the first two His EufaulaConnection calls him back half an hour later Heres what Hatfield writesabout what Eufaula told him                           I cant and wont give you any names but I can confirmthat Ws Dallas attorney remains the repository of any evidence of theexpunged record From what Ive been told the attorney is the one who advisedhim to get a new drivers license in  when a survey of his public recordsuncovered a stale but nevertheless incriminating trail for an overly eagerreporter to follow he said pausing occasionally to spit tobacco juice intothe everpresent Styrofoam cup                        Spitting tobacco juice into the Styrofoam cup is a nicedetail But how I asked Hatfield could he see his source doing this in whathe described as a telephone conversation Hatfield made a spitting noise intothe phone and said that he knew the source chewed tobacco because he had spenttime with him But then he added I might have put that in to protect him Hedoesnt chew tobaccoI had to help him out a bit This is quite an admissionNowhere in the book does Hatfield warn the reader that he has altered detailsor created composite characters to protect his sources His admission aboutSource No  raises the question of what else in his book is fictional            Or what if anything in the book isnt fictional Anyone with a nose for cooked quotes should be ableto detect the distinct odor of journalistic jambalaya coming from Hatfieldsbook All three of his arreststory sources speak in a stiltedtooperfectlyadvancingthestoryline way telling the author more or less thesame thing and congratulating him on his genius in ferreting out this factsHere are some of their quotes                           Source  I was wondering when someone was going to getaround to uncovering the truth he replied surprisingly unruffled by mydirect approach  Theres only a handful of us that know the truth               Source  Take this any way it sounds but do you thinkGeorge would take time out from speeding around town in his TR convertiblesports car bedding down just about every single womanand few marriedonesand partying like theres no tomorrow to go work fulltime as a mentor toa bunch of streetwise black kids Get real man this is a whitebread boy fromthe other side of town were talking about  The judge a good ol Texas boyand a friend of Georges politically influential daddy purged the record Ithappened a lot in Texas years ago and George damn sure wasnt the first richkid who got caught with a little snow and because of his familys connectionshad his record taken care of by the judge               Source  Be careful and watch your back every step ofthe way he warned speaking almost in a whisper Without sounding paranoidI think I would be amiss if I didnt remind you that George Bushs old man wasonce director of the CIA Shit man they named the building after the guy nottoo long ago Besides Ws raised almost a staggering sixty million dollarsfor his White House run in a matter of only a few months and his corporatesponsors and GOP fat cats arent going to roll over and play dead when youexpose the truth about their investment  You know what makes me sick aboutall this shit Its the hypocrisy Cocaine use is illegal but as governor ofTexas hes toughened penalties for people convicted of selling or possessingless than a gram of coke a crime previously punished by probation Okd thehousing of sixteenyearolds in adult correctional facilities and slashedfunding for inmate substance abuseprograms Texas currently spends over onepoint fourfive million dollars per day keeping drug offenders behind bars andanother twentyeight thousand dollars a day incarcerating young people on drugoffenses he said angrily                                        You cant prove that someone made up quotes from ananonymous source just as you cant prove you never got arrested and had therecord expunged But these passages sound about as authentic as a threedollarbill The anachronistic colloquial expressions bedding down a littlesnow shit man the insertion of gratuitous detail his TR convertiblesports car one point fourfive million dollars and the utterlynonconversational tone raised almost a staggering sixty million dollarsall make me suspicious Another tipoff is that Hatfield doesnt discuss histhree highlevel insidetheenemycamp sources in the body of the book whichwas already in galleys when the author made his discovery            The story reminds me in fact of another great episodein leftwing wishful thinking involving the Bush familythe October SurpriseThat scandal you may remember featured the elder Bush secretly flying not toHouston but to Paris in October  to cut a deal with the Iranian mullahs sothat the American hostages would not be released before Election Daythusaccording to the theory ensuring Ronald Reagans victory over Jimmy CarterLike that story this one comes replete with a cloakanddagger fantasy inwhich the truthseeking journalist in this case the author of theXFiles Encyclopedia  faces danger from shadowyconspirators for attempting to expose the truth            What the two fantasies have in common is that neithercan be either confirmed or proved definitively false Reporters cantdoublecheck Hatfields work because he offers nothing but anonymous sourcesAnd while Bush can deny Hatfields accusations as he already has calling themtotally ridiculous and not true he cant prove that something neverhappened  years ago            In fact we should credit the Bush campaigns denialWhy Because if Bush was arrested in  any number of people would have toknow about itone or more police officers prosecutors a judge lawyersfriends and so on Theres no way Bush could be sure that someone with actualevidence wouldnt come forward And while he might survive an admission ofguilt about something stupid he did  years ago he would be far less likelyto get away with a coverup in the midst of a campaign In other words if thestory had any truth to it Bush would be fatally compounding his problem bypulling a Clinton            Bush really is on an accelerated schedule He alreadyhas his Gary Aldrich
