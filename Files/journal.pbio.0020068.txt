                            Symbiosis an interdependent relationship between two species is an important driver of        evolutionary novelty and ecological diversity Microbial symbionts in particular have been        major evolutionary catalysts throughout the  billion years of life on earth and have        largely shaped the evolution of complex organisms Endosymbiosis is a specific type of        symbiosis in which onetypically microbialpartner lives within its host and represents the        most intimate contact between interacting organisms Mitochondria and chloroplasts for        example result from endosymbiotic events of lasting significance that extended the range        of acceptable habitats for life The wide distribution of intracellular bacteria across        diverse hosts and marine and terrestrial habitats testifies to the continued importance of        endosymbiosis in evolution        Among multicellular organisms insects as a group form exceptionally diverse        associations with microbial associates including bacteria that live exclusively within        host cells and undergo maternal transmission to offspring These microbes have piqued the        interest of evolutionary biologists because they represent a wide spectrum of evolutionary        strategies ranging from obligate mutualism to reproductive parasitism Buchner         Ishikawa  Box  Table  In this issue of         PLoS Biology  the publication of the full genome sequence of the        reproductive parasite         Wolbachia allows the first genomic comparisons across this range        Wu et al                     Lifestyle Extremes in Insect Endosymbionts        At one end of the spectrum beneficial endosymbionts provide essential nutrients to        about  of insects and provide models for highly specialized longterm mutualistic        associations Figure  These primary endosymbionts are required for the survival and        reproduction of the host most of which feed on unbalanced diets such as plant sap blood        or grain and occur within specialized host cells called bacteriocytes or mycetocytes        Baumann et al  Moran and Baumann  Molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrate        stability of these obligate mutualists over long evolutionary periods ranging from tens to        hundreds of millions of years By allowing their hosts to exploit otherwise inadequate food        sources and habitats the acquisition of these mutualists can be viewed as a key innovation        in the evolution of the host Moran and Telang  Owing to their longterm stable        transmission from generation to generation vertical transmission these cytoplasmic        genomes have been viewed as analogs to organelles        By contrast reproductive parasites of insects including         Wolbachia ONeill et al  and the more recently discovered        endosymbiont in the Bacteroidetes group also called CFB or CLO Hunter et al         propagate in insect lineages by manipulating host reproduction These maternally inherited        bacteria inflict an impressive arsenal of reproductive alterations to increase the        frequency of infected female offspring often at the expense of their hosts Such        mechanisms include cytoplasmic incompatibility parthenogenesis and male killing or        feminization As parasites these bacteria rely on occasional horizontal transmission to        infect new populations Noda et al  and by directly altering reproductive patterns        may be a causative agent of host speciation Bordenstein et al         Comparative molecular analysis of insect endosymbionts over the past decade has provided        new insights into their distribution across hosts their varying degrees of stability        within host lineages ranging from cospeciation to frequent hostswitching and their        impressive genetic diversity that spans several major bacterial groups More recently        studies in genomics of obligate mutualistsand now         Wolbachia illuminate mechanisms of hostsymbiont integration        and the distinct consequences of this integration in various symbiotic systems In        addition since hosts and symbionts often have different evolutionary interests the        diverse features of insectbacterial associations can be understood as different outcomes        in the negotiation of genetic conflicts Some recent highlights and tantalizing research        areas are described below                    Endosymbiont Genomes Spanning the Gamut from Static to Plastic        The distinct lifestyle of endosymbionts has clear effects on rates and patterns of        molecular evolution Compared to freeliving relatives endosymbionts are thought to have        reduced effective population sizes due to population bottlenecks upon transmission to host        offspring and in the case of obligate mutualists that coevolve with their hosts limited        opportunities for gene exchange The nearly neutral theory of evolution Ohta         predicts accelerated fixation of deleterious mutations through random genetic drift in        small populations a phenomenon that has been observed in endosymbionts Moran         Lambert and Moran  Over time this lifestyleassociated accumulation of deleterious        mutations may negatively affect the fitness of both the host and symbiont        It is increasingly clear the distinct lifestyle of endosymbionts also shapes the        architecture and content of their genomes which include the smallest most ATrich        bacterial genomes yet characterized Andersson and Kurland  Moran  A common        theme is substantial gene loss or genome streamlining which is thought to reflect an        underlying deletion bias in bacterial genomes combined with reduced strength or efficacy of        selection to maintain genes in the host cellular environment As a result of gene loss        these bacteria completely rely on the host cell for survival Because they cannot be easily        cultured apart outside of the host for traditional genetic or physiological techniques        analysis of genome sequence offers a valuable tool to infer metabolic functions that        endosymbionts have retained and lost and to elucidate the steps in the evolutionary        processes of genome reduction        Since  full genome sequences have been published for         Buchnera of three aphid host species         Wigglesworthia of tsetse flies and         Blochmannia of ants Shigenobu et al  Akman et al         Tamas et al  Gil et al  van Ham et al  Parallels among these mutualist        genomes include their small size each smaller than  kb yet retention of specific        biosynthetic pathways for nutrients required by the host for example amino acids or        vitamins However genomes also show signs of deleterious deletions Early gene loss in         Buchnera involved a few deletions of large contiguous regions of        the ancestral genome and often included genes of unrelated functions Moran and Mira         These large steps imply that genome reduction involved some random chance due to the        location of genes in the ancestral chromosome and selection acting on the combined fitness        of large sets of genes rather than the fitness of individual loci Such deletions are        apparently irreversible in obligate mutualists which lack recombination functions and        genetic elements such as prophages transposons and repetitive DNA that typically mediate        gene acquisition The scarcity of these functions combined with limited opportunities to        recombine with genetically distinct bacteria may explain the unprecedented genome        stability found in         Buchnera compared to all other fully sequenced bacteria Tamas        et al  and a lack of evidence for gene transfer in other mutualist genomes Stability        also extends to the level of gene expression as obligate mutualists have lost most        regulatory functions and have reduced abilities to respond to environmental stimuli Wilcox        et al         The         Wolbachia genome presented in this issue allows the first genome        comparisons among bacteria that have adopted divergent evolutionary strategies in their        associations with insects Wu et al  Like other parasites but unlike longterm        mutualists         Wolbachia may experience strong selection for phenotypic        variation for example to counter improved host defenses to compete with distinct         Wolbachia strains that coinfect the same host or to increase        its transmission to new host backgrounds High levels of recombination in         Wolbachia for example Jiggins et al  may allow rapid        genetic changes in this parasite and may be catalyzed by the exceptionally high levels of        repetitive DNA and mobile elements in its genome Wu et al  Other bacteria that        colonize specialized niches for long periods and lack cocolonizing strains also possess        high levels of repetitive chromosomal sequences For example among ulcercausing         Helicobacter pylori in primate guts repetitive DNA mediates        intragenomic recombination and may provide an important source of genetic variation for        adaptation to dynamic environmental stresses Aras et al  The potential        contributions of repetitive DNA and phage to intragenomic and intergenomic recombination in                Wolbachia are exciting areas of research Masui et al         The         Wolbachia genome also provides a valuable tool for future        research to test whether plasticity extends to gene content variation among         Wolbachia strains and labile gene expression patterns        Between these two extremes of obligate mutualism and reproductive parasitism lies a        spectrum of secondary symbionts of insects most of which have not yet been studied in        detail Such guest microbes transfer among diverse host species Sandstrm et al         may provide more subtle or occasional benefits for example relating to host defense        against parasitoids Oliver et al  and could represent an intermediate stage        between a freeliving lifestyle and obligate endosymbiosis Genomelevel data from these        secondary symbionts promise to shed light on the range of lifestyles between obligate        mutualism and reproductive parasitism and on the early stages in the transition to each        Microarraybased comparisons of gene content among         Escherichia coli  a facultative mutualist of tsetse flies         Sodalis glossinidius  and a relatively young mutualist of        weevils         Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont SOPE show that genome        streamlining in the endosymbionts may preclude extracellular existence and highlight        modifications in metabolic pathways to complement specific host physiology and ecology Rio        et al  In addition these endosymbionts may employ similar mechanisms as        intracellular parasites in overcoming the shared challenges of entering host cells        avoiding or counteracting host defense mechanisms and multiplying within a host cellular        environment Hentschel et al  The rapidly growing molecular datasets for secondary        or young primary insect endosymbionts have identified pathways that are considered to be        required for pathogenicity such as Type III secretion Dale et al   Such        pathways may therefore have general utility for bacteria associated with host cells and may        have evolved in the context of beneficial interactions                    Genetic Conflicts and HostSymbiont Dynamics        Given their diverse evolutionary strategies insect endosymbionts also provide a rich        playing field to explore genetic conflicts Frank a b which might involve the        mode of symbiont transmission the number of symbionts transmitted and the sex of host        offspring Genetic conflicts described between organelle and nuclear genomes of the same        organism Hurst  can provide a context to understand the evolutionary dynamics of        insectbacterial associations and the diverse outcomes of these relationships For example        the uniparental maternal mode of inheritance of both mitochondria and insect        endosymbionts may reflect host defense against invasion by foreign microbes with strong        deleterious effects which spread more easily under biparental inheritance Law and Hutson                Hostsymbiont conflicts over offspring sex ratio are quite apparent in reproductive        parasites Vala et al  While the bacteria favor more female offspring and employ a        variety of mechanisms to achieve this the host typically favors a more balanced sex ratio        This conflict may lead to changes in the host that counter the symbionts effect on sex        ratio For example the spread of         Wolbachia in a spider mite population caused selection on host        nuclear genes that decrease the symbiontinduced sex ratio bias Noda et al         Obligate mutualists also experience genetic conflicts with the host regarding        transmission mode and number In general symbionts generally favor dispersal out of the        host to avoid competition with their close relatives while hosts are expected to restrict        symbiont migration and thus reduce the virulent tendencies Frank b In obligate        mutualisms there may be little room for negotiation For example the highly conserved        hostcontrolled determination of aphid bacteriocytes Braendle et al  and the        phylogenetic congruence observed in numerous studies suggest that aphids have won this        conflict over symbiont transfer However the number of bacteria transmitted may be more        flexible and is known to vary among aphid taxa Mira and Moran  Models indicate that        the fixation rate for symbiontbeneficial selfish mutations increase with the number of        symbionts transmitted reflecting greater efficacy of selection among bacteria within a        given host Rispe and Moran                     Prospects        In sum the past few years have witnessed a surge of new empirical and theoretical        approaches to understand the dynamics of bacterialinsect relationships These tools have        shed light on the roles of recombination selection and mutation on endosymbiont genome        evolution and have highlighted parameters that shape the outcome of genetic conflicts        between hosts and symbionts These data provide a foundation for studying the evolution of        mutualism and parasitism and modes of transitions between them In the near future we can        look forward to full genome sequences that span a broader ecological and phylogenetic        diversity of endosymbionts and provide a richer comparative framework to test existing        models and develop new ones        Developments in endosymbiosis are important not only to questions in basic research but        may have important practical applications Bloodfeeding insects such as mosquitoes and        tsetse flies are vectors for parasites that cause significant global infectious diseases        such as malaria dengue virus and trypanosomiasis many of which have frustrated attempts        at vaccine development The same insects that transmit these devastating human parasites        often possess a diversity of mutualistic and parasitic bacterial endosymbionts A very        promising and urgent area of endosymbiont research is the manipulation of these bacteria to        control vector populations in the field Current studies already provide evidence that        endosymbiont manipulation is a promising strategy to reduce the lifespan of the insect        vector or limit its transmission of diseasecausing parasites Aksoy et al         Brownstein et al  Each advance in our understanding of endosymbiont genomics and        evolutionary dynamics represents one step closer to that goal
