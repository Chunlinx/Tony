                hey Dick whos your favorite team   i think im going to have to go with the Chicago Bears   oh how come   well i like Mike Ditka   oh yeah   and um of course i used to like Jim McMahon and you know uh Walter Payton   yeah   but they got rid of them but i still like Ditka and i think theyve got still got a pretty good team if they could just find a real good quarterback   yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys werent all that good after all   yeah i was kind of i was i was disappointed they came along pretty good but but they just didnt have anybody that could actually go in there and win the game   yeah   Tomczak was was trying hard but he just cant do it   yeah and or they found that Tomczak really wasnt a he was a good backup quarterback was what he was   hes not a starter   yeah yeah he wasnt the guy to take them take them to the championship   so im hoping maybe theyll draft a good quarterback this year i dont know who theyre gonna get but i hope   yeah i dont i dont know whats out there for quarterbacks and theyve got a what about a mid a mid first round choice i think   yeah they dont have much in the way of rounds but who knows if they dont get one maybe they can trade for one after all you know i New Orleans picked up uh old uh Steve Montana or Walsh   yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Steve Walsh   whos your favorite team   yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but   i think hell be okay once he gets on   well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it itll work out okay for him i uh you know i uh he didnt have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term six year contract   and a bunch of and a bunch of money oh yeah   and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh yeah Walsh didnt have that much uh well as you probably guessed im a Cowboy fan uh more or less   gee thats too bad   and well its hard uh because   thats too bad it must get a long time between thrills   yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games   uhhuh   and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lanes first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season   uhhuh   uh so thats where i started cutting my teeth on the NFL and then i got to Dallas and we didnt have any NFL in fifty nine so i sat and watched uh watched it on television then at the end of the fifty nine season when they announced were gonna get a team in sixty i went out and bought two season tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders   good grief   for the Cowboys   you still got them   uh yeah except i dont use them   well   uh  then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my two season tickets and they were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard line uh which was really nice and uh in the early days uh you know ten twelve fourteen thousand people im talking about sixty through about sixty four   uhhuh yeah   uh was what we got i also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans football team which is now the Kansas City Chiefs   ah the old Kansas City Chiefs yeah   and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldnt like both you had to like one and hate the other   oh yeah   and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games   huh   and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay       and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh lets see sixty nine when they decided to build the new stadium in Irving uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasnt built with any tax payer money uh they floated bonds that the that the season ticket holders had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder       and uh so i had a first choice and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to buy   good grief   and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line i wonder if that guy thats in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar bonds   huh   that guy so uh that happened then uh ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by TI im with TI and i got transferred overseas   yeah   uh through most of the eighties so i each each year i just sold my tickets i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three years four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines   huh   and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i cant afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them       so i still hold them but i dont go   oh thats too bad   but uh the the funny thing about the Cowboys is is that everybody is really enthused because weve got all these umpteen jillion draft choices and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably Emmett Smith nobody thats been drafted in the last twelve years is a starter   no im kind of uh actually uh i think theyve got the draft choices to make to make a good run at it but i im not sure how well theyll draft   well if you dont make smart selections it doesnt do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you cant sign them   yeah theyre theyre having trouble doing a little bit of both   yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity on draft day hes got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they wont sign a contract they wont draft them   huh   and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that   so you you got thirty minutes to make your decision then   and uh uh yeah because see last year their first two draft choices were uh Alex uh Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didnt get either of them until half way through the season and they didnt get to go through training camp with them   yeah well Smith came on pretty good Wright was   yeah Smith came on pretty good Wright is is still in the in the potential category   Wright didnt do much   everybody likes his speed but he cant catch the ball   and it doesnt do him much good to run down field if he cant catch the ball   no no no but but you know thats where Bob Hayes was in his early days too so   ill be interested to see how they do of course actually i was in Dallas in of course i worked for TI too for a while   hum   and i left them i guess in eighty two but i was in Dallas there when uh Roger Staubach and   oh yeah   all the bunches up there and   yeah well those were the glory years the seventies were absolutely   and uh i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know whatever whatever the Cowboys did that day that it just kind of turned me against them   yeah yeah and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the teams emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium   uhhuh   uh and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of uh of the seventy one season and that was the year they went to the Super Bowl and beat Miami   yeah   in the Super Bowl the previous year that theyd finished in the Cotton Bowl they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in in the in the last second or two but uh i mean in the seventies it was playoffs every year   i had some friends of mine well i guess its its some friends of my parents uh lived in Dallas and of course theyre avid you know just avid Cowboys fans and uh they have this uh little mini Winnebago that they take out there on game day   oh yeah theres so many people do that   and uh we used and uh we used to uh my first wife and i used to go out with them all the time because every Sunday you know the   yeah   Cowboys there they had like four tickets   yeah   they they they had four tickets because their kids were there of course their kids came and went   yeah   but uh every time the kids didnt go wed go and wed go out there and just you know at at like ten oclock in the morning and set up and there would be all these people gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff and then everybody would wander into the stadium you know   well i own four tickets i might i told you i had two i actually own four and in seventy one the year they moved into the stadium i bought two more because i had uh two children and they were very little and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did but uh uh at twenty nine dollars a pop now lets see six fours is uhhuh  thats a hundred and sixteen dollars   is it that much four hundred dollars goodness damn   and another five for parking so thats a hundred and twenty one dollars and with two kids in college and the potential of having three there next September uh i you know im going to watch them on television for a few years   uh yeah i would imagine speaking of that what are your Cowboys going to do for backup quarterback   uh boy they dont have one uh   we sure figured out that old Babe Wassenberg didnt make it   yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasnt it didnt they   yeah he was pretty good staying on the sidelines with his clipboard but he wasnt he wasnt worth a damn in the game   yeah but you know its its interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy theyre going to have to trade him theyre going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks   you know   and and and you know the years that we were good we had Staubach and Morton   are you up there too   now the one that wasnt playing the one that wasnt playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over three or four seasons both those guys went down with with severe injuries and the other guy stepped in and they didnt never lost a lick   uhhuh but they were still bet your money paid if somebody sent me you know i i guess being an athlete of course i played in high school and college   yeah yeah   and i can understand you know wanting to play but of course as i get more seniority on earth   huh   i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn five hundred thousand dollars a year id just be happy to sit there   yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the Super Bowl Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the game but he got his winners share
