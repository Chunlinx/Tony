                                 GW Bush vs gwbushcom            Theslogan on George WBushs Web site is Prosperity With a Purpose The slogan on ZachExleys parody of George W Bushs Web site gwbushcom  is Hypocrisy With Bravado Exley meansto mock the contradiction between Bushs presumed use of drugs and his supportof harsh prison sentences for drug offenders today But he might have an evenbetter case based on the way the Bush campaign has harassed him Bush and hislawyers are demanding the meticulous enforcement against Exley of minorcampaign finance rulesrules they themselves consider dated andridiculous            InMay a Bush campaign lawyer named Benjamin Ginsberg filed a complaint againstgwbushcom with the Federal Election Commission In it Ginsberg contends thatthe parody site constitutes an independent expenditure under federal electionlaw In other words Bush is arguing that Exleys Web sitea oneman operationstarted on a larkshould fall into the same legal category as the WillieHorton ads run against Michael Dukakis in  The intimidating letter furtherwarns that if Exley a freelance computer programmer in Boston has spent morethan  on his site he must register it as a political committee whichmeans filing an even more elaborate disclosure For a Web site run by a privateindividual in his spare time meeting these requirements would constitute asubstantial burden            Thecomplaint is hypocritical on a couple of counts The first is that GW Bushhimself has bought his own way out of some of the more onerous FEC disclosurerequirements Because his campaign is forgoing federal matching funds itdoesnt have to file quarterly disclosure statements electronically That meansthat Bushs contribution reports remain essentially useless raw data forseveral weeks while those of his rivals are available for database searchesBush also thinks that limits of  and  fixed in  areanachronistically low and should be raised Yet he is using these preinflationthresholds as the basis for his complaint Even Bushs lawyer seems to questionhis own assault Its a fair question to ask whether the rules should coverhim Ginsberg says of Exley            In hisresponse to Bushscomplaint Exley rehearses the history of Bushs antagonism toward hissite citing Ws infamous statement that there ought to be limits tofreedom He points to a number of absurdities about his situation I appearto be caught in a catch  so far I have not spent over  per year on theWeb site he writes However paying for legal advice would put meimmediately over the FEC spending threshold thereby validating Bushscomplaint against me            Thisis a clever point In fact though legal fees dont count toward thedisclosure limits What Exleys response misses is a much better argument forwhy the FEC should leave him alone Hes press gwbushcom is one of the kindsof new media made possible by the Web In fact Exley instinctively thinks ofit this way This is my private little magazine he told me If he wants toput his nondisclosure on a firm legal footing Exley could ask the FEC for anadvisory opinion to that effectsomething the FEC has to rule on within sixweeks instead of several years And Exley would have a good case since hissite isnt antiBush propaganda so much as a wacky Bushaverse take on thenews It links to Gore parody sites as well            TheFEC will probably not be in any hurry to settle the matter if it can avoiddoing so The narrow issue of whether Exleys Web site constitutes anindependent expenditure opens a much larger can of worms It points to thereality that many of the old campaign finance laws simply dont make sense incyberspace Should someone who starts a site stating his views have to disclosewhere his money comes from in the way someone who buys a newspaper ad does Ifa Web site itself counts as an inkind contribution to a candidate as anearlier FEC ruling indicates a  spending limit may apply And ifhyperlinks count as contributions as the FEC has also indicated thencorporations labor organizations and foreign nationals cannot legally link toofficial campaign sites Many if not most of the key distinctions of campaignfinance law simply dissolve when immersed in the Internet            The ethos of the Webargues against regulating private individual activity in any way And indeedbecause the Web does much to create an open and level playing field forpolitical expression restraining it in the name of fairness seemscounterproductive The Center for Democracy and Technology recently publishedan excellent report on this topic titled Square Pegs and RoundHoles Applying the Campaign Finance Law to the Internet It doesnt settleany of the specific questions about how campaign finance law should work incyberspace But it does make one thing damningly clear The FEC is utterlyunequipped to deal with them
