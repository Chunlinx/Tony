        why what would you tell someone       well i think first thing is they need to talk with their child to  their child talk to their child and find exactly what they want to do why are theyre going why are they going to college instead of doing something else     umhum   once you find out why they want to go to college then you can get a better idea of uh what range of colleges they should go to   uhhuh   uh obviously if they want to learn trade skills you wouldnt send them to an academic center and vice versa   uhhuh   and um beyond that i think you need to consider the uh range of expenses of going to college that would probably narrow your ranges down even further   umhum   and if you want to go something beyond what you can afford then you need to start investigating scholarship and other things   umhum   so i think you start out with something broad like that and then narrow your range as you you know as you find out more about the child and what the their uh needs are and what they want to do how about you   well i guess i would agree somewhat i mean in terms of finding out first why they want to go to college if they do want to go to college a lot of times its the parents who want them to go to college rather than themselves     that does happen yes   um but uh i think its probably the the studies have been done looking at uh how well you are and what you do when you end up whether or not you uh have a degree or not uh makes a big difference later on in your life and um  you know itd be good to even to start as early as possible to understand what what you child would desire   umhum   and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment   well   and but you know you never know they always a lot of people go to college because they dont know what else is better to do       it seems like its my experience but uh i guess that once theyve decided they wanted to go to college i think thats thats also thats something  uh important but uh you know have them go through the i guess they have like the Barrons books and various other books that describes all the different colleges that they are in terms of competitiveness and things like that   umhum   and they could also narrow it down that way other than just the economic things though its probably more so now than used to be um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if you know you could always shoot for those places that dont have you know are  that might be considered out of your range but sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldnt rule them out on the first cut uh i would try to get them to to find the colleges they think that are you know best fit their needs in terms of the size the college the kinds of course offerings the reputation they have in those areas um you know whether a child wants to be closer or away how far away they want to be from home theres a lot of different other aspects to it you know   that does enter into it all   yeah and uh i think theres things like student uh faculty ratios and and uh all that kind of stuff how well endowed the school is sometimes you thats important because if its not well endowed school       uh then a you know a lot of times theyre just they uh the schools go from year to year based on just the enrollment and uh if thats what the schools doing then um it may not be around the following year especially these times   yes      you know theyre not as economically sound  right   well i have a a daughter now who is a junior  who is looking at colleges and uh   umhum   its interesting uh there were a lot more choices years ago when i went to college   umhum   and uh she is is going through the process much like what youre you know youve described and ive described described so how far away do they want to go what do they want to do how important is whether its a private or a public school       what are the chances for scholarships and uh a lot of mid range smaller schools that are actually easier to get into if you have pretty good grades of course its not quite so comparative to say the Ivy League schools   oh yeah uhhuh   and um   yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have       lots of other uh good and bad points sometimes the offerings that they have is better than   umhum   you know some of the Ivy schools thats for sure uh but theres also other problems too um you know they tend to they all admit all sorts of people
