                                 Yes There IAreI Easy Answers            Its official Over the past week in rapid succession the editorial pagesof both the New York Times and the Washington Post endorsed whatthe Post called a disarmingly simple alternative to traditionalaffirmative action when it comes to college admissions The solutionGuaranteed admission to college for a fixed percentage of the top students ineach high school regardless of grades or SAT scores Although raceblind thispolicy has the effect of boosting minority admissionsbasically because itadmits the top students at predominantly black high schools even if thosestudents score lower than white students who arent at the top of othergenerally richer and whiter schools            Call it the X Percent Solution In Texas where racebased admissions at theUniversity of Texas were struck down by the courts in  the stateguaranteed admission to the top  percent of each public high schoolandblack admissions at UT rebounded California adopted a  percent rule after avoter initiative Prop  banned race preferences at state colleges anduniversities More recently in Florida Gov Jeb Bush issued an executiveorder guaranteeing state university admission to the top  percent of eachhigh school graduating classagain as a replacement for a racebasedaffirmative action program            The Times hailed the Texas policy in an editorial last Saturday eventhough last year it dismissed the idea as tinkering The Postfollowed on Monday saying that if the X Percent Solution turns out to get thejob done without explicit resort to race or ethnicity    why not TheSolution also has support on the rightfrom governors George and Jeb Bushmost obviously but also at least in its diluted  percent form from WardConnerly the University of California regent who has led the fight againstrace preferences in his state            So hey everybodys happy But has anyone really thought through the fullimplications of this convenient fix Has the divisive decadeslong debate overaffirmative action really been defused by a clever policy gimmick Its notimpossible But theres at least one obvious problem The gimmick depends onhigh school segregation If there werent allblack ghetto high schools thenadmitting the top X Percent of each school wouldnt have the effect ofadmitting so many blacks Indeed if schools were perfectly integrated by raceand equal in quality then automatically admitting the top  percent at eachschool probably wouldnt make much difference in admissions at all whencompared with a straight policy of simply admitting top students regardlessof where they went to school            The Post seems to think this contradiction is really a deliciousirony The residential segregation that persists in so much of the nationbecomes an instrument for desegregating higher education But its more thanthat The dynamic could easily work the other waywith the X Percent solutionin education becoming an instrument for furthering residential segregation asblack families with highperforming students decide to keep their kids inallblack neighborhoods because that will virtually guarantee their kids aticket to college            This dilemma is particularly acute for supporters of school choice mostlyon the right who hope that vouchers or other choice mechanisms such ascharter schools will encourage motivated black students to leave bad schoolsand attend better ones But why would a black student who is near the top ofhis class at a lousy public high schooland therefore guaranteed collegeadmission under the X Percent Solutionleave to go to a much better highschool where hes apt to rank in the middle of the class Indeed why would anygood student black or white leave a bad school for a good school if he ranksmuch higher at the former than at the latter The X Percent Solution seems tosubvert the basic mechanism that is supposed to make school choice work Whatsyour answer Gov Bush Either one of you            There are other problems with the X Percent Solution Even if theres noschool choice wont it remove a major incentive for poor schools to improveAfter all their top  or  percent get into college anyway And what happensshould society become more integrated and the need for an X Percent setasidediminish Do you want to be the politician who tries to take away aneighborhood high schools traditional X percent quota Theguaranteedadmission slots could become an unassailable entitlement as hard tocut as a Social Security COLA            Time for publicpolicy journalists especially on the right to investigatethese complications It may turn out that the X Percent gimmick is just thatand that if you want to substitute classbased preferences for racebasedpreferences theres no shortcut that miraculously avoids the need to examineeach individuals recordor that automatically produces high minorityadmissions
