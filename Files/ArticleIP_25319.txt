                                  War by Numbers            Do Americans grow faint atthe sight of their own blood Certainly the pollwatching White House thinksso Congressional leaders from both parties are now urging the president not torule out any option Still Clinton insists that he has no intention ofcommitting ground troops to the Kosovo war front and remains convinced thatairstrikes alone can persuade Serb forces to swear off their favorite pastimeof rapeandpillage            Of course it is possiblethat the parsable president sees political advantage in allowing Congress andthe public to push him into a ground conflict of uncertain cost and consequenceWho knows the true meaning of has no intention But the White House mayalso be misreading public attitudes Polls taken during US militaryengagements from World War II through Bosnia suggest that the US public ispretty toughtougher probably than our mistyeyed commander in chief            True pundits such as Andy Kohut director of the PewResearch Center have repeatedly warned that the public will cool once UScasualties are incurred During the first week of the NATO bombing of Serbiathe White House got scant comfort from the public Polls showed the expectedpatriotic bounce when the action started but it was relatively small andevanescent In the last week of March only slightly more than  percent ofAmericans approved of the presidents handling of the situationa far cry fromthe  percent plus who applauded President Bushs  bombing of Iraq Thisdespite the fact that the conflict had most of the hallmarks thathistorically have made for American support for military interventionshumanitarian purpose concerted allied action usually good in itself for apoint boost in the polls and an identifiable villain            Still that initiallukewarm response didnt surprise polling experts The American EnterpriseInstitutes Karlyn Bowman for example pointed out that Americans are alwayswary about putting troops in harms way especially when US interests arentwell understood And despite his lingering credibility problems on foreignpolicy Clinton did manage to rally some  percent of the public behind hisFebruary airstrikes on Iraq Perhaps thats because the public is morefamiliar with the Saddam issue Bowman noted Kosovo is less clearcut            Since then however public opinion has graduallytoughened And that doesnt surprise the experts either Even at the start ofthe bombing the public was remarkably realistic In a March Newsweek poll while only  percent then approved of the airstrikes percent agreed ground forces would be required to persuade Yugoslav PresidentSlobodan Milosevic to back down Expectations that American lives would be losteven in an air campaign have ranged from the high s to the low s Stillsupport for the actual use of ground troops hovered in the lower s            Then came a weeksaturated with coverage of Serb atrocities and a very sharp rise in publicattention to the conflict A Newsweek poll taken April partlybefore confirmation of the capture of three US soldiers on the Macedonianbordershowed that support for the airstrikes had risen to  percent And amajority  percent expressed strong or moderate support for the use ofground troops to end the conflict  percent supported sending soldiers torescue any US prisoners of war By April  a Washington Post ABCpoll found  percent support for taking to the ground Two days later an NBCNews Wall Street Journal poll found that an astounding  percent saidthe United States and NATO should send soldiers if it was the only wayto stop the fighting in Kosovo Bolstering that average were hefty majoritiesof two normally pacific groups women  percent and Democrats  percentThus do politics make strange foxhole fellows            What accounts for the rapid shift in opinion Apparentlynot presidential leadership Despite Clintons strong support among Democratsin the early April Newsweek poll only  percent approved of hishandling of the Kosovo situation  percent thought the White House didntthink through its plans sufficiently a finding supported by a New YorkTimes CBS News poll taken April  The Times poll however alsofound majority support for ground troops if needed to stop ethnic cleansing orto drive Milosevic from power and the latest ABC News Washington Postpoll April  shows  percent supporting ground troop operations ifairstrikes fail to deter the Serbs            Obviously horrifyingfootage of refugees played a role in rallying the public But perhaps Americansare not the wimps that the polsand the Pentagonsometimes seem to think            Steven Kull director of the University of MarylandsProgram on International Policy Attitudes points to his own studies and arecent RAND study showing that from World War II through Bosnia public supportfor bellicose action often surges in the face of US casualties Publicsupport for US involvement in the  Persian Gulf War remained at very highlevels even at the start of ground combat operations in which most Americansexpected incorrectly that US casualties would be high In the Somaliaintervention high initial public approval of the humanitarian aims had fadedby  as the public came to perceive that the United States had wandered intothe middle of a longrunning civil war Still support for strong actionactually rose briefly after the deaths of  US soldiers            But says Kull One would not expect a real bounceuntil you see some signs of success What jades the public on militaryintervention in civil wars such as Korea Vietnam and Somalia is the prospectthat the sacrifice in lives and treasure may be in vain Serbs may findsolidarity in the memory of defeats past and present but when it comes torallying America nothing succeeds like success
