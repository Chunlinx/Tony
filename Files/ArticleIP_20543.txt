                                  Making Nice            As I understand it whenpolitical scientists and sociologists refer to a society as civil they areciting the many important functions that are performed by voluntaryintermediate institutions These institutions are intermediate between thestate and the individual They are voluntary in that the performance ofindividuals within these institutions is not dictated by the state or by theexigencies of the market Churches trade unions philanthropic bodies andclubs are examples of such institutions            Each of theseintermediate institutions is a society in itself and each of us spends much ofhis life in them Some of these little societies are civil and some are not Iuse the word civil here to mean that the participants are cooperative andrespectful of the others and their interests That is different from politewhich is a surface quality The chairman of a congressional committee who callsupon the gentle lady from Arkasota while thinking you dumb hillbillybitch is polite but not civil in my sense            What makes some of these minisocieties civil and some notI think of two in my experience that were especially civil One was the Centerfor Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences where I spent a year as a fellowmore than  years ago There were about  of us fellows at thecentereconomists political scientists historians sociologists andpsychologists Most of us knew fewif anyof the others before we met therebut we immediately became friends and enjoyed a pleasant social life togetherMore important we could consult each other and collect candid advice Therewas no feeling of rivalry among us            Being happy just to be atthe center had something to do with the pervasive good feelings Also each ofus had shed both his ego requirements and drive for statusat least for theduration of the years leave The fellowship was not part of ones real lifeit was an interlude to be enjoyed and not spoiled by conflict It was as if wewere on a cruise ship with passengers we had never seen before and wouldprobably not see again after the cruise was over            My second example is the book discussion group I belong toat Washingtons Cosmos Club a venerable gentlemens club which now admitswomen as well Book discussion groups are regularly described as scenes ofrivalry and hostilityof fights over which books to read and who gets to talkthe most Why is our group civil I credit in part the physical andpsychological environment of the club which makes for dignified clubbinessBut whats more important is the character of the participants We are allmembers or spouses of members of the club We are mostly pretty old And wehave mostly had and may still be having some achievement and attentionoutside the book discussion group So nobody feels the need to assert hisindividuality and importance We can relax and enjoy the pleasure of civilbehavior to each other            These may seem trivialcases in which neither the gain from cooperative effort nor the possible gainfrom individual assertion is very large The key is not in the absolutestrength of these gains but in their relative strength In the cases I havementioned the two forces are weak but the need for egosatisfaction in thisarena is weaker than the gain from cooperation            I can give a more serious example For many years startingwith the end of World War II I worked for an organization of businessmenformulating policy statements on issues of economic policy We wereallbusinessmen and staffimpressed with the failures of policy that causedthe Depression and that may have contributed to the outbreak of war We thoughtwe had some insights that would help to avert such failures in the future Atthe same time the organization was a major scene in which we might strugglefor selfexpression and status It was where we staffers spent most of ourwaking hours derived our incomes and achieved status internally and to therest of the world But the divisiveness of these interests was outweighed byour common interest in the program on which we had embarked So we all workedtogether eagerly and happily to try to bring about a change of policy We werea civil society            But after about  yearsthe memories of Depression and war were fading some of what we thought werenew ideas had become conventional wisdom and many of the most inspiringleaders of the group had gone on to other things or had retired Then wegradually sank into bureaucratic rivalry and sparringinto incivility            Different participants in a society will have differentviews of how civil it is I thought that those of us who worked on theeconomics side of the Nixon administration made up a civil society We had acommon goalthe success of the administration in economicsand felt besiegedby a common enemy the media I did not covet anyone elses job and did notfeel that anyone coveted mine I had no ambitions for more status and attentionwithin that society But then I read in Bob Haldemans diary which waspublished in  that in  Secretary of the Treasury John Connally hadcomplained to Haldeman that several peopleincluding mewere conspiringagainst him Evidently Connally did not regard that society as civil For himit was a jungle out there even though one of the predators was really arabbit            Civil behavior has two sides One side is treatingother people with civility The second side is interpreting the attitude andbehavior of other people toward oneself as civil For most people I suppose thefirst side is difficult without the second In the Nixon administration JohnConnally was not civil in the second sense That led him to the notverycivilact of complaining to Bob Haldeman            Civility is not one of the major virtues It is notlike courage or honesty The friendly cooperation that characterizes civilsocieties is a pale shadow of the love that inspires great selfsacrifice Butto participate in societies that one perceives to be civil adds much to thepleasure of life
