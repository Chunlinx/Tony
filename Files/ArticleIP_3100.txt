                                 Vive la Haute Couture            The death of hautecouture is a constant refrain of fashion critics It has been coming to anend ever since it started much like culture in general What a killing blowwas suffered by haute couture in the first decade of this century whenThe Press was first invited to fashion showings Its presence would surelydestroy the secrecy between a lady and her dressmaker which was crucial toindividual distinction More than half a century later the ascent ofreadytowear dealt another allegedly fatal stroke to haute couture  asformal elegance began to look tacky and ethnic and thriftshop gear gainedstatus More recently the street fashion called grunge was imitated bycouture designers at fivefigure prices and again dirges could be heard Oneimagines that discriminating people in the  th century mourned thedeath of high fashion in much the same way when slashed sleeves grotesquelyimitating the rags of mercenary soldiers came into style            A fewweeks ago Sothebys held an auction of haute couture clothesaccessories and related materials Most of the garments belonged to elegantParisiennes whose names and photographs embellished the catalog and who wereselling their dresses to benefit good causes in the manner of Princess DianaThese clothes dated back to about  at the earliest and to the early sat the latest A few dresses shown together in the catalog as a group titledLes Createurs  were nameless as to owners and dated as far back as Before the auction I went to Sothebys eager to view such elegantcastoffs at close range You could handle them if you wore the white cottongloves provided by the vigilant Sothebys staff who hastened over whenever youleaned your nose too near the chiffon or made too broad a gesture toward theembroidery            Its more interesting to see what actual couture clientsordered and wore than it is to look at runway numbers worn only by models Onenoticeable fact is that rich women unlike beautiful models are not all talland thin Displays of historical costume have always revealed the wayfashionplate chic used to be adapted by clever dressmakers for the beefy ordumpy or flatchested but were now used to thinking that fashionable bodiesare molded to fit the mode with the help of individualized exerciseliposuction and implants Its not true at least not in Paris Some of thegarments fitted onto padded mannequins showed that their wearers were ofphysical as well as financial substance and these masterpieces are strikingmainly as imaginative triumphs of individual fit and suitability            The stuffwas classic in the best sense lacking quirkiness and full of internal harmonyeven when it was daring always both beautiful and personal The ensemble thatfetched the highest price advance estimate  buyeranonymouswas a formal black taffeta strapless dress with a matchingshawlcollared jacket designed by Yves St Laurent for Christian Dior in Since its part of YSLs first collection as Diors successor this object hasclear historic value and great elegance but not much independent life Itneeds a woman inside it preferably the one for whom it was madenot named inthis case The same is true of the navy wool twopiece Dior dress that fetchedthe next highest figure  estimate also  sold to aprivate collector another historical object representing the New Look in with a close fit high collar and richly draped skirt Beautifully realizedvery wearable very simple it should obviously be worn to lunch not put onexhibit I was glad to hear from the director of Sothebys fashion departmentthat most buyers do wear their purchases prepared to sacrifice currency forunimpeachable quality            Among the named original owners the most palpably presentin her clothes was Catherine Deneuve whose magnetic and statuesque beauty waseasy to imagine inhabiting these sweeping YSL evening dresses Another was thedark and impeccable Parisienne Jacqueline Comtesse de Ribes herself adesigner whose masterpiece here must have suited her perfectly For thisdress she first coated the torso in highnecked longsleeved transparentblack lace Covering the breasts was a joined pair of black velvetdiamondshaped patches whose bottom points met the top points of a long blackvelvet skirt of which the top edge plunged in one sharp V to the lacecoverednavel in front and swept diagonally back in a bigger V to the bottom of thelacecovered spine At their top points the black breastdiamonds wereattached to thin black ribbons that climbed over the shoulders Two otherribbons

two morecorrespondingly at the hips where the lower two ribbons began Like almosteverything in the whole group this amazing dress combined complexity andsimplicity sensuality and decorum refined wit and strong impact Frenchhaute couture has been famous for achieving this combination for years solidly backed up by visibly inventive tailoring and visibly exquisitefabrics and craftsmanship The result is an undeniable beauty whatever themode a beauty specifically meant to render the individual wearer beautifultoo            By contrast the current showat the Fashion Institute of Technology called  years of Fashion The NewLook to Now mainly focuses on the impact of the garments themselves Theshow an instructive panorama of shifting taste in the last halfcentury seenthrough the innovative work of designers from England Japan Italy andAmerica interspersed with French examples demonstrates how changingperceptions of high fashion have slowly altered its character Fifty years agothe closerange visual value of haute couture clothes emphasized theirrarity and the rarity of their wearers faintly implying that they were allhereditary nobility in the daily habit of entering wellappointed finelyproportioned rooms Fashion shows were designed as exclusive events Fashionphotography aided that impression with formal views of nameless thoroughbredmodels Since then all fashion has gradually become a branch of popularentertainment that involves everybody in its creation of vast revenues throughcarefully fostered connections with all kinds of celebrity and fantasy            Designerslike John Galliano have the media image of star performers The clothes toohave the fantasy look of things not made with hands things always morefleetingly pungent or allusive than they are authoritatively beautiful visionsthat float across the TV screen on the bodies of the fantasy figures for whomthey have been designed costumes for one performance Just as with actualcostumes the deep thought and careful work are undiscernible and no part ofthe appeal everything must look easily conjured up and as easily swept awayphotos suggest the same thing with nonthoroughbred models lolling andcrumpling their clothes as they gaze straight at you a strap slipping downunless theyre poised in fragile tinseled drapes and staring from under dreamheadgear Fashion journalists covering the couture are careful to explain theprecise tailoring and the deft application of the paillettes since most of itisnt meant to register on the scanning gaze The throwaway aspect of popularinexpensive fashion now normal since nobody learns to sew has lent its lookto the costly couture which more and more seems incompletely imagined and onlyhalf realized            But real quality does show at close range At FIT there isa  hooded and trained evening dress by Azzedine Alaia made of slinky greenacetate knit that molds the body better than a glove with similarly cannycurved seaming Set into one of these audacious seams is a zipper that beginsbetween the breasts snakes up over one shoulder slithers diagonally downacross the back and swoops forward over one hipbone to continue diagonallydownward in front again  darling help me with my zipper wont you At anydistance its invisible on this sleek sea creature            Evidence accumulates that thecreation of sartorial beauty will never end It will only shift ground Talentwill arise to cut anew and drape afresh to hang the mirror in another placeto unsettle us again and again and to keep reclothing us and righting ourminds
