                              Periodic Table MannersThe Carnival of the Elements            Like the weather atoms nowadays are freelytalked about but the ordinary person rarelydoes anything about them  We know that water isHO and if we are sufficiently dyspeptic that bakingsoda is NaHCO and it is generally agreed that uraniumis quite heavy and that certain isotopes of it canbe manipulated in such a way as to make a very bigbang  Some of us may even take a slightly perversedelight in the ability to rattle off the first oddnames of the elements to the tune of Gilbert andSullivans Modern Major General thanks to the jeudesprit of a brash young Harvard juniorfaculty statisticianin the early s                        Very few of us however can say why the symbolfor sodium is Na why

someone corners you at aparty and starts dropping terms such as stoichiometryas the temperature of your beer rises slowly but inexorablyfrom cellar to attic            It is in Attica that we begin for the notion that themany complex substances with which we are surroundedin daily life might in reality be compoundedfrom a much smaller number of basic elements is documentedas far back as the golden age of GreeceToday we are accustomed to thinking of elements andatoms as one and the same to the Greeks atoms andelements represented efforts by different philosophicschools to explain the discrepancy between appearancesand the true nature of things            According to Aristotle it was the qualitative pluralistEmpedocles  BCE who first arguedthat everything was fundamentally reducible to theelements earth water air and fire or sunlight in differentproportions but as one classical scholarobserves a popular belief in the four as somehowbasic ingredients in nature was much older possiblya borrowing from Egypt            Greek atomism was fashioned in a different workshopDemocritus born sometime between  and BCE maintained that despite our sense perceptionsin reality there are only atoms and thevoid  Aristotle says that Democritus conceivedatomsthe word means unsplittables Greek a not plus tomos  a cut sectionas being particlesat variance with one another which tend to getensnarled and interlocked fit snugly and so catchfirm hold of one another for some bodies are scalenewhile others are sharply hooked some are concaveothers convex As it turns out atoms dont quitework this way but complex molecules particularlyorganic compounds often do which is why surfaceproteins of a cell that function as receptor sites forharmful invaders such as viruses can be blocked withother molecules of the appropriate shape and whywhen placed in a solution of mixed sugars some bacteriaflunk the membership test for the Clean PlateClub because they can digest dextrose but leave itsmirror image levulose untouched            Although the fourelements paradigm remainedrobust throughout antiquity and through the MiddleAges during which a mystical tradition emergedproposing a fifth element ruling the others the socalledquintessence  atomism fell out of favor fornearly two millennia until the quantitative philosophyof the early Enlightenment created a conceptual environmentfriendly to the metamorphosis of alchemythrough the chemical experiments of Robert HookeIsaac Newton Joseph Priestley Henry CavendishAntoine Lavoisier and others into something like thechemistry we were all taught in high school            The scientists prejudice to be sure sometimesimpeded saving the phenomenon as the Greeksaptly called experimental observation  The yearbefore the outbreak of the American RevolutionPriestley succeeded in removing from air so hethought the substance called phlogiston which wasthought to be what put fires out and dubbed hisdephlogisticated air oxygen because he supposed itto be an essential ingredient of acids Greek oxy sharpas in oxymoron plus  gen  related to theverb gignomai  I become happen am born  Cavendish was much closer to his own mark in he isolated hydrogen which he correctly perceivedas a building block of water  hydro being theoblique stem of Greek hyder  water            In many instances finding an element was simplya matter of recognizing that it was an elementand not a compound and had been lying aroundpeoples mines and workshops since antiquity  Inplace of the alchemical signs still common throughNewtons day in the notation of chemical reactionselements got assigned symbols of one or two lettersoften drawn from the Latin names for the same substancesbecause Latin remained the common tonguefor scholarly communication across national and linguisticborders until well into the th century  Thusthe sign for iron became Fe from Latin ferrum  forgold Au  aurum  for silver Ag  argentum

deposit of calciumrich diatomaceous earthMines do grow in meadows            Apart from identifying the elements thechemists of the th and early th century weremost interested in quantifying them  Jns

has been a boon toarcheologists            Four decades later Dmitri Mendeleev systematizedthe table to show stacks of elements with similarproperties eg the interchangeability of thenumbers of

regularly ask about theprogress of the Dictionary of AmericanRegional English familiarly known as DARE Idlike to take the opportunity of VERBATIMs rebirthto bring you all up to date  First let me answer themost frequently asked question How is FredCassidy doing  Im delighted to say that Frederic GCassidy DAREs Chief Editor as well as the founderof and inspiration behind the project shows few signsof slowing down as he approaches his ninetyfirstbirthday  His recent return from a trip to Jamaicawhere he was born and later did the research for hisbooks on Jamaican English and his imminent departurefor a conference on Caribbean Linguistics in StLucia should convince you of his good health            The second most frequently asked questionWhen will Volume IV be available  is more difficultto answer  Before I try let me give a quick synopsis ofthe project for those who arent already familiar with it            The Dictionary of American Regional English is areference tool unlike any other  Its aim is not to prescribehow Americans should speak or even todescribe the language we use as cultivated speakersand writers  Instead it tries to document the varietiesof English that are not found throughout the countrythosewords pronunciations and phrases thatvary from one region to another that are learned athome rather than at school or that are part of our oralrather than our written culture  Although AmericanEnglish is remarkably homogeneous given thetremendous size of the country there are still manythousands of differences that characterize the variousdialect regions of the United States  It is these differencesthat DARE records            The Dictionary is based both on facetofaceinterviews carried out in all fifty states between and  and on an extensive collection of writtenmaterials diaries letters novels histories biographiesnewspapers and government documents thatcover our history from the colonial period up to thepresent  These materials are cited in individualentries to illustrate how words have been used fromthe seventeenth century through the end of the twentiethThe entries also include pronunciations if theyvary regionally or differ from what would be expectedvariant forms etymologies if DARE can add towhat is already known about a words history andstatements about regional and social distributions ofwords and forms            A feature unique to DARE is its inclusion in thetext of the dictionary of numerous maps that showwhere words were found in the  communitiesinvestigated during the fieldwork  The maps are distortedto reflect population density rather than geographicarea giving a speaker in small but denselypopulated Connecticut as much space as a speaker inlarge but sparsely populated Nevada  Though themaps are disconcerting at first glance one easilylearns to translate the state boundaries and makesense of the regional patterns            Volume I including extensive introductory matterand the letters AC was published in  to theacclaim of scholarly and lay reviewers alike Impleased to say  It had gone into a fifth printing withina year of publication  Volume II DH came out in and Volume III IO appeared in   VolumeIV will include P through the middle of S we hate todivide a letter in the middle but you all know how bigS is  And Volume V will take us through Z            To give you a sample of whats to come let memention a few representative headwords fromVolume IVchosen simply because I like them  Ifthey are strange to you see below for their meaningsThe Ps take us from pandowdy to pompey to pudjickythe Qs offer qualmish quick start and quiddlein R we find ramstugious redd up robin snow andrumpelkammer and S yields saluggi sayso andsmearcase  Not to be outdone in creativity the naturalscience entries offer pollynose prickly pig puppytoes Quaker bonnet railroad Annie and sacalaitamong many many others            As you can see from this sample we are movingsteadily along through the alphabet  Our originalhope had been to publish Volume IV in  withVolume V coming out in   That schedule howeverwas contingent on our maintaining our earlier levelof funding which has become increasingly difficultand in the last few years impossible  In fact ourfinancial woes necessitated a staff reduction last summerand it looks as if Volume IV will not be readybefore             Although the project is located on the campus ofthe University of WisconsinMadison the Universitycan provide very limited financial support  Our fundinghas come primarily from grants from the NationalEndowment for the Humanities matched by giftsfrom numerous foundations and individuals  Whilethe Andrew W Mellon Foundation was for manyyears our largest source of private funds we havealso received assistance from the Brittingham Fundthe Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation the EvjueFoundation the Horace W Goldsmith Foundationthe Hillsdale Fund Inc and the Grace JonesRichardson Trust among others            After helping DARE for nearly twenty yearsdespite its usual limit of ten years the MellonFoundation has had to move on to other worthy projectsSo we must find other friends who can help ussee that this project reaches the only reasonable conclusionfor a dictionarythe letter Z  The singlebright spot in our funding picture is that the Dean ofthe College of Letters and Science here at the UWMadisonhas provided DARE with a DevelopmentSpecialist for three years  David Simon has justjoined our staff and will be devoting his considerableenergies to finding new sources of funding forDARE  Although we hope that the NationalEndowment for the Humanities will continue to provideus with some support it is clear that the futureof the project depends largely on private philanthropyWe all know people who know people whomight be able to help  If you can be part of our supportnetwork or know someone else who can wontyou give David a call  He can be reached at   Or drop him a note at

Dictionary of AmericanRegional English DARE offices on the Universityof Wisconsin campus Frederic G Cassidy assembledthe third group of dialect fieldworkers he wouldsend out in Word Wagons Dodge vans converted tocampers to collect regional words from farflungreaches of the United States  I was one the otherswere Tom Clark Stanley J Cook and Patt Van DykeWe went through a week of orientation and instructiongetting to know the office staff and operationshaving our driving and phonetic transcription skillschecked and learning to use our camping andrecording equipment  Bibliographer Goldye Mohrhad identified the communities we were to visit  Itwas up to us to choose an efficient itinerary andlocate informantsas many as needed but ideallyjust one in each placeto answer the pageDARE questionnaire QR  We were advised tobegin each project by notifying the county sherifftown clerk or other officials and to ask them forleads to good informants            The ideal informant INF was a native and lifelongresident from an old local family someone withoutmuch exposure to the outside world who spokeregularly and familiarly with community members ofall social ranks and occupations who could rememberprecisely how all of them talked about theirsocial domestic economic and natural environmentsand who would donate ten to twenty hours offree time to transmit all this information            The ideal fieldworker FW was a good listenerwith at least a little linguistic training and a lot ofSprachgefhl who knew as much about the world ingeneral as the INF knew about the local part of itFirst though the FW had to possess a talent for fittingin so as to make such an impression of integrityand worth on local officials that they arranged anintroduction at once to the ideal INF  Once theinterview began this ideal FW would seem as familiaras an old friend so that the INF always spoke ineveryday terms instead of bookish formal ones            Like all ideals these remained abstract andDARE had to make do with actual human beings andtheir limitations  Judging by the quality of the QRs archived in Madison weINFs and FWsalikemust have compensated for our limitationspretty well            Of my own limitations the one I had to compensatefor most was my ignorance of city life  I asked JimHartman the fieldwork coordinator not to send meon any more urban expeditions than necessaryHowever since I was the sole FW assigned toLouisiana New Orleans was necessary  In fact it wasnecessary twice because two QRs were allocated inthe metropolitan area  To increase coverage I dividedone between a white suburban housewife and ablack gardener from downtown  For the other I wentto the Irish Channel a workingclass neighborhoodThis was the environment I was most illsuited for            I knew how to act in some places  Growing up inthe rural Ozarks I learned early that good countrypeople expect visitors to sit and visit a spell beforebringing up their business  From dealing with academicadministrators I knew to come straight to the pointwith personages who sit behind large desks and havetheir time allocated by secretaries  One of my teachersa South Carolina native had taught me that white menlike me always had to state their business clearly whenlooking for a resident of a black neighborhood otherwisethe neighbors would assume they were up to nogood and pretend not to know the person  Because mycity experience was largely limited to student enclaveshowever nothing prepared me for establishing turf ina workingclass urban neighborhood            My difficulty was exacerbated by the settingwhere I was introduced by a city councilman a barParasols which played a central role in the social andcultural life of the Irish Channel  I could find no oneINF who would withdraw to a private spot for a quietinterview I just had to show up every afternoon andinterview whichever authentic oldtime Irish Channelmale residents came in and agreed to talk there in thebar  Women stayed on the restaurant side and I wasgiven to understand it would be presumptuous of meto try to interview them  On the bar side I wasexpected to buy rounds of drinks when my turn cameup and to drink the beer served to me when othersbought rounds  The regulars came almost every dayto play out roles jokester misanthrope goosey guysmiley guy gourmand and others in an ongoing plotlessimprovisational drama            It was a funloving group and I would have had asmuch fun as anybody if I had not had work to do butkeeping the QR going required continual exercise ofthe will  Normally with one INF once we establisheda working relationship my only strain came frommaking the questions understood and making sure Iunderstood the answers  In Parasols though I had tostruggle every night to shape and defend my identitybecause it never did settle down to a single role thatevery actor could play to  To some I was the guy writinga book One fellow always greeted me withArkansas Arkansas Another fixated on Wisconsinand repeatedly tried to start friendly arguments aboutthe Green Bay Packers            A quintessential incident one night a patron newto me came in noticed me asking questions andbegan asking some himself  I explained cordially whatI was doing and who I worked for            He said Oh a Yankee hunh            Still cordially I said No Im not a Yankee  I justwork for the University of Wisconsin  I was born andraised in Arkansas  He sparred with me about whatthe Dictionary would be good for and called me aYankee again  This time half for show and half in realanger I stood up slammed my fist to the table andshouted God damn it Im not a Yankee            There were several of us at the table and everybodysbeer turned over  I thought Uhoh now Ivegot a fight on my hands  Sensing I had to show somespunk but unable to guage it right I had almostshown too much  He said Take it easy  Im not tryingto start nothing  He didnt back off for long after Ihad bought more beer he came after me again aboutthe Dictionary  I think he said its a lot of bullshit            I answered much the way I had answered moredelicately phrased objections in Arkansas and northLouisiana I told how for example a fisherman wouldbe able to check the Dictionary if he caught a mudfishin Florida and wanted to find out what the realname of it was  He could find that the mudfish iscalled bowfin in textbooks that in south Arkansas andnorth Louisiana it is written grindle or grinnel butalways pronounced  grinl  that in south Louisiana itis called green cypress trout grinnel  and choupique which in English is pronounced  that innorthwest Florida the word grindle is sometimes pronouncedgrindl  A person could find similar interestingbits of information about every aspect of dailylife            Such explanations had always worked before buthere I had gauged wrong again  The people farthernorth had all been earnest Protestants with a utilitarianoutlook  This man resided in a Catholic neighborhoodwhose cultural values were epitomized byparades Mardi Gras St Patricks Day and StJosephs Day  Celebrants began planning next yearsparade the day after this years was over  I shouldhave known that these interests did not point to autilitarian turn of mind            Yeah he said but I still think its a lot of bullshit            A few years later I would present a symposiumpaper titled Scholarship as Play saying academicpursuits manifest the human tendency to extend thelearning activity of play all the way through adulthoodinstead of abandoning it after adolescence asmost other mammals do  Even in  though Ihad long realizedwithout thinking the matterthrough so thoroughly as I did for the paperthatacademic study is not serious in the same sense thatfarming mining weaving and childrearing are  Ihad seldom said so openly but this began to seemlike a good time  I grinned and looked the man in theeye and said To tell you the truth I think its a lotof bullshit myself  But I really enjoy doing it            He looked blank for a moment and then grinnedback and said You know something  I kinda likeyou            Fitting in can have its drawbacks  Another timeI was able to keep an informant only because I wasan outsider she realized she should make allowancesfor my ignorance  That story is worth telling if onlyfor the word she made allowances for            In introducing myself and DARE to a prospectiveINF in Cameron LA I gave examples of what Ihad learned  Among others I mentioned the namescaouane kawn or kawn turtle grosbecgroubk night heron and becscie bksimerganser  She agreed to work with me but thenext day she warned me not to say one of the wordsI had used the day before because it was a dirty wordand I would get in trouble for it  At the time I couldnot recall any words I had said  I asked Whichone            She cast down her eyes and said I cant tellyou            For a day or two I was almost afraid to speak atall until I narrowed down to the words mentionedabove  Just before leaving Cameron I made an educatedguess and asked my INF if it was the word forturtle that was so bad  She said it was            Hartman had told me to be on the lookout forthe southeastern turtle name cooter  with the slangmeaning pudendum  If that was what caouanemeant we had something  I pursued the investigationin a bar where verbal taboos are often relaxedThere was one male customer inside talking withthe proprietress  After I had circumlocuted a whileto avoid offense to her she and the customer agreedslyly they knew what word I meant  I learned over tothe man cupped my ear and intoned dramaticallyTell me            Its caouane kawn he said and in Frenchit means pussy  I remained outwardly calm but Icould have jumped up and down and shouted            I wrote to Cassidy expressing puzzlement  Iremembered Thomas Pyles pointing out in classonce that animal metaphors for this body part namecute furry animals pussy beaver squirrel monkeycony and in France lapin   Nothing about a turtle iscuddlesome it does not fit the pattern  Cassidyoffered an intriguing explanation  the metaphorprobably originated in Caribbean folklore which hasit that sea turtles the referent for caouane in standardFrench dictionaries copulate for a hundreddays at a time  In Louisiana the name was transferredto a freshwater turtle with far more modestsize and amatory tenacity but the metaphor persistedIt pays tribute not to cuteness but to sexualpower  It venerates venery            I would never have learned all this if my INFhad not proffered the courtesy owed to an ignorantoutsider                           Textual note The anecdotes recounted here areretellings of my fieldwork journal entries dated Feb and Mar    The original volumes are in mypossession photocopies are archived at the DAREoffice                                          Ups and Downs            Explaining English idioms is tough enough buthow do you account for the seemingly contradictoryones  I was in a taxi with a Japanese friend of mineand the driver was cutting through traffic like aspeedboat through a docking area  Hey buddy  Irapped on the dividerglass  Slow up a little willyou            This tactic actually worked  But when we arrivedat our destination and were safely on the sidewalk myfriend murmured Excuse me but isnt the properexpression slow down            Well yes I began  I mean no  Its both really            My friend cocked his head as if to say YouOccidentals  I could have said something aboutJapanesehow hai sometimes means yes and sometimesmeans no but decided not to pursue it furtherStill it got me thinking            Take a restaurant doing a brisk business whenclosing time comes around does it shut up for thenight or shut down   When your grandmother pickedall those cherries did she put up preserves or putdown canned cherries for the winter  For properdirections do you go down the road for a mile beforeturning right or up the road                        These may seem like imponderables but we cantease out a few differences  First of all when anestablishment shuts up it simply closes but when itshuts down it ceases activity  If this sounds like toonice a distinction consider common usage factoriesshut down rather than shutting up conversely yourrude brother may ask you to shut up not shut downSimilarly putting up food often involves sealing it injars later stored on shelves as opposed to puttingdown a good supply of hay for your livestock  As forwhich way to go on a road up is either literally up arise due north or just the way the speaker is pointing            English has other such ups and downs ripping upa house versus ripping down the same structure forinstance or the hearty  Drink it down  instead of Drink it up   If usage is a sundial the shade ofmeaning alters its angle slightly here  Ripping up anythingmeans destroying it often by severing the connectivetissues from ripping up floorboards to rippingup a draft card  To rip down a building on the otherhand is to raze it  Break up and break down  like tearup and tear down  and cut up and cut down  workcomparably  Idiomatic drinking like drinking itself isa little fuzzier but two senses coexist having yourcomrades clap you on the back as you tilt up your beerstein or else downing a draught of nasty medicinebecause the doctor tells you to            Of course most ups and downs function as simpleopposites as in uptown versus downtown   To look upa road should be in the opposite direction of to lookdown it just as to look up to a person you admire isthe course of to look down on an inferior  But whatabout expressions that split unevenly  To sit up is atmost a slantopposite of to sit down  since sittingdown means to sit whereas sitting up means that youwere already sitting but are now improving your postureA situp  with a hyphen exercises your abdominalmuscles but a sitdown strike tends to exercisethe tempers of management  And if you happen tobe sitting already then you can stand up  but if youreasked to stand down  then youre still standing afterthat just not on the stage or dais  Of course if yourein the military to stand down is to be at ease nolonger at attention            Other uneven splits include hurry up  or to hastenversus hurry down  to hie yourself in a particulardirection  You dig up buried treasure but dig down onyour energy reserves to finish that race  You can becalled up for army duty but in Britain to be calleddown from university is a bit of a disgrace similar toexpulsion in the United States  Why are these ups anddowns not polar opposites  If it comes to that evenuptown and downtown arent quite equivalentbecause downtown in many towns is only a fewblocks            After a while you can see a difference emergingGet up and get down  for instance could be exactantonyms except that each has one or more secondarymeaning that leads away from the originalpaired meanings  Get up may mean to pull yourselfup from the ground or to arise from bed  In the nominalsense getup can mean a costume  Get down however besides meaning to alight also refers toloosening up or having sex from get down to it  as inthe refrains of so many funk songs from the s  Tothrow up a parcel onto the boat may be the oppositeof to throw down that parcel onto the loading dockbut clearly throw up has a regurgitative meaning thatthrow down lacks  This second meaning forms a slantoppositePut up and put down  for instance need notrefer just to food you can put up a guest and put upwith him as well or put down a dying dog a milderform of which applies to making babies sleep  Toreturn to look up and look down  which seemed socomplementary in terms of location or regard look uphas a tertiary meaning as in looking up a word in thedictionary that look down lacks            Thus pipe up and pipe down are also slantoppositesto speak out or to tune a band versus tolower your voice  Keep up means to stay with thepace whereas keep down is to oppress or not to disgorgeWhen you turn down  are you refusing anoffer or folding a bedsheet  You can just as well turnup that bedsheet but when good luck turns up  thatintroduces a new wrinkle  Maybe one good turndeserves its opposite  As D H Lawrence oncewrote in an autobiographical poem called RedHerringMy father was a working manand a collier was heat six in the morning they turned him downand they turned him up for tea                        The various senses of both turns show a lot aboutthe mining business and what an efficient hell it was            In a similar vein you run up a flag on the poleor run up a gross of a new product or just run up awhopping bill but you run down a colleague or atruck may run down a man on the street  And therundown is inside information  You can touch up apaint job but you touch down on an airfield  Andthis is not to be confused with the touchdown thatall American football fans know  You can stay up asin keeping awake or stay down as in hugging theboxing ring mat for fear of your opponent yet tostay up can be the opposite of to stay downit justdepends on the context  As a linguist friend ofmine once wearily conceded  Everything dependson the context            You can even apply some ingenious logic to theups and downs if you want to pack up more in analready stuffed suitcase better first pack down whatyou have in there  If you live it up too freely youmay never live it down   And crackdowns  donewhile there is still time may prevent future crackups Or a comeuppance may lead to a bringdown             Then there are the single halves  You can cookup a storm but if you attempt to cook down oneleave me out of your dinner invitations  You cancatch up to your rival but who ever heard of catchdown   You can pick up a quart of milk at the supermarketor some information by keeping your earsopen but you generally dont pick down anythingWhen you get too rowdy you may be asked to quietdown never quite up or in reverse clam up butnever clam down   Oppositely you may be asked tofess up or own up but not in any other directionFacing a rough day ahead you may want to rest up but never rest down  You cant butter down yourboss  Your feelings may be pent up inside not pentdown  Scuffing your shoes on the pavement wearsdown the leather not up   And how would you everhunker up                        On the other hand the lopsided quality of singlehalves has caused a few reparations  Nowadaysthe warm up for an athletic meet is paired after theevent with a warm down  And the old queryWhats up has a streetwise counterpart Whatsgoing down  Just as nature is reputed to abhor avacuum some people cant abide asymmetry            Of course there are other ins and outs to pursuehere but in and out just introduce moreinstances of slant usage from read in and read outto fill in or fill out the blank            Should I go off from here  Or should I go on                              Word Words            We need some new words to describe wordsEnglish already has several well known onym wordsfrom the Greek onyma meaning name such assynonym same meaning antonym opposite meaningand homonym same sound            Less well known is heteronym same spelling butdifferent sound eg sow meaning pig and sowmeaning planting seeds  Heteronyms are alsocalled homographs                        Then theres pseudonym  false name eponymnamed for a person eg sandwich after LordSandwich and acronym formed from the initial lettersor syllables of a group of words eg snafu meaningSituation Normal All Fouled Up or laser meaningLight Amplification Stimulated EmissionsRadiation            It was that word acronym that started me thinkingabout the need for more word words  The wordacronym is sometimes used for words formed fromthe first two letters of a group of words  Soho is thearea of Manhattan SOuth of HOuston Street  But isSoho an acronym  Yes if we accept a definition thatincludes the initial letters  But cant we be more preciseLets leave acronym for a word formed from thefirst letter of several words  Then well need a wordfor a word formed from the first two letters of wordsHow about bicronym   That captures the initiallettersense of acronym but uses the combining form bi signifyingtwo from the Latin bi meaning twice orhaving two            What then should we do with Tribeca  the area ofManhattan that is the TRIangle BElow CAnal StreetBicronym wont do because we are using the firstthree letters of triangle  Tricronym wont do eitherbecause we are using only the first two letters frombelow and Canal   Perhaps the answer is polycronym still capturing the initialletter sense of acronym  butusing the combining form poly signifying manyfrom the Greek polus meaning much            These words bicronym and polycronym  suggestthe need for still another word  The words bicronymand polycronym are formed by breaking up the combiningform acro from the Greek acros meaninghighest into a and cro and combining bi or polywith cro   A word thus formed by breaking up anexisting combining form prefix root or suffix shouldalso have a name  It could be fractonym using thecoined combining form fracto from the Latin fractusthe past participle of frangire meaning to break            Fractonyms existed in English before we had aword for them  A fairly well known example is prequelthe word that means an episode or a movie that portraysevents occurring before the events in the originalepisode or movie  Prequel takes the word sequelLatin sequela meaning what follows breaks it intose and quel  and then combines quel with the prefixpre  Another current example of a fractonym isthreepeat  used to describe the feat of a team or individualwho wins an annual championship three yearsin a row  The Chicago Bulls were widely reported tohave achieved a threepeat in professional basketballRepeat was broken into re and peat and peat wascombined with three Voil another fractonym            Then we could have retronym meaning a wordformed by reversing the spelling of another wordLord Kelvin is credited with coining mho by reversingthe spelling of ohm   An ohm is a unit of electricalresistance named for the German physicist GeorgSimon Ohm and a mho is a unit of conductivity of abody whose resistance is one ohm  We could also callmho a backword  but we are better off staying withthe family of onyms  Retronym derives from thecombining form retro from the Latin retro meaningbackward            A related word is needed for a word with twoopposite meanings  Sanction means to forbid andalso to permit  Moot means a debate and a mootpoint originally meant a debatable point and thenalso came to mean a point that was not debatable ornot worth debating  Such a perplexing word mightbe called a contronym using the prefix contra fromthe Latin contra meaning against or possibly a contradictonym                        We also need a word for a word that illustrates itsown meaning  Oxymoron means a phrase that contrastsopposites for a literary effect eg a deafeningsilence  Oxymoron derives from the Greek oxymorosmeaning pointedly foolish which itself derives fromoxy  a combining form meaning sharp from theGreek oxus meaning sharp and moron from theGreek moros meaning dull  Oxymoron is an oxymoronBut what should we call such an unusualword  One possibility is etymonym pronounced ehTYMonymusing the coined combining formetymo from the Greek etymon meaning the truemeaning of a word which derives from etymos meaningtrue or real  This is not as rare a category as youmight think  Another etymonym is noun noun is anoun  Prefix almost qualifies at least it illustrates aprefix            Then there should be a word for a word that hasan etymology that is no longer true  Atom literallymeans a hypothetical body that is so small that it isincapable of being further divided  Atom derivesfrom the combining form a from the Greek ameaning not and the Greek tomos  meaning cutOf course in the age of neutrons protons electronsand even quarks we now know that an atom is not aparticle that cannot be divided into smaller particlesSo we need a word for outdated etymologiesPossibly pseudoetymonym using the combiningforms pseudo and etymo   Another possibility isgerontoetymonym pronounced gerONtoehTYMonymusing the combining forms gerontomeaning old from the Greek gerontos meaning oldman and etymo  Perhaps better to stay with pseudoetymonymand save the prefix geronto to formgerontonym  meaning an old word especially onewhose original meaning has been altered but is notnecessarily now false            The category of eponyms might be subdivided toadd literatonym pronounced literAHtonymmeaning a word derived from the name of a personor place in literature and mythonym  meaning a literatonymderived from mythology  Herculean fromHercules and less obviously martial from Mars  Awell known literatonym is serendipity often usedimprecisely to mean anything found by good luckbut precisely meaning something good that is unexpectedlyfound while looking for something elseSerendipity was coined by Horace Walpole from thefairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip theancient name for Ceylon who often set sail for onedestination and found something even better by fortunateaccident            What should be call these new wordsNeologism is sometimes used but it means not onlya new word but also the use of new words  Besidesbetter to stay with the onym ending and call suchwords neonyms  using the combining form neofrom the Greek neos meaning new            Finally we need a word for all these words thatidentify a category of words  the existing wordssuch as synonym antonym and homonym and thesuggested neonymsbicronym fractonym etymonymand the others  The obvious answer isnymonyms or a bit catchier nymnyms wordwords                              Mad for Words A Tale of Murder Insanityand the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary            At the authors party held to launch this bookin Oxford last spring the current editors of the OEDwere green with envy  How could Simon Winchestera journalist best known for travel books have earneda huge publishers advance for this book  And whywould the film rights be worth even morea cashpayment in the six figures sterling  It is after all adescription of what they do every day as lexicographers            The heart of the story concerns two elderly gentswho copy words out of old books and write aboutthem in a dictionary  It does not seem the sort ofactionadventure story that would lend itself to filmtreatment  Much as those of us who love wordswould wish for it a film biography of Sir JamesMurray isnt the stuff to draw people to the multiplextheatres out by the highway  A fine scholar a selfeducatedand proud man but one whose favoriterecreation was riding a huge tandem tricycle aroundOxford and the surrounding countryside            Hint its the other guy            The other elderly gentleman with a library of oldbooks and the recreation of copying curious wordsout of them was William Chester Minor MD anAmerican living in England and one of the mostfaithful and useful of Dr Murrays volunteer readersSpeaking to the Philological Society in  Murraydeclared So enormous have been Dr Minors contributionsduring the past  or  years that we couldeasily illustrate the last four centuries from his quotationsalone  Minor did little else than make wordindexes to old books it was an obsession with him            If the filmic possibilities arent yet clear weshould begin with Minors birth in Ceylon in June the child of New England missionariesWinchester invents some luscious women youngchocolateskinned giggling naked girls with sleek wetbodies and rosebud nipples and long hair and coltishlegs with scarlet and purple petals folded behind theirears who play in the white Indian Ocean surf and whorun quite without shame along the cool wet sands ontheir way back home   Here perhaps the cinematicpossibilities become a little more obvious            These girls are not perhaps altogether fictionalMinor would later tell people that he began to entertainlascivious thoughts about the time he was thirteenAnd his parents thought it was a good time tosend him back to New Haven to board with an unclewhile he got more education than the mission schoolscould provide  In a characteristic flight of the travelwritersimagination Winchester hints that the parentswere sending him back to Connecticut where frolicsomefemale nudity was they thought less common            Minor earned his medical degree from Yale in and immediately enlisted in the US Army  Thelife of an army surgeon in that dismal year was horrifyingand Minor could not have felt optimistic sinceneither Vicksburg nor Gettysburg had yet producedhope that the union would be preserved  In May he was treating the wounded from the Battle ofthe Wilderness part of the brutal and grueling campaignthat would take so many lives in the peninsulaof Virginia  But it was not that carnage that so influencedMinors life in Winchesters view but the orderthat the doctor brand an Irish deserter on the facewith a D Fear of retribution from the unforgivingIrish combined with those Sri Lankan girls isadduced by Winchester as a factor leading to Minorslife as a dictionary maker            The army eventually recognized that there wassomething badly wrong with Minor and when he continuedto serve as a medical examiner after the war itbecame apparent that he was unfit for his responsibilitiesas a captain in the medical corps  He was in diagnosed as delusional and taken for treatmentto a hospital in Washington  Released at thebehest of friends he left for England in October with a box of paints some books and his gun            On February   Dr Minor shot GeorgeMerritt a brewery worker in the back of the neck asMerritt tried to flee  He killed him thinking him tobe an Irishman stalking him and bent on revengeAnd then when a constable approached he admittedthe shooting  Minor was tried found insane and committedto the asylum at Cawthornehence the titleof Winchesters book in Britain The Surgeon ofCawthorne A Tale of Murder Madness and the Loveof Words                        Minor eventually learned of Dr Murrays greatproject and began to copy words from old books  Andthen in December  he cut off his penisWinchester would like us to believe that this surprisingpiece of surgery is connected to those lissomebeauties of Sir Lanka or to intimacies with ElizaMerritt Georges widow  Though Eliza had visitedMinor a few times and was grateful for his contributionsfor the upkeep of her children the idea that theyhad been intimate some fifteen years earlier is utterlyspeculative  This is one of many flights of fancy duringwhich Winchester negotiates among the possiblethe probable and the no evidence existsConsider the movie what script writer would show usMinor copying out words from a  volume calledthe Compleat Woman rather than a remorseful andforgiving grapple with a tipsy Mrs Merritt            In April  the British government yielded tothe importunings of Minors relatives and let him gohome  Cawthorne had cared for him since  andnow it was time to shift the costs of his upkeep to theAmericans  So in the company of his brother he wentto St Elizabeths in WashingtonWinchesterreminds us that an antiSemite American poet and afailed assassin of an American president have beenhoused there too  Minor wasnt quite throughthough in  he smacked one of his fellowinmates though he had but little strength to hurtanyone In  his nephew urged that he be movedto an asylum in Connecticut  On March   hediedat  years and nine months            Interspersed in Minors story is the tale of theediting of the OED  Winchesters story has an abundanceof mistakes  Herbert Coleridge the first editorof the Philological Societys dictionary was not thepoets grandson Elisabeth Murrays biography wasonly taken on by Oxford after Yale University Presshad turned it into a bestseller and shamed OUP intopublishing it OUP having earlier rejected it asunworthy  There are lexical curiosities as wellBugger grips is his intriguing term for what othersmight call muttonchops or burnsides he believesthat fulsome means exuberant            But these carpings are sour grapes  Winchesteris getting very rich from a story pretty well known tomany people interested in dictionariesparticularlyElizabeth Knowles of OUP who unearthed basicinformation and is rightly given by Winchester whathe would call a fulsome accolade  He discovered aMinor descendant and found a trove of correspondencethat makes the story much richer and morefactual than what was otherwise known  He seemsto have overlooked a story in the Springfield SundayRepublican headlined A Mad Dictionary MakerJuly   p             Winchester wants the story simple and cinematicMurray should arrive at the gate of the Asylumimagining it is some private residencealasWinchester tells us a popular myth Murray knewthat Minor was in the asylum it was as obvious fromthe return address on his letters as Sing Sing wouldhave been to an American counterpart  Minor was soguiltridden over his prodigious sexual appetitesthat he committed an autopenectomy reducing hisorgan to a stub that extended about one inch fromits base  These are alluring possibilities for filmAnd remarkable accents to a story that is essentiallyabout two elderly gentlemen making a dictionaryRichard W Bailey University of Michigan                                          On the Socalled Debate over Black English            Perhaps no issue better illustrates the poverty ofour political and intellectual culture than the socalleddebate over Black English or as it has nowbeen christened Ebonics            The confusions are many the emotions are highand the political ramifications obvious  It may be ofinterest to try to sort some of the issues out                           Language or Dialect                        The Oakland School Board proclaimed thatEbonics was a language and that teaching English tospeakers of Ebonics was an exercise in bilingualismcomparable in principle to teaching English tospeakers of Spanish or Vietnamese  The outcry wasimpassioned and predictably hostile            The debate is virtually meaningless  Most studentsof language understand that whether two varietiesof speech are considered dialects of one languageor separate languages is as much a politicalquestion as it is a linguistic one  So for example thevarieties of Chinese Mandarin Cantonese etc areabout as different as the Romance LanguagesPortuguese Spanish etc  That one group isreferred to as dialects and the other group as languageshas more to do with national boundaries thanany internal feature of the speech varieties themselvesOne linguist characterized a language as adialect with an army and navy                           Bad English                        Much of the debate has been couched in termsof lowering standards the dumbingdown of theeducation system etc  For example in a syndicatedcolumn Ellen Goodman Seattle Times December  snidely compared Black English I bewith French Je suis and characterized the formeras merely bad English as opposed to a valid language            Even the most superficial analysis of any speechcommunity would reveal that certain varieties ofspeech are prestigious and others are stigmatizedand that what determines a particular varietys statushas virtually nothing to do with the internal featuresof that variety and everything to do with the classand in this case the race of the speakers involved  Inshort the issue is the color of their skin not the colorof their vowels            But the confusions are deeper and more insidiousI was on a recent talk show where the hostreferred to speakers of Black English as illiteratethugs The juxtaposition of the two terms is revealingAn academic feature namely literacy isassumed to correlate with a moral one  In otherwords bad English is what is spoken by bad peopleThis assumption is pervasive in our society  Someonewho speaks a prestigious dialect is thereby thoughtto be honest clean trustworthy and admirable            A friend of mine used to teach remedial readingin the New York public school system  The class wasfor students who had repeatedly failed and wasreferred to as the last class before jail On the firstday my friend would tell the class Im supposed toteach you how to read  But lets get one thingstraight Hitler knew how to read and my grandmotherdidnt and Ill take my grandmother anytime  The difference between my New York friendand the radio talk show host is crucial  Schooling andmorality are not synonymous and probably show virtuallyno significant correlation  In the current discussionfamiliarity with the prestige dialect does notcorrelate with moral virtue                           Some Basic Linguistics                        On this issue it is sometimes difficult to knowwho are worse the intellectuals or the bigotsColumnists quote scholars who insist that speakersof Black English are careless and lazy and that theparticular variety of speech involved has no rulesThat positions such as these are articulated and publishedreflects a level of information analogous toarguing that the earth is flat            In fact an example of how rules in Black Englishdiffer from those of other dialects may be revealingConsider the following data  I hesitate to refer todialects as standard or nonstandard since it seemsto me to give the game away            In one dialect of English the plural of nouns isformed by adding s or z or  resulting in formslike posts boyz and buss for posts boys andbuses             In my dialect of English however the plural ofpost is pronounced something like poss  The simplestmechanism for accounting for such a pronunciationis by adding a phonological rule for the deletionof t under certain circumstances  So for exampleprints and prince are both pronounced prins  Therule in fact is more general applying to d as wellWines and winds are both pronounced waynzNotice however that the rule for the deletion of tmust follow the rule for forming the pluralOtherwise if t deletion preceded plural formationthen post would become pos and the plural wouldbe poss  Well it turns out that for many speakersof Black English the plural of post is in fact pronouncedposs  Why  Because they have essentiallythe same rules as I have but in the opposite order  Inother words there are three dialects            Dialect A Plural formation            Dialect B Plural formation followed by t deletion            Dialect C t deletion followed by plural formation                           Pedagogy                        Now imagine the average teacher of reading withstudents representing each of the three speech varietiesA student of Dialect A sees the written wordposts  and pronounces it posts  The teacher beamsthat child can get to be president  A student ofDialect B sees the written word posts  and pronouncesit poss  The teacher might encourage thestudent to enunciate more clearly  Such a studentmight not get to be president but could perhapsaspire to be Mayor of New York            But now the student of Dialect C sees the wordwritten posts and pronounces it poss  The teacheris confused Get that student an eyeexam get thatstudent a hot lunch get that student something  Thefact is that such a student has demonstrated the abilityto read  What the student needs is a better teacher            And ultimately thats one thing that the OaklandSchool Board was suggesting the simple commonsenseproposal that teachers might be more effectiveif they knew something about the speech patterns ofthe people they were trying to teach  Unfortunatelythat proposal became obscured by the pointlessdebate over whether Black English is or is not a language                           History                        Another emotional and largely irrelevant debateresulted from the use by the Oakland School Board ofthe word genetic to refer to Black English  That someactually took this to mean that people are born with apredisposition to acquire a particular language wouldbe laughable if it were not so pernicious  Some yearsago there was a brief article in the newspaper abouta woman from Texas who had adopted a Mexicaninfant and was studying Spanish so that she would beable to speak to the child when it grew up  She wasequally misinformed but not as malicious as the currentcritics of the Oakland School Board            In fact the origin of some of the features of BlackEnglish is of some theoretical scholarly interestSlaves in this country were systematically separatedfrom their families and put in situations where theycould not use their native language  In such a situationwhat typically develops is what is referred to as apidgin based on the language of the environment inthis case English  The next generation acquires thislanguage as a product of their linguistic maturationand this variety is sometimes called a creole  Over thesucceeding centuries this language has undergone aprocess of decreolization for obvious reasons            Now what is of some interest is that becauseslaves in other countries were not systematically isolatedthere is as far as I can tell no such thing asBlack Portuguese in Brazil for example  In otherwords there is a historical explanation for the emergenceof Black English but it surely has little relevanceto the current educational and pedagogicaldebate            It still remains to be seen whether a rationalcoherent language policy for speakers of BlackEnglish can evolve in our educational institutionsGiven the emotional and uninformed reaction so farit is hard to be optimistic                              Revising The FWord            Writing a book entirely about the word fuckaside from being a good way to guarantee cocktailpartychatter exposes one to numerous criticismsApart from the tiresome degradation of societyarguments from the puritanical everyone is familiarwith this word in its many forms  Newspapers coylyrefer to it with euphemisms and circumlocutions Tshirtvendors stock shirts emblazoned with its manyparts of speech  And everyone has a favorite passageunusual compound or offbeat etymologicaltheory to promote            The original edition of The FWord was a successfulproject  It included almost all of the importantuses of the word and the introduction gave agood picture of the words history both etymologicaland social  But there is always room forimprovement and so when Random House determinedit was time to reprint we decided that amajor revision could be supported  The revision isin progress at the time of this writing and this is apreliminary report on where things stand                           Historical                        Interest in the historical aspect of the word fuckhas always been high most reviewers cited variousanecdotes from the Introduction  We have accordinglybeen trying to research and add any relevantor interesting story  The earliest example of fuckappearing in a ciphered version in the fifteenthcenturypoem Flen Flyys has always been acrowdpleaser since it is not

been used earlier in severalavantgarde films  Unlike the literary world whereprovocative books such as Ulysses or LadyChatterleys Lover led to legal battles over obscenityissues in the movies no one tried to place fuck ontofilm until the country was ready for it            While fuck appeared in popular periodicals suchas The Atlantic Monthly Harpers MagazinePlayboy  and others by the s it took a bit moretime for the word to um penetrate the augustpages of The New Yorker   The editorship of TinaBrown is usually creditedmore usually faultedwith that journals frequent use of the word andthough writers did use it frequently under MsBrown in fact fuck appeared there spelled in fullin  during the editorship of the puritan WilliamShawn in a short story by Bobbie Ann MasonMaybe you have to find out for yourself  Fuck  Youcant learn from the past June   p             The etymology of fuck has never ceased inspiringcomment  The various purported acronymic originsare still the first thing most people think of wewill be expanding our treatment of this and includingthe first known appearance of an acronymic etymologyin New Yorks underground paper The EastVillage Other in   The most striking recentdevelopment has been the popularity of the pluckyew story which conflates the origin of fuck withan earlier piece of folklore about the origin of theoffensive backhand twofinger gesture  Accordingto the original form of the tale before the battle ofAgincourt immortalized in Shakespeares Henry Vthe French taunted the English longbowmen bywaving two fingers at them saying that those fingersused to pull back the bowstring could neverdefeat the mighty French  After the English annihilatedthe hapless French  dead French to amere  Brits by Bill Ss count the Englishresponded by waving their two fingers back at theFrench in the nowfamiliar gesture the Americanversion limits it to the single middle finger  Therecent twist has been to note the fact that longbowsare traditionally made of yew wood and claim thatthe act of drawing the bowstring was called pluckingyew the victorious English not only wavedtheir fingers at the French but shouted We canstill pluck yew  Pluck yew  at them  A few convenientsoundchanges brought us to our familiarphrase fuck you            This story totally ludicrous in any version waspopularized on the National Public Radio segmentCar Talk where it was meant as a joke manyunfortunates particularly on the Internet havetaken it seriously  It will be debunked            On the serious side considerably more etymologicalinformation will be presented  The editor isgrateful to Anatoly Liberman for sharing the entryand bibliography for fuck from his magnificentforthcoming etymological dictionary  Libermanargues convincingly that the word is part of a largefamily of Germanic words having the form f  shortvowel  stop having the base meaning to moveback and forth not to thrust as most dictionariesand the original edition of The FWord had it  It isprobably a borrowing from Dutch Low German orFlemish but not a continuation of an Old Englishword  He finds no IndoEuropean cognates of Latinfutuo he notes It is a strange coincidence that Latinfutuo is also an f word            On the less serious but still scholarly side wewill refer to the hilarious Studies Out in Left FieldDefamatory Essays Presented to James D McCawleyOn His rd or

An Obscenity Symbolthe most important article ever written on fuck despite the absence of that word from the articleitself a not uncommon situation in the field I mightadd  The decision of the editor who even now ishiding behind this circumlocution but yes it wasme to forgo a bibliography should not have preventedhim from acknowledging this indispensable work                           New Words and Senses                        A moderate number of new words or phrasesand a smaller number of new senses have beenadded  Several readers suggested the addition of thats hit zipless fuck an act of

for antedatingscitations earlier thanthose previously known for a word or senseis acrucial effort  Early examples force us to rethinkwhat we thought we knew about the historicaldevelopment of language  The original work for TheFWord proved that fuck was used in a variety offigurative senses far earlier than had previouslybeen believed and that certain expressions wereyears or decades older than anyone had realized            The number of antedatings we have found inthe last several years has been small which is bothgood in validating the quality of our originalresearch and bad no breakthroughs  The insultingepithets fuckface and fuckhead were originallyfirst cited in  and  respectively  Several ofthe citations referred to World War Two and aeuphemistic  example of fuckfaced suggestedthat these terms were in use in the s  Happilywe found solid  citations in an article publishedin this magazine in an article we had readwithout catching these cites  This article also provideda significant antedating for NFG no fuckinggood an abbreviation accidentally omitted fromThe FWord but included in the books parent workwith a first cite from             The compound fuckme

          An important goal of the revision has been toinclude any famous use of relevant forms of fuck In the original version we were content to have agood smattering of examples from the earliest tothe most recent but as long as the examples weregenuine attestations we were satisfied  Preferenceis given to actual examples in running text then toprinted glossarial evidence and finally to orally collectedexamples            Now we have made an effort to extend our evidencefrom important or interesting sources  Thuswe have added the famous scene in Catcher in theRye where Holden sees a fuck

University FDU but includes some papers read at meetings of theInstitute since  at John Jay and Baruch CollegesNew York  Dedicated to Margaret M Bryant the volume has four subdivisions IGeographic Names II Names in Literature IIIPersonal Names and IV  Various Other Names            I Geographic Names is further divided into International Names and  Names in the UnitedStates  The contributions of three members of theUS Board on Geographic Names BGN namelyRichard R Randall Meredith F Burrill and DonaldJ Orth give a very good and welcome insight intopractical aspects of placenamegiving  In PoliticalChanges and New Names  Dr Randall pays particularattention to both the new names of politicallychanged countries and also to the problems arisingwhen we try to record native names as in transcriptionIn Motive in Placenaming Donald Orth discussesmotivation in naming a location and illustrateshis point with a very appropriate quote fromMysterious Island by Jules Verne  He mentions forexample names that honor persons names that havea religious background names that express egogratification and toponymic habituation in whichfamiliar names from the homeland are adopted tomake a place seem a little less strange names whichshow evidence of discovery etc  He stresses howeverthat The motives themselves may be explicit orsubconscious but their conjunction at a givenmoment is normally unpremeditated  Even thoughthey may be considered separate events there is adirect linkage between the motive to name and thename given  In fact it is difficult to consider onewithout the other  They are capable of reinforcingone another in a number of ways p             Part  of the first section opens with a reprint ofAllen Walker Reads onomastic history of the RockyMountains which is followed by a very lengthypaper on No Names in the United States  In thelatter work Robert M Rennick professes that it isonly an introduction to the subject and asks for moreinformation so that more extensive research can bedone  However in this work the author is unable toconvince this reader of the need for more suchresearch and I think the paper would have benefittedvery much from an abridged presentation  Onthe other hand Dr Burrills article on Toponomyand Cultural History is a very good example ofhow toponomy and lexicography in general andhistory can benefit from each other  Each culturegroup has its own ways of looking at nature its ownset of distinctions between things in a general classand its own rigid boundaries to thought that areposed by its language  Including terms for artifactsof all kinds that are useful cultural clues these elementsare reflected in toponyms p   Theauthor describes the use of specific terms and theproblems associated with them beginning with theword swamp which is followed by creek follytump  and gurnet   Especially he says the comparisonof the use of these words in the colonies and inthe respective homelands has promising results            Benjamin Nunezs historical study ProtoPortuguezToponymics on the West African Coastin the Fifteenth Century speaks for itself and thesame may be said for the optimistic and thoughtfulremarks of Alan Rayburns Promoting the Study ofNames As a Scholarly Discipline in NorthAmerica            II  The editor introduces this section            Names in Literatureby stating the purpose ofit namely which is to ask if the study of imaginarypersonages and places does not properly belong toonomastics p   This section contains papersabout Bret Easton Ellis Less than Zero LeonardRN Ashley Charlotte Bronts Jane Eyre LynnHamilton Anna Seghers Revolt of the FishersRussell E Brown Molires Le Malade imaginaireBetty J Davis Baltasar Gracins El CriticnCatherine G Rovira Trollopes The WardenVivian Zinkin and Names Prime Evil FictionalHeroes of Horror and Fear in the work of SirWalter Scott and Barbey dAurevilly Maxine MBernard            One of the most readable of these articles isRussell E Browns paper on Anna Seghers Revoltof the Fishers in which he shows how the authorestablishes a certain universality for the uprisingaccordingly the names can be attributed to no specificplace or time  It seems that the Bretonic languageis not only the major source of characternames here but Low German and Dutch also playa part  Brown emphasizes that the last two languageshave a lot of names and spellings in commonHowever the source Brown uses for Dutchnames is hardly adequate Van der Aas biographicaldictionary only describes wellknown Dutch personsand isnt meant to be an overview of all thesurnames in use  For that information one shouldturn to the Nederlands Repertorium vanFamilienamen edited by PJ Meertens and othersin fourteen volumes Assen Van Gorcum Nevertheless Browns description of theauthors choice of a pen name and her symbolicaluse of the name Marie in her novel are excellentexamples of the relevance of literary name studies            The paper of Maxine M Bernard covers thework of two authors Sir Walter Scott and BarbeydAurevilly but because of this broad span her conclusionsare not always very convincing  For examplethis is her interpretation of one of Barbeys religiousmonsters the seductor and rapist of an innocentcountry girl in A Nameless Story   The nameRiculf seems to be a clever composite of twoFrench words rire meaning to laugh comesdirectly from the Latin rictus meaning a mockingsneering laughter and culer meaning to backaway or go astray  His persona was just such a typemocking God leading others astray scornfully gettingaway p   She doesnt mention that thisname is a perfectly normal Germanic name whichconsists of rik mighty and ulf wolf which isitself a rather colourful name for a scoundrel  TheFrench connection that Bernard suggests seems tome rather farfetched and certainly needs moreproof eg from significant quotations of the novelitself  I would go no farther than point out a possibledouble meaning and certainly would not proclaimthe French interpretation the only one butwould mention it only as a possible secondarymeaning            III  The contributors to Personal Names areKelsie B Harder Herbert Barry  Aylene SHarper A Ross Eckler Penelope Scambly Schottand Dorothy E Litt Harders Literary NamesMainstreamed As Given Names is very insightfulHow many parents realize that the currently popularJennifer is derived from Guinevere KingArthurs adulterous queen or that the name Pamelabecame popular through Samuel RichardsonsPamela or Virtue Rewarded   As the authorstates Naming now seldom reflects reading p Barry and Harpers article about SexDifferences in Linguistic Origins of PersonalNames is to the point and thorough  An importantpoint they make is that although names nowadaysare often chosen without knowledge of their linguisticroots and meanings the linguistic backgroundnevertheless persists as an important basis for selectionbooks of names generally provide informationabout roots and meanings and as long as these booksare read and used the knowledge of these works willform part of the choice  p             In Ecklers paper on SingleLetter Surnameswe learn that all letters exist as a surname and areoverwhelmingly likely to be held by people ofOriental ancestry p  and only Q is missingThe paper by Penelope Scambly Schott RosamondPoison and Contamination gives a neat example ofhistorical confusion based on the fate of anotherindividual with the same name  Thus the fairRosamond of English literatureHenry IIs mistresswho died in was also said to be poisonedto death in  not in the flesh but on thepage            It isnt clear to this reviewer just what place theLitt article SelfNaming and SelfDefining inSubscriptions to Familiar Letters in the EnglishRenaissance is supposed to have in onomasticsThe author explicitly refrains from examples ofnomination in code names codenumbered namesanonyms pet names namechanging and other onomasticoddities in this material p   Yet theseelements seem to be more related to onomasticsthan those she has described in this paper and thereforemake the reader anxious to know more            IV  Various Other Names  The paper section ofthe book ends with this general category whichincludes articles by Douglas P Hinkle Roger WWescott Walter P Bowman Thomas L Bernardand E Wallace McMullen  While Dr Hinkle admitshe has barely scratched the surface in his article yetin StreetLanguage Naming Practices in theHispanic Drug and Underworld Subcultures hegoes into great detail and tells us quite a bit egthat a snort of cocaine is called a narizn  from theSpanish nariz nose which compares to Englishslang snootful  Anyone curious about technical linguisticswill take delight in Wescotts comments onThe Phonology of Proper Names in English  He isof the opinion that slang has formal as well assemantic peculiarities and that names resemble slangin this respect p   Thus he tells us names canexhibit phonetic alternation  An example is thesequence Jean Jenny Jane Janet John and Joanultimately derived from a single Biblical Hebrewname meaning Jehovahs mercy  He also mentionsthe four types of palindromization two will sufficehere progressive additive pappa or paw andregressive additive NanAnn or Anna   Thus agood number of common changes are explained forus  For example one extreme lexical transformationis the nickname Poll which is derived from Mary inwhich the m has been both occluded and unvoicedthe a has been retracted the r has been lingualizedand the y has been dropped p             According to Bowman Musical Names TheTitles of Symphonies is a beginning on an abundantonomastic field  Among those already wellknownBerliozs Symphonie Fantastique appears at first tobe an instrument of revenge against one heartlesslady and using the same title also a means of admirationdirected toward his future fiance  Bowmandescribes how composers have used placenames toexpress feelings evoked by visits eg DvoraksFrom the New World or to express a nationalisticor patriotic regard for a homeland eg HindemithsPittsburgh Symphony  Personal names as well aspolitical events or dates function in symphony titlesAlso literature has left its mark eg Liszts FaustBowman concludes his paper with some fascinatingoddities  In Thomas Bernards NamesNationality and the Incongruity Factor our attentionis called to the fact that a good number of peoplehave names that dont seem to correspond withtheir nationality  One example will suffice untilrecently one wouldnt assume that someone with thename Fujimori would be a Peruvian            The last article in the volume is McMullensHistory of the Names Institute   A companionarticle again by the editor concludes thearticles in Pubs PlaceNames and Patronymics andcovers the years             But this isnt all the book has extensive indiceseg the admirable Index e which contains theAbstracts all written by the

gave me pausePerhaps I thought the army yielded power harshlywhile wielding a noiron velvet fist            Already while working my head to the bone                on the above examples and others too humorous tomention I had been visited by fond memories ofJane and Goodman Ace those masters of malapropismthoughaccording to an article in The NewYorker which I read years ago Goodman was themaster Jane was a reallife Mrs Malaprop I hadmade a list of the Jane Aceisms in that article  I stillhad that list and now rather than just sitting therelike a bum on a log I compared Janes words with myown burgeoning record of unstrung and unlamentedlapses many still to be entered in my trustee notebook            When I had at last poured over the two liststhe one so much too brief the other
