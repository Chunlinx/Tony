                                 Like Water From a Stone            It may sound odd to hear thename John McPhee in the same sentence as the phrase cult writer McPheescareer developed smack in middle of the literary mainstream in The NewYorker of the s and s In many ways he along with Joan DidionNorman Mailer and Tom Wolfe helped define contemporary American writingelevating journalism from journeymans status to something like literatureWhats more McPhees work is uncultishly genteel Unlike his fellow NewJournalists he rarely stoops to the first person Where his peers wrotefrenzied accounts of Vietnam and racial strife he gravitated toward tamersubjectsthe young Bill Bradley for example and canoes            In thisera of Monica overkill its not surprising to find a cult of a writer asrestrained as McPhee Didion Mailer Wolfe et al have become somewhatoverexposed McPhees influence may have narrowed since his heyday but heremains the ultimate writers writer In creative writing programs his focusedprose and reverence for facts are touted as the great model for literaryjournalism Among my acquaintances in New York publishing McPhee has betterword of mouth than any author I know            This month his fans should be moved to even greater awe bya giant new opus Annals of the Former World is vintage McPheeitrepresents  years of New Yorker pieces and books reworked for thefirst time into a unified whole All the craftsmans flourishes are on viewSentence by sentence this book has more finely tuned prose than anything Iveread in ages Click for an excerpt Which is as it turns out its mainshortcoming Things written sentence by sentence often lack a larger energyOne could even call McPhee boringexcept that the real problem is weirder thanthat            Here is akey fact about McPhee He was born in Princeton went to Princeton and with afew exceptions has lived in Princeton all his life The obsessive travels hesrecorded in prose are balanced by a level of stability almost unheard of for acontemporary writer His working life is just as consistent He knew at  thathe wanted to write for The New Yorker  By the age of  he was on staffenjoying wonderful privilegessalary and benefits huge word countspermission from his editor to do whatever he wanted This is freedom the likesof which American writers may never see again            Early on he specialized in admiring portraitsof successful young men Bradley as a star college basketball player ThomasHoving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Its hard to appreciate howinfluential these pieces were since their meandering narrativea leisurelystream of details set off by sharp dramatic sceneshelped define the modernmagazine profile What stands out about them today is how positive they areabout their subjects Bradley has a great work ethic and uncommonly goodmanners Hoving is a shining star among art bureaucrats so talented that everymajor New York institution would swap favors with Satan to hire him Itsrefreshing to read a journalist who doesnt snoop around for hints that hissubject ever did anything sordid Yet the pieces are also suffused with astrange selfsatisfaction McPhee lays out a picture of young men who happenedto go to Princeton and to possess gifts a good eye discipline not unlike hisown Then moving in to eat his cake he asks us to applaud their modesty            As timewent on McPhee began to focus more and more on the structure of a piece Eacharticle he believes has an organic shape He finds it by sorting his ampleresearch into subtopics writing the name of each subtopic on an index cardand playing around with the cards till he finds the right order To anoutsider the results of this search can seem specific to the point ofabsurdity An introduction to the collection The Literary Journalists reports that the Hoving profile was shaped like a capital Y in whichthe descending branches finally joined at a moment of an epiphany duringHovings college career at Princeton and then proceeded along the bottom stemin a single line In some sense that I struggled to understand but eventuallygave up on another famous piece Travels in Georgia was apparently shapedlike a lower case e            His sense of shape may explain why he was drawn to geologya science that interprets rocks and gashes in the earth and weaves theseinterpretations into a story of how the world grew Annals of the FormerWorld began in the s with a piece for The New Yorker s Talk ofthe Town on road cuts around New York City but McPhee knew he was ontosomething bigger Again the form preceded the content He imagined a book thatwould journey in a straight line across Interstate  He began travelingaround the world interviewing geologists journeying with them to outcropslooking and learning The result is a majestic book filled with fascinatingfacts memorable profiles of scientists and a profound grasp of the fact thatwe human beings are nothing but the merest specks            And yet Annals of theFormer World numbs the brain It makes you feel as if youd been pluckedout of your own life and plopped down into someone elses repressed familyThis familys weird habits include for example assuming that when you seesomethinga woman a mountain an empty soda canthe appropriate response isnot to decide how you feel about what you see but to think of tautly composedphrases in which to describe it The family belongs to the passiveaggressiveschool of communication Its members hint at what theyre thinking and expectyou to read their minds            To be fair this lastneurosis extends beyond McPhee This book may be the grandest embodiment of theprinciple that guided The New Yorker through its glory days underWilliam Shawn that it is the role of good writing to arrange facts artfullyand discreetly and not much else Out of selfinterest Im as nostalgic asanyone for the era of big word counts and editorial carte blanche ButAnnals is a good antidote For all McPhees expertise at crafting anarrative it feels unnecessarily bloated for all his famous humility theresa mild vanity in its fussy perfectionism Above all theres a sense ofstrainof McPhee working hard to make all these facts sing And for what Awellcurated museum exhibit backed by a few smart CDROMs could in a daydrill you in most of the geology McPhee has to teach We could get upset aboutthis and worry that technology is about to replace fine writing I say bringon the CDROMsand free the writers to do something else
