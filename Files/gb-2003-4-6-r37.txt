                    Background        Development of the male genitalia is largely controlled        by cells in the urogenital mesenchyme that express androgen        receptors AR      Germline mutations of the         AR gene produce a spectrum of        developmental abnormalities in XY individuals ranging        from infertility or mild hypospadias to complete        feminization which are collectively referred to as the        androgen insensitivity syndrome AIS In general the        degree of genital ambiguity correlates with the level of        compromise of AR function XY individuals with        ARinactivating mutations are completely feminized despite        high levels of serum testosterone              The molecular events responsible for ARdependent male        genital morphogenesis are poorly understood We        hypothesized that the ARdependent mesenchymal programs        underlying male external genitalia development might be        illuminated by comparing the transcriptional profile of        mesenchymederived stromal cells from normal males to those        from individuals affected with AIS As cultured genital        fibroblasts originate from the urogenital mesenchyme and        retain expression of the AR         in vitro  we compared        geneexpression patterns in cultured genital fibroblasts        from normal XY males and from XY females with severe        or complete AIS using DNA microarrays representing         distinct human genes We found striking differences in the        gene expression profiles of genital fibroblasts cultured        from normal and AIS patients but no transcriptional        response to androgen was detectable in any of the cultured        genital fibroblasts                    Results                  Baseline gene transcription in genital          fibroblasts          To gain insights into the role of androgen in genital          morphogenesis we compared basal transcriptional patterns          in genital fibroblasts from XY individuals with either          wildtype AR or germline inactivation of the AR as a          result of mutation We could not identify mutations in          the           AR gene in two phenotypically          female individuals with complete AIS However genital          skin fibroblasts of both subjects failed to express AR          protein and did not show androgen binding Table           Initially we restricted our analysis to genital skin          fibroblasts grown from the foreskin of nine normal males          and from the labia majora of five AISaffected XY          individuals with female external genitalia The AR status          of all genital fibroblasts was confirmed by           AR gene sequencing and          hormonebinding assays Table  To determine basal          geneexpression patterns mRNA was isolated from          growtharrested G             confluent cells and analyzed using          DNA microarrays of approximately  cDNAs          representing  genes Distinct differences in the          basal expression profiles of normal and AISderived          fibroblasts allowed these two groups to be distinguished          on the basis of their expression patterns by unsupervised          hierarchical clustering analysis Figure  We then          identified  unique transcripts represented by           total cDNAs with significant differences in expression          levels between normal and AIS genital fibroblasts using          the significance analysis of microarrays SAMprocedure              with a false discovery rate of less than           percent of genes identified by chance alone          We used the list of the  cDNAs from the SAM          analysis for hierarchical clustering analysis of           different primary fibroblast lines from normal and AIS          affected individuals Figure  In addition to the           genitalskin fibroblast lines used to generate the SAM          list we included five gonadal fibroblast lines from          XY females with complete AIS a prostate fibroblast          cell line from a normal male analyzed twice abdominal          skin fibroblasts from a normal male forearm fibroblasts          from a normal male and genital fibroblasts from two AIS          XY females who had documented AR mosaicism ARD          ARD  Table  The ARD and ARD lines express          wildtype AR and were derived from individuals who were          mosaics for wildtype AR and AR with a premature stop          codon     Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the          expression of  of the  previously identified          transcripts with measurable expression across at least           of  experiments separated the fibroblasts into          those with geneexpression patterns resembling normal          male foreskin fibroblasts and a second group with an          expression pattern more similar to labial skin          fibroblasts from AISaffected individuals Figure  The          latter group contained all five gonadal fibroblast lines          from complete AIS females as well as the fibroblast lines          from abdominal and forearm skin The prostate          fibroblasts on the other hand displayed expression          patterns largely similar to the normal male foreskin          cells Notably the two mosaic AIS cell lines ARD and          ARD showed geneexpression patterns that most          resembled normal male foreskin Figure           Comparison of expression patterns in genital          fibroblasts from normal and AISaffected individuals and          fibroblasts from extragenital sites offers possible          insights into the programs that underlie genital          development For instance transcripts encoding homeobox          A protein HOXA and Tbox proteins TBX showed          striking differences in their expression levels between          the male genital and AISextragenital fibroblasts           HOXA was expressed at high levels          in normal male foreskin fibroblasts and at low levels in          all AIS and extragenital fibroblasts Figure  Tbox          gene             TBX  was expressed at higher          levels in the fibroblasts from genital skin extragenital          skin or prostate from males than in genital skin          fibroblasts from AIS XY females Figure            TBX showed an almost identical          expression profile to           TBX  whereas high           TBX expression appeared to be          restricted to foreskin fibroblasts from normal males          including those from the phenotypically female mosaic          patient ARD           BMP bone morphogenetic protein           was predominantly expressed in foreskin fibroblasts from          normal males and in prostate fibroblasts Figure            WNT winglesstype MMTV          integration site family member  was part of a small          gene cluster with high expression in normal male foreskin          fibroblasts that distinguished these samples from all          other fibroblasts Figure           Compared to genital and gonadal fibroblasts from XY          females fibroblasts from normal male genital tissues          showed pronounced differences in expression of cell          adhesion and extracellular matrix genes For example          cadherin             CDH  versican            CSPG  collagen A            COLA  collagen A            COLA            PHA encoding a          procollagenmodifying enzyme all showed relatively low          expression in the genital skin fibroblasts of normal          males whereas tenascin XB            TNXB  nidogen             NID  laminins            LAMA            LAMA  and tissue inhibitor of          metalloproteinase             TIMP  all showed relatively high          expression levels compared to AISderived fibroblasts          Figure  Several of the differentially expressed          genes including aldoketo reductase C            AKRC  aldehyde dehydrogenase          A            ALDHA  and alcohol          dehydrogenase B            ADHB  function in sex steroid          and retinoic acid metabolism Figure  Other          differentially expressed genes such as mitogenactivated          protein kinase             MAPK  and STATinduced STAT          inhibitors  and             STATI            SSI  encode proteins involved          in intracellular signal transduction                          Transcriptional response of cultured genital          fibroblasts to androgen treatment          We tested the responses of normal and AIS genital          fibroblasts to dihydrotestosterone DHT under culture          conditions similar to those that were reported to produce          aromatase induction in these cells     Cells were          treated with DHT  nM both at confluency G             and during exponential growth and          transcript levels were assessed using DNA microarrays          Unsupervised hierarchical clustering did not disclose any          obvious differences in geneexpression patterns between          DHTtreated and ethanoltreated fibroblasts either in          normal controls or in AISderived cell lines We treated          LNCaP prostate cancer cells with androgen under similar          conditions and readily identified nearly  transcripts          modulated by androgen with unsupervised hierarchical          clustering analysis and with supervised methods              and data not shown A supervised analysis comparing          geneexpression patterns of DHTtreated fibroblasts to          ethanoltreated controls was carried out using the SAM          procedure Again no genes could be identified that were          significantly induced or repressed by DHT treatment          Additional experiments using physiological concentrations          of androgen for example    nM methyltrienolone          also failed to disclose any androgenresponsive genes          data not shown In contrast SAM analysis identified           transcripts that differed significantly between          proliferating and confluent cells and  transcripts          that differed between fibroblasts derived from          AISaffected individuals and normal male foreskin          Hierarchical cluster analysis of these experiments          clearly showed the distinct differences in          transcriptional profiles between AISderived and normal          male fibroblasts and between proliferating and normal          fibroblasts Figure  Cells derived from the same          individual and cultured under the same conditions always          showed highly similar geneexpression patterns          suggesting that the differences in expression between          individuals are stable and reproducible despite passage           in vitro Figure                             Discussion        We found consistent characteristic differences in        baseline gene expression patterns between genital skin        fibroblasts from normal males and XY female patients        with AIS Many of these differences between normal and        AISderived fibroblasts were also observed in gonadal        fibroblasts suggesting that these differences are not        purely due to differences in the anatomical site of origin        of the fibroblasts Interestingly fibroblasts derived from        abdominal and forearm skin regions with relatively little        sexual dimorphism showed geneexpression patterns similar        to the labial skin fibroblasts of AIS patients Together        these data suggest that the AR is involved in determining a        stable and stereotypical program of gene expression in        genital fibroblasts that does not require the continuing        presence of androgen for its maintenance        A critical question raised by these results is whether        the observed differences between genital fibroblasts from        males and AIS females reflect cellautonomous effects of        androgen exposure during development or indirect effects        of the ARdependent genital morphogenetic program One        possible interpretation of these data is that the distinct        patterns of expression could have been due to differences        in the origin or the developmental milieu of foreskin        fibroblasts derived from the genital tubercle as opposed        to the labial fibroblasts derived from the genital        swellings     The differences in gene expression we        observed in AIS fibroblasts of gonadal origin compared to        those of labial origin support this view Figure  We        have observed consistent and characteristic differences in        the geneexpression patterns of skin fibroblasts derived        from different locations on the body     However the        current set of experiments suggests that the androgen        receptor has a cellautonomous role which contributes to a        stable androgenindependent geneexpression pattern in        genital fibroblasts Expression patterns in cultured labial        skin fibroblasts derived from two different individuals        with AR mosaicism suggested that the cellautonomous AR        status was a relevant determinant of baseline gene        expression in genital skin fibroblasts Both these        fibroblast lines although derived from morphologically        female genitalia in phenotypically female XY individuals        mosaic for ARinactivating mutations expressed wildtype        AR in the cultured cells These female AISaffected        individuals are thought to have acquired their         AR gene mutations postzygotically            ARD which showed AR protein expression and        binding in the range of normal male foreskin fibroblasts            and see Table  despite its origin from        anatomically female genitalia had a geneexpression        pattern indistinguishable from foreskin fibroblasts of        normal males Figure  The second fibroblast line from an        AR mosaic patient ARD Table  had very low wildtype        AR expression and showed baseline geneexpression patterns        that were nevertheless more similar to normal male foreskin        and prostate fibroblasts than to any of the AISderived        cell lines Figure         The discrepancy between the female phenotype of these        mosaic individuals despite expression of the wildtype AR        in cultured genital skin fibroblasts is not resolved to        date     It may be explained by a timedependent rise        of an originally small fraction of cells containing the        wildtype         AR allele in the mosaic genital        mesenchyme during prenatal and postnatal development or by        differences between         in vivo and         in vitro conditions Yet the        documented expression of the wildtype AR in cultures of        these labial cells supports the idea that the AR status of        the fibroblast was an important intrinsic determinant of        the basal transcription patterns we identified Therefore        the AR appears to be involved in setting longlasting        geneexpression patterns in genital skin fibroblasts        Comparison of geneexpression patterns in genital        fibroblasts from normal and AISaffected individuals and        in fibroblasts from extragenital sites may offer clues to        the programs that underlie external genital development        Both cell adhesion and connective tissue remodeling are        indispensable for normal development and maintenance of        tissue integrity       The differential expression        of proteoglycans collagens and cell adhesion molecules        for example cadherin  might be involved in genital        morphogenesis and later stability of sexually dimorphic        traits of the external genitalia Some genes expressed in        wildtype AR cells could influence androgen signaling For        instance aldoketo reductase C is specifically involved        in cellular androgen metabolism    and thus may        modulate the spectrum of cellular androgenic steroids        available for activation of the AR Structurally different        androgens elicit different patterns of response from        several androgenresponsive promoters suggesting that the        type of ligand present could affect cellular response            Mitogenactivated protein kinase  and STATinduced        STAT inhibitors  and  were expressed at significantly        higher levels in cells with wildtype AR Both MAP kinase        and STAT pathways are involved in ARdependent regulation        and in ligandindependent activation of the AR            Differential expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase A and        alcohol dehydrogenase B enzymes that affect retinoic acid        biosynthesis suggest that other signaling pathways may        participate in the ARinitiated programs of external        genital differentiation             Several genes expressed specifically in the normal male        foreskin fibroblasts have been previously implicated in        male genital development including         HOXA  the Tbox genes         BMP and         DWnt  Mutations in         HOXA can cause distal limb and        urogenitaltract malformations such as male hypospadias in        handfootgenital syndrome     Tbox genes          TBX  are essential early regulators        of limb development and also appear to be involved in male        genital development      Mutations in         TBX cause the ulnarmammary syndrome        characterized by limb apocrine and genital developmental        abnormalities     Expression of Tbox genes   and         was significantly higher in normal male foreskin        fibroblasts than in AIS genital fibroblasts         BMP has been implicated in ductal        budding and branching during prostate development           and a potential role of BMP in external genital        development has also been postulated             DWnt has been found to have roles in        sexspecific cell determination in the gonads and genital        disc of         Drosophila     Thus mutations        in genes characteristically expressed in normal male        foreskin fibroblasts can in some cases lead to defective        genital development The data from these experiments        therefore provide candidate genes for further investigation        in patients with genital malformations        As normal genital skin fibroblasts of XY male        individuals express the AR         in vitro see Table and             we had anticipated that androgen treatment would elicit a        transcriptional response program that could provide        additional insights into the role of androgen in genital        development We have previously used a similar approach to        delineate the transcriptional programs activated in        prostate cancer cells in response to androgen     We        had hoped that comparison of transcriptional responses of        normal fibroblasts to those from AISaffected individuals        with varying degrees of genital ambiguity would provide        still further insights into androgens role in genital        morphogenesis However we were unable to detect any        significant changes in geneexpression patterns in        cultured ARexpressing genital fibroblasts or in        AISderived fibroblasts in response to androgens Although        two previous reports have shown increases in aromatase        enzymatic activity in genital skin fibroblasts treated with        dihydrotestosterone DHT      others have failed to        observe changes in aromatase activity in response to        androgen     In agreement with our findings Elmlinger                et al  found significantly different        baseline expression levels of insulinlike growth factor        IGF and insulinlike growth factor binding protein        IGFBP between normal and AISderived genital skin        fibroblasts and could not detect changes in transcript        levels in response to androgen treatment     In normal        genital fibroblasts androgenresponsive reporter genes can        only be activated by expression of cotransfected AR in the        presence of ligand     Therefore endogenous AR        expression itself may be insufficient in genital skin        fibroblasts to elicit a transcriptional response Moreover        the lack of detectable changes in transcript levels for any        of the  genes in the AISfibroblasts virtually        excludes the possibility that DHT or R could be acting        through other steroid receptors or other signaling        pathways        The differences in androgen responsiveness we have        observed between normal genital fibroblasts and prostate        cancer epithelial cells         in vitro might reflect the responses        seen         in vivo  Prostate epithelial cells        retain exquisite sensitivity to androgen throughout life        Androgen deprivation produces profound involution of the        prostate particularly of the epithelial component but        little or no change in the external genitalia It is        possible that genital mesenchymal cells are only capable of        responding to androgen at discrete stages in development in        their specific         in vivo environment In mice stromal        androgen responsiveness is restricted to the earliest        stages in prostate development and later the epithelial        compartment becomes responsive and remains so     This        responsiveness may be mediated through the expression of        specific AR coregulators Compared to LNCaP cells normal        male genital fibroblasts show distinctly lower baseline        expression of several AR coregulators such as NCOA        GRIP NCOA TRAM ARA RNF data not shown        Thus genital fibroblasts may express critical AR        coregulators at discrete times during development that        allow them to respond by setting up longlasting        transcriptional programs that underlie the genesis and        maintenance of genital morphology                    Conclusions        Our data suggest that in addition to        androgenindependent positional influences on fibroblast        phenotypes the AR is originally involved in establishing        stable and reproducible patterns of gene expression in        stromal cells during genital differentiation which are        reflected in the differences in global geneexpression        patterns between fibroblasts cultured from the genital skin        of normal individuals and females affected by AIS        Comparison of the expression patterns of genital        fibroblasts from XY normal males and XY females with        inactivated AR provides a window on the ARdependent        geneexpression programs within the urogenital mesenchyme        which contribute to the development and structural        integrity of male and female genitalia For further        discrimination of androgenindependent positional effects        from prenatal androgen actions on expression phenotypes of        genital fibroblast strains comparative expression        profiling of homologous genital tissues is needed The        apparent lack of response of genital fibroblasts to        androgen         in vitro  despite expression of a        normal AR has important implications for future research        in defining the role of androgen in genital development and        the pathogenesis of ambiguous genitalia Transcriptional        profiling of the early stages of genital development         in vivo in the presence and absence        of androgen may provide further insights into the role of        androgen in genital development                    Materials and methods                  Cell strains          Primary cultures of genital fibroblasts were          established from genital skin biopsies labia majora or          gonadal biopsies in female AIS patients and from the          foreskin of normal males undergoing circumcision          Abdominal skin fibroblasts were derived from the midline          above the mons pubis of a fertile male during abdominal          surgery Forearm skin fibroblasts from a normal male were          a gift from H Chang Department of Biochemistry          Stanford University Peripheral zone prostate          fibroblasts were a gift from D Peehl Department of          Urology Stanford University and were established from a          histologically normal region of a patient undergoing          prostatectomy for prostate cancer who had not been          previously treated with hormonal therapy Hormonebinding          assays using methyltrienolone R          hydroxymethylestrotrienone and          androgen receptor sequencing have been described          previously                              Cell culture and hormone treatment          For determination of basal geneexpression profiles          without androgen stimulation fibroblasts were cultured          on mm plastic dishes at C with  CO             To eliminate possible artifacts          due to differing states of proliferation cells were          grown to confluence at which point they enter G            arrest     They were maintained          in phenolredfree DMEM F Dulbeccos modified Eagle          Medium with the nutrient mix F Gibco containing          Lglutamine  mM Hepes buffer penicillinstreptomycin          Gibco and  of a constant lot of certified fetal          calf serum FCS Gibco The pH was adjusted to  with           N NaOH and the medium was exchanged every  h At day           the last media exchange was carried out and  h later          cells were scraped and mRNA harvested directly          Androgen stimulation of genital fibroblasts was          carried out under two different culture conditions          similar to those previously reported to produce induction          of aromatase enzymatic activity in these cell lines               In the first cells were grown to confluence as          described above using phenolredfree DMEM F containing          Lglutamine  mM Hepes buffer penicillinstreptomycin          Gibco with  charcoalstripped steroidfree FCS          DSFCS Hyclone to ensure androgendepleted          conditions in control cells With every media exchange          every  h cells received either ethanol in a final          dilution of  or  nM dihydrotestosterone DHT          dissolved in ethanol The last DHT treatment was          administered with the last media exchange  h before          lysate preparation In total six doses of

seeded at a density of  cells          per cm in mm plates Twentyfour hours later medium          was removed and cells were washed three times with new          media containing  DSFCS then cultured for another          h interval in the absence of androgens Cells were          then treated with either  ethanol  nM or           nM DHT dissolved in ethanol After  h incubation          exponentially growing cells were harvested LNCaP cells          passaged and treated under similar conditions were used          as a positive control for androgen reponsiveness

cDNAs representing           UniGene clusters were manufactured as described              Hybridizations were performed using equal amounts          of Cy and Cylabeled cDNAs according to previously          published protocols     Hybridized microarrays were          scanned using a GenePix array scanner and analyzed          with GenePix Pro  software Axon Instruments Union          City CA

in the analysis To correct for          variations in cDNA labeling efficiency we normalized the          CyCy fluorescence ratios for all genes in each array          hybridization to obtain an average log            ratio of  We restricted our          analysis to genes with measurable expression in  of          the samples we analyzed We used the SAM procedure             to identify genes with statistically significant          differences in baseline expression levels between normal          and AIS genital fibroblasts The SAM procedure computes a          twosample Tstatistic for example for normal vs AIS          cell lines for the normalized log ratios of          geneexpression levels for each gene It thresholds the          Tstatistics to provide a significant gene list

   and results were visualized using          TreeView software              To identify the effects of androgen treatment on gene          expression in genital fibroblasts we carried out a set          of  DNA microarray analyses of mRNA from normal and AIS          genital fibroblasts This dataset included cells treated          at confluence G             or during exponential          proliferation as described above Raw data were filtered          normalized and centered as described above We used the          SAM procedure to identify transcripts with significant          differences in expression with reference to the origin of          the fibroblast lines whether the cells were confluent or          proliferating and whether they had been treated with
