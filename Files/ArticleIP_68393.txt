                                 McCain Knocks Himself Out                                              Editors note  Click to read Jacob Weisbergs report fromThursdays GOP debate                        Fromthe opening bell of Thursday nights Republican presidential debate JohnMcCain went hard after George W Bush But McCains punches were awkwardlythrownin part because the other candidates crowded the ring keeping Bush andMcCain apartand Bush absorbed the blows with genial poise Though Bushsperformance was otherwise clumsy and lackluster he won by playing ropeadopeHe let McCain wear out himself and the patience of viewers Heres a scorecardof their exchanges                            McCain is asked whether he acted improperly by asking theFederal Communications Commission to expedite its review of a transaction byone of McCains campaign donors McCain tries to change the subject to BushOur money is coming in very well by the way Not anywhere near  millionbut its coming along pretty good The implicit message of this quip is Ifyou want to look at somebodys fund raising look at Bushs McCain deliversit with a grin that suggests hes just razzing Bush The grin isnt designed toprotect Bush Its designed to protect McCain Youre not supposed to get angryat him and neither is Bush since McCain is just having fun right Bushchuckles along playing the good sport McCain leaves a bruise without lookingmean One point to McCain                            Moderator Tim Russert invites Bush to hit McCain on the FCCstory but Bush says McCain has addressed the story adequately Instead Bushcriticizes McCains campaignreform plan which he claims would unilaterallydisarm the GOP McCain fires back What youre saying is that we shouldcontinue what happened in  Thats disgraceful Chinese money Indonesianmoney came into the campaign  Right now a supporter of yours is runningattack ads morphing Bill Clintons face into mine And by the way ask him toget a better picture will you Everyone laughs McCain grins again addingAnd ask him at least to disclose where this money is coming from            Noticehow McCain manipulates the evidence Bush opposes a particular campaignreformplan From this McCain infers that Bush favors disgraceful fundraisingpractices Meanwhile a Bush supporter is running ads against McCain Fromthis McCain infers that Bush can tell this supporter what to do And in caseanyone misses the implication that Bush is funding the ads in violation ofcampaignfinance laws McCain tells Bush to ask his supporter where the adcampaigns money is coming from Another point to McCain for landing a secondblow and leaving em laughing                            Bush repeats that McCains plan is bad for RepublicansRussert tries to move on but McCain interrupts and tells Bush Youve raised million and I dont think you have an idea of how importantcampaignfinance reform is to restore the confidence of young Americans intheir government Bush replies What you dont need to do is tell me what Ihave an idea about or not Bush stares ahead McCain stares at Bush McCaindoesnt let up I dont believe you have a good idea he says Otherwiseyoud get on board McCain grins again but only at the end He has deliveredmost of his blast with a scowl His mask is slipping and his criticism isturning personal One point to Bush                            Halfway through the debate Russert asks McCain how hewould shore up Social Security and Medicare McCain replies that theres asurplus Then he turns the question on Bush We dont want to spend it all intax cuts he says Gov Bush said the other day that were awash in cashWeve got a  trillion debt that were saddling young Americans with Weought to pay down the debt This shot at Bush like the one about the million comes out of nowhere To get from Russerts question to Bushs taxplan McCain has twisted the topic completely out of shape A candidate can getaway with reaching this far for a punch once but not twice Another point toBush                            When Bush tries to respond to McCains criticism of histaxcut proposal McCain barks Could I finish my answer Hello McCain is grinning but the grin is becoming ghoulish and his voice is risingto a tightly wound pitch Bush maintains an air of ease and good humor asthough the exchange is friendly Eventually Bush gets a word in No one issuggesting we pass the entire surplus back to the taxpayers he says Butyour plan does McCain interjects No it doesnt says Bush Yes itdoes says McCain Bush blinks in amused disbelief and when asked by Russertto respond jokes No it doesnt yes it does no it doesnt Everyonechuckles Not only has McCain lost his temper but Bush has bailed him out andhas come through smiling Two more points to Bush                            In his closing statement Bush says Im the one person uphere whos been elected to an executive position When McCains turn comes hetells Bush George Ive had executive experience I was commanding officer ofthe largest squadron in the United States Navy It was a great experienceThis doesnt contradict what Bush saidanother wild swing by McCainbut nevermind McCain just wants to point out that he went to Vietnam and Bush didntBy now McCains expression is utterly humorless            The week began with rumorsthat McCain was doing so well Bush was going to attack him Instead McCainspends the evening attacking Bush He lands few blows and he wears out his ownimage as a goodnatured idealist Round  of  goes to Bush
