        okay this is really ironic that this would i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away  and its just   oh no   been tearing me up all day  because we have just been looking all over for him weve been to the pound weve been to the humane society weve been to the adoption   oh i bet   center weve just been all over the neighborhood weve been calling neighbors so this is just really strange  that   oh i guess so have you lost him before   no this is the first time um hes gotten out before but hes always stayed right here you know hes never gone away and so this is just really strange you know because um   uhhuh uhhuh what kind of a dog is he   hes part golden lab and part uh lets see Alaskan no not Alaskan i always forget  uh Australian shepherd   yeah oh boy hes a big one then huh   and yeah hes pretty big thats why it it really surprises me you know that he hasnt come back because like i said hes never gone away like this before and i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something i dont know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big you know but i dont know   yeah oh well i i hope he comes back thats too bad how long have you had him   thanks i do too oh about two years so hes yeah its really gosh   oh thats tough yeah you get very attached to animals dont you   that isnt that funny how we do i mean we just really   yes well you know theyre always there for you and they dont talk back to you and uh  its kind of pleasant yeah sure sure   yeah well theyre companions you know theyre really well do you have any pets   yes we have a little a dog a little white Lhasa and her name is Angel and we have a cat who a white cat hes hes just a Tabby just a and his name is Dominique we call him Neek but   um  how do they get along together   pretty good uh weve we had the the dog first and um shes kind of a wimp and and the cat kind of rules but uh uh she she likes him all right he we had another cat uh       about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep and uh then we got this new cat so i   um   i have two children and they really enjoy the animals and then my mother who is very elderly lives with us and shes really good friends with the dog theyre very good buddies   oh yeah thats what are so neat about animals i mean they are you know like i said theyre theyre really companions you know and theyre friends you know i mean they   thats right   you can love them all you want and they love you right back and they dont yeah no  i know its just so neat you know its   thats right they dont care what you look like or what you act like they just love you unconditionally its wonderful   thats i dont know  this is just so hard   its just like i said weve had him for two years and hes never i mean hes hes gotten out   its oh i know it has to be   but hes always been right there hes never been gone from at all you know hes just always been right there when he gets out you know its the first time hes ever been gone like this   uhhuh uhhuh oh yeah oh thats really too bad thats awful well   uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didnt it was like oh no  so i dont know   well i ill i hope youll find him you most likely will   yeah we keep you know they they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know dont give up hope you know and then   well have you put any posters up or anything like that   well not yet we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we   umhum   we were trying to find some pictures of him recently weve got so many when he was a puppy   uhhuh yeah   you know but we just dont have a whole lot we have him on film you know on the video camera  you know but you cant put that on the  you know so   umhum umhum yeah no you sure cant oh dear   so i dont know i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up   well thats good   and hopefully that will help you know and maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too you know if they can keep yeah   they can keep their eyes open yeah that will help well   so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out hell come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so   yeah yeah yeah he will i bet he does i know that its hard on you i know that id be worried too   nope i know its just like i said its just so ironic that this would happen you know and i would get this this kind of a call  yeah it just i know its really strange but   yeah isnt it though that is thats yeah i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night and when hes not right at the door in the morning i really worry that somethings happened to him that somebody hes got in a fight or you know somebodys hit him and and uh and if he doesnt come by mid morning then i really get scared but hes always come back eventually so   well thats good thats one thing about cats though theyre so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if theyre not right there   yeah yeah they can yeah yeah well but hes a real feisty guy he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesnt want them on our property its   is that right   hes cats are really almost more territorial than than dogs are they just really do not want other animals on their property theyre very very he he just any cat that comes near and even a dog he wont he wont jump at them or anything but hell sit and hell watch and it and he i think maybe he would if it came real close but hes very protective of our property   huh thats really i i guess i really dont know cats that well because my mother never liked them so i never had them growing up so you know i never really had them around me you know so ive never owned one  you know but   so uhhuh yeah well theyre uh really a lot different than dogs because theyre not theyre very independent and uh theyre very hes hes very affectionate when he wants to be but if you want him to be and he doesnt want to be hell just hell you know either scratch you or or run away um but when he wants to be   huh   uh hes really affectionate he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and and and snuggle up to you and but if hes not in the mood youd better stay away from him so but dogs seem to be always in the mood theyre always you know right there and like like you to pet them and loving and so   huh yeah thats true i i like the way they come up and theyll theyll put their head underneath your hand you know its that uh and most dogs do that i mean i dont know any that really dont i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just   yeah yeah oh yeah they do hm they sure do   you know come up and they put your you know  or theyll rub their their head against you you know and its its   yeah is now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outside   well no well well hes outside during the day and then when we get home at night we do bring him in   and you have a fenced yard or uhhuh   yeah uhhuh yeah the backyard its real big too for him to run in and stuff thats why we couldnt understand why he would want to get out  you know because he got all this room to run in and   yeah well how did he get out   but he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we we filled it back up   oh boy umhum   put him back in there he did it again  so we chained him up you know but we really didnt want to keep him chained up because you know we feel like thats just too restricting for him so um   umhum umhum right right   we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it you know so that he couldnt get out well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire so i cant i i i just have not   umhum oh   i dont understand you know because its like uh hes got a good home you know hes got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you know its like we cant understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldnt   yeah yeah well you know that animals are like that they like to roam and investigate and   yeah i guess thats yeah i guess thats probably true i dont think its anything we did  least i would hope not no i i know i mean hes always you know he really does have a good home i think thats what really   and see whats going on no no im sure that yeah   bothers me the most about it you know its like   yeah how are your kids handling it   well i dont know if its really quite hit him hit them  uh i have two girls and they they just been real um   uhhuh uhhuh   i dont know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now its like um well if he doesnt come home can we get another dog its like wait a minute you know   yeah yes that sounds like kids  uhhuh  oh   poor Buddy you know i said hes only been gone a day and you already want to replace him  Buddy umhum   whats his name did you call Buddy  we thats whats our cats name that that that died oh yeah we named him uh uh we named him Buddy after uh Buddy Bell uh uh   is that right   the Ranger baseball player that used to be here  and we used to we were really into that when we got him   oh   going to the Ranger games and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason but Buddy after Buddy Bell so but he was he was a good cat too we miss him a lot and i feel feel i feel real guilty because   thats funny yeah it just   we had him like for six years and one year i forgot to get his leukemia booster and he got it   oh   and i just felt so bad i its real contagious and its and the vet said it runs rampant in this area and if they dont have their booster   i didnt know that   any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like they get it if the other cat has it so   i had no i had no idea i did not know that   oh oh it was terrible i just felt terrible and i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was he was just real getting real skinny
