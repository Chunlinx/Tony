                                 A Little Bit of Sole            In these bodyconsciousdays feet do get their due Ask any girl Shoes matter as much as hairstyle inall walks of life and infinitely more than gloves and hats despite being sonear the ground Buying shoes demands sizable chunks of time and money and theeventual decision generates more existential agony about their looks than abouttheir fit Pain in the feet may be negotiable pain in the image never Passionor hatred can be ignited by one glance in a shoe store window If the lust of ashoppers eye is slaked by actual purchase her willing feet accept thechallenge her active spirit expands The other night I looked across arestaurant at a sexy young woman who appeared to be limping She wasntthough not at all really She was just wearing inch spike heel inchplatform sole tightfitting thighhigh boots and making her spectacular wayamong the tables to the exit            The current display atthe Museum at Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City is calledShoes A Lexicon of Style It focuses on the amazing range of design inmodern womens shoes Theres no history here no sociological detachmentonlythe look divided into categories for maximum impact Drama is increased by theuse of a single lighted showcase running the length of the pitchdark room withno interruptions no pauses for breath You move along in one directionmesmerized by a single great sweep of shoes arranged in pairs on three risingtiers under vivid lights Emotional tension mounts laughter and wonderalternate with lust and disgust no relief is offered from the first stilettoheel to the last bulbous Nike            Apart from a few historic examples such as some satinpumps with celluloid heels from  most of these styles date from the lastthree decades even from the last three years This show indicates that only inthe last third of this century have designers really hit their stride withvarieties of shoe material shoe shape shoe trim and shoe attachmentNevertheless one of my favorites here was designed in  by Herbert Levinea pair of stilettoheeled soles with no uppers at all nothing but someinvisible adhesive pads to hold each shoe against the wearers bare sole Theseshoes would look as if they had grown there by some potent fashionsorcery            Another great shoe momentis a  pair of tabi toe ankle boots by Martin Margiela Japanesetabi are white cotton socks with a practical cleft between big andsecond toe to go under thong sandals but as a beige leather highheeled bootthe effect is that of a perfect cloven hoof I once saw these being worn inParis Emerging casually from under a pair of pants they made my hair stand onend            Suggestive shoe artifice comes in many varieties Onecurious example by Junya Watanabe is a flat shoe draped and upholstered in roseand gold brocade so that each foot becomes a rich little shoeshaped cushionat the nethermost point of the body Opposed to that is the lethal weaponstyle which usually involves a fierce high heel often skinny and slanted inan odd direction like a halfopen switchblade with fastenings for the shoethat run to grim metallic buckles or very toothy zippers Even fiercer is ahighheeled sandal by Todd Oldham with straps of spiky barbed wire that crossthe foot and climb up around the calf This sandal seems to attack the wearerstender skin and the viewers horrified eye together until we learn from thelabel that its really all made of soft rubber and must feel deliciouslytickly On the other hand of course theres Dr Scholls health sandal buteven that wholesome item in this show anyway boasts a leopardprintstrap            A womans foot is alwaysengaged in a tense visual dialogue with her shoe demonstrating its own shapeand flexibility against the shoes claims displaying its own erotic capacitiesin tandem with those of the suggestive object Here we see how high heels canbe globular or pyramidal golden or barklike slim as bending flower stems orthick as beams straps can be suave ribbons or stiff manacles Shapes aremostly variants of the mule and the pump the oxford and the moccasin the bootand the sandal the muffin and the hot

or perversely masculine female footgear comes the SneakerChic section Now we enter the huge athletic universe of canvas and rubberwith all its hightech spinoffs and hangerson Manolo Blahnik gives way

itself In this worldthe watchwords are stability traction and support But no one is fooled Thelook is the true issue So potent is the element of style in active sport shoesthat great fashion designers have gone for it producing hybrids such asGaultiers spikeheeled sneakers and Chanels black deckshoecumsneakerwith the big double C gleaming on its white toe            Fashion is at its mostvolatile in the sport shoe world Hip insider models can die in a few monthsif the mainstream adopts them and be quickly replaced by new cult favoritesMuch urban chic thus dwells in beautifully engineered shoes built for strainbut worn by people who would never dream of putting them to the test BeauBrummell who invented modern urban cool in the s would thoroughly approveof such delicate perversity Only style is the true test Utility is really ofno interest but its presence is essential It governs the beauty of theshoe            Since thats the point the foot retreats from the visualgame and the enveloping shoe leads its own bright life As we move along theshowcase these shoes begin more and more to resemble pairs of small sportscars and to suggest similar methods of marketing and design Here we find thevivid brand names the poetic model names the features invented for theirfunction but displayed for their looksall evoking motion action swiftpersonal transport perhaps into a better world
