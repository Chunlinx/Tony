                                 A House of Ones Own            A bigger garage A cedarcloset An extralarge laundry room Are these the stuff of womens dreamsTraditional                Home  a homedesign magazine for suburban women ofchildbearing age thinks so The magazine surveyed  women to find out whatthey wanted in their homes Some of the questions were about things Whats atthe top of your wish list What would be in your dream house Others were aboutfeelings What do you like about your home Would you move Who really makesthe decisions            Notsurprisingly the women wanted more storage space maybe a whirlpool bath andcould foresee a day when their homes would feel like empty nests or crowdedhouses Electronics were low on their lists But the women were also attachedto their domiciles however imperfect Eightytwo percent said their homes weremost like a resort a place to relax A majority said they were thedecisionmakers where the house was concerned and that they wanted to stayput            Traditional Home then offered its readers a solutionto their dilemmas a lessthantraditional homea flexible housethat theowners could change easily as their needs changed without remodeling ormoving Readers loved the idea they voiced doubts mainly about the cost andso Traditional                Home entered the homebuilding business TheBuilt by Women project a model home designed by women for womenincorporates the survey responses into plans for a dream house The magazinesNovember issue gave readers a first look at room layouts and faades for theproject and the January issue offers roombyroom photos of the first housebuilt in a Dallas suburb Editor Karol DeWulf Nickell will be offering asatellite tour as well Already some readers for just  are buying theplans to build these homes themselves            The Builtby Women house designed by Chicago architect Margaret McCurry comes withthree faade options New England clapboard ever trendy Tudor and a yellowTexas brick Many American subdivisions offer houses with similar basichistorical toucheswroughtiron porch halftimbers above the doorbut leavethe front wall fortresslike with a garage door a front door and a smalllookout window the only apertures I was in Phoenix recently looking at asubdivision with new houses where there was a twocar garage in front and thefront doorno other window on the street McCurry said I could drive intothat community and kidnap a little girl and no one would see McCurry addswindows to let women watch the street as they read work or clean both asecurity system for a paranoid age and a symbol of the oldfashioned Americandreampicture window pastel drapes and all            From the outside Built by Women is merely asturdier version of the houses that builders slap down outside cities plantingtwo or three spindly trees by the driveway and calling it landscaping Thereare no communal kitchens or marble bathrooms thats not what the women in thesurvey wanted Instead McCurry wanted to give women a house that makes theirdaytoday routine comfortable Readers who had recently built or remodeledsaid their homes reflected their designers fancies not their own needsCounters were too high misplaced lights cast shadows when women applied theirmakeup there was more space for formal entertaining than for family dinnersNot so in McCurrys model Readers said they wanted the areas where they spentthe most time to have space and light so McCurry has provided a spaciouslaundry room generous hallways a living room thats small enough tostraighten easily but large enough to fit the whole family            The womensurveyed did want to retain some ceremonial space so theres a formal fronthall and parlor off the doubleheight foyer in the model house But otherwisethe emphasis is on the practical The bathrooms the stairs and large closetsare packed into a strip down the center of the house and two sets of threerooms are lined up on either side The garage fits within the rectangularfootprint of the house but along the side so it no longer dominates the frontof the house The kitchen is positioned between the family room and the diningroom separated by swinging doors The childrens playroom is upstairs and overthe garage so the rugrats can jump up and down to their hearts content            The Built by Women house sounds superficially like theopen plan the vogue in the s that was also supposed to offer ultimateflexibility But the open plan proved less permanent than the lava lamp No onewanted just a folding screen between the childrens and parents bedrooms Noone wanted to read a book in a drafty multipurpose area That was for swingersalways planning their next key party The s flexible house is all aboutfamily Family members can retreat to their own rooms insulated from warringmusical tastes by hallways bathrooms and closets They have their ownentrances a motherinlaw suite on the first floor a back door for dirtykids a front door for first impressions The entire family can come togetheraround the dinner table restored to central status from its incarnation as anook or a counter McCurrys house has lots of doorways and entrances so thatthe motherinlaw and the children can find their own way to the dining room atdinner time or exit when the parents need more privacy The living room can bea homeentertainment center when the kids are young it is well insulated soBarney need not take over the house and then a home office in the emptyneststage its wired for the Internet            The Built by Women model homeencloses a clear theory about keeping your family intact Oldstyle feminismwould have quarreled with Traditional                Home s premise that womencared and wanted to care more about their homes than men do and rejected theidea that the newstyle dream house would involve more space for houseworkBut the magazines contribution feminist in its own way is the utility of aplan that allows each room to have another function depending on the age of theowners their children and their parentsutility in the service of familyunity The Built by Women house is like a new wardrobe with all the promise ofthe early Donna Karan a house that fits and stretches and wont go out ofstyle Built by Womens goal is to put the average American family in a housethat suits for as long as possible
