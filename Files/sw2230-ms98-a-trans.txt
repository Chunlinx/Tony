        why do you think so few people vote then   why do i think so few people vote i i think a lot of it is uh apathy um um for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people figure why bother you know whats the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal um and in others cases you know they they see themselves as one voter in a million and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they they feel like one vote doesnt have an impact   umhum   and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our minority issues the we had the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin um and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go the way that it didnt go but they also had very low voter turnouts especially like in the Hispanic community and i think in that case theyve just they developed a distrust of the system and so theyve chosen not to participate in it   umhum   and i think thats part of it   what part what part would you say the big brother aspect plays the people that dont want to be called for   what do you think   jury duty or or things that theyve heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just dont bother   oh ive ive heard people say that i know its its a real thing and i think it makes a difference as to how many people vote apparently not being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them that they dont want to have any say in uh politics   hum okay and then what about the smaller election say some of the city elections uh even down to the uh school board type uh elections i guess there are so many       that you can uh weed out the ones that you really want to partake in   yeah yeah well last November was my first election in Dallas ive only lived in Dallas a little over a year and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for and i mean i didnt know anything about any of these races i didnt know what the responsibilities of the judges were i didnt know anything about the individuals whos names were on the ballet and im going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here   umhum   so whats the point in voting for these people i i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through darts at a board   right well its a shame that uh that even the politician who wants to give give out good information about himself uh has trouble in virtually everything he does say thats positive or or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information uh and then once you get off the candidates personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the candidate feels about that   umhum   theres theres very little room for or very little time to handle all the different things youd like to know about a candidate and then unfortunately after you do get some of that information you may find out it werent true to begin with  so   yeah you you think then that uh part of it is because the uh it flashes too much on the personal uh characteristics of the candidate rather than his uh job performance issues   i would say that its much easier to deal with the the the public the uh media thats thats giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with uh any personality quirk or any negatives that theyve found or any skeleton in the closet   umhum   than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can listen to either side of a given issue   yeah   uh and its pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that Texas uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you dont even fathom what the implications are of theyre decision so who would you care who got in that position you know   id id say yeah id say theres a large number especially of urban young voters that dont know what the Railroad Commission does   right   and so they go you know who who who what does it matter who i vote for   right   i think well thats one thing ive noticed ive ive lived a couple of different places ive noticed Texas seems to have more elective offices than any place ive ever been   so hence more apathy  i guess or confusion   well a lot more confusion you know i in in other towns ive never called upon to decide all this long list of judges ive never been called upon to decide you know  were were voting for Railroad commissioner and and uh Land commissioner and that sort of thing and in other state these would be appointments of the governor   umhum   we wouldnt be expected to cast a ballet on the subject   hum boy that makes the governors vote a whole lot more important doesnt it   well it does   yeah a lot more appointees i guess makes him carry a lot more weight   umhum but it also means youve got a unified state government you dont have different departments pulling against each other   thats probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can at least get his party together        yeah yeah   so hum   the the the big problem i guess with the the mass media is you know uh you dont have time to educate the public on these matters because the public is not going to sit still and  soak the message in   umhum   i mean anything that cant be covered in thirty seconds or less theyre not going to care about it   right   or or if you cant dramatize it and put it on Unsolved Mysteries then theyre not going to you know theyre not going to want to hear it   do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in   uh the the line what i waited maybe ten minutes in line it was it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly worth it to me i think   did you go early in the morning or   i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest   after work hum thats interesting well where in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the school and so we   uhhuh   i drive out of my complex early in the morning and go over there usually before the polls even open and and vote right at the you know number one or two sometimes the third or fourth person in in line   umhum   and i wait longer to to watch them set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down Central and not be bothered by the the traffic as it were     yeah   because normally im im at work before seven so uh just stay a little later that as it were and and make the the effort to vote uh but unfortunately since there are so many other things that uh our city wants to vote on   hum   they dont they they tend to make the elections if its a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles so i dont always i dont always vote at the same place so its a little bit more trouble for me to well this elections going to be held this date and ive got to go over here   so you have to go a little out of your way huh yeah yeah   and ive got to remember uh you know on this election im in this district in this election im for here and uh you know this precinct votes here   umhum   and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want   yeah yeah i would also like better information on on what on you know what am i voting on and and who just some general statements about the candidates i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers   umhum   and i didnt see much of it like you know i see you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that youre being called upon to decide theres very little information on   umhum   as far as you know what what is the duties of this political office and uh and what are the characteristics or what what are the issued statements and uh spoken goals of the uh candidates   right   id like to get   probably wouldnt even hurt to have a section that says heres how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over the last several years you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular judge or this particular uh Railroad Commission for instance does   yeah   if if you know if he he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the guy to to blame for this if uh you didnt like what happened   umhum   you are right there is no uh no such deal other than the small publication that uh uh League of Women Voters puts out it supplements that newspaper that i get a local newspaper they they published but uh nothing per se in the major newspaper and as hungry as they are for things to print youd think theyd want to do that   yeah well they the Dallas Morning News did publish a a section that covered the major races and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of better informed decisions but still uh you know it it left a lot of the the the local races the races unique to my precinct uh up in the air there is one thing that that did annoy me and that is the the my congressman last fall didnt have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice   umhum   and i think uh in some districts you know theres a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it that uh you know why vote when its decided already   right   that sort of attitude   thats true with so many elected officials i guess theres just so many people to go around  in some of those cases   yeah   hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go   well we used the five minutes up   yeah at least  bye   okay all right bye
