UNDER  USC  aBiiv OF A MAJOR RULEISSUED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY EPA ENTITLEDACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS RISK MANAGEMENTPROGRAMS UNDER CLEAN AIR ACT SECTION r RINADi Costbenefit analysisBecause EPA determined that the rule was an economicallysignificant regulatory action under terms of Executive Order it prepared an economic impact analysis in support of therule on risk management program regulations It submitted thatanalysis to the General Accounting Office on June   alongwith a copy of its final rule The economic impact analysisdescribes the regulatory options EPA considered for revising itsearlier proposed risk management requirements and estimates thecosts and benefits attributable to these optionsThe chart below extracted from the analysis shows that withthe exception of the first year EPA believes that the cost of thebenefits associated with the implementation of the rulesrequirements greatly exceed the costs of implementation of theruleANNUALIZED NET COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE FINAL RULEIn addition to the estimated benefits of reduced damages fromreleases of toxic substances EPAs analysis also highlights whatthe agency believes to be additional qualitative benefits includingthose resulting from efficiency gains increased technologytransfer indirect cost savings increased goodwill and increasedpublic awarenessGAOOGCii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and Section  Initial regulatory flexibility analysesThe Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies toevaluate the effects of a proposed rule on small entities EPAprepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis in compliancewith section  of the Act it published a summary of thatanalysis in the preamble to the proposed rule in the FederalRegister on October    Fed Reg  The analysisconcluded that the economic burden for initial compliance would beminimal for about  percent of the small businesses affected Forthe remaining  percent however the analysis stated that theprogram would impose a significant adverse effect in the firstyearBased on the information presented during public hearings and incomments received on the proposed rule EPA published asupplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Registeron March    Fed Reg  The agency included in thepreamble to the revised proposed rule a summary of its updatedregulatory flexibility analysis The analysis concluded that therule as proposed in  would have had severe adverse effects onsmall businesses The revised analysis evaluates three alternativesto the initially proposed rule and assesses the burdens and impactsof each According to the EPAs discussion the streamlinedrequirements of the revised proposed rule drastically reduce theburden on both small businesses and small communitiesSection  Final regulatory flexibility analysisEPA published a summary of its final regulatory flexibilityanalyses as required by section  of the Act in the FederalRegister on June    Fed Reg  EPA estimated thatthe total number of small entities affected by the rule was or  percent of the affected universe No detailed analysis of theimpact on small entities was performed because of the relativelylow cost of implementation estimated by EPA for most manufacturerssubstantially less than  percent of sales the first year andconsiderably less in subsequent years for nonmanufacturers lessthan  for initial complianceAccording to EPAs analysis a number of decisions adopted inthe final rule specifically the adoption of tiers programsthe reduced requirements for the risk management plan and thedevelopment of guidance for offsite consequence analysis havesignificantly reduced the burden on small entities EPA consideredcomments on both the initial and the proposed rule in making thesedecisionsAll analyses prepared in accordance with this Act were submittedto the Chief Counsel Small Business AdministrationPage  GAOOGCSection  Preparation of analysisEPAs analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions ofthe effects of the rule and alternatives on small entitiesSection  Participation by small entitiesEPA included small entities from both government and businessin focus groups public hearings seminars and meetings to developthis ruleiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  EPA has determined that this rule contains a federal mandatethat may result in expenditures of  million or more for statelocal and tribal governments or the private sector in only itsfirst year In compliance with section  of the Unfunded MandatesReform Act EPA prepared a written statement including a costbenefit analysis assessing the impact of the rule which itpublished with both the proposed and the final rule As discussedpreviously EPA considered the future compliance costs in assessingthe impact of the ruleConsistent with the intergovernmental provisions of sections and  of the Act and Executive Order  Enhancing theIntergovernmental Partnership EPA involved state local andbusiness representatives in focus groups public hearingsseminars and meetings to develop the ruleSection  of the Act requires agencies to identify andconsider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and toadopt the least costly most costeffective or least burdensomealternative that achieves the objectives of the rule The preambleto the final rule indicates that EPA evaluated three differentmethodologies for implementation It ultimately chose what itbelieved to be the least costly and least burdensomealternativeiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqThis rule was promulgated through the general notice of proposedrulemaking procedures of the Act  USC   EPA affordedinterested persons several opportunities to comment Followingpublication of the proposed rule  Fed Reg  EPA heldfour public hearings and received approximately  writtencomments Because of these comments EPA issued a supplementalnotice of proposed rulemaking on March    FR  forcomment onPage  GAOOGCapproaches for setting different requirements for sources thatpose different levels of hazard tiering worstcase releases andother hazard assessment issues accident information reportingpublic participation inherently safer approaches andimplementation and integration of section r with stateprograms particularly state air permitting programs EPA held apublic hearing on March   in Washington DC and receivedmore than  written comments In total commenters represented chemical manufacturers  other chemical users  petroleumindustry companies  industry trade associations  other tradeassociations  agricultural supply retailers  propaneretailers  explosives users  water treatment facilities utilities  state agencies  local governments  other federalagencies  academics and consultants  environmental groups labor unions and  private citizens This rule reflects EPAsconsideration of all comments major issues raised by commentersand EPAs response are briefly discussed in the preamble A summaryof all comments submitted and EPAs response to them is availableat the agencyPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The rule imposes information collection requirements in theregistration process in the preparation and submission of the riskmanagement plans and in the maintenance of onsite documentationEPA describes in the preamble to the rule the reasons for thecollection of information the type of information and an estimateof the burden imposed on the source Both initial and supplementalproposed rule publications invited comments on the informationcollection requirements imposed by the rule  Fed Reg  Fed Reg Section c of the Act requires each agency to establish anindependent process to review each proposed collection ofinformation before submitting the proposal to OMB for review EPAsOffice of Program Planning and Evaluation conducted such a reviewEPA subsequently sent the information collection requirements tothe Office of Management and Budget for approval under the Act USC  a and  EPAs discussion of its compliancewith the Paperwork Reduction Act was omitted from the final ruleincluding the agencys response to comments by OIRA required to bediscussed in the final rule by  USC  dConsequently there is no evidence in EPAs filing of OIRAscomments on approval or disapproval of the agencys informationcollection requirements EPA did however reduce the potentialburden of required information collection in drafting the finalrule See discussion belowEPA appears to meet the OMB requirement  CFR a that agencies evaluate the use of automatedelectronic or other technological collection forms by allowingsources to register and file risk management plans electronicallythus avoiding what could have been a huge paperwork burdenPage  GAOOGCExecutive Order No Based on its economic impact the rule was determined to be aneconomically significant regulatory action within the meaning ofExecutive Order  EPA submitted both the proposed rule and thefinal rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory AffairsOIRA for review According to EPA OIRA raised some concernsabout the scope of information collection requirements initiallyproposed by EPA EPA addressed OIRAs concerns by lessening theinformation collection requirements for risk management plans inits final rule In the Federal Register notice EPA describedlessening risk management plan information requirements asfollows   EPA has limited the requirements for information to thatwhich can be reported as data elements In contrast the rule asproposed would have required sources to document for each processall major hazards the consequences of each of these hazards therisk reduction steps taken to address each hazard and theconsequences of each risk reduction step The result would havebeen for large complex sources documents of a l pages ormoreStatutory authorization for the ruleThis rule is promulgated under sections a a titleV of the Clean Air Act as amended  USC   rai f The intent of section r is to preventaccidental releases to the air and mitigate the consequences ofsuch releases by focusing prevention measures on chemicals
