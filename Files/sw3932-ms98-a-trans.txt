        all right     its going to be a hard one huh why   yeah i think so i i dont know well im not one in finances first of all and but i do try try to keep a family budget what about you   uhhuh um you know its its its a it is a hard one because we dont have a budget  we barely have enough to cover what we have let alone keep a budget     well thats the way with us thats why i said i try to keep one with my husband isnt working and uh yeah and and it makes it real tough youre right   oh is that right that makes it real tough huh so how do you how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that your bills are paid and   well i rob Peter to pay Paul i pay the utilities and the most expensive uh biggest bills at the first of the month   yeah uhhuh   and then i look buy the groceries and the smaller bills like like middle of the month but i have it exed out to last me for the whole month and he works contract work occasionally so that helps hes an electronics engineer an electronics engineer   huh what does he do a what uhhuh   and uh he works mainly on aircraft and he was working with Eastern and Eastern uh went bankrupt   oh is that right   so yeah so um   well thats tough yeah especially these days when uh the economy is so bad yeah i work on commission and um   he he he he said he yeah     and that makes it tough too because i you know you cant you cant always budget what you you know you cant have the same budget every month because uh you know uh   thats true what kind of work do you do   uh i am in the roofing business commercial roofing business   oh uhhuh   and so you know i may do real well this month but uh next month it may you know may not rain at all and we not have any work so   that makes it really hard too   it makes it really hard to to set any budget and uh you know so um i guess its uh       it you know each family has their own own way of doing it i i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what what needs to be paid so that we dont you know we dont have the lights turned off or have the electric water turned off or the phone turned off       do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or anything like that   and no i dont um  mostly mostly mostly mostly because we dont uh yeah so how about you   have it to do it right hm yeah no im the same way i saw where um Castleberry won i was in that uh Publishers Publishers Warehouse i never send those either but i thought well maybe you do have a chance after all   uhhuh yeah   but um   huh no i uh you know  most of the uh most of the financial uh problems that we have you know are are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of couple of you know few years ago with uh   umhum   credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a couple you know for little while   um   and uh you know been on commissions for for you know few years and its just um we just never got caught up so do you own your own home   yes we do   yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our house up for sale and   yes harder   and uh the economys so bad we couldnt sell it   yeah well when we bought the economy the uh real estate was really high and now with the last appraisal we got and everything it really went down so that if if we wouldve tried to go on a market wed have lost money   yeah well we did too yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our house was the the note   uhhuh   and um shoot uh somebody came and and offered us we wouldve lost twenty thousand dollars on our home you know if we were just to sell it   umhum   and uh so we decided to keep it and kind of just uh   im trying to hang in there   yeah try to make things uh work   does your where does your wife work   she doesnt i mean she does actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home     oh   and um so the only you know i guess bright uh       uh thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the company that that uh i work for and and so thats kind of helping us out you know its making things a little more um   little easier because i can always count on a check on Friday   yeah do you just go commercial
