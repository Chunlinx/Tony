        what kind of camping do you do down there   well we have gone to several places   umhum   um theres a real nice area north of here close to the Oklahoma border   do you do you have a camp trailer or do you just take tents and sleeping bags umhum   no we take tents tents and sleeping bags is what we use   take the whole family   yeah we do uh we havent gone in a while because we have a three year old and were waiting for her to get a little bit older but we have two older kids and we take them   umhum   and uh its fun i mean were not avid campers   umhum   but um i guess our the funnest camping trip we had was was when we went up north close to the Oklahoma border thats north to me  um   umhum   and we stayed for about three or four days and the weather was very nice thats one thing you have to consider down here because in the summer it gets so hot   umhum   that you know nobody wants to do anything um oh uh one time we went to Arkansas and did some camping   umhum umhum   id almost forgotten about that six years ago i guess     do do you go up in the mountains or mainly stay in campgrounds   well we didnt really have any just second  what is it getting worse and worse okay um uh no we really didnt go up in the mountains   you basically just go with the KOA campgrounds or something like that   well this was a uh it wasnt a KOA what was  Frazier what was that that we went to in Arkansas it was a park it was a state park   umhum   yeah it was a state park   umhum   um and they had trails you know that we could go on   umhum   uh we were going to go on the river but the river was so high that year itd been raining so much that they wouldnt let anybody get on the river   huh ill be   yeah there were a lot of snakes around   yeah   oh it was Snake River oh Snake River with a lot of snakes in it   uhhuh       my experience at camping is a little bit different um we do we do do a little family camping but  i do a lot of elk hunting with uh bow and arrow elk and deer hunting   uhhuh oh wow   and uh so i i we go back into the mountains using horses and and uh go and well pack in sometimes as far as ten miles back in just on horseback and well stay for ten days and   oh wow   and thats a lot of fun but its its not real uh conducive to taking my wife uh she doesnt appreciate being away from civilization that long and     yeah yeah   and uh no electricity and no you know we you you take a bath in the creek and freeze to death while youre doing it but uh   yeah oh my gosh thats really roughing it   uh it is but it is fun   uhhuh   of course i guess it takes the right personality   have you only done that once or youve done that several times   no no ive done that lots of times   you love doing that huh   yeah its in fact i as far as im concerned i dont get enough   really oh wow   um but well probably go during the summertime on uh like a threedayers probably two times and then as soon as fall comes on and the hunting season starts   umhum umhum   uh we usually get one big one and then one big one thatll last probably ten days and then one or two small ones for two or three days at a time   umhum umhum  TI switchboard well youve done a lot more camping than i have actually my husbands the one thats really the avid camper he you know has a lot more experienced and and he makes it a lot of fun for everybody though because he knows   yeah umhum yeah   when you when you go with someone thats experienced and knows how to do things and its a lot often fun for everybody else   umhum   and   yeah i agree its its always fun to go with somebody that knows how to cook over an open fire thats a little thats a little different than uh you know heat control at home and and uh uh you can have some lousy meals out there or you can have some great meals um   oh yeah uhhuh yeah thats true when we were in Arkansas wed been camping for about three days i guess and i was already tired of sleeping on the floor   umhum   and we ran into a lady that told us about a resort area up there and we checked into one of these resorts and got to sleep in a a nice bed and that that was camping the right kind of camping to me   umhum umhum       well it makes a difference were were set up with uh camping cots and uh and uh uh self inflating mattresses and and and things like that and then and then its not so its still not like home but its uh     yeah right makes a little bit more comfortable   umhum   yeah do you have kids that you take along   yes well yeah but they dont come on the big trips theyre very small too ive got a a six a three and a about a one one and a half and   yeah oh wow youve really got your hands full   yeah and they they enjoy the day ones well run up in the mountains like uh when i get off work sometimes and were not were not very far were forty five minutes from some   yeah uhhuh   some real nice mountains here and we can go up there and build a fire and cook hot dogs and thats really not camping though thats kind of a picnics what that is but but   oh thats great uhhuh uhhuh   but they enjoy that   thats great thats great
