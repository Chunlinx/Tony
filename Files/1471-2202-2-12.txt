                    Background        Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are secreted        signaling molecules of the TGF superfamily that have been        implicated in the control of a host of critical        developmental phenomena in the central and peripheral        nervous systems       BMP one of the more        prominently expressed BMPs in the nervous system has been        detected in multiple regions of the nervous system        throughout development and into adulthood        yet        its biological activities in the nervous system are not        well defined A role for BMP in dorsal forebrain        patterning has been proposed based on its expression in the        dorsal midline of the developing forebrain and observations        that ectopic expression of BMP in the developing neural        tube of chicks markedly downregulates ventral markers while        maintaining dorsal markers      Further support for        BMP regulation of early forebrain development has been        provided by studies of         BmpBmp double mutants            However reports that BMP in the mouse brain exhibits        peak expression levels in the adult striatum and brainstem        and that maximal expression in the hippocampus and        cerebellum occurs at E through PN and again in the        mature nervous system     suggest additional roles for        BMP during later stages of neural development and into        adulthood        BMPs have been divided into subgroups based on        structural and evolutionary considerations     Although        closely related BMPs have been shown to elicit distinct        cellular responses          members within a        subgroup often display conservation of not only structure        but also function        BMP belongs to the A        subgroup of BMPs which also includes BMPVgr        BMPOP BMPaOP BMPb and Drosophila A             Other members of the A subgroup have been shown to        modulate neuronal morphogenesis through selective effects        on dendrites Thus BMPs   and A stimulate dendritic        growth in cultured sympathetic neurons derived from either        perinatal or adult ganglia in the absence of effects on        cell survival or axonal growth       BMP has        also been shown to enhance dendritic growth in hippocampal        cortical and spinal motor neurons              Whether BMP similarly promotes dendritic growth has        not been previously addressed Since dendrites are the        primary site of synapse formation we felt it was important        to examine this possibility Moreover since dendritic        remodeling occurs throughout the life of the animal such        studies could suggest a function for BMP in the adult        nervous system In this report we demonstrate that like        other members of the A subgroup BMP triggers robust        dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons         in vitro coincident with activation        of Smad Noggin and follistatin soluble proteins known        to function as physiological antagonists for BMP            also inhibit the dendritepromoting activity of BMP        Furthermore BMP mRNA and protein are detected in intact        sympathetic ganglia and neuronglia cocultures        respectively consistent with a proposed role for BMP in        regulating dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons         in vivo                     Results                  BMP induces dendritic growth in cultured          sympathetic neurons          As previously reported     sympathetic neurons          grown in the absence of serum and glial cells fail to          form dendrites Figure A however when grown in the          presence of BMP these neurons extend multiple          dendrites Figure B Similarly addition of recombinant          human BMP to the culture medium elicits dendritic          growth in sympathetic neurons as evidenced by the          presence of tapered processes that are immunoreactive for          MAP Figure C Comparative analyses of          concentrationeffect relationships for BMP and BMP          Figure  indicate EC            values for BMP approximately          fold higher than those of BMP however maximally          effective concentrations of these two growth factors have          comparable effects on sympathetic neurons as assessed by          the percentage of neurons with dendritic growth the          number of dendrites per cell and the total dendritic          length per cell Time course studies of dendritic growth          in neurons exposed to maximally effective concentrations          of BMP and BMP reveal comparable temporal responses          as well Figure  Both BMP and BMP elicit dendrite          formation in  of the neuronal cell population          within  to  hr Figure A The gradual increase in          the number of dendrites per cell throughout a day          treatment with BMP parallels that observed in sister          cultures exposed to BMP during the same period Figure          B Experiments in which cultured sympathetic neurons          were treated simultaneously with maximally effective          concentrations of BMP and BMP indicate that the          effects of BMP and BMP on dendritic growth are not          additive data not shown                          Treatment of sympathetic neurons with BMP induces          phosphorylation of Smad          In most cell systems that have been examined the          primary signal transduction pathway for BMPs involves          phosphorylation of Smad     and recent evidence          suggests that this is also true for BMP induced          dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons     To          determine if BMP initiates similar signaling events in          sympathetic neurons cultured sympathetic neurons grown          in the absence of glial cells were treated with BMP for           or  min then analyzed by Western blotting using Abs          specific for total Smad or for phosphorylated Smad          Phosphorylation of Smad is evident within  min after          exposure to BMP Figure A with significantly          increased pSmad levels apparent at  min In contrast          treatment with BMP did not alter levels of total Smad          Figure B                          Antagonists of BMP function inhibit BMPinduced          dendritic growth          Recent data suggest that in the developing nervous          system signaling by at least BMPs   and  is          determined by the spatiotemporal expression patterns of          BMPs and their receptors and by relative levels of the          soluble BMP antagonists such as follistatin and noggin          that directly bind BMPs in the extracellular compartment          and prevent functional receptorligand interaction                   The extent to which these factors may          regulate BMP signaling is difficult to determine          because of the paucity of data regarding either          antagonism of BMP signaling by follistatin and noggin          or the interaction between known BMP receptors and BMP          To address the former question we tested the ability of          follistatin and noggin to block the dendritepromoting          activity of BMP The latter was evaluated indirectly          using a recombinant chimeric protein containing the          extracellular domain of the BMP receptor type IA fused to          the immunoglobulin Fc domain BMPRIAFc The chimeric          protein containing BMPRIA was chosen because it has been          previously reported that this is the predominant BMP          receptor type expressed in embryonic and postnatal          superior cervical ganglia SCG     As indicated in          Figure  follistatin and noggin significantly inhibit          the dendrite promoting activity of BMP in a          concentrationdependent manner Maximally effective          concentrations of noggin  ngml and follistatin           ngml reduce BMPinduced dendritic growth by           and  respectively The BMPRIAFc chimera also          significantly inhibited BMPinduced dendritic growth          Increasing the concentration of any of these antagonists          to levels greater than those expressed in Figure did not          cause greater inhibition of BMPinduced dendritic          growth data not shown                          Expression of BMP mRNA and protein in SCG          cells          If BMP is a physiological regulator of dendritic          morphogenesis in sympathetic neurons then its          spatiotemporal patterns of expression should be          coincident with dendritic growth in this neuronal cell          type Potential sources of BMP include neuronal and          glial cells within the ganglia To examine this          possibility antibody Ab specific for BMP was used to          immunostain cocultures of SCG neurons and glial cell that          had been cultured for  weeks to allow for significant          expansion of the glial cell population The specificity          of the BMP Ab used in these experiments is indicated by          demonstrations that it recognizes purified recombinant          BMP but not purified recombinant BMP or BMP in          Western blots Figure  Moreover the reaction with          BMP protein is significantly blocked by preincubation          of the BMP Ab with blocking peptide Figure  In SCG          cultures immunostained with this BMP Ab          immunoreactivity is present in most if not all ganglionic          glial and neuronal cells Figure Aand B In glial          cells fluorescence is present throughout the cell but          excluded from the nucleus in neurons immunoreactivity          is evident in both the soma and processes Preincubation          of the BMP Ab with specific blocking peptide Figure          Cand D reduced BMP immunoreactivity to levels          comparable to those observed in control cultures reacted          with the secondary Ab only Figure Eand F          BMP expression in vivo was assessed by RTPCR          analyses of SCG harvested from rats of different ages          corresponding to various stages of dendritic growth in          sympathetic neurons As indicated in Figure  BMP mRNA          is present in SCG at embryonic day  E which          corresponds to the period of initial extension of primary          dendrites and at postnatal days  and  PN and PN          which corresponds to the period of maximal dendritic          growth In contrast BMP mRNA was not detected in adult          SCG                            Discussion        BMP is widely expressed in the nervous system        throughout development and into adulthood        yet        the only function described for this growth factor thus far        is dorsal patterning of the developing forebrain              Our data suggest that BMP may also regulate later        stages of neural development specifically dendritic        morphogenesis The most direct support for this hypothesis        is the finding that addition of BMP to sympathetic        neurons in culture causes these cells to extend multiple        dendritic processes These data are consistent with        conclusions from previous studies indicating that        dendritepromoting activity is restricted to BMPs from the        A or dpp BMPs  and  subgroups and is not observed        with BMPs from other subgroups such as BMP BMP or        dorsalin or with other members of the TGF superfamily        such as activin TGF  or       Functional        redundancy between BMPs of the A subgroup has been        previously reported with respect to other developmental        endpoints     of which some such as upregulation of        cell adhesion molecules     may be directly relevant        to effects on dendritic growth BMP and BMP as well as        dpp subgroup members BMP and BMP have been shown to        influence other aspects of sympathetic neuron development        such as differentiation of adrenergic sympathetic neurons        from neural crest            and        neuropeptide phenotype     It will be of interest to        determine if BMP also exhibits functional redundancy with        respect to these effects        Pharmacological studies of BMP indicate that relative        to BMP BMP is less potent but equally efficacious in        promoting dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons        These data together with observations that maximally        effective concentrations of BMP and BMP are not        additive suggest that the two ligands share aspects of a        common signaling pathway It has been shown that        phosphorylation of Smad precedes dendritic extension in        cultured sympathetic neurons exposed to BMP moreover        expression of a dominant negative construct of Smad in        cultured sympathetic neurons significantly inhibits        BMPinduced dendritic growth in these neurons            These data suggest that activation of Smad is a necessary        component of the signal transduction pathway by which BMP        induces dendritic growth In this report we demonstrate        that BMP similarly induces Smad phosphorylation in        sympathetic neurons as detected by Western blot analyses        using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of        Smad These data suggest conserved mechanisms of        signaling within the A subgroup The molecular        mechanisms of BMPinduced dendritic growth downstream of        Smad activation are not well characterized Previous        studies have demonstrated that transcriptional and        translational events are required for dendritic growth in        response to BMPs     but the gene expression profile        responsible for BMPinduced dendritic growth has yet to be        determined Thus it is not clear if BMP or  induces        dendritic growth directly or if some other factor made by        the cells in response to BMPs is responsible for initiating        dendritic growth        BMPs activate Smad by binding to type I and type II        serinethreonine kinase receptors      Specific        receptor subunits shown to bind BMPs include BMP receptor        type IA BMPRIA BMPRIB BMRII activin receptor type I        ActRI and ActRII       BMP ligands can bind        to either type I or type II receptor subunits        independently but both receptor types are required for        highaffinity binding and signaling     The finding        that the soluble BMPRIAFc chimera significantly inhibits        BMP induced dendritic growth suggests that BMP may be        activating the Smad signaling pathway via interactions        with BMPRIA Although the physiological relevance of this        finding has yet to be confirmed by ligand binding studies        using endogenous neuronal BMPRIA these data are        consistent with reports that BMPRIA is the predominant BMP        receptor type expressed in embryonic and postnatal superior        cervical ganglia SCG            It is becoming increasingly evident that BMP signaling        is regulated not only by the spatiotemporal expression of        BMP ligands and receptors but also by relative levels of        soluble BMP antagonists which directly bind BMPs and        prevent functional receptorligand interaction                 The different BMP antagonists bind to BMPs and        other TGF family members with varying degrees of        specificity For example follistatin binds both activin        and BMP avidly but competes weakly or not at all with the        type I receptor for BMP binding      whereas        noggin binds to BMPs  and  with greater affinity than        BMP     Whether BMP function can be antagonized by        noggin or follistatin has not been previously reported but        our results suggest that simultaneous addition of either        antagonist with BMP significantly inhibits the        dendritepromoting activity of BMP in a        concentrationdependent manner Thus profiling the BMP        binding affinities as well as the expression patterns of        these BMP antagonists will be critical to understanding the        regulation of BMP signaling in the nervous system        If BMP is important in regulating dendritic growth in        intact ganglia its expression should correlate with        periods of dendritic growth         in vivo  In sympathetic ganglia        dendritic growth begins prenatally and maximal expansion of        the dendritic arbor occurs during postnatal weeks  and              RTPCR analyses of intact SCG indicate that cells        of the SCG express BMP transcripts from E through P        Preliminary observations indicate that these BMP        transcripts are translated into protein in SCG in vivo as        assessed by Western blot analyses using BMP Ab P Lein        unpublished observations Earlier studies have        demonstrated the expression of BMP transcripts in        developing avian sympathetic ganglia     suggesting        the presence of multiple BMPs in sympathetic ganglia        throughout development These data in conjunction with        observations that mRNA for BMP type IA and type II        receptors are expressed in the developing sympathetic        ganglia     are consistent with a potential role for        BMP in regulating the initiation and rapid expansion of        the dendritic arbor in sympathetic ganglia of perinatal        animals        The cellular distribution of BMP was determined by        immunocytochemistry in sympathetic neurons cocultured with        ganglionic glial cells Both neurons and glial cells        express BMP protein In situ hybridization analyses of        BMP and BMP indicate that both cell types also express        BMP transcripts P Lein unpublished observations These        findings are consistent with previous reports that        dendritic growth can be induced in sympathetic neurons in        vitro when cultured at high neuronal cell density    or        in the presence of ganglionic glial cells            Dendritic growth continues albeit to a lesser extent        into adulthood and dendritic remodeling occurs throughout        the animals life Mature sympathetic neurons cultured from        adult animals respond to BMP with enhanced dendritic        growth     and treatment with BMP enhances recovery        in animal models of stroke         Although        BMP mRNA was not detected in adult SCG Western blot        analyses indicate that BMP protein is present in adult        SCG P Lein unpublished observations presumably derived        from nonganglionic sources such as serum or target tissues        These observations together with reports that BMP is        expressed at significant levels in the adult nervous system           suggest a potential role for BMP in modulating        dendritic morphology not only during development but also        in adult nervous systems                    Conclusions        These data suggest that BMP regulates dendritic        growth Addition of BMP to sympathetic neurons in culture        triggers significant dendritic growth that is        concentrationdependent Data from western blot analyses        using Ab specific for phosphorylated epitopes of Smad as        well as analyses of dendritic growth in cultures exposed to        BMP in the presence of a soluble BMPRIAFc chimeric        protein are consistent with a signaling pathway that        involves binding to the BMPRIA and activation of Smad        BMP signaling may be modulated by noggin and follistatin        since these BMP antagonists were observed to inhibit the        dendritepromoting activity of BMP Spatiotemporal        patterns of BMP expression at the mRNA level as assessed        by RTPCR and the protein level as determined by        immunocytochemistry correspond to periods of initial        dendritic growth and rapid expansion of the dendritic        arbor These observations together with previously        published reports from other laboratories indicating        significant levels of BMP expression in the developing        and adult nervous system    suggest a potential role for        BMP in modulating dendritic morphology not only during        development but also in adult nervous systems                    Materials and Methods                  Materials          Purified human recombinant BMPs   and  were          prepared using
