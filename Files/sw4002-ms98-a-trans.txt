            okay   okay     have you done this very long     uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months   yeah thats the same with us   yeah   well what kind of car would you buy   well its kind of hard to say uh because i dont think were going to buy another car for about three years we just   oh okay   bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty nine and uh wait a minute we bought one in ninety weve got three cars of all things   uhhuh   so uh probably well be in at least a midsize four door sedan   okay what kind do you have now   uh we have a a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater CRX   oh okay   uh its rather difficult to to project what kind of uh wed look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh report or uh repair records that the various cars have   uhhuh   and then of course we look into the prices   yeah   and uh for uh were not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep weve begun to keep them uh longer a longer period of time uh i traded off an eighty two Oldsmobile for the eighty nine Mazda   oh uhhuh   so uh   and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic   uh yeah yeah we weve had thirty some odd cars in our married life and um we weve had a good many foreign cars   uhhuh   and uh they they uh ive been extremely weve had three Mazdas weve been extremely pleased with our Mazdas   oh really   yeah   weve always bought American made cars mostly Oldsmobiles   yeah well we weve had uh lets see we had uh we had a uh let me think we had a fifty three and a uh we had uh two fifty threes which is a long thirty minute story  uh and we had a sixty five       and then we had this eighty two   uhhuh   so we we really cant complain about Oldsmobiles really   yeah weve been real pleased with ours i think weve had one two three   yeah   and most we have a Cutlass we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like a a seventy seven   umhum   then we have a Cutlass Sierra and weve had a ninety eight   umhum   so but i dont know well were going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they   umhum   give good financing through the the motor company   umhum   but i dont know what were going to buy i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty  so     well uh my son over in Shreveport uh sold Porsches Audis Mada Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas   oh   uh so uh the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy seven MG MGB   oh the   was British green racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top   ooh boy   and uh i drove it mostly and   i bet it was hard to part with that   yeah it really was my husband was in the Air Force and we got transferred to Okinawa   oh   so uh we had to sell it which which really really tore me up   oh yes   because uh it was it was great fun and then uh when we got to Okinawa bought well we bought a second hand we uh we decided that uh we had that sixty uh sixty five Oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat uh and a and the little uh forty horse power Mazda four door sedan   oh
