Titled Eat Your Clothes Mr RacistDesigner the piece has been excerpted on the OfficialPhilippine AntiTommy Hilfiger site The writer tiptoes around the chargesbut is markedly less tentative when expressing her outrage I am shocked shefulminates If Hilfiger really did insult my people you can bet I will doevery single thing I can in my power to make sure that his label never makes ithere            Forumsranging from soccultureafricanamerican to talkrumors and Streetsound have been thickwith antiTommy talk of late When rumors of the designers alleged racistoutbursts filtered into the mainstream media they were debunked by Time magazine USA Today and the Washington Post But that didnt stem for a boycott of hisproducts Nor did the official response of the Hilfiger Corp Claiming to

underserved fashion nicheurbanblack America which was drawn to Laurens WASPy abstractions but alienated bytheir overstated inaccessibility Hilfiger saw potential for symbiosis betweenhiphop and the Hamptons The result He still does the khakis and the yachtshots and the polo ponies and the redwhiteandbluestripe designs that someliken to the Confederate flag but he mixes them up with punchbright colorsand exploded logos            Hilfiger knew he had struck gold when he noticed black kidsmixing the preppy look with sports gear on the street As he told VanityFair in  I saw this and I said Oh
