                                 The Stock Spinners            The problem with venalityin business is that getting outraged about it makes it easy to miss thesystemic problems that venality often disguises And thats exactly whatshappened in the uproar over the Wall Street practice called spinning            Spinning has apparently been common on the Street for as long as anyone canremember and yet it had never really been written about until a November article in the Wall Street Journal broke the story The mechanics of itare simple An investment bank thats underwriting an initial public offeringgives shares in that IPO to corporate executives at companies with which theinvestment bank is either doing business or would like to do business Theexecutives can then spin the shares which is to say sell them for a quickprofit as the stocks price bounces higher something most IPOs have tended todo on their opening days of trading Robertson Stephens for instance gave oneclient  shares in the IPO for Pixar the company responsible for ToyStory  the client spun those shares into a million profit Theassumption of course is that an executive who receives a gift like this willbe more likely to direct his companys business toward the investment bank thatproffered the shares Quid pro quo            If thats not unsavory enough for you in somecases the investment banks dont give the shares to the executives until thestock has started trading well above the offering price In other words if anIPOs opening price is  and within a couple of hours of the opening bellits trading at  a bank will choose that moment to allocate the shares tothe executives account The executive gets the shares at  and sells them at all in one fell swoop Banks are able to do this only by abusing aregulation that permits them to cancel a mistaken allocation of IPO sharesbefore the first trading day ends The conversation one imagines goes alittle bit like this Now that the stocks price has risen I realize I didntmean to give them to this persons account I meant to give them to you Nowabout that deal we were discussing             Wellits probably not quite that crude but spinning does seem unquestionably toviolate state laws that prohibit corporate executives from taking personaladvantage of financial opportunities that they get because of their position ata company One columnist recently wrote that Americas unique strength hasalways been that the path to success isnt totally rigged that its not simplyabout being a member of some inner circle that cuts you in on the action forlife and that spinning threatens this strength But though he deserves a nicepat on the back for the graduationspeech rhetoric thinking in terms offairness doesnt really get us very far Spinning is unfair but then so islife as our parents told us To see why spinning really should be eliminatedyou have to look at the question from a hardnosed efficiency angle            Why after all do we have laws againstbribery If someone really wants my companys business why shouldnt he beable to do everything he canincluding paying me offto get that businessBecause bribery encourages people to make decisions based on the wrongcriteria which means in the business world that it distorts the efficientallocation of resources Absent the bribe I would decide to give my companysbusiness to Investment Bank A But because Investment Bank B allowed me to spinshares in a new Internet IPO I give my companys business to them instead            This isbad in two different ways First Im violating my fiduciary responsibility tomy company because Im making a decision based not on whats best for it butrather on whats best for me Second investment banks that already do a lot ofIPO business will tend to get more business simply because they have moreshares to spread around The rich get richer not because theyre moreefficient but because their ability to bribe is greater            Ordinarily of course bribery tends to besomewhat selflimiting in the sense that you dont want to spend more onbribes than the revenue that you generate through them But spinning costsinvestment banks nothing at all Once an investment bank has underwritten anIPOwhich means that it has committed to selling all the companys availableshares at a set priceall it has to worry about is making sure those sharesget bought Needless to say people are anxious to buy shares when they knowthey can sell them seconds later for an easy profit So while a company thatbribes customers is typically hurt by the fact that money that could have gonetoward profitable investments instead goes toward bribes in the case ofspinning both briber and bribee win            The factthat some investment banks are getting more business than they otherwise mightis a good enough reason for regulators to step in But spinning has still worseconsequences The practice works only if the price of an IPO bouncessignificantly higher on the first day That gives investment banks an incentiveto set opening prices lower than they should be Instead of taking a companypublic at  a share and watching it trade at  all day long an investmentbank can take a company public at  a share watch it jump to  right afterthe opening bell and allocate those nowprofitable shares to its clients            Its possible of course that investment banksjust keep getting surprised over and over again by the strong demand for IPOsand that they really make their best effort to match opening prices with marketdemand while giving themselves reasonable insurance against getting stuck withunsold shares But somehow it seems unlikely that spinning would have becomesuch an institutionalized practice if investment banks didnt have a prettygood sense that a stocks price was going to jump on its opening day And thatmeans the real losers are the companies whose IPOs end up underpriced            Underpricing an IPO ofcourse deprives the newly public company of capital When Pixar went publicthe money raised from that very first sale of its shares was what it used torun its business in the future But Pixar went public at a price  percentlower than the highest price people paid for its shares on the opening day oftrading And while it would be a mistake to say that the stock could haveopened at that highest price its safe to say that if Robertson Stephens haddone a better job of gauging demand millions of dollars that went intotraders pockets would have gone into Pixars vaults instead            Whats frustrating aboutall this is that the moment when a company goes public is when the stock marketshould function most efficiently Thats the only time when the money you payfor a stock goes right to the company rather than to another trader The priceof an IPO then should reflect as nearly as possible what investors reallythink about a companys prospects And yet everything about the IPOprocessfrom spinning to the fact that shares are distributed mainly to largeinstitutional clients to the fact that some investors are fed informationbefore the IPO that other investors never seeworks against the marketsefficient operation Wall Street has come a long way from the insiderdominatedworld that was blown apart by the Great Depression But spinning is anexcellent reminder of how far toward real transparency the Street still has togo
