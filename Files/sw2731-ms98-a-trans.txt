                do you have any strong feelings about gun control   i have  pretty  strong feelings about it yeah i think that guns ought to be controlled   uh i agree there should be some control but uh how strong of uh a control do you think there ought to be   well lets see on one to ten i guess i vary i actually started out as a member of the NRA in my youth but having looked at murder statistics in other countries um its so dramatic that i think that im probably down to about a two or a three in terms of control however no im sorry maybe up to a nine or a ten   uh okay thats  yeah okay got the scale going the other way     um open the almanac one day and it just has murders of by by guns and you look and you look at European countries and and its like six eleven four and you get to the US and its four thousand   sure   and that tells me something about   but if you make owning a a gun a crime only criminals will have guns ive heard that before and thats probably true   yeah that   thats i mean the other problem is theres so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now thered still be millions and millions and millions of them   sure uh   but uh would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesnt doesnt pack a rod   yeah i agree with that i think that some states are just far too lenient uh Texas and Florida are very easy on uh gun ownership being able to buy guns all it takes is a drivers license   yeah     and uh sign an affidavit uh saying that you didnt commit any felonies   right   so i think that ought to be uh tightened up i favor uh uh holding uh the guns say for for seven days or whatever until uh you can check out whether somebody is legitimate or not   yeah   and i think that might stop some of the uh impulsive crimes but uh things that like that are planned uh selling guns to New York City things of that nature i dont think youre ever going to be able to stop that theres just too much of a demand and people are going to get ahold of guns no matter what the restrictions are   yeah i think i think that youre right it would be the pretty much the same problem that that prohibition  is in fact pretty much the same problem that drug control is   yeah   if enough people want it and theyre willing to pay for it theyll get it   and a lot of people own guns just as a hobby and uh hunters in particular theyre theyre not uh buying guns to commit any crimes at all just uh uh pursuing their hobby   yeah yeah   but it its uh ones uh say the midnight specials uh uh the semi semi automatic weapons uh assault rifles things like that that uh really have no place uh for a sportsman   yeah thats certainly true i mean i own a handgun myself  ive actually never fired the thing but   uhhuh   but um but i went out and bought it intending to to learn to use it and so on but i never did   yeah i dont see any problem with owning a gun for self protection but uh education is is a big part of that people need to be educated on how to uh how to how to store their weapons uh so the kids cant get at them and so theyre not a threat to the rest of the family     yeah right right   a lot of people dont get that type of education they dont have any kind type of safeguards on their weapons at home   yeah i mean i certainly just walked into the store and bought mine and a box of bullets i suppose i could have gone and blown my own brains out or anyone elses who was who was nearby     yeah   although i must say i have a healthy respect for the thing   yeah uh gun control legislation is uh is really tough to beat i mean the NRA is so strong and they lobby uh uh a lot in Congress   yeah   so uh its going to be really tough to uh add uh gun control type of laws to what we already have   yeah its um it sort of amazes me that that in the Gulf War people were really concerned about ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred people dying and if a thousand people died in that war it would have been a mess and if five thousand had died it would have been considered a national calamity and yet that many people die uh from gunshot wounds i mean i think that we have our values in a in a sort of in in a funny place   sure yeah uh yeah ill have to agree with that it uh i never really correlated uh those two incidences say crime at home uh versus an international war but uh yeah i guess i dont know how to how to place that   yeah i mean in some in some fields we seem to have this really profound respect for human life and in other fields we dont i think guns and automobiles are the two places where were willing to take our licks but you know were willing to accept sixty thousand highway deaths a year   yeah uh thats thats true uh and uh when it gets to the point where its unacceptable where the majority of the people find it unacceptable they may find cause to write their Congressman and lobby for some stronger controls     yeah   but uh yeah we are very tolerant a very tolerant society and uh it takes a great deal of uh abuse before we get our act together   yeah in some areas but i think in other areas um i dont know i guess this this this this Gulf War came to mind where where um well war just comes to mind  you know couple a hundred people get get blown up and its and it really shakes the country to its roots maybe just because of the way it happens   right uhhuh   and uh but you know well go all out uh to save uh a child with a rare disease who makes the newspaper will get millions of dollars in contributions and and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is considered so precious   yeah   when its viewed somehow when its viewed in i dont know as as a single life it becomes very precious and when you view it as a statistic whether its guns or automobiles or smoking um people just dont see those as individual lives somehow or they dont they dont uh relate to them personally   i think it depends on uh whos leading the crusade and how strong they feel about it take for instance Mothers Against Drunk Driving that used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife   yeah   and now its a national organization they theyre very powerful uh they collect a lot of money   yeah yeah   and uh it i think its made an impact i mean it its made a lot of people cut down on their their drinking and driving because the laws are enforced stronger now   yeah it   DWI convictions are very serious   yeah they are and and its really changing the social structure of things i know i went out with a bunch of people i dont know six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the waitress asked us which one was driving she didnt want to   right   wasnt going to serve that person anything   because uh theyre liable anybody who serves anything to anybody is liable can be sued   hm yeah i didnt think about that i sort of thought that   with guns i think it ought to be the same way       i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons   yeah i thought that was the case i mean if uh if my kid grabs my gun and goes and shoots somebody i would really have the feeling that theyre going to come banging on my door   well i saw a talk show just the other night where uh there was a mother on the show and her uh son had been killed in a neighbors house by one of the neighbors handguns   huh   when only the other kids were at home they apparently had three handguns that were uh in plain sight one on top of the refrigerator one in the on the bedroom dresser and one somewhere else but uh   hum   just teenagers and uh and grade school kids at home and one of the kids got shot by a gun got killed and apparently no charges were filed against the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer   hum  i dont know what that says its pretty sad   so its i guess they say accidents will happen and uh  uh you know its just hard to say whos at fault for uh things like that that happen   yeah   but somebodys got to be uh um somebodys got to be held responsible ultimately so i dont know i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i cant see a total ban on it at all uh because then youre still going to have criminals with guns and its not going to help uh the situation uh there people want to break the law theyre going to do it   yeah its well its just too late i mean there are countries ive lived in both Japan and England where guns are not available even criminals dont carry them or its so hard to get and the and the law is so severe for people caught using them that by and large uh they dont   well they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature too you cant get them through airports uh   yeah yeah   you know like in uh Germany in the airports there where there uh where terrorism is so much of a threat uh the uh policemen have uh automatic weapons you know and uh i dont know what the penalties are for trying to smuggle guns into a country like that but i imagine theyre quite severe   yeah no i think by the  by the the the year nineteen hundred there were probably enough guns in the US i mean its just always been a way of life here the wild wild west   right well ive heard it said that thats one of the reasons why were not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brothers got a gun at home       and what are you going to do about that You got two hundred million guns here and its uh its more than just an army   well yeah thats uh thats a point although uh if thats the case why are we spending all this money on all of this high tech weaponry i wonder   well there thats your your professional army uh thats your first line of defense   yeah   uh that thats for your your mercenary forces that go across overseas and and attack other countries but at at home here   right
