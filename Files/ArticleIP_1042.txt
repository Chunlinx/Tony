                                 Is the Stock Market Too High            Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan briefly shook world financial markets a couple of weeks ago witha single question How do we know when irrational exuberance has undulyescalated asset values Traders interpreted Greenspans delicate rhetoricalquery made during a speech at a conservative think tank to imply that hebelieved the stock market was overvalued and that the Federal Reserve might beabout to increase interest rates in order to lower stock prices So investorsbailed out pushing stock prices down by between  percent and  percentFederal Reserve officials then hastened to assure the press that a rise ininterest rates was not in the offing and that Greenspans expressions ofconcern were merely expressions of concern            Is thestock market too high If so whatif anythingshould the Federal Reserve doabout it The stakes for investors are enormous The current value ofpublicly traded stocks on US markets is about  trillion If thosestocks are overvalued by say a third more than  trillion of the wealthAmericans hold in stocks is likely to vanish if and when stock prices return totheir fundamental values  Fundamental values is a concept easier todefine in theory than in practice It refers to the prices stocks ought to sellfor based on businesses real economic value apart from speculation Theassumption is that stock prices will ultimately whenever that is return totheir fundamental values however much extraneous factors may be influencingthem at the moment            No one disputes that stock prices are very high  Onestandard measure of fundamentals is average earnings over the past years a period considered long enough for businesscycle fluctuations toaverage out In a typical year a typical stock is priced at about  times itsyear average of earnings Today the typical stock sells for nearly  timesits year average of earnings            Theargument that the stock market is overvaluedand that it will either graduallydeflate or crashis simple Stocks are tradable pieces of paper that aremerely a claim on a corporations future earnings And the ratio of stock priceto earnings is twice what it traditionally has been In the past whenevergeneral stock prices have gotten as high relative to fundamentals as they aretoday the next decade has been an extremely bad one in which to invest in thestock market            However optimists offer three main theorieswhy current stock prices are not too high            First Some claim thatinformation technology is ushering in a generationlong economic boomPast ruleofthumb valuations based on earnings and dividends assume thateconomic and profit growth will continue in the future at roughly the pace itdid in the past But the argument goes because we are on the threshold ofthe postindustrial transformation economic growthand earnings growth anddividend growth and stockprice growthwill be faster than in the past            Second Others claim thatthe rate of return that the average investor expects to receive onstocks has fallen That would mean that any given level of profit can sustain ahigher stock price In the past demand for stocks was limited by fear ofrisk  Investors could look to the bond market and see the chance for adecent return with total safety But the argument goes the s inflationtaught investors the brutal lesson that there is no safety in bonds Yourinvestment can evaporate if interest rates rise or if inflation devalues thebonds purchasing power Investors today also have less fear of the businesscycle and other risks associated with stocks So investors are willing to paymore for stocks than they used to            ThirdOver the past generation corporations have learned better how to avoid payingtaxes Some companies have pushed up their debtequity ratios raisingmore money through bonds and less through stocksand thus changed payments toinvestors that used to be called dividends into interest Dividends arepaid out of posttax earnings whereas debt interest is a taxdeductiblebusiness expense Other companies have decided to buy back shares withmoney that would otherwise have been paid out in dividends The moneyshareholders receive in this way is taxed as a capital gain usually at a lowerrate whereas dividends are taxed as ordinary income Furthermore investorscan choose whether to participate in the buyback or to hold onto their sharesand defer taxes completely All these various tax techniques make shares ofstock more valuable per dollar of corporate earnings than previously            The only correct answer to the question Is the stockmarket too high is No one knows JP Morgan the turnofthecenturyfinancier had a stock answer for people who asked him what the stock marketwould do It will fluctuate At the peak of every previous bull market therehave been experts and prognosticators declaring that the old rules of thumb areno longer valid The most famous of these predictions came just before thestockmarket crash of  when Yale Professor Irving Fisher reassuredinvestors that stock prices had attained a permanently high plateau Butevery timeuntil nowwhat had gone up has come down            What ifthe stock market is too high What if it is indeed undergoing what Greenspancalls irrational exuberance This is a bad thing because the exuberance mayend in a crash  and the crash may depress the general economy Its notinevitable The decline in prices to their fundamental level may be gradualand even a crash may not turn into a larger economic disaster When stockprices fell by a quarter in one day in  the American economy barelynoticed thanks largely to quick action by Greenspans Federal Reserve Evenso it is better to avoid the crashcausing exuberance than it is to try tokeep a crash from triggering a depression            So if the stock market is overvalued whatshould the Fed do One answer is nothing  The history of centralbank attempts to deflate overvalued stock prices is not encouraging The Fedsefforts to cool off stock prices in  had no impact on the stock market butit did start the depression it had hoped to avoid The Feds principalstockdeflating tool is an increase in interest rates which draws money out ofstocks and into bonds But raising interest rates now which would depress theeconomy now to avoid a possible financial crisis which would depress theeconomy later is a lot like destroying the village in order to save it            A second answer is that theFed can express concern  as Greenspan did Such expressions might subtlyshift market psychology and begin the gradual deflation The risk is that theshift in market psychology might not be subtle and the deflation might not begradual Note how gingerly Greenspan expressed his concern He did not saythat he was worried because the stock market was overvalued He asked how hecould figure out whether the stock market was overvalued He did not say thathe would take any action in response to overvaluation He asked if monetarypolicy should be any different if there were overvaluation            It is hard to imagine asmaller step than the one Greenspan took
