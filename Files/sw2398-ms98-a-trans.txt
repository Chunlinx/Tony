                have you had any uh major uh car repairs done recently   well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a car  because of the requirement to do some major repairs   uhhuh   um i had a Ford Escort with about ninety five thousand miles on it and the engine was shot um i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced and um but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely   so youre saying that the repairs would have cost more than the car was worth   right and um um i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um which i which surprisingly the car was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed     i think any car that runs right now is in demand   i guess so um but i ended up buying a um a used car to replace it i got a uh eighty five Dodge Aries which only had thirty four thousand miles on it and uh speaking of repair problems um this car has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix cars   uh i work on my own ive got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that ive had uh since it was new   wow   and ive had very good luck with it uh havent had many repairs done at all the alternator went out four years ago and uh the i had to replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty three       but uh other than a few transmission leaks that i got repaired uh i really havent had anything but uh regular maintenance   yeah but do you do anything yourself i mean   yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication   yeah okay   but if any major problems say like uh transmission leaks i took it in for that   right   and i had to have an alignment done last year so i had that done   yeah yeah i dont think thats the kind of thing you can do yourself is it  unless you had the equipment   uh not really its not too easy i had past uh state inspection uh just last month so and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that for passing inspection uh they gave me a shopping list of things i needed to get done   yeah     namely uh replacing putting the catalytic converter back on the car   oh   and fixing the emergency brake   yeah   so those things i could do myself it wasnt a problem   yeah what now what state are you in   Texas   Texas youre in Texas so am i um yeah the the problem i have with this Dodge uh this Dodge Aries is that if i drive the car for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up and then i run to run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the car it wont start   uhhuh   and it wont start until the car is cooled off ive learned that and as soon as it cools cools off itll start right up   i had that problem with a nineteen sixty eight Camaro   what was the problem   i never did get it fixed   oh   it it could be the starter that it just gets too hot   yeah yeah somebody said that um that uh there must theres probably some kind of short in the starter and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short and then it it it isnt until the car cools down that the metal you know these two pieces arent touching any more and and uh and your you you know then itll start because you dont have the short   yeah   but ive taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you wont be able to start it sure enough he couldnt and they had to push it into the garage but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didnt uh didnt recur recur they couldnt get it to fail   hm   and sure enough after id taken it home for you know a couple of weeks after that i didnt have the problem but now its starting to recur again   yeah   so its just one of those weird things i mean he was willing he said well i think its in the ignition switch itll only cost you eighty five dollars but i wont guarantee thats the problem   right they never do   uh yeah and im going well well i dont want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure   uhhuh ive heard of that problem with many other different cars doesnt seem to be prevalent with just one manufacturer   and then uh yeah well thats thats thats reassuring ive never had a Dodge before and i mean it seems like a nice little car its a great deal it only had thirty four thousand miles on it and otherwise it doesnt give me any problems at all   i wont buy a Dodge   you wont  oh yeah   my dad had one he had a Dodge   yeah   six hundred and after thirty thousand miles the head gasket went out   oh really Holy mackerel   nothing but problems with it so he finally traded it in and actually bought a Ford Escort   oh jeez ive you know ive actually had a lot of luck with Fords um um im not gonna im not gonna sit here and claim that theyre the best cars in the world but     oh a lot of people do like Fords yeah   yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time   sure   and uh uh so ive ive just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but   yep im ready for a new car myself but ive had this car for eleven years and its given me such little trouble that i i i dont think i could get an adequate replacement that would uh cause me to let huh   yeah yeah i just uh i was just talking to somebody whod had a some kind of i think he had a Cutlass and he had a hundred and ninety five thousand miles on it and finally the thing finally went so he goes out and he buys a Lexus   uhhuh   and im going whoa  he he moved up   i guess thats what about thirty forty thousand dollars   yeah i mean you know hes single hes approaching fifty years old   right   he doesnt really have anything else to spend his money on   i guess not   so but uh i cant i just cant imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars   i have no idea i know theyre theyre engineered very well but i would have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car   really well its funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby its one of these you know five minute change places and this guy comes storming into the lobby there and he says um you know you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil change and you charged me thirty dollars and the guy says well yeah but you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter   uhhuh   and the guy was oh yeah hes almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed im going   right   i dont think thats worth it  i dont think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know i dont know     no dealers will get get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it   yeah oh yeah oh jeez   they they gave me this cock and bull story that because there was a turbo charger on the car they had to prime the turbine with the oil   what   and its its its a bunch of hog wash i ive changed the oil myself ive put a filter on you know put the oil in and all its no problem at all   yeah yeah yeah i couldnt i tried to do that with my Escort but theres no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car   no i have to get under my car to get the oil filter out but yeah you change it four times a year its not that big a deal filter you can buy that on sale for two dollars uh the oil um less than a dollar dollar less than a dollar a dollar a quart its really not that   ooh yeah yeah oh yeah id prefer to do it but the Escort was very difficult for me to get under and i didnt want to put it up on ramps or anything it just made me nervous   uhhuh right   i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it   well i can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car i cant crawl under it the clearance isnt enough but enough to reach under and get the filter off its not a problem   hum yeah i just couldnt yeah yeah i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think   yeah   at least im going to give it a try cause you can see i mean the oil filters i mean you can touch it its right there   uhhuh for anything else ill put the car up on jack stands   youve got jacks it makes me nervous   oh yeah       when putting the catalytic converter back on i had to put the right side of the car up on jack stands   whoa whoa   but it wasnt a real problem   yeah yeah hm well i i you know its just a thats the biggest hassle i think that if i had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it   yeah every three thousand miles ill change the oil ive got about ninety four thousand miles on the car right now   yeah wow wow   and uh its working just fine i dont have any problems at all so im going to keep it uh i get offers  every now and then from   gee yeah     from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because its a Trans Am theyre high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend   yeah all right   the trouble is they think they can buy it for a thousand dollars or less   right right well i bet you i bet i mean if its in good condition and stuff you could probably get a pretty good blue book price   yeah its in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the car painted   well the paint paint job yeah if youre going to look a new car what would you look at   a new car   yeah   oh im not i dont think im in the new car market       a new car that really hard pick   well what what what brand i mean what model would you look
