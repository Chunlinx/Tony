Weekly Standard            A group of AfricanAmerican intellectuals ismounting a behindthescenes campaign to persuade Republican presidentialfrontrunner George W Bush to speak out on what one sociologist has calledthe unspoken domestic crisis of the next millennium White criminals preyingon white people            These thinkers note that white sociopaths mostoften prey on people of their own race citing the Columbine High Schoolshootings in Littleton Colo the Fort Worth Texas church massacre andDonald Trumps presidential candidacy as examples            Its white people whoare suffering disproportionately yet no white politicians want to talk aboutit said Herman Pepper a professor at the Eldridge Cleaver School of Law inOakland Calif who has written extensively on the roots of white crime Ageneration of kids is growing up in fear and the traditional white leadershipseems out of touch            Peppers arguments while controversial are based on amixture of sociological data and political calculation that even his critics donot entirely dismiss A  Justice Department study of crime in  Americancities found that  percent of white crime victims were victimized by fellowwhites And while crime has been decreasing Pepper notes that it is fallingmost slowly among whites The  National Crime Victimization Survey reportsthat while the number of violent crime victimizations per  people fellfrom  to  among blacks it only fell from  to  among whites            Pepper is passionate that the issue must beaddressed            Fifteen people died atthe Columbine High shootings all but one of them white the genial beardedacademic said in a recent interview Liberals want to blame guns Traditionalconservatives blame a decline in moral standards which is more on the markBut guns and bad values dont kill white people White people kill whitepeople             In a compilation of  prominent violent incidents between and  Frank Blanco a criminal justice policy analyst at the Institutefor Reactionary Reform a Washington think tank noted that virtually all ofthe victims were white            From the Oklahoma Citybombing to the Atlanta day traders rampage the pattern is clear Blancowrote in a recent article for the Wall Street Journal editorial pageThe new cohort of amoral middleclass white male predators has a culturalexistence of its own It must be confronted in its own terms But virtually noone in the political class will admit it That vacuum creates an opportunityfor real leadership            Pepper and Blanco have conferred with Bush campaignofficials in Austin twice since midAugust to discuss their ideas according tosources on the campaign While a Bush spokesman declined to comment Peppersaid that he and his colleague used the meetings to advance two ideas            First we said the message needs to be that whitepeople have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps Pepper saidGovernment is not the solution For example the idea of putting the TenCommandments in every classroom is attractive but in the long run federallyfunded stone tablets will only breed dependency on the nanny state            Second we said thatgovernment does have a limited role in addressing the problem Maybe thereshould be block grants to the states that would enable them to give a tax breakto every white teenager in America who buys a highquality handgun That wouldreally deter the predators in the school corridors At the same time it wouldteach todays youth about the reallife value of the Second Amendment            Blanco said he emphasized the political potential of thewhiteonwhite crime issue for a Republican presidential candidate            Fairly or unfairly the Republicans have beenpigeonholed as being soft on white lawbreakers whether its Oliver North orthe Posse Comitatus he said in an interview in his Capitol Hill officeTalking candidly about white crime is a way to break that perception            Blanco said that while traditional interest groupsin the Republican Party might be offended the broader electorate would get themessage            The issue is reallycompassion he said After all the vast majority of white people arentderanged gunmen They are hard working and pay their taxes too Theyre thevictims here            Already some Republican strategists are objecting Theeditors of the conservative journal Always Right wrote last week thatPeppers argument amounted to a blamethevictimtype approach that onlyserves to help those in the AfricanAmerican community who want to avoidsharing responsibility for getting at the root causes of what is really asocietywide problem            The larger issue says Kwame Jackson professoremeritus at Morehouse College is the culture of communities such as LittletonJonesboro West Paducah Edenboro Springfield Pearl and Oklahoma City wherethe whiteonwhite crime epidemic is the worst            Lets face it thepathologies are severe in these areas Jackson said Young people grow uplistening to country music lyrics that mock the sanctity of marital vows Thedependency on VA hospitals for free medical care is widespread And theintellectual elites who once defended standards have proved all too willing togo silent in the face of deviant behavior like Newt Gingrichs affair with astaffer Sophisticates will sneer but these things have an effect            Jackson considered the dean of AfricanAmericanconservative intellectuals introduced Pepper and Blanco to the Bush campaignstaffers He said he was confident the Republican frontrunner would bereceptive to their thinking            I get the sense of a magnificent RonaldReaganlike intellect absorbing the best ideas of a generation while remainingoptimistic and inclusive Jackson said            Jackson sought to distance his efforts from theviews of Murray Charles who holds the Elijah Muhammad Chair for the Study ofRacial Realism at Boston University Charles recent monograph The CaucasianCoefficient has triggered a fierce debate in academic circles Writing forthe American Statistical Science Associations Web site wwwASSAnineorg lastmonth Charles marshaled an array of data to argue that the appropriateresponse to the Columbine tragedy would be for the federal government to fund astudy of the gene structure of whites            Is there a biologicallybased explanation for the tendency of white males to slaughter strangers inpublic Charles asked We need to ask the hard questions and not shy away ifthe answers are politically incorrect            In an accompanying editorial the ASSAnineorg editors saidthe authors views while offensive to some deserve the utmost in thoughtfuldiscussion and announced that the next nine issues of the publication would bedevoted entirely to debating Charles thesis            Murray has some good ideas Jackson said but Ithink he goes too far with the notion that white people are biologicallydisposed toward crime and violence I mean some of my best friends are whitepeople We need a more compassionate approach to whiteonwhite crime
