                                 Pop Fiction            I startedpicking up The                New Yorker  back when I was a sprout in order toread Donald Barthelme I think what did it were those fauxMax Ernst collageswith which he occasionally ornamented his stories which appeared so muchwilder than my received notion of what that magazine was like and the storiesturned out to be even wilder than the pictures His surrealistic short fictionwas about as avantgarde as you could get on the mass market in those days Asthe present volume reveals Barthelme also occasionally contributed to Notesand Comment at that time the first section of The Talk of the Town Theresnothing earthshaking about those pieces falling as they do into thewalkingaroundandpeering or flightofwhimsy tendencies of that venerablerubric Still its hard to feature them appearing in todays version of thesame magazine I remember exactly where I was when I realized thatPostModernism had bought it I was in my study with a cup of tequila andWilliam Ys new book One Half  Ys work is we agree good verygood But who can make the leap to greatness while dragging behind him theburntout boxcars of a dead aesthetic Perhaps we can find new employment forhim On the roads for example In  this and not a celebrity or apromotional motive anywhere in sight do I need to point out that William Y isan invention of the authors            The term PostModernism turns up again and again in theseessays and interviews and it comes as a surprise to find it applied aquartercentury ago not to metareferences in knowing television serials but tothe work of Barthelme and his coevals John Barth John Hawkes Robert CooverWilliam Gass etc Who still reads John Barth Although when you think aboutit these writers who came of age in the s were PostModern even thenReading Barthelme may make you think of Surrealism of Pop Art of variousspecies of what used to be called bricolage but what came to my mindrevisiting his stories after a long absence was the mileaminutechannelswitching in the monologues of Robin Williams Like Williams Barthelmewas a master ventriloquist with a dish antenna in his subconscious From AShower of Gold circa             Yesterday Peterson saidto the television audience in the typewriter in front of the Olivettishowroom on Fifth Avenue I found a recipe for Ten Ingredient Soup thatincluded a stone from a toads head  Coming home I passed a sign that saidin tenfoot letters COWARD SHOES and heard a man singing Golden Earrings in ahorrible voice and last night I dreamed there was a shootout at our house onMeat Street and my mother shoved me in a closet to get me out of the line offire  My mother was a royal virgin and my father a shower of gold Mychildhood was pastoral and energetic and rich in experiences which developed mycharacter            Actuallyyou wont find much of this kind of machinegun improvisation inNotKnowing  at least once past the bracing title essay the most fullyfleshed apologia Barthelme achieved which barrels from Husserl to MelancholyBaby to the pastdue bills on his desk in mockpeevish diatribe You canimagine the voice successively issuing from a pulpit a bullhorn an onionskinpage a teletype a Victrolaand then suddenly theres the author speakingplainly as himself I suggest that art is always a meditation upon externalreality rather than a representation of external reality or a jackleg attemptto be external reality Savor that word jackleg a quartersecondvisitation by the ghost of Horace Greeley or someone like him Such isBarthelmes power when hes operating at full throttlehis piano seems to have keys            Unfortunately most of NotKnowingconsists of leavings marginalia occasional pieces that do not show him at hisbest There are some book reviews which are acceptable but not much more somemovie reviews which are pretty feeble with that literalism that bedevils manyliterary writers when they come to dabble in the form viz the collected filmcriticism of Dwight MacDonald and some art writing considerably more savvyalthough many of the pieces originated as catalog essays and thus sometimesbetray a rather forced enthusiasm There is a transcription of a  fictionsymposium in which Barthelme says relatively little and the reader is mostlysubjected to vast snowdrifts of abstraction courtesy of Gass There are a fewNixonera opeds that are musty period pieces now And there is a passel ofinterviews that vary greatly in quality and insight            The enthusiastic andscholarly wish to preserve the entirety of a given writers work isunderstandable and even endearing to a point but one of the frustrations ofthis collection is its repetitiveness Anecdotes are retailed in pieces andretold in interviews the same citations crop up again and again I lost countof how many times Barthelme attests to his debt to Beckett and explains thathis writing not resembling Becketts is a paradoxical measure of his thrallNone of this is Barthelmes fault of course If I were to publish yourcollected table talk you would be appalledonly your spouse and your deityknow how many times youve told those same five stories Had Barthelme livedlonger he died in  at  the majority of these items would not havebeen reprinted for another  or  years and then probably in the usualdeadauthor package by the University of Winooski Press for acquisition byselected academic libraries Dont get me wrong This collection has itspleasures not least of which is the reminder of how strong and unique asensibility Barthelme possessed which sent me back to the incomparableanthology Sixty Stories  But NotKnowing is not unlike adeadrockstar memento such as all those collections of Jimi Hendrixs doodlesand backup sessions that seemed to come out every Christmas until his estatefinally clamped down The impulse is partly commercial partly sentimentalpartly a wish to uncover just one more unsuspected gem In Barthelmes casethis kind of packaging seems oddly timed since his influence on currentfiction is if anything at a low ebb But maybe just maybe in some circuitousand stealthy way NotKnowing will play its part in revising that lapseprompting young readers in particular to seek out the best work of an Americanoriginal part philosophe and part banana
