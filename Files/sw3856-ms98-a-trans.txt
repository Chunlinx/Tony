                what experience have you had with family reunions   well actually uh oh the last eight or ten years i have an aunt and i i should say have like done our family reunion and uh oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this uh savings and loan in a in a little town   uhhuh   and uh then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and uh its real nice because my mother uh had seven brothers and sisters and if we didnt do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles thats the type family reunion weve had there you know so uh you know if we found you know the years we dont do that  nobody nobody sees each other because everybody lives in different places you know   huh thats really good yeah my mom my moms family is all   my family is really scattered out so if we didnt have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example um my my parents live in Seattle Washington   oh   however all of my moms and relatives and family are from Utah   uhhuh   and all of my dads uh relatives and family are from Oregon so we we usually have family reunions once a year and well go to Utah and uh go to  Oregon um   my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to Utah um and um she sometimes plans them and and sometimes helps in planning them usually um Southern Utah is so hot that um we pick theres the they rent out this cabin thats up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get some cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time   oh uhhuh   and thats what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also   uhhuh  yeah everybody fixes their specialty or whatever   uh yeah   yeah well it really in your case and mine too uh i guess in most everybodys as far as especially more distant relatives you know uh cousins aunts and uncles and so on you just wouldnt see them if you didnt do something like that well my immediate family like on my side uh has gotten large because theres four of us and now weve all had children and now we all have grandchildren so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house uh about seventy miles from here so we weve done it once we all get together down there and um that works out real well because theres a lot well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that   yeah i know at the the family reunions on my dads side that we go to in Oregon um we usually um have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so   uhhuh uhhuh well it really doesnt much matter where where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them   oh theres a theres a family reunion reunion um once a year um for for each for my fathers side and for my mothers side i know and my wife also um so they try when they have family reunions they dont have them as regularly but when they do they try and make  big deal out of it and usually have you know something like a talent show or   yeah   um each family um does something um yeah   yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and and shown them at the family reunion   yeah my mom my grandma also has some we havent particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to see those those are you know nice for memories   uhhuh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago theres places now that do that and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know   uhhuh   on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has uh worked out good   uhhuh   so uh so how did you get on the TI thing
