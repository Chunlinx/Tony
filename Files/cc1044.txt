                    Introduction        Delirium is not a disease in itself but a syndrome of        acute cerebral inefficiency affecting the brain in various        ways It creates a deleterious effect on cognitive        functions such as consciousness orientation perception        attention shortterm memory judgment and abstract        thinking    Delirium is a temporary condition which        can occur suddenly or slowly over a period of hours or        days A single episode lasts up to  week The symptoms may        be so slight they go unnoticed or so serious they could be        life threatening The clinical signs of delirium are        changeable all day and are usually more serious during        early morning or night Temporary changes in clinical signs        are important characteristics of delirium While the        patient may appear well and communicative during an        observation changes in orientation could occur a few        minutes later    Delirium is typically an indicator        of a physical pathology and a worsening prognosis             It is commonly unrecognized or misdiagnosed by        physicians treating critically ill patients The rate of        misdiagnosis has been reported as  in various reviews           Clinical evaluation is the most important        criterion and electroencephalography is the most useful        test for diagnosis        Although delirium can be experienced in all age groups        it has an increased frequency at more advanced ages           Risk factors determined for the syndrome include age               imbalance of electrolyte            hypotension    hyperglycemia     azotemia           feverhypothermia and infections                 use of multiple drugs and withdrawal of        alcohol           male sex           severe diseases such as cancer cerebrovasculary or        cardiopulmonary disease malnutrition and burn                 patients who have been operated on and        kept in ICUs           and        psychosocial environment      Furthermore        subclinical cerebral damage increased adenylate cyclase in        the central nervous system and nutritional status        identified by albumin level are predisposing factors for        postoperative delirium   Interleukin monoclonal        antibodies and ifosfamide have also been suspected recently        as factors   The aim of the present study was to        confirm andor determine predisposing factors for        delirium                    Materials and methods        Between January  and  we screened prospectively        for delirium  consecutive general surgery patients at        the DicleUniversity Hospital All patients whether        hospitalized for elective or emergency services or whether        treated with medication or surgery were kept for a period        of time in our ICU Ten nurses four physicians and four        staff work daily in the ICU department The ICU has  beds        with continuous noninvasive monitoring and ventilators        There are windows in the bed areas of the ICU Trained        clinicianresearchers carried out daily structured        interviewers with the patients from admission until        hospital discharge Suspected cases of delirium were        identified during the daily interview Patients with        changes in their status of consciousness          n   were consulted by an        experienced consultationliaison psychiatrist S        Delirium was defined as an organic mental disorder        involving a confusional state with attention deficit        disorganized thinking and a fluctuating course and acute        development The diagnosis of delirium was based on the        criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of        Mental Disorders revised third edition and established        through a psychiatric interview Table  Patients who had        history of severe dementia or had abused psychoactive drugs        and alcohol were excluded from our study Delirium was        diagnosed in  patients Patients were divided into two        groups the DG          n   and the NDG          n   Analysis of whole blood        count arterial blood gases biochemistry and urine        culture antibiograms of blood urine or other secretions        and radiological examinations such as chest Xray were        performed on all delirious and nondelirious patients All        abnormal findings during delirium related to physical        conditions laboratory features and additional diseases        were evaluated as probable

delirium were treated initially for        etiological diseases but when the treatment was        insufficient medication with diazepam or haloperidole was        added        Biostatistical evaluation was carried out on an        IBMcompatible personal computer using SPSS  software        The Student         t test for continuing variables and        the chisquare test for categoric variables were used To        identify factors independently related to the development        of delirium we also performed forward stepwise        conditional logistic regression         P   was

       Delirium a syndrome associated with long hospital stays        and high rates of morbidity and mortality   is a sign        of deterioration in the homeostasis and physical status of        the patient   Approximately  of patients on        general surgical wards and  of patients on general        medical wards experience delirium during their hospital        stay Approximately  of patients in surgical ICUs and        cardiac ICUs and  of patients who are recovering        from hip fractures have an episode of delirium           The delirium rate is  in cancer patients   but        increases to  in patients with advanced malignancies          Delirium is seen in  of the patients when the ICU        facility has windows but rises to  of the cases when        the ICU facility has no windows   It has been        determined that preoperative risk factors for delirium were        older age     prior cognitive impairment           preexisting cerebrovascular or other brain diseases        history of prior delirium   preoperative abnormal        sodium   vision or hearing impairment    and        regular use of psychotropic drugs before admission          In this series  of our patients had delirium           n   of these were older than         years The youngest patient was  years old and the        eldest was  years old All of our patients most of whom        were younger than  years old were kept in an ICU with        windows This may be responsible for the low frequency of        delirium in this series Although the age of delirious        patients were higher than that of the NDG          t           P   age was not determined as        a predicting factor for delirium          P   in the logistic        regression test in our study The rate of delirium has a        predominance in males    We found that the number        of delirious male patients was significantly higher than        female patients            P   although gender was not a        predictive factor for delirium          P   in the logistic        regression        The prevalence of delirium in the Emergency Department        was    In this series the rate of delirium was         in emergency admissions similar to Kishis series           but emergency admission was not considered a        factor for delirium        The etiology of delirium is complex and usually consists        of multiple factors In  of delirious patients the        etiology is secondary to organic factors but it is        difficult to interpret further details            Imbalances of electrolytes metabolic changes intoxication        or absence of drugs trauma of head and postoperative state        are the most common etiological factors Other less common        factors are infections intracranial lesions coma fever        cardiovasculary diseases poisons polymedication and        deficiencies of vitamins              Anticholinergic drugs are also commonly accused agents          Surgical stress and infectious fever are common factors        in geriatric patients   Francis         et al   reported that abnormal        sodium levels feverhypothermia and azotemia were        independent predictors for delirium in elderly patients        Foreman   determined that hypernatremia hypokalemia        hyperglycemia azotemia hypotension and polymedication        were predictors for delirium in a prospective study Some        predisposing factors determined in our study were        respiratory disease  hypotension  anemia         hyponatremia  azotemia  and        metabolic acidosis  The major neurotransmitter        hypothesized as involved in delirium is acetylcholine and        the major neuroanatomical area is the reticular formation          Electrolyte imbalance and azotemia may be responsible        for the decrease in acetylcholine activity in the        brain        Symptomatic infection and fever were other independent        predictors of delirium Delirium has been reported in        infectious diseases such as diverticulitis   pneumonia          and typhoid fever   Certainly fever is        concomitant with many infections and experimental data have        supported a casual relation between fever and delirium        Fever and infection correlated with delirium in our study        as independent predictors in the multivariate logistic        regression Cytokines andor bacterial toxins and cerebral        metabolic changes may be causes of the mental changes        associated with infection        To perform specific treatment it is important to        determine the etiological factor Arterial blood gases and        current and past vital signs should be checked to establish        whether cerebral hypoxemia or hypertensive encephalopathy        is present The patient with hypoglycemicinduced delirium        virtually always has a history of insulindependent        diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemic delirium is also        hyperadrenergic Hypotension can result from multiple        etiologies such as decreased cardiac output from a        myocardial infarction cardiac failure or arrhythmias and        anemia All medical conditions that cause hypotension can        lead to a decrease in brain oxygenation   In this        study we predicted that respiratory diseases anemia and        hypotension were effective in delirium by decreasing brain        oxygenation        Research into patients who developed hepatic failure        suggests that the gammaaminobutyric acid system is        important in the development of hepatic encephalopathy        ie hypoactive delirium caused by liver dysfunction        Specifically endogenous benzodiazepinelike substances may        play a role in delirium associated with hepatic failure          In our study delirium was seen in  of HBP The        abnormalities such as elevated level of hepatic enzymes        hyperbilirubinemia hypocalcemia and hyperamylasemia        associated with HBP were strongly predictive factors for        delirium This condition showed that early intervention was        important in HBP cases        The existence of hyperactive hypoactive or mixed        clinical subtypes of delirium is widely accepted The        hyperactive subtype was more frequent  than the        unspecified  and hypoactive subtypes           In a series consisting of cancer patients it was observed        that the hyperactive type which has a shorter duration is        the most commonly seen subtype of delirium with a rate of           In our study  of delirious patients had        hyperactive subtype        There is no specific drug used for management of        delirium The first step of treatment is trying to calm        down the patient and to identify the underlying cause            The second step is treating the causative factors        when determinable If causative factors are undeterminable        then efforts should be directed to preventing permanent        damage    Butyrophenones haloperidole thiothixene        and droperidole and benzodiazepins diazepam oksazepam        and lorazepam are the recommended drugs for sedation and        preventing agitation     In this series we        treated the etiological factors in all patients and gave        diazepam to  of the patients and haloperidole to         of the patients        Both surgeons and anesthesiologists could reduce the        incidence of delirium in the patients who are at high risk        by carefully ordering and monitoring the dosages of drugs        and watching for signs of cardiac ischemia during the        perioperative period           The practice of polymedication should not be given up           The goal in diagnosis is to discover reversible        causes for delirium In this study series we determined        that conditions such as disease or symptom variables        respiratory diseases symptomatic infections fever        anemia hypotension and laboratory variables        hypocalcemia hyponatremia azotemia elevated liver        enzymes hyperamylasemia hyperbilirubinemia and metabolic        acidosis were predicting factors for delirium Clinicians        must identify specific etiologies when possible and apply        appropriate treatment                    Competing interests        None declared
