                all righty so how what do you think of capital punishment     well Texas has capital punishment   oh does it   yep and uh they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years and uh there are so many cases here like Sixty Minutes is on right now here there are so many cases here where they proved that theyve convicted the wrong person   yeah   that im against it they should just give them life in prison   well i feel that way the only exception i think is qualifies for capital punishment is repeat offenders where the offender actually murders people repeatedly   right   like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i dont think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again   yeah exactly right uhhuh   thats the only time i think its really   well like in your state Charles Manson   yeah   or the guy who killed all those children   yeah exactly   yeah umhum   and i think i think those types of people deserve capital punishment but i think they should restrict it strictly for repeat offenders or like i said serial killers because i mean a lot of times not a lot of times but quite quite a few times theyve convicted innocent people on the first time   right umhum   but you know if theyve been convicted like three times you know there somethings wrong   somethings going on right   so i think thats the only time its really a necessary   yeah i think so too after after its gone that far then they pretty well have a   uh   enough proof that that persons   the guilty party   they cant be rehabilitated rehabilitated either so yeah   right but thats really the only time when i agree with it   umhum   most of the time i dont think its a good idea because like you said there have been cases where theyve convicted the wrong people   yeah   just because of circumstances   umhum   but in Arizona which is where im originally from they had a big thing about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within six months caught and they had a big thing about whether they should you know go for capital punishment or not but its not used in Arizona   umhum   so they had a problem with it unfortunately all the people got was sent to jail for a couple of years until they get paroled   right i never heard about those   unfortunately one of them killed a friend of mine so i was very much involved       and when he got out on parole i was like go ahead get out on parole   umhum   and after that i had i had to tangle with him and the police caught him the second time and they still wouldnt do anything except send him to jail so   yeah   i definitely believe if theyre repeat offenders they should be something to be done with them other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again   right   but a lot of states have outlawed capital punishment   umhum   i dont know which states in general   and thats thats the reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida   oh really   that was his primary goal was to to have the death penalty   hum   because he started out in Washington and Oregon and traveled all the way across the country   huh i didnt know that   they had um Mark Harmon played him they had a movie about it a few years ago   yeah really   umhum   hum i didnt know that   and then of course there was a lot of publicity about it um the days before they killed him   yeah   umhum so   but   and he was really you know he was off the wall so   i dont know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays its like i think people have to be off the wall to do them but i still dont believe capital punishment should be used unless theyre repeat offenders   right   but i dont know i once i finish law school ill have more probably more views on it ill be able to do something about it then   and yeah and some of the ways i think that um the way that Texas um executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way they use they do it by injection   oh do they   yeah instead of you know the electric chair the gas chamber thats   yeah   you know   that would be the more humane way of doing it   yeah well they you know they just go to sleep and and then eventually they die   yeah   instead of being you know fried or or   or stuck in a gas chamber until they finally pass on   yeah fighting fighting for breath right umhum   but i know a couple of states still believe in the hanging but   umhum   i dont i dont go for that either
