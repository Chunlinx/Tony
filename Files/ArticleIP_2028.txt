                                 Kwitcherbellyachin            Do you worry that thenational debt will impoverish your children Are you incensed about payingthousands in taxes just to cover the governments interest costs And do youlong for a political hero who will dare to close the budget gap even if itmeans raising taxes If so I have one word for you I learned it from AnnLanders The word is kwitcherbellyachin Your share of the debt is anentirely voluntary burden If you dont want it you can dispose of it thisafternoon You can do the same with your childrens share All you have to dois pay off what you or your children owe            Becareful though Theres a wrong way and a right way to handle this The wrongway is to send the US Treasury a contribution earmarked for debt reductionTheyll accept your gift all right but they wont credit your personalaccount Instead your share of the burdenlike everyone elseswill fall bya tiny fraction of a cent            Heres the right way to retire your share of thedebt First calculate how much you owe Suppose for example that youre theaverage American Your share would be about All you have to do is lend  to the governmentThe easiest way to do this is to buy a  Treasury bond From that momenton you will owe  to yourself  which is as good as owing it tonobody at all Each year youll pay taxes to cover your share of the intereston the debt and each year that money will come right back to you as intereston your bond For all practical purposes youll have opted out of thedebt burden entirely            If its your childrenyoure worried about give them the bond Let them collect interestuntil the day of reckoning when that political hero finally arrives to raisetaxes and retire the debt Then they can sell the bond and use theproceedsto pay theirtaxes            Theonly possible objection to this scheme is that you have to come up with to buy a bond But on the other hand if the politicians take your advice andraise taxes in order to pay off the national debt youll have to come up withthat same  to pay your share of those taxes So buying bonds is nomore attractive than being taxed for debt reduction but its noless attractive either If your mantra is Go ahead and tax me butspare me this debt burden its time to stop chanting and essentiallytax yourself            Ageneration ago economics textbooks used to dismiss thedebt burden by asserting that we owe it to ourselves meaning that some of usthe taxpayers owe it to others of us the bondholders That was scantcomfort to those who paid taxes but didnt hold bonds But the old semiwisdombecomes genuine wisdom when embellished with the observation that anybody whowants to can become a bondholderand that buying bonds is no more painful thanpaying taxes to alleviate the debt            Whenever I hear somebodygriping that the national debt is too high I nod in apparent agreement andpoint out that the problem is more general than that Not only is the debt outof control I say but so is my front lawn The grass is ridiculously highWhen will the politicians finally face reality and force me to mow it            Thisusually has one of two desirable effects Either the griper moves to the farend of the room or he asks Why not just mow the lawn Why would you need thegovernment to force you In that case I reply Well why not just buy a bondand eliminate your share of the national debt Why would you need thegovernment to raise your taxes I dont mean to say that everyone should buyTreasury bonds Im saying only that everyone who complains about thedebt should buy Treasury bondsand then stop complaining            In dismissing bogus concerns about the national debt I donot mean to dismiss legitimate concerns about government spending Your shareof government spending is something you cant opt out of short ofemigrating or resorting to felonious tax evasion That makes governmentspending a fair target for your indignation            Suppose a recklessCongress decides to appropriate  of your money to finance a worthlessaircraft carrier or a worthless social program Then one of two things musthappen Your taxes will rise by  or else your share of the debt willrise by  Either way youve got a legitimate gripe            But if Congress opts fordebt over taxation you can count on thoughtless commentators to denounce theinterest payments on that debt as a second and separate outrage Thatswrong because you can if you wish buy a  Treasury bill that willbring all your interest payments right back to youthereby in effect taxingyourself to pay off the debt right away and limiting your damage to theinitial             The great burden ofgovernment is that it spends your money Those politicians who have devotedtheir lives to exacerbating that burdenlike Bob Dole and Bill Clintonwouldprefer to divert your attention to relative nonissues like the deficit Dontfall for it
