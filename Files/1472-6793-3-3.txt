                    Background        There are three general mechanisms whereby vascular        smooth muscle force is regulated  Activation mechanisms        involve contractile pathways that increase ser myosin        regulatory light chain MRLC phosphorylation either by        increases in myoplasmic calcium Ca          i     or by decreases in myosin        light chain phosphatase activity     The increased ser        MRLC phosphorylation activates the myosins ATPase        producing crossbridge cycling and contraction         Deactivation mechanisms are the reversal of activation        mechanisms relaxation results from lower ser MRLC        phosphorylation induced by either reductions in Ca             or increases in myosin light chain phosphatase activity            Since dephosphoylated myosin does not cycle force        is reduced  Force suppression occurs when force is        reduced despite persistent elevation in ser MRLC        phosphorylation levels This is an exception to the above        MRLC phosphorylation paradigm since phosphorylated myosin        should cycle and produce force Force suppression has been        observed with elevations in cGMP      cAMP            extracellular Mg      and with some pharmacologic        treatments        Cyclic nucleotide induced relaxation is associated with        phosphorylation of heat shock protein  also known as        HSP or P on serine        More recently        ser HSP phosphorylation was shown to specifically and        temporally correlate with force suppression rather than        the deactivation form of relaxation      A region        of HSP residues  has sequence homology with        troponin I peptides from this region bound thin filaments        reduced actin activated myosin S ATPase activity and        relaxed skinned swine carotid artery     We        hypothesized that binding of ser phosphorylated HSP to        the thin filament may turn off thin filaments so that        phosphorylated myosin does not interact with the thin        filament ie a model similar to skeletal muscle troponin        I This would explain low force with elevated MRLC        phosphorylation HSP has a second phosphorylation site        presumptively phosphorylated by PKC     of unclear        significance        HSP is a member of the heat shock protein superfamily        and is known to provide resistance to heat treatment in        cells     Recently we found that heat pretreatment         hours at C of swine carotid artery increased ser        HSP phosphorylation and suppressed force     In        this study we addressed three questions  What is the        temperature threshold for increases in ser HSP        phosphorylation and force suppression  Does the heat        pretreatment response diminish by prolonged recovery at        C after heat treatment ie is the heat pretreatment        reversible And  Are increases in cAMP or cGMP        responsible for the heatinduced increases in ser HSP        phosphorylation                    Results                  Experimental protocol          Tissues were first equilibrated at C     This          involved a warmup  mM K contraction approximately           min after mounting repeated stretching to             Nm  g for a  mg tissue a release to             Nm  g and a second  mM K contraction          approximately  min after mounting This protocol sets          the muscle to the optimal length for force generation          The latter K contraction was used for force          normalization Tissues were then exposed to various          temperatures for various times solutions were replaced          if evaporation was observed Temperature was changed by          adjusting the water bath set point This procedure          increased temperature within  min Reducing temperature          would have been slower but was accelerated by adding ice          to the water bath After the exposure to different          temperatures tissues were returned to C for various          times contracted with  M histamine for  min and          then frozen for analysis                          Threshold for temperature dependent increase in ser          HSP phosphorylation and force suppression          Equilibrated swine carotid medial rings were exposed          to various temperatures for  hours returned to C for           hour contracted with  M histamine for  min and          then frozen Significant reduction in force and increases          in ser HSP phosphorylation were observed with heat          treatments between C and C Fig  Ser MRLC          phosphorylation levels did not significantly differ in          tissues treated at C or C suggesting that the          decreased force observed at C was force          suppression          Histamine did not induce any contraction after          pretreatment at C and histamine also did not          significantly increase ser MRLC phosphorylation levels          MRLC phosphorylation was significantly less than that          observed at C This result suggests that the          decreased force observed at C was caused by reduced          ser MRLC phosphorylation Ser HSP phosphorylation          at C was significantly lower than that observed at          C but higher than that observed at C These data          suggest a biphasic response with ser HSP          phosphorylationassociated force suppression with heat          pretreatment between  and C and deactivation by          inhibition of ser MRLC phosphorylation after heat          pretreatment at C          Pretreatment at C induced a small insignificant          increase in ser HSP phosphorylation without          significant effects on force Putative PKCHSP          phosphorylation    was not significantly altered at          any tested temperature                          Recovery after heat treatment          Swine carotid medial rings were exposed to C for           hours followed by C for various times before          stimulation with  M histamine for  min and freezing          Fig  A set of control tissues were not exposed to          C and had low ser HSP phosphorylation labeled          before Ser HSP phosphorylation levels were high          both in tissues that were histamine stimulated at C           time ie no recovery at C and in tissues that          were returned to C for  min to  hours Force was          suppressed in all heattreated tissues regardless of          recovery time There appeared to be a modest rebound in          histamineinduced contraction  to  hours after return          to C                          Dependence of histamineinduced force on ser          HSP phosphorylation          The relation between mean ser HSP phosphorylation          and mean force from all the tissues that were stimulated          with histamine is shown in the upper panel of Fig           There is a clear relation between reduced          histamineinduced force and increased ser HSP          phosphorylation with all treatments except the C          heat pretreatment protocol The lack of correlation at          C is expected given the lower ser MRLC          phosphorylation ie deactivation observed after C          pretreatment There was no correlation between putative          PKCHSP phosphorylation and force lower panel of Fig                                    Cyclic nucleotide levels did not correlate with          heat induced ser HSP phosphorylation levels          Swine carotid medial rings were stimulated with  M          histamine for  min either before control or at the          end of a  hour C treatment Heat pretreatment did          not significantly alter cAMP and cGMP levels despite          significantly increased ser HSP phosphorylation and          suppressed force These data suggest that the increases          in ser HSP phosphorylation cannot be explained by          elevated cAMP and cGMP levels after  hours of heat          pretreatment                            Discussion        Our prior study    found that  C heat        pretreatment of swine carotid artery increased ser HSP        phosphorylation and suppressed force ie a reduction in        force without a significant reduction in MRLC        phosphorylation  The effects of heat pretreatment and        nitroglycerin were additive both on increasing ser        HSP phosphorylation and suppressing force     And         the relation between ser HSP phosphorylation and        force was similar with heat pretreatment and nitroglycerin        suggesting a similar mechanism of action to suppress force                   The goal of this study was to extend our observations on        heat treatment We found that temperatures between  and        C increased ser HSP phosphorylation and suppressed        force ie reduced force without reductions in ser MRLC        phosphorylation Fig  Excepting the C response        the relation between mean ser HSP phosphorylation and        mean force was similar with all treatments in these        histamine stimulated tissues top panel Fig         consistent with the hypothesis that ser HSP        phosphorylation was mediating force suppression        No contraction was observed after pretreatment at        C however this was not force suppression since MRLC        phosphorylation was significantly reduced to near basal        levels for the swine carotid This may explain why the        response observed after C was not on the ser HSP        phosphorylationforce relation shown in Fig  This        finding is consistent with the hypothesis that different        temperatures reduce force by different mechanisms For        example whole body hyperthermia at C induced        apoptosis in rats    while exposure to C reportedly        induces necrosis in cultured cells     The similar        temperature sensitivity of apoptosis and ser HSP        phosphorylation suggests the possibility of a role for        HSP in the promotion of or protection from apoptosis It        is possible that HSP induced force suppression may be        part of a protective response to moderate heat exposure In        contrast the absence of a contractile and MRLC        phosphorylation response after more extreme heat exposure        C may represent tissue necrosis        There was no significant change in putative PKCHSP        phosphorylation    with any protocol As a result there        was no correlation between putative PKCHSP        phosphorylation and force lower panel of Fig         We also investigated whether the heat pretreatment        response was reversible Ser HSP phosphorylation        levels remained elevated and overall force remained low up        to  hours after return of heat treated tissues to C        This suggests that the process that increases ser HSP        phosphorylation is not reversible at least in vitro This        may indicate substantial tissue damage during the  hour        exposure at C        Finally we found that the increases in ser HSP        phosphorylation were not explained by increases in cAMP        or cGMP at the end of heat treatment Fig  This        suggests that some other mechanism keeps ser HSP        phosphorylation at high levels Considering that the        increased ser HSP phosphorylation remains elevated for         hours after return to C it is possible that heat        treatment is reducing HSP phosphatase activity        Our experiments suggest that temperatures of C and        above can alter arterial contractility Such temperatures        can occur physiologically Brooks et al           exhaustively exercised rats for  min on treadmills        Immediately after exercise not during thermocouples were        inserted into thigh skeletal muscles and the rectum They        found an initial mean temperature of C in skeletal        muscle and C rectally Both temperatures fell        exponentially with rest after exercise It is likely that        muscle temperature exceeded C for at least part of the         min exercise This suggests that profound exercise can        increase regional temperature to levels that could        potentially induce ser HSP phosphorylation and force        suppression Thermal stress may bring about a resistance to        contractile agonists which could have clinical        significance in conditions such as hyperthermia andor        sepsis with vasodilatory shock        Heat treatment may have effects on smooth muscle beyond        contractility Orihara et al    reported that exposure        of vascular smooth muscle cells to C for  hours        inhibited cell proliferation Further work is required to        assess whether HSP is involved in this response        These results also demonstrate that multiple mechanisms        can induce force suppression that is correlated with ser        HSP phosphorylation Our prior studies showed that        increases in cGMP by nitrovasodilators and cAMP by        forskolin increase ser HSP phosphorylation and induce        force suppression     Such results suggest that the        correlation between ser HSP phosphorylation and force        suppression is robust in the swine carotid stimulated with         M histamine However it must be stressed that        different contractile conditions may be associated with        different relationships between ser HSP        phosphorylation and force given the multiple mechanisms        whereby agents can cause relaxation       For        example smooth muscle relaxation can occur by agents that        reduce myoplasmic Ca by inducing hyperpolarization        reducing Ca influx without changes in membrane potential        increasing Ca efflux or by reducing Ca release from        the internal store The response can depend on the form of        contractile activation eg nitroglycerin reduces Ca        better after agonist activation compared with K        depolarization     Comparison of ser HSP        phosphorylationforce relationships require careful        analysis in comparison with ser MRLC phosphorylation        levels to clearly show that the change in force is force        suppression rather than deactivation                    Methods                  Tissues          Swine common carotid arteries were obtained from a          slaughterhouse and transported at C in physiological          salt solution PSS PSS contained mM NaCl  KCl           Nmorpholino propane sulfonic acid MOPS  Na            HPO              CaCl              MgSO              Dglucose  pH adjusted          to  at C Dissection of medial rings mounting and          determination of the optimum length for stress          development at C was performed as described              The carotid ring preparation differs in the method of          mounting from our prior heat study which employed carotid          strips     The mounting procedure rings vs          strips does not alter the behavior of the carotid media          in tissue baths The intimal surface was mechanically          rubbed to remove the endothelium                          Antibodies          Rabbit antiHSP antibody was made commercially via          repeated injection of gel purified recombinant HSP          sequence confirmed by mass spectroscopy After          confirmation of an antigenic response serum was          collected and frozen for future use Specificity was          verified as described                              Measurement of HSP and MRLC          phosphorylation          Swine carotid arteries were first thermally and          histamine stimulated followed by freezing in an          acetonedry ice slurry     After air drying the          tissues were homogenized in a buffer  mg wet weight          tissueml buffer containing  SDS  glycerol and           mM dithiothreitol Full strength half strength and          quarter strength dilutions of samples were then separated          on onedimensional isoelectric focusing gels ampholytes          were a  mixture of pI  and pI  for HSP and          a  mixture of pI  and pI  for MRLC          blotted to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes          immunostained with our rabbit polyclonal antiHSP          antibody  or rabbit polyclonal antiMRLC antibody           in  bovine serum albumin and  sodium          azide and detected with enhanced chemifluorescence          ECF for HSP and enhanced chemiluminescence ECL for          MRLC     A representative blot is shown in Fig           The dilutions ensured that the detection system was in          the linear range Immunoblots were scanned on a Molecular          Dynamics fluorimager          Phosphorylation was determined by change in the          isoelectric point pI for each phosphorylation species          There are two HSP phosphorylation sites in the swine          carotid therefore there are four immunoreactive          species unphosphorylated at pI  top band in Fig           monophosphorylated on a putative protein kinase C PKC          site at pI  second from the top band in Fig           monophosphorylated on ser at pI  second from the          bottom band in Fig  and diphosphorylated on both ser           and the putative PKC site at pI  bottom band in          Fig  Phosphorylation at ser was confirmed by mass          spectroscopy sequencing of the pI  isoform in our          laboratory Ser HSP phosphorylation was reported as          the percent of ser monophosphorylated pI  plus          diphosphorylated HSP pI  in relation to the sum of          all four species          Identification of the PKC site is putative and is          best described by Beall et al     They found that          phorbol dibutyrate induced phosphorylation in the C          terminal region of HSP based on tryptic digest          analysis We calculated putative PKCHSP          phosphorylation as the percent of putative PKC          monophosphorylated HSP pI  plus diphosphorylated          HSP pI  in relation to the sum of all species For          MRLC phosphorylation was determined as the percent of          phosphorylated smooth muscle MRLC in relation to total          smooth muscle MRLC ie nonmuscle MRLC were          ignored                          Cyclic nucleotide assays          cAMP and cAMP were determined by immunoassays were          performed in a separate set of tissues treated          identically except the homogenization buffer was  M          HCl detailed methods in     Prior analyses showed          the sensitivity of these assays in carotis smooth muscle          homogenates     The University of Virginia Diabetes          Core lab performed the immunoassays with commercial          reagents                          Statistics          Data are presented in the text and
