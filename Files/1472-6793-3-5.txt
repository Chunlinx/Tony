                    Background        Reduction in hypothalamic melanocortin tone caused by        reduction in proopiomelanocortin POMC mRNA and elevation        in agoutirelated peptide AGRP mRNA is thought to play a        key role in mediating nutritional effects on neuroendocrine        function      Thus fasting      insulin        deficiency     and leptin deficiency    are all        associated with reduced hypothalamic melanocortin tone        However factors that regulate hypothalamic melanocortin        tone are not fully elucidated Since both fasting and        insulin deficiency are associated with reduced plasma        leptin     and leptin replacement reverses effects of        fasting    and also effects of insulin deficiency on        food intake and body weight     it has been suggested        that the reduction in leptin accounts for the reduced        hypothalamic melanocortin tone in these conditions        However fasting can influence hypothalamic gene expression        in insulindeficient mice independent of changes in plasma        leptin or insulin     as well as in leptin resistant         dbdb mice     These data suggest        that other factors in addition to leptin may mediate        effects of fasting Since fasting insulin deficiency and        leptin insufficiency also lead to an elevation in plasma        glucocorticoids     and adrenalectomy of        leptindeficient         obob mice largely normalizes        hypothalamic gene expression in these mice     it is        plausible that elevated glucocorticoids may mediate some        effects of nutritional state on hypothalamic gene        expression This hypothesis is particularly compelling        since recent data suggest that aberrant glucocorticoid        activity may play a key role in the development of the        metabolic syndrome            Glucocorticoids have previously been reported to        increase body weight set point as determined by hoarding        behavior in rats     while adrenalectomy has been        reported to lower body weight set point in rats     In        addition central infusion of glucocorticoids leads to        increases in body weight and food intake with a concomitant        induction of hypothalamic NPY     Nevertheless it        remains unclear if an elevation in glucocorticoid        concentration contributes to the effect of fasting on        hypothalamic gene expression Adrenalectomy has been        reported to block elevations in NPY mRNA in response to        fasting     On the other hand it has been reported        that elevation of plasma corticosterone levels is not        required for the induction of NPY mRNA by fasting            In addition the extent to which hypothalamic AGRP and POMC        mRNA depends on elevated glucocorticoid levels in fasting        and insulin deficiency has not been determined to date        Therefore in the present study we assessed if an elevation        of plasma corticosterone is necessary and sufficient to        mediate effects of fasting and insulin deficiency on        hypothalamic melanocortin tone as indicated by expression        of hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA                    Results and Discussion                  Study  Effects of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic          responses to fasting          Fasting reduced body weight and adipose weight in both          the shamoperated and adrenalectomized groups as expected          Table  Blood glucose was also decreased by fasting in          both the shamoperated group and adrenalectomized group          Table  Serum corticosterone concentration increased          with fasting as expected in the shamoperated mice Fig          A adrenalectomy blocked this fastinginduced elevation          of corticosterone Fig A Therefore the          adrenalectomized fasted mice exhibited similar levels of          corticosterone as both the adrenalectomized ad lib fed          mice and the shamoperated ad lib fed mice Fig A As          we noted previously a basal level of corticosterone was          detectable in the adrenalectomized mice after surgery              In contrast to corticosterone other humoral factors          were not significantly affected by adrenalectomy Serum          insulin and serum leptin both exhibited the same          decreases in the adrenalectomized fasted and          shamoperated fasted animals compared to the          adrenalectomized ad lib fed and shamoperated ad lib fed          mice Fig Band C therefore the levels of these          humoral factors were the same in the shamoperated fasted          mice and the adrenalectomized fasted mice          Fasting increased hypothalamic AGRP mRNA as expected          in the shamoperated fasted group and adrenalectomy          completely blocked the induction of AGRP by fasting Fig          A Adrenalectomy also produced a trend to decrease AGRP          mRNA in the adlib fed mice but this effect was not          significant Fig A Fasting decreased hypothalamic          POMC mRNA as expected in the shamoperated fasted group          but fasting had no effect on POMC mRNA in the          adrenalectomized animals Fig B As with AGRP NPY          mRNA was also elevated after fasting and this effect of          fasting on NPY mRNA was also completely blocked by          adrenalectomy Fig C Adrenalectomy therefore          completely blocked the effects of fasting on hypothalamic          AGRP POMC and NPY mRNAs                          Study  Effects of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic          responses to insulin deficiency and fasting          Streptozotocin injection induced diabetes in          shamoperated mice Table  Interestingly          adrenalectomy attenuated the rise in blood glucose in          streptozotocininjected mice Table  Fasting reduced          blood glucose in the ADXSTZFast group below even that          of control mice Table  Streptozotocin injection led          to reduced body weight and adiposity in shamoperated          animals as previously described     Table           whereas adrenalectomy attenuated the loss of both body          weight and adiposity associated with insulin deficiency          Table  Streptozotocin injection also led to          significant hyperphagia typical of diabetic mice             Table  and adrenalectomy also ameliorated this          response to insulin deficiency Table           Serum corticosterone was elevated in the ShamSTZ          group and was decreased in both ADXSTZ and ADXSTZFast          groups Fig A Adrenalectomy did not result in          complete elimination of corticosterone but instead          resulted in low but detectable levels of serum          corticosterone as previously noted    and described          above Serum insulin was reduced to the same extent in          ShamSTZ ADXSTZ and in ADXSTZFast groups compared          to control mice as would be expected with streptozotocin          injection Fig B Serum leptin was also reduced to the          same levels in all experimental groups compared to          control mice Fig C          Hypothalamic AGRP mRNA was significantly elevated in          shamoperated diabetic vs shamoperated euglycemic          mice as expected     Fig A However          adrenalectomy completely blocked the elevation of AGRP          mRNA in diabetic mice whether or not they were fasted          Fig A Hypothalamic POMC mRNA was reduced in diabetic          mice as expected     Fig B Adrenalectomy          blocked this reduction in POMC mRNA in diabetic mice          whether or not they were fasted Fig B As with AGRP          mRNA NPY mRNA was elevated in diabetic mice and          adrenalectomy blocked this induction of NPY mRNA in          diabetic mice whether or not they were fasted Fig C          In summary hypothalamic AGRP POMC and NPY mRNA all          exhibited the expected changes in association with          streptozotocininduced diabetes     Fig ABC          and adrenalectomy largely or completely blocked all these          responses to insulin deficiency whether or not the mice          were fasted Fig ABC                          Study  Effects of corticosterone implants on          hypothalamic gene expression          Implantation of corticosterone implants for  hours          significantly increased serum corticosterone compared to          placeboimplanted mice as expected Fig A          Interestingly the corticosterone implants also          significantly increased serum insulin and leptin Fig          Band C In contrast the corticosterone implants did          not significantly influence body weight or food intake          compared to placeboimplanted mice body weight of             g for the placebo group compared to    g for          the corticosterone implant group food intake of             gday for the placebo group compared to             gday for the corticosterone implant group although          epididymal adipose tissue depot was slightly smaller in          the corticosterone implant group    g for the          placebo group compared to    g for the          corticosterone implant group p            Corticosterone implants also had no influence on blood          glucose    mgdl for the placebo group          compared to    mgdl for the corticosterone          implant group          Implantation of corticosterone implants for  hours          significantly elevated hypothalamic AGRP expression          compared to the placebo group Fig A Hypothalamic          POMC mRNA was also significantly elevated in the          corticosterone implant group Fig B Hypothalamic NPY          mRNA exhibited a trend toward an increase although the          effect was not significant p   Fig C Therefore          hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNAs were both induced by the          glucocorticoid implant whereas the NPY mRNA was not          significantly influenced                            Conclusions        In the present study adrenalectomy and corticosterone        implants were used to address the role of elevated        corticosterone in mediating the effects of fasting and        insulin deficiency on hypothalamic gene expression        resulting in several novel observations First we have        demonstrated that adrenalectomy can block the elevation of        AGRP mRNA and the reduction in POMC mRNA with fasting        consistent with previous findings by Ponsalle et al        concerning NPY     and suggesting that increases in        corticosterone mediate fastinginduced changes in        melanocortin tone Second we have also shown that        hypothalamic responses to insulin deficiency require        elevation in corticosterone Third we have demonstrated        using corticosterone implants that elevated corticosterone        is sufficient to enhance hypothalamic AGRP expression but        not to reduce hypothalamic POMC mRNA Together these        results suggest that an elevation of corticosterone is        necessary for reduction in melanocortin tone during fasting        and with diabetes and is sufficient to induce hypothalamic        AGRP mRNA but not to reduce POMC expression        Although a reduction in plasma leptin plays an important        role in mediating neuroendocrine responses to fasting           and diabetes     we have previously demonstrated that        fasting can regulate hypothalamic melanocortin tone        independently of both leptin and insulin     The        present studies suggest that corticosterone may play a role        in mediating these leptinindependent effects Fasting was        associated with elevated corticosterone Fig A and        reduced insulin and leptin Fig Band C as well as        melanocortin tone Fig Aand B as expected However        preventing the elevation of corticosterone completely        blocked the effect of fasting on hypothalamic AGRP and POMC        mRNA Fig Aand B without preventing effects of fasting        on plasma leptin or insulin Adrenalectomy also blocked the        effects of fasting on hypothalamic NPY mRNA Fig C        confirming the findings of Ponsalle et al     These        data suggest that leptins effect to reverse effects of        fasting on melanocortin tone may require and be mediated by        a reduction in glucocorticoids        Glucocorticoids were also elevated as expected in        insulindeficient diabetes Fig A and serum insulin        leptin and melanocortin tone were also reduced in this        condition Fig Band C Aand B As with fasting the        reduction in plasma leptin could largely be a reflection of        the reduction in adipose weight as well as plasma insulin        In turn as with fasting the reduction of plasma leptin        could be the cause of the elevation of hypothalamic AGRP        and NPY mRNA as well as the reduction of hypothalamic POMC        mRNA On the other hand blocking the rise in        corticosterone by adrenalectomy prevented the reduction in        hypothalamic POMC mRNA and the induction of AGRP mRNA        without reversing either the reduced leptin or the reduced        adiposity characteristic of insulindeficient diabetic        mice Fig Aand B These data suggest that reversal of        effects of insulin deficiency by leptin    may require        and be mediated by a reduction in glucocorticoids We had        previously shown that fasting could regulate hypothalamic        gene expression in insulindeficient mice even though in        these mice fasting did not influence plasma leptin or        insulin     Since adrenalectomy blocked the        fastinginduced reduction in melanocortin tone in diabetic        mice as it had in euglycemic mice in the first study        these results suggest that effects of fasting on        melanocortin tone in diabetic mice may be mediated at least        in part by a rise in plasma corticosterone itself possibly        secondary to the reduction in plasma leptin        Implanting corticosterone implants for  hours led to        an elevation in both hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA Fig        B Since adrenalectomy blocked the elevation of AGRP mRNA        by fasting and insulin deficiency elevation of        corticosterone would be expected to increase hypothalamic        AGRP mRNA as was indeed observed However the        corticosterone implants produced the unexpected effect of        elevating hypothalamic POMC mRNA a rare if not unique        circumstance in which hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA are        regulated in the same direction The basis of this        unexpected phenomenon is not yet clear However since        leptin and insulin both stimulate hypothalamic POMC            the elevation of insulin and leptin in the        corticosteroneimplanted mice Fig Band C the former        possibly mediated by glucocorticoidinduced insulin        resistance and the latter possibly mediated by the        resulting hyperinsulinemia might mediate the observed        effect of corticosterone implants on hypothalamic POMC in        these implanted mice On the other hand leptin inhibits        hypothalamic AGRP mRNA     yet AGRP mRNA was        nevertheless elevated in the face of elevated insulin and        leptin These data suggest that in fasting and        insulindeficient diabetes as in leptindeficient         obob mice      glucocorticoids        dominate leptin and insulin levels in determining AGRP        expression whereas insulin and leptin dominate        glucocorticoids in determining hypothalamic POMC        expression These data are also consistent with the        observation that in streptozotocininduced diabetic rats        replacement of insulin is not sufficient to normalize        elevated serum corticosterone or the elevated hypothalamic        AGRP mRNA while it does partially normalize plasma leptin        and hypothalamic POMC mRNA            After the present paper was submitted for review we        became aware of a recent study by Savontaus et al        examining the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of        hypothalamic gene expression in rats     using a        roughly similar experimental design as in the present        study In several respects the conclusions from this study        are similar to the present study for example        corticoisterone implants increased hypothalamic AGRP and        POMC mRNA and adrenalectomy blocked the effect of fasting        on hypothalamic POMC mRNA However in one key respect the        results reported by Savontaus et al differed from those in        the present paper adrenalectomy failed to block the        effects of fasting on hypothalamic AGRP and NPY even        though corticosterone implants were observed to induce AGRP        mRNA Since we observed that adrenalectomy also blocks the        effects of diabetes on hypothalamic gene expression in the        present study we suspect the difference between the        present study and that of Savontaus et al is probably due        to different regulatory requirements in mice and rats For        example it is clear that the regulation of AGRP differs in        rats and mice since in mice hypothalamic AGRP mRNA is        elevated by a deficiency in leptin receptor function           but in rats this is not true     However hypothalamic        POMC is regulated similarly in rats and mice and this is        probably the more important element regulating metabolic        phenotype        Taken together these data suggest that elevated        glucocorticoids are sufficient to drive the increase in        hypothalamic AGRP mRNA during fasting and diabetes but not        the reduction in POMC mRNA Interestingly at least with        respect to food intake and body weight over this hour        period the elevation of POMC appears to compensate for the        elevation in AGRP to produce no net functional effect on        body weight homeostasis in the presence of significantly        elevated plasma corticosterone After more chronic        exposure this delicate balance could plausibly become        disrupted leading to glucocorticoidmediated development        of the metabolic syndrome     Thus interactions        between insulin leptin and glucocorticoids and the        neuropeptide responses they generate within the        melanocortin system allow complex metabolic responses to        nutritional status but may also allow the development of        metabolic pathologies                    Methods                  Animals          The appropriate Institutional Animal Review Board had          approved all studies          To study the effect of adrenalectomy on          fastinginduced changes in hypothalamic gene expression          Study  two monthold male CBlJ mice were obtained          from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME Mice were          individually housed with free

procedure as adrenalectomy except that          the adrenal glands were grasped but not removed After          the surgery all mice were given one injection of          dexamethasone  mgkg bw ip to facilitate recovery          from surgery The drinking water was replaced with normal          saline  NaCl to compensate for the loss of          mineralocorticoids Body weight was monitored for one          week following the operation at which time it was          verified that the animals had recovered initial body          weight as expected All mice were placed in fresh cages          with new bedding and food was removed from half of the          adrenalectomized mice and half of the sham operated mice          for  hours This resulted in four groups sham ad lib          fed n   sham

     surgery Dexamethasone treatment continued until four          days after the streptozotocin injection Mice were then          monitored for two weeks without the dexamethasone          injection at which point half the adrenalectomizedSTZ          treated group were fasted while the rest of the mice were          ad lib fed This resulted in four separate groups

after which time all          the mice were sacrificed          For all studies mice were sacrificed following a          balanced design towards the end of the light period          between  and  h Mice were decapitated          decapitation after a brief approximately  second          exposure to carbon dioxide we have verified in pilot          studies that the brief exposure to carbon dioxide does          not significantly affect the plasma corticosterone levels          under these conditions Table  Adrenalectomy was          verified in each individual by visual inspection to
