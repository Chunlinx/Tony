                okay what kind of pets do you have   i have two miniature Schnauzers   oh how cute are they very old     um one of them is just a year old and the other one is four   oh so get got one with a lot of puppies still in it   umhum i am afraid so   do you train them did you train them   uhhuh somewhat   do can they do tricks and stuff   well a little bit i am mainly i just like them for companionship and you know they they they can retrieve and that sort of thing but   yeah oh really   i dont teach them to do dancing or anything       how about yourself   well my husband thinks hes married to Ellie May Clampitt   is that right   yes we have four dogs and lots of fish and then uh where i live i have some wild rabbits that live outside so   uhhuh   i consider them my pets too   umhum   i go out and talk to them and give them you know things out of the refrigerator i do not know if they ever really eat any of it or not but uh my dogs are mainly just mutts they are they are all big though they are like half Lab and half Collie   umhum oh okay   so i have big dogs and i had never had big dogs until i got married i had a little toy Poodle as i was growing up   umhum   and my dad had bird dogs but you know i normally i was used to having a little puppy that i could hold and snuggle and boy these big dogs are something else   umhum but you know what it surprises me my neighbor has um Dalmatians and they want to be in your lap just like puppies do   oh really yeah thats what one of my my male dog thinks he is a lap dog but uh         its real funny because we have a water bed and one of my dogs is afraid of the thunder and so when it thunders she hits the water bed and like catapults you up   umhum umhum   its a real treat   yes im sure it is you just never know where you are going to be do you  oh   no but its real funny cause shes just big and shes real ferocious but boy if it thunders she is just like a little baby   hum that really tames her down quick doesnt it   oh yeah its real funny i got a book on you know how to train you dog to keep from being afraid of thunder but golly i had to quit my job and stay home     umhum   thats interesting i i had a a miniature Schnauzer um ive always had them well since the early seventies i really like the breed   yeah   um but my silver one i had to put to sleep a few years ago but now she she was afraid of thunder but she would go into the main bathroom which is surrounded by the house theres no outside windows or anything okay   oh uhhuh uhhuh   and i guess she felt safest there but shed crawl into the bath tub   really   umhum whenever there was thunder and lightning and then i felt just bad for her because she would shake even thought she was in there but there was not much i could do   oh yeah huh   but the other the the puppy i got after that which is the the four year old and then um i bought a mate for her to have company and uh the young one thats a year old they do not even notice it when it thunders and lightning huhuh it does not bother them a bit   really thats good do they play get along real well with each other   umhum very well together yeah   yeah well thats what my uh Dr Jim Humphreys i watch his show sometimes and he said that dogs are pack animals and so they are a lot happier when they have a buddy to play with   umhum yeah and i always felt so guilty leaving the one by itself you know and of course with your four   oh yeah oh yeah they have they have a big time   yeah  oh thats great   but its really funny cause i mean you know obviously nobody plans to have four dogs but uh my husband had the two and then   umhum   shortly after we got married the couple behind us had a dog that they just were tired of and they were going to have her put to sleep and she was just gorgeous and we said no we will take her and find her a home and we did   umhum you kept her     and then the little one that or the the last one i guess i should say um my husband saw her get hit by a car so he loaded her up and brought her home thinking wed find her a home and we did   oh umhum   because right now i am so attached to all of them i could not get rid of one if i had to   i know well they sound like they are real fortunate to have found you too you know   oh yeah yeah they are real fun we take them pretty much everywhere i mean we have to God it costs us a fortune to board them   oh well sure it would   but um we go camping and they go with us and we have the best time   umhum well how do you maintain any decorum around your house     its difficult um they are all black and so i told my husband i said boy next time we are either going to get a black carpet or blonde dogs   umhum   because i said this is just too much and then people say when are you going to have children and we are like well when we start getting rid of dogs   umhum       my i have a neighbor we live on most of the lots out here are a half acre to an acre   oh wow   and they have five and what shes done is she sees them along side the road stray or something she will bring them home   oh my gosh oh yeah   and her husband finally said thats enough you know we cant have any more       but its amazing i have gone over there and the majority is they were two two large dogs and theyre outdoors and the other three were in the house but you would never know that she had dogs   uhhuh really yeah   she must scrub the floors every day   well my husband vacuums a lot  especially when they are shedding   um you almost have to thats why i had the miniature Schnauzers cause they do not shed yeah   oh really well now my dad just got a Schnauzer but i do not know i guess its not considered miniature because um its what i consider normal size   they have the standard and the giant  and uh i understand ive been to dog shows and i have seen them i have not been around them but i understand that they are very gentle animals   oh huh   even even so they are so big   yeah   but uh the only thing that   well how big is big i mean like the size of a Collie big     um i believe the the standard are the size of a collie and the giant gets bigger than that if i am not mistaken   wow oh well then what daddy has must be a miniature too because its   the miniatures are usually about fifteen inches high yeah   yeah yeah   and thats how my are and then you know even though they are miniature they can be large for their size or small for their size   huh well have you ever seen a Schnoodle   yes   i just love they were so cute   yes um a member of my family has one back home yeah they they are real cute   oh really well the first time i saw one i just fell in love and me and Kyle just said like no we cant have any more dogs  i know     come on now get serious right thats enough is enough uhhuh   yeah it just kills me to go i cant even go into a pet store because i want a puppy so badly     oh yeah   and so its real funny all my girlfriends say yeah everybody else is saying i want a baby and Jackie is saying i want a puppy     well i dont know if you if you have ever had a litter but its a wonderful experience yeah um the older one that ive got shes had two litters and it is so much fun   no really oh wow oh but i just couldnt bear to give those puppies away     it oh listen i raised three of them i kept three until they were about four months old i just could not part with them and then you know i had to   oh oh yeah   and i didnt think i would be able to sell them when they were three months old but it was amazing i have a i have an enclosed patio and so thats where i kept the dogs and theres a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard thats fenced so the mother trained the puppies   yeah oh really well thats neat   yeah to to go in and out and its real interesting to watch how they they take care of one another and how she corrects them and and when they they fight like kids and she will break them up it was just really neat   yeah huh   huh   and uh it was it was quite an experience and i wanted to the other one that i have is black and silver and i wanted to have puppies with her but she had a medical problem and i had to have she had to have surgery so   oh yeah oh yeah   she is not able to have puppies but shes and dont dont you
