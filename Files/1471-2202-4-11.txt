                    Background        The neurotrophins play crucial functions in the        interaction of muscles with their innervating neurons        during development and in the adult vertebrate organism        The neurotrophin family includes Nerve Growth Factor NGF        Neurotrophin NT Neurotrophin NT        Neurotrophin NT and Brainderived Neurotrophic Factor        BDNF Three neurotrophins BDNF NT and NT are        known to contribute to the development maintenance and        functioning of the neuromuscular system Each of these        three neurotrophins is expressed differentially in muscle        during development in the adult and in response to injury        NT is the most abundantly expressed of the three        neurotrophins during embryonic muscle development followed        by NT and BDNF      After birth NT and NT        are downregulated in muscle whereas BDNF continues to be        expressed at low levels     BDNF mRNA is expressed in        myocytes in the adult muscle     Essentially nothing is        known about BDNF gene expression in fish muscle We        detected BDNF mRNA in the muscle layer of the fin of the         days old zebrafish larvae using in situ hybridization            but the identity of the expressing cells has not yet been        definitvely established        The first demonstration that BDNF potentiates        neuromuscular transmission was reported by Lohof AM et al            BDNF transiently stabilizes silent NM synapses        during the period of transition from polyneuronal to        mononeuronal innervation of skeletal muscle fibers            BDNF and CNTF cooperatively affect efficiency of embryonic        xenopus neuromuscular synapses in culture      BDNF        stimulates transmitter release from neuromuscular synapses           and enhances the efficiency of transmission at the        neuromuscular synapse     BDNF together with NT        can restore neuregulin levels and a normal distribution of        AchR at the neuromuscular junction blocked with curare            BDNF in conjunction with fibronectin increases        spontaneous synaptic currents in the cultured embryonic        xenopus neuromuscular junction     BDNF downregulates        AchR clustering most likely by binding to TrkB expressed        in myocytes     BDNF downregulates agrin levels in        muscle but increases neuregulin in ventral horn spinal        motor neurons at the time when they form neuromuscular        synapses            BDNF production is activity dependent     Muscle        activity is required to maintain BDNF mRNA levels in rat        soleus muscle      Vigorous exercise increases BDNF        mRNA levels above baseline     Neuromuscular blockade        in culture also decreases BDNF mRNA levels In response to        nerve injury BDNF mRNA is slowly but substantially        increased in Schwann cells and muscle fibers     BDNF        expression is also increased in cardiac myocytes following        ischemic injury            The molecular mechanisms that induce BDNF gene        expression in muscle during development maintain basal        expression in the adult muscle and dynamically regulate        BDNF mRNA in muscle in response to neuromuscular activity        and injury are not known To understand the contribution of        BDNF gene transcription to this regulation we have begun to        examine the structure organization and expression of the        zebrafish BDNF gene The mammalian BDNF gene is known to        have at least four promoters whose cellspecific and        developmental activity is differentially regulated                  The transcripts derived from these        promoters have a common organization They all consist of        two exons one of the  noncoding exons followed by the        coding exon which is common to all transcripts        We previously cloned a zebrafish BDNF transcript that        appeared to contain two exons and thus suggested that the        zebrafish and mammalian BDNF genes have similar        organizations     We recently cloned the zebrafish BDNF        gene and identified the previously cloned  exon in the        genomic clone     The exon was named exon c Sequence        analysis confirmed that the position of the intron that        separates exon c from the common coding exon is identical        in fish and man In addition the size of the intron is        similar in fish and mouse Exon c contains a  bp        sequence that is  identical to a segment in exon III of        the rat BDNF gene Transient expression in developing        zebrafish embryos of the promoter upstream from exon c        using an EGFPF reporter revealed expression in a number of        cell types including skeletal muscle epithelial cells        notochord and vascular cells        I here report the cloning structural analysis and        transcriptional activity in transiently transfected        developing zebrafish embryos of three additional  exons        and their associated promoters Two of the  exons were        found in the same transcript This transcript thus contains        three exons a novel structure of a BDNF transcript not        previously reported These two exons could not be found by        homology searches in the mammalian genome but were detected        in the pufferfish genome The promoter upstream from the         exon of the tripartite transcript was linked to the EGFPF        reporter The fusion gene was exclusively expressed in        terminally differentiated myocytes of developing zebrafish        embryos The  flank immediately upstream from the        promoter is GCrich and contains multiple Splike        sequences as well as several potential Mef binding sites        These transcription factors are known to be important for        the expression of genes in myocytes Although the        endogenous exon and promoter were expressed in embryonic        muscle the endogenous exon could not be detected in        juvenile fish or adult female muscle by RTPCR Possible        explanations for this discrepancy are discussed                    Results                  The zebrafish BDNF gene has at least four           noncoding exons          The organization of all neurotrophin genes so far          examined is similar      It was therefore expected          that the zebrafish BDNF gene would have multiple           exons To identify additional  exons  RACE was          employed To maximize the chances of finding all existing          exons total RNA extracted from  days old larvae was          used as the template The relative abundance of BDNF          transcripts in total RNA dramatically increases in the          first  days of development and plateaus by  days pf                       Initially  of the  RACE clones were screened for          inserts by restriction enzyme digest figure  To          identify  RACE clones that contained novel           noncoding exons the nucleotide sequences of          representatives of groups of clones with similar sizes          were determined The sequences were compared with the          sequences of subclones of the genomic BDNF clone c          which we had previously identified and partially          sequenced     Five of the ten sequenced  RACE          clones contained the already known and previously cloned           exon     This exon was named exon c because it          contains a  nucleotide segment in which  nucleotides          are identical with a segment in rat exon III suggesting          the two exons are orthologous see table  and figure a                       Two clones contained  bp inserts The first           nucleotides were found close to the  end of a  kb          genomic HindIII fragment of c that contains exon c          close to its centre     The next  nucleotides          were found  nucleotides downstream suggesting that          they represented an internal exon Classical splice          acceptor and donor dinucleotides surround this  bp          exon see table   additional file  consistent with          an internal position in a BDNF transcript The shorter          more  exon was named exon b and the more  exon exon          b see figure           All known BDNF gene  exons are directly spliced to          the common coding exon generating mature messages that          contain two exons a single  noncoding and the common          coding exon Finding an internal exon was thus unexpected          and surprising          A single clone contained a  bp insert The sequence          of the insert was not found in the available c          subclone sequences To determine if it might be a BDNF           exon it was compared with all known sequences using          BLAST A segment of  nucleotides that was identical          with a segment in rat exon II was found suggesting the          insert was a  BDNF gene exon This segment was named          highly conserved sequence  or HCS see table            additional file  The exon was named exon a          Additional File           Table   Highly

   Click here for file          Exon a was located outside the sequenced regions of          the genomic clone c     To identify its location          in c a HindIII restriction digest of c was          subjected to southern blot hybridization analysis using a          probe specific for exon a A  KB HindIII fragment          specifically hybridized to the probe This fragment was          subcloned into the HindIII site of the EGFP vector by          plusminus green cloning A  KB region containing exon          a was sequenced Comparison of the genomic and  RACE          sequences indicated that the novel  portion of the          insert was present as a continuous sequence in the          genomic clone Moreover a classical splice donor site          followed the  end table   see additional file           The insert thus represented a  noncoding exon of the          zebrafish BDNF gene          These cloning and sequencing data indicate that at          least three distinct transcripts are derived from the          zebrafish BDNF gene figure           A single  RACE clone did not exhibit any homology to          the mammalian or zebrafish BDNF genes A BLAST search          identified the insert as the  end of actin mRNA                          Organization of the Zebrafish and mammalian BDNF          Genes are similar          The locations of the exons identified by  RACE in          the BDNF transcription unit were mapped in three ways          First their nucleotide sequences were compared with that          of clone CHJ which carries a  KB zebrafish          genomic fragment NCBI databank accession  AL          Exon b was found at nucleotides  exon b at          nucleotides  and exon c at nucleotides           figure  Exon a was not found          Second the nucleotide sequences were compared to          known BDNF exons by a BLAST search A short segment of          identity was found in exon a with exon  of the mouse          human and rat genes suggesting it is orthologous to          these exons and thus should lie upstream from exon b          see table   see additional file  These analyses          placed exon a upstream from exons b b and c and          upstream from the  end of clone CHJ          Third to confirm this upstream location and to          estimate the distance between exon a and b longrange          PCR was done with a sense primer exaP in exon a and          an antisense primer in exon b scP using the          genomic clone c as a template A PCR product of  KB          was obtained see figure  No PCR product was obtained          when sense and antisense primers were switched The PCR          product would be expected to be  if the exon a and b          containing HindIII fragments were contiguous The larger          size suggested that a  KB HindIII fragment was present          between the two To test this possibility the PCR          product was digested with HindIII Three fragments were          generated indicating the presence of an interposed          fragment Their sizes were consistent with the largest          and smallest being derived from the exon b and a          containing HindIII fragments respectively and the          middle one being an interposed fragment A HindIII          subclone of c was found with an insert identical in          size with the interposed fragment figure  The          subclone was named DexaDS The insert of DexaDS was          sequenced and its orientation determined by PCR using          either primer exaP or scP paired with a primer          DexaDSP located within DexaDS          The sequencing and PCR data and the nucleotide          sequence of clone CHJ were used to construct a          HindIII map of the zebrafish BDNF gene see figure                                    Comparison with pufferfish gene suggests existence          of an additional exon          The pufferfish BDNF gene is located in the          scaffold contig Ensembl           Fugu rubripes and           Danio rerio both belong to the          infraclass teleostei The two BDNF genes can therefore be          expected to be well conserved The nucleotide sequences          of the two genes were searched for identities using          Bestfit and Gap from the GCG sequence analysis package          These comparisons revealed three regions in the          pufferfish gene whose nucleotide sequences were           identical with exons a b and c of the zebrafish gene          The relative positions of these exons to each other and          the coding exons were identical in both genes The          distances between these exons and their distances to the          coding exon were also very similar An additional region          of  identity was found between exon c and the          coding exon at nucleotides  of the zebrafish          sequence nucleotide numbers of clone CHJ This          region could represent exon d and hence might correspond          to rat and mouse exon  Since this exon has not yet been          cloned by  RACE its inclusion in figure is          tentative          Collectively the  RACE mapping PCR and sequence          comparison data suggest that the zebrafish BDNF gene has          at least  and possibly  noncoding exons if exon  d is          included and that at least one transcript has  exons          see figure                           Exons a and c contain highly conserved          sequences          Nucleotide sequence analysis of the  RACE clones so          far identified three additional  exons namely exons          a  b and b A striking structural feature of exon a          is a  nucleotide highly conserved segment HCS that          is identical to a segment of rat exon II see table            additional file  and figure  The function of HCS is          unknown This segment is also conserved in the pufferfish          genome scaffold scaffold We previously          reported the presence of a  bp segment within exon c          in which  bps are identical in man and fish see table            additional file  The significance of this highly          conserved segment HCS is unknown          In contrast to exons a and c exons b and b          exhibit only random similarity with the known mammalian          exons A region of high similarity was found in the          pufferfish gene in a location expected for exon b Exon          b differs from any mammalian counterparts in that it is          an internal noncoding exon So far internal noncoding          exons have only been described in other neurotrophin          genes at first in the mouse NGF gene     and          subsequently in the NT gene    and more recently in          the NT gene                              The  flank of exon b is GCrich and contains          multiple Sp and Mef binding site consensus          sequences          The flanking regions of exons a and b were analyzed          for potential transcription factor binding sites using          the Transfac database and search engine     The          flank of exon b is GCrich and contains multiple          potential Sp binding sites close to the promoter Two          potential Mef sites were also found see table            additional file  The nucleotide sequence is strikingly          similar to that of the  flank of the FGFR gene The          FGFR gene is

                         Fusion genes containing exon bb are specifically          expressed in skeletal muscle          To confirm that the cloned promoters were functionally          competent and to begin to identify regulatory regions          within the promoters the cloned promoters were linked to          the EGFPF reporter see figure  The fusion genes were          injected into embryos and expression examined by          fluorescent microscopy in live embryos          Promoter b was linked to the EGFPF reporter using a          HindIIIBamHI fragment that contained  flank exons b

sequences and all SV sequences except the SV           UT and polyA addition site were removed by MluI          digestion followed by purification on an agarose gel          In two series of injections  embryos were injected          with AJ The day survival rate was   of the          surviving embryos expressed the reporter  days after          fertilization Over  of the expressing cells were          skeletal muscle cells Expression was mostly seen in          trunk muscles rarely close to the tail and never in the          head figure  In a few embryos AJ was also expressed          in notochord and vascular cells In a rare embryo          expression was seen in neurons and blood cells          To further narrow down the sequences that are          responsible for expression in myocytes exon b was          directly linked to the reporter using a PstI site           nucleotides downstream from the transcription start site          see clone CHJ In this construct which was

EGFPF reporter in a          similar fashion figure  The  flank extended to           KB However only  bps of intron a were used Thus          the total composite intron size was  bps This          construct which was named DOA was injected into sets of           and  embryos The survival rate was  and            of the combined survivors expressed the reporter All          had an unusual pattern of expression There was intense          labelling of round structures of variable size and          labelling intensity by  h pf see figure  These          structures did not conform to any cellular or subcellular          shapes They were close to the surface of the embryos          Because of limited spatial resolution it was not clear          whether they were in the yolk or in cells on the surface          of the embryo These structures tended to be present in          limited sections of the embryo but generally did not          follow a specific pattern However in a few embryos          there were more ordered patterns In one embryo there was          a line of labelled structures coinciding with the          embryonic midline In the same embryo there was an          anterior semilunar patch arranged symmetrically about the          midline By  h pf most of the labelled structures had          moved into the embryo in various and seemingly random          locations By  days pf only a few remained and by           days pf no labelled structures or cells were seen in           of the embryos A very rare embryo had expression in the          notochord or transient expression in several myocytes          The same expression was found with a construct in which          the exon was directly linked to the reporter at a BglII          site This construct has no intron                          Expression of endogenous exons is          tissuespecific          The fusion genes containing exon b and its  flank          were expressed only in skeletal muscle To determine          whether the endogenous exon were also expressed          cellspecifically total RNA was extracted from the          skeletal muscle of an adult female and analyzed for exon          a using RTPCR To increase specificity and sensitivity          two rounds of PCR were done with nested primers Diluting          the cDNA template fold prior to amplification with          actin primers checked the quality of the cDNA actin          mRNA was readily amplified in the first round of PCR          indicating the cDNA was of good quality Surprisingly          exon b could not be detected even after two rounds of          PCR see figure  The primers were competent as they          yielded product when the RACE clone was used as a          template          Exon b could be spliced directly to exon  The          resulting bipartite transcript would yield a PCR product          of  bps No PCR products in that sizerange were seen          A set of nested antisense primers that is  bps further          downstream also gave negative results In contrast to          exon b exon c was detected in muscle RNA after the          second round of PCR Total RNA from whole juvenile fish          was also analyzed as it should contain all exons that          are expressed at this stage of development Both exon a          and c were found The amplifications with exon b          primers yielded minor amounts of DNA that did not          comigrate with the controls It is possible that they          represent transcripts in which exon b is spliced to          exons other than b                            Discussion        The data presented in this report show that the overall        organization of the BDNF gene is similar in fish and man        However fish and human genes differ significantly in the        size of the transcription unit the number of exons and        the splicing patterns of the exons In contrast the        zebrafish and pufferfish BDNF genes are highly similar in        all regions that could be compared The pufferfish gene is        flanked on the  side by a kinesin gene that lies  kb        upstream from the BDNF coding exon and on the  side by a        Lin gene less than  kb downstream from the coding exon        The fish transcription unit thus appears to span between         and  KB In contrast the mouse and human genes are        between  and  KB long at least twice and possibly four        times as large The difference in size is due to much        larger introns in the mammalian genes        A second difference between fish and mammalian genes is        the generation of a tripartite transcript from the fish        gene Such tripartite transcripts have not yet been        described in mouse rat or human A more thorough        examination of all human transcripts may eventually uncover        tripartite messages in the human        A third difference between fish and mammalian genes is        the much greater diversity of exons in the human gene even        when compared with the mouse However neither in the        zebrafish nor the mouse has an exhaustive search for all        possible exons been conducted yet We have recently found        additional exons in a second round of RACE However they        have not yet been sequenced or mapped on the transcription        unit        The  exons of the rat and mouse genes and their        associated promoters are expressed in a tissue and        cellspecific manner     The data presented here as        well as data presented in a previous report    indicate        that the zebrafish BDNF gene promoters are also expressed        in a tissuespecific manner When linked to the EGFPF        reporter exon b was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle        cells Visible expression did not start until the myocytes        exhibited striations However there may a significant time        lag between onset of transcription of the transfected DNA        EGFPF aggregation and insertion into the membrane Both        are required for efficient fluorescence Thus the precise        onset of transcription of the transgene is uncertain It is        also possible that the EGFPF reporter is quite stable and        persists beyond a period of transient transcription        The exclusive expression of the promoter b construct in        skeletal muscle differs markedly from the previously        reported expression of a promoter c construct     The        previously tested reporter c construct was identical to        the promoter b construct injected here except for the        promoter sequences It was expressed in a number of cell        types including notochord epithelial and endothelial        cells and skeletal muscle        The  flank of exon b was searched with TransFac for        potential transcription factor binding sites            Potential binding sites for three transcription factors        that have been shown to play key roles in muscle gene        expression were found Sp Mef and SRF     Four        potential Sp and two Mef bindings sites were found within         bps of the transcription start A potential SRF binding        site is also close to the transcription start site Farther        upstream two AP sites were found These Sp and Mef        sites may play a role in muscle expression of the BDNF        gene The proximal  flank of the FGFR gene has a similar        clustering of SP Mef and SRF sites     The FGFR        gene is expressed in terminally differentiated muscle        although at a lower level than in proliferating myoblasts            The expression depends on Sp sites in the proximal        promoter and the binding of Sp and Sp to these sites        The absence of Sp and Sp from fully differentiated        myocytes may explain the downregulation in terminally        differentiated muscle        Unexpectedly RTPCR did not detect exon b in total RNA        extracted from skeletal muscle of an adult female see        figure  It is possible that exon b is expressed in        skeletal myoblasts only transiently during the period of        innervation by primary and secondary motor neurons We did        not assay RNA from these early stages of development It is        also possible that exon b is expressed primarily in        proliferating myoblasts The expression in skeletal        myocytes observed in the reported experiments could        represent persistence of the EGFPF reporter protein past        the time of downregulation of transcription in myocytes Or        our construct could lack a suppressor that turns the        endogenous promoter off in terminally differentiated and        innervated myocytes It is also possible that our construct        is expressed ectopically However the similarity of its         flank with that of the FGFR gene is striking A more        detailed analysis of the time course of expression of the        endogenous gene and cellular localization of BDNF        transcripts in muscle is needed to address these        possibilities        In contrast to the situation with exon b exon c was        detected by RTPCR in adult female muscle RNA see figure         The RTPCR data do not identify the cells that express        exon c Muscle contains blood vessels and mixed nerves        Endothelial cells are known to express BDNF     and so        do Schwann cells     These cells may contribute to the        exon c transcripts Is exon c expressed in myocytes The        RTPCR data strongly suggest so In addition a construct        that is driven by the exon c promoter is expressed in        various types of muscle cells     However it is also        expressed in a number of nonmuscle cells Thus its        expression is much broader than the exclusive muscle        expression of the exon b construct When the exon c        construct was extended in the  direction to include exon        b and its flank expression was still broad data not        shown manuscript in preparation The Sp and Mef        elements thus are not capable of suppressing expression in        other cell types        It should be noted that both the exon b and exon c        expression constructs contained the SV IEG UT and        polyadenylation signals downstream from the EGFPF reporter        rather than BDNF sequences see figure  It is becoming        clear that their presence affects expression manuscript in        preparation However their effect may be quantitative        rather than qualitative In any event exon c is the only        exon that was detected in adult female muscle by RTPCR        Exon b appears to play a more limited role during        development and possibly in muscle injury and        regeneration        The exon a construct was not expressed in any        identifiable embryonic or larval cells at the somite        stage yet there was intense labelling of yolk platelets        The platelets are close to the surface They are        congregated preferentially near the midline It is not        clear whether the platelets become labelled in the yolk or        within cells Their location close to the surface suggests        they become labelled in the yolk syncitial layer YSL The        YSL begins to form at the kcell stage or  h after        fertilization when transcription of zygotic genes begins        By the dome stage the YSL has completely covered the yolk        cell and effectively separates the embryo from the yolk        cell The peripheral blastomeres of the YSL appear to        maintain cytoplasmic bridges with the yolk cell These        peripheral blastomeres may continue to take up platelets        They must also transcribe the exon a construct This        possibility is consistent with our previous in situ        hybridization analyses which revealed BDNF expression in        the peripheral YSL     Some of the labeled platelets        end up in cells of the embryo and persist up to  days of        development These platelets must represent the earliest        onset of transcription of the injected construct possibly        at the onset of zygotic gene transcription        It is not clear why this particular construct        consistently and strongly labels yolk platelets We        routinely get expression of other constructs in the yolk of        a small number of embryos presumably when there is        unintended injection or leakage into the yolk However in        all these embryos there is diffuse labeling of the membrane        of the yolk cell rather than labeling of platelets Since        they all encode the same reporter and share the same  UT        the difference must originate from the noncoding         regions of the construct either the  flank or  UT                    Conclusions        The zebrafish BDNF gene is much more compact than the        mammalian gene and rivals in compactness that of the        vertebrate with the smallest known genome the puffer fish        The more compact size makes the zebrafish more amenable to        comprehensive molecular genetic analysis than the mammalian        gene The zebrafish has multiple differentially regulated        promoters and  exons like its mammalian counterpart Two        of the four presently known  exons contain conserved        segments that are identical in fish and man The promoter        containing a segment identical to rat exon II is        transiently expressed in the yolk syncitial layer The        remaining two exons are novel and generate a tripartite        transcript The novel promoter is specifically expressed in        myocytes of transfected embryos but the endogenous exon is        not expressed in adult female muscle The cloned BDNF gene        and knowledge of its organization are invaluable tools for        a future genetic analysis of the regulation of BDNF gene        expression

sequenced                          Sequencing of Genomic DNA and Identification of          Exons          The previously identified genomic BDNF clone             was digested with HindIII and HindIII fragments subcloned          into the HindIII site of pEGFP BDNF exoncontaining          subclones were identified by dotblot hybridization using          digoxigeninlabelled probes prepared from  RACE clones          by PCR The exoncontaining regions of hybridizing          subclones were sequenced and the genomic sequences          compared with the cDNA sequences to identify          transcription start sites and exonintron junctions                          RTPCR          Total RNA was extracted from two juvenile zebrafish          and skeletal muscle of a single adult female

carrying EGFPF pEGFPF from          Clontech Palo Alto CA EGFPF is a derivative of GFP          that exhibits enhanced fluorescence and possesses a          farnesylation signal at the COOHterminal The          farnesylation signal is derived from the           src protein Once farnesylated          EGFPF becomes anchored in the cell membrane Standard          methods of restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of          selected fragments were applied to generate the various          expression constructs Junctions of heterologous          fragments were sequenced to confirm correct
