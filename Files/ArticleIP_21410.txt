after theClintonDAlema talks Eugenio Scalfari the founding editor of LaRepubblica who is now a columnist at the paper was hardly less harsh Anycourt that wasnt a Marine court would either have condemned the pilot of thehomicidal plane or would have shifted the focus of the trial onto theresponsibility of his superiors he wrote The justice solemnly promised bythe United States after the tragedy had been denied he added with thearrogant contempt that the military of the empire shows toward satellitecountries and their citizens Scalfari rejected antiAmerican posturing butsaid that
