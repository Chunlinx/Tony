                okay so   i guess   what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care   i think um i wonder if that worked   does it say something   i think it usually does you might try um i dont know hold it down a little longer   okay         well   okay i   does it usually make a recording or something   well i dont remember it seemed like it did but it might not i guess i guess   okay   we can start um   okay   no i dont i dont have any kids i um my sister has a she just had a baby hes about five months old and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was gonna do with him and   umhum   the different do you have kids   i have three   oh really   uhhuh       yeah i do yes um i dont work though but i used to work and when i had two children   umhum   i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but i dont envy anybody whos in that situation to find day care   yeah   but does your sister live in a big community   um yeah she lives its a its a fairly large community she um got real lucky though she had a boss who um moved into a larger office   umhum   and shes able to take her baby to work with her   oh really   and its a small office that she works in   umhum   and um its a its a legal firm office and its just one lawyer and so shes the only one really that takes care of the office theres no one else that works there   um umhum   and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her   wow       how lucky i i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids and but   yeah   the community im in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their home that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them  to get   yeah so its fairly safe   to yeah to get references and that so but um i i dont dont feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because theres so many kids and so many     worried that theyre not going to get enough attention   yeah and um you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things but and theyre expensive and   yeah   course theres a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things   yes   or they just watch them and let them play and things like that but take a long time to find the right place   yeah and you and you dont always even know if its its gonna be the right place or not   umhum   anything i guess could happen   umhum   because after i guess after he you know gets to a certain age shes going to have to take him to a day care   umhum when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah   yeah when when hes not when she cant keep control of him and he starts crawling thats   umhum it would be hard i think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around   umhum   but um seems like you know golly what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or       you know at the wrong time  but   yeah i think she has problems with that too   umhum well when you have kids will you work do you work now   i dont know thats something ive considered um   umhum   i always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time   umhum   is that what you do   um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home so im here all the time   oh so they dont go to school is it like um oh whats that called its a correspondence school they do it at home   uhhuh yeah yeah   thats interesting do you have to have any special training   so not it depends on the state you live actually some laws absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesnt yet   say that and im not a certified teacher i went to college but i   umhum   you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now and so   so they havent been to public schools at all   one of them was for a couple of years and so you know my oldest he was and then my youngest two have never been   hm   so anyway but we dont   so youve never had
