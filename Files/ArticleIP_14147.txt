                                 Andrew Johnson Saved by a Scoundrel            Every impeachment junkiehas by now heard the tale of the valiant Edmund Ross the Republican senatorwho in  broke party ranks to acquit the impeached President Andrew JohnsonLast Sundays New York Times ran a long paean to Ross and punditsleft and right sing his praises The New York Times  Anthony Lewis anantiimpeachment stalwart endorses the expert judgment of John F Kennedy whowrote in Profiles in Courage  that Ross heroic vote may wellhave preserved  constitutional government in the United States MeanwhileGeorge Washington Universitys Jonathan Turley a devout Clinton foe recalledwistfully in a recent Wall Street Journal column that for his selflessact Ross was shunned physically assaulted and ruined both politically andfinancially Turley proposes erecting a statue in the Capitol of the otherwiseobscure Kansan            Most historians agreethat in voting to acquit Johnson Ross did the right thingbut they wouldadd for the wrong reasons Click for a little more on Johnsons recordThose who have researched the issue conclude that contrary to legend Rossacted for motives anything but highminded That popular wisdom holds otherwisetestifies not to Ross integrity but to his talent for selfpromotion            Edmund Ross was a littleknown newspaperman with nopolitical experience when the governor of Kansas named him to fill a vacantSenate seat in July  The incumbent had committed suicide Six monthslater Ross won reelection with the financial helpsome believe bribesof abusinessman named Perry Fuller Once in Washington the newcomer copied many ofhis peers and took up the cause of controlling his states patronagethen thecoin of politics With a federal government that was tiny compared withtodays a senators power lay largely in deciding who would receive plum jobswith the postal service or in the West the Indian affairs bureau Hungry forpower Ross tangled with Kansas senior senator Samuel Pomeroy and itscongressman Sidney Clarke eschewing the eras weightier battles over rightsfor freed slaves and reconstructing the Union            Meanwhile the RadicalRepublicans were impeaching President Johnson a stubborn Democrat who wasconsistently defying their will on various Reconstructionrelated measuresFor more on the issues surrounding the impeachment see September s  Observers naturally assumed Ross would vote with his party but when it becameclear in February  that the Radicals wanted to replace Johnson withBenjamin Wade of Ohio the president pro tem of the Senate Ross began to thinktwice Wade was likely to grant Pomeroy the control over Kansas appointmentsthat had been Ross Wanting neither to alienate his partymates nor lose hismeal ticket in Johnson Ross tried to avert a vote altogether He pressedJohnson for concessions on certain Reconstruction issues in exchange for hisvote and those of other fence sitters            When judgment day came on May  Johnson survived by avote of  one shy of the twothirds needed to convict Since the other sixproJohnson Republicans had declared their intentions before voting theensuing attention focused on the apostasy of Ross whose vote came as thebiggest surprise But Ross vote wasnt the lone act of bravery it was latermade out to be At least four other senators were prepared to oppose convictionhad their votes been neededa fact that has been forgotten maybe because itdoesnt square with the High Noon portrait of Ross as the man ofprinciple facing down the mob            Ross wasted no timeexploiting Johnsons debt to him On June  he wrote to Johnson to have himinstall one of his cronies as Southern superintendent of Indian affairs andJohnson agreed to oust his own friend in order to comply Sensing opportunityRoss kept upping the ante like a Mafia henchman running a protection racketNice little presidency ya got herehate to see anything happen to it OnJune  he wrote to Johnson to secure a position for Perry Fuller his election sponsor On July  he asked Johnson to make his brother a federalmail agent On July  he pressed the president for jobs for three morefriends invoking his impeachment vote just in case Johnson had forgotten            The legend about Ross is correct in that his stand earnedhim enemies Newspapers compared him to Benedict Arnold Jefferson Davis andJudas And he did lose his reelection bid as did the other proacquittalRepublicans But so did many anti Johnson Republicans from the samestates and theres little evidence to suggest the impeachment votes

plausibly chalked up to theturbulent climate of the s when the makeup of both partiesand of thecountry itselfwas in constant flux            Ross didnt see it thatway Stung by charges that his vote was bought he turned the tables on hisaccusers and charged them with orchestrating the whole impeachmentcampaign so as to get their hands on the controls of patronage He got theHouse to investigate charges of bribery involving his rivals Pomeroy andClarkewhich in fact turned up some damning evidence against them            Till his dying day Ross continued to paint himself as amartyr He wrote numerous articles as well as a book etching his selfservingversion of events into the historical record In a passage later quoted byKennedy Ross wrote in his  memoir I almost literally looked down into myopen grave Friendships position fortune everything that makes lifedesirable to an ambitious man were about to be swept away by the breath of mymouth perhaps forever This grandiose account was adopted almost uncriticallyby his biographer Edward Bumgardner and then by Kennedy whose PulitzerPrizewinning sampler of hagiographies cemented it in the public mind Clickfor more on Kennedys warped
