                                 The MuchPrompted Impromptu Memorial            Exactly how spontaneous was the spontaneous shrine erected last week on JohnF Kennedy Jrs doorstep Last Sunday afternoon Chatterbox was walkingthrough TriBeCa and decided to pass by the impromptu memorial that she had beenhearing so much about on television There wasnt much to see a gaggle ofonlookers milled around the block and a few dozen floral bouquets rested on thestoop Above them four or five handlettered signs had been pasted to the sideof the building What was most unusual about the scene was the phalanx ofreporters aiming microphones and cameras at the onlookers            When Chatterbox arrived home the news shows were still broadcasting fromthe scene Reporters described the outpouring of emotion at the makeshiftshrine mentioning the address over and over again  N Moore St  NMoore St The accompanying videotape used closeup shots and slow pans of thenotentirely cluttered stoop the camera lingered over the flickering flames ofmemorial candles and the droplets of water clinging to the flower petals Whathad appeared in person to be a loose gathering now looked like the altar of aMexican church on All Saints Day It also looked suspiciously like thememorials that had sprung up in Tel Aviv after Yitzhak Rabins death and inLondon after Princess Dianas death            By late last week the scene at  N Moore St matched its televisedaccounts Neighborhood delis ran out of flowers and NYPD officers were tellingonlookers to say a prayer and move it along please The hill of bouquets hadbecome so mountainous that it had to be carted off to a local childrenshospital and the candles so many that they started a small fire
