                    Introduction        MI is an important endpoint in clinical trials The        prevention of MI has in fact been the primary treatment        effect assessed in recent trials of antiplatelet and        antithrombin therapies                    CECs are now commonly used to adjudicate suspected        endpoint events in cardiovascular clinical trials Limited        information has however been published about the        classification of the cause of death              or the adjudication of nonfatal endpoints                 in these trials The rates of endpoint        events can vary considerably depending on whether        committees merely confirm events reported by investigators        or whether they adjudicate all suspected events identified        by data screening        In the PURSUIT trial   a central independent CEC        systematically identified and adjudicated all suspected        nonfatal MIs that occurred after enrolment and through a        day followup The rationale for CEC adjudication was        the need for a systematic unbiased independent and        standard assessment of this endpoint in a large        international trial To understand the role of such a        committee and to provide recommendations for future        efforts we reviewed the results of the CEC process used in        the PURSUIT trial to identify and adjudicate suspected        endpoint MIs                    Methods                  The PURSUIT trial          The PURSUIT trial   enrolled  patients at           hospitals in  countries from North America Latin          America Western Europe and Eastern Europe Patients          with acute coronary syndromes without persistent          STsegment elevation were randomly assigned to placebo or          eptifibatide The inclusion and exclusion criteria as          well as treatment regimens have been published elsewhere            The primary endpoint was a composite of death or          nonfatal MI or reinfarction in patients with MI at          enrolment by day followup as adjudicated by the CEC          The composite endpoint was also calculated using the          site investigator determination of MI from case report          forms We assessed the incidence of endpoint          postenrolment MI among all  patients enrolled in          the PURSUIT trial                          Endpoint definitions          The definition of endpoint MI included a first MI          for patients without MI at enrolment or reinfarction          for patients who had a MI at enrolment according to          clinical electrocardiography ECG and laboratory          criteria see Appendix A MI present at enrolment was          not considered an endpoint MI and was not adjudicated by          the CEC                          Data collection          Data were collected using standard case report forms          Additional information collected from all patients          included cardiac enzymes ECGs performed at the time of          the qualifying episode at enrolment at  hours at          first hospital discharge and at day followup          revascularisation procedure reports details of ischemic          episodes clinical complications medications and          readmission records All enzyme values for each patient          were reported study monitors then verified them against          source documents Site investigators were asked to submit          supporting documents for patients with suspected MI          which included discharge summaries and additional ECGs          during the suspected event Progress notes and procedure          notes were also collected if necessary An independent          blinded core laboratory read the specified ECGs and          identified suspected MIs defined as new Q waves   s          in two contiguous leads Overall data for creatine          kinasemyocardial band CKMB were missing for only           patients  data for baseline ECG were missing for           patients  and data for later ECGs were missing          for  patients                           Process for event adjudication          The CEC was a group dedicated to event adjudication          within the North American Trial Coordinating Centre at          the Duke Clinical Research Institute The group consisted          of a managing supervisor clinical coordinators with a          nursing or clinical research background administrative          assistants cardiology fellows and cardiology faculty          members The CEC helped define clinical endpoint events          helped develop computer algorithms to identify patients          with suspected endpoint events from data from case          report forms worked with monitoring groups to collect          supplemental medical records for event review and          adjudicated suspected clinical endpoint events          A schematic diagram of the clinical event adjudication          process is shown in Figure  Computer algorithms          systematically identified key variables from the database          that could indicate the occurrence of a postenrolment          endpoint MI These variables which were determined          from clinical expertise and trial experience included          elevated cardiac enzymes ECG core laboratory          identification of suspected MI recurrent ischemic          events urgent revascularisations or site investigator          assessment of a postenrolment MI The system was          designed for broad identification of all patients with          possible MI after enrolment A report of all patients          with suspected endpoint MI was generated according to          hits on the variables already listed          Each patient with a suspected MI had a clinical folder          prepared by CEC staff at the Duke Clinical Research          Institute Folders included the case report form and          ancillary data forms discharge summaries cardiac enzyme          results ECGs and a data worksheet that summarised          clinical events procedures and cardiac enzyme          information Medical records were translated into English          if necessary using physicians literate in the other          language when possible          Each case was reviewed independently by two physicians          blinded to treatment in the phase I review The case was          classified as resolved if the physicians agreed that a MI          had or had not occurred Cases in which there was          disagreement between the two CEC physicians were          forwarded to a secondlevel phase II review for          adjudication by consensus of a committee of faculty          cardiologists Fig  The committee members were also          blinded to treatment and to the result of the phase I          review Physicians could request additional medical          records if necessary to adjudicate a suspected event          If additional records were obtained the case was          rereviewed to ensure that decisions were based on          similar documents For quality assurance  of the          cases with agreement by the phase I physicians were          reviewed in a blinded fashion by the phase II committee          to determine whether there were any systematic          inconsistencies with the phase I reviews There were no          inconsistencies found                          Statistical analysis          Variables were summarised as percentages for          dichotomous variables or medians th and th          percentiles for continuous variables The  test was          used to calculate           P values                            Results        Overall  patients with suspected MI after enrolment         were identified and adjudicated by the CEC Table        presents the number of patients enrolled and the number of        patients with an endpoint MI identified by the CEC or the        site both or neither by geographic region The proportion        of patients with MI adjudicated by the CEC was similar in        North America Latin America and Western Europe but tended        to be higher in Eastern Europe        As expected because of the rigorous effort by the CEC        to identify all suspected MIs for adjudication the process        identified more endpoint events than did the site        investigators Table  Eptifibatide reduced the incidence        of death or MI in the PURSUIT trial by   versus                 P   at  days   This        benefit was driven primarily by a reduction in nonfatal MI        We noted smaller absolute and relative treatment effects        when the CECdetermined MI rates were used compared with        the site investigatordetermined rates        The proportion of patients enrolled who had a suspected        endpoint MI ranged from  in North America to  in        Western Europe Table  Disagreements between the site        investigator and CEC assessment of MI occurred in  of all        patients enrolled in the trial or  of the  patients        with suspected MI adjudicated by the CEC  Table  Of        these  patients with disagreements  patients had a        MI assessed by the CEC but not by the site investigator        and  patients had a MI identified by site investigators        but not by the CEC                    Discussion        The review of the clinicalevents classification process        in the current study raises some important issues for        clinical investigators First the rates of endpoint        infarction or reinfarction were higher than those reported        in prior trials of patients with acute coronary syndromes        Second the CEC identified more events than the site        investigators Third the site investigator and the CEC        assessments of MI disagreed for  of the patients        reviewed by the CEC        CECs have become an integral aspect of clinical trials        of new therapies for patients with acute coronary        syndromes The primary function of these committees has        been to systematically adjudicate nonfatal endpoints such        as MI The first large trials in these patients used        mortality as the primary endpoint thus standardised        assessment of patient outcome was not required            More recent trials however have included nonfatal        endpoints such as MI congestive heart failure stroke or        safety measures as part of composite clinical endpoints        Myocardial infarction has been considered a hard        endpoint but its assessment can be as difficult in        clinical trials as it is in clinical practice because        clinical laboratory and ECG data may conflict and        physicians often disagree whether a patient has suffered a        MI An example of this difficulty is the evaluation of        small enzyme elevations in patients undergoing percutaneous        coronary intervention   Although these lowlevel        enzyme elevations are defined as MIs in many trial        protocols physicians do not consistently consider them to        be infarctions in daily clinical practice and therefore may        be reluctant to report them as such        The rates of infarction as adjudicated by the CEC in the        PURSUIT trial were higher than reported in previous trials        of patients with acute coronary syndromes for several        reasons      First the PURSUIT trial CEC effort        was more liberal in its identification of possible events        Committee physicians reviewed events for almost  of the        patients in the trial which is nearly double the        percentage that underwent adjudication by the same CEC        group in two other trials Integrilin to Minimize Platelet        Aggregation and Coronary Thrombosis IMPACTII   and        Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries in Acute        Coronary Syndromes GUSTOIIb   Second the definition        of MI is evolving and has varied among clinical trials in        this patient population For example criteria for MI after        bypass surgery in the GUSTOIIb trial were more stringent        than those in the PURSUIT trial requiring two of three        criteria to be met CK or CKMB fraction   times the        upper limit of normal two new Q waves or new regional        wallmotion abnormalities Finally more cardiac enzyme        samples were collected per patient in the PURSUIT trial        than in GUSTOIIb median  th  th     versus            RAHarrington unpublished data These factors        particularly the systematic collection of cardiac enzymes        missing for only  of the patients contributed to a        higher ascertainment of MI in the PURSUIT trial Trials        that rely on investigatorreported MI probably        underestimate the true event rate        Before implementation of the CEC process the        International Steering Committee agreed on the definitions        for MI which were based on experience and clinical        expertise Because of the global nature of the PURSUIT        investigation attempts were made to model definitions        after everyday clinical practice The study protocol        provided the endpoint definitions so that the CEC and        site investigators had the same set of criteria to classify        MI Nevertheless the site investigators underreported        infarctions Similar findings have been noted in prior        trials               The strategy used to identify suspected infarctions can        affect the proportion of events with disagreements Some        trials have confirmed events reported only by the        investigators        whereas other trials        have adjudicated all suspected events identified by        systematic screening of patient data               In the first strategy the CEC event rates will be the same        as or lower than the site investigatorreported rates In        the second the CEC event rates may be higher lower or        the same as the site investigatorreported rates        The impact of adjudication of cases from other regions        of the world by physicians based in North America is        unknown In the current study however medical records        were translated to English physicians fluent in other        languages were used when needed and the criteria for        reinfarction were based for the most part on objective        data such as enzyme and ECG data        There are several key implications of these findings        The strategy used to identify and adjudicate endpoint        events is one of many factors to be considered when        comparing event rates between clinical studies During        trial planning the events classification strategy being        considered may also have an important impact on estimation        of event rates and the calculations of sample size and        power Education and training of clinical investigators        regarding endpoint definitions and ascertainment may help        in minimising differences between CEC and site investigator        assessments of endpoints Finally the strategy and rigor        of the clinical event adjudication process used may        influence the interpretation of trial results by the        clinical and regulatory communities We believe that CEC        adjudication of suspected nonfatal MI endpoint events is        important to provide independent unbiased standard        systematic assessments particularly in trials that include        broad geographic regions and different clinical practice        settings                    Conclusion        Nonfatal MI inherently undesirable is an important        clinical event and an important component of clinical trial        endpoints CEC adjudication of infarction is necessary to        provide standardised systematic independent and unbiased        assessments of endpoints in clinical investigation In the        PURSUIT trial the assessment of infarction by site        investigators versus that of a central CEC disagreed more        infarctions were identified by the CEC than by the site        investigators The impact of these findings affects the        comparison of event rates between trials as well as the        design of future trials                    Competing
