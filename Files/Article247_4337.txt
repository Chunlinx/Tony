                                 If a Bohemian Falls in the Forest             Is there currently an American bohemia Last week the official organ ofAmerican cultural bohemianism the Village Voice  was sold tospeculators without a complaint from its once fiercely anticapitalist readersand staff Also last week the Chronicle of Higher Education proclaimedthe death of American intellectual bohemianism A junior professor of Englishat Princeton bemoaned the fact that his most brilliant students are being luredinto highpaid consulting jobs higherpaid than his rather than pursuingthe life of genteel poverty demanded by academic or artistic careers Oh surehe says he knows the occasional Ivy Leaguer who works ninetofive so that shecan rush off at night to read Gilles Deleuze or play rock n roll But shesan anachronism New York at least is postbohemian            Now people have been proclaiming the death of bohemia ever since a th century Parisian Henri Murger wrote a book that would becomean opera that would become synonymous with the artistic life right up to themoment when the whole concoction was boiled down to corn syrup in the Broadwaymusical Rent  Jerrold Seigel the author of an excellent history ofbohemianism Bohemian Paris Culture Politics and the Boundaries ofBourgeois Life   says that when people go around sayingbohemia is dead what they usually mean is that they cant see how to wigglefree of commercialism and convention People experience bohemia as a form ofauthentic existence Bohemia is a state of mind says Seigel Its not justthe collective experience of radicals and artistes in the cafes of Paris or thelofts of Williamsburg Brooklyn Bohemianism is a life selfconsciouslypositioned on the margins in order to express ambivalence about themainstream            But does the aggregate of people who happen to be living the bohemianlifestyle right now add up to an actual bohemia Thats a tougher questionSeigel also says that bohemians have a role to play in society Theirs is toact out the bourgeoisies quashed longings and confusions Bohemians should bemirrors in which we see what we might have been had we dared            So whos doing that today Obviously we can rule out the hipsters payingexorbitant sums to inhabit gentrified downtowns and sport the latest iterationof poverty chic But there are people all over America living lives quietly onthe fringe We get a glimpse of them in a forthcoming book by New YorkTimes rock critic Ann Powers Weird Like Us My Bohemian AmericaSimon  Schuster  is a charming rambling account of her coming ofage as a musicstore clerkriotgrrrl punksteraspiring writer in Seattle andSan Francisco interspersed with interviews of her old friends Bohemia Powersadmits is geographically dispersed It looks moribund But she says itthrives sight unseen It is everywhere somebody opens a usedrecord shop alaundromatcaf and a punk rock bar Its a floating underground which isreally more a life path than a place  It is a challenge undertaken inprivacy  to confront and reinvigorate the premises of society thedefinitions of kinship labor love leisure consumerism and identityitself            Heres the problem with this definition Can bohemia exist in privacyWhat if society isnt aware that its premises are being reinvigorated itscontradictions being dramatized What if the bourgeoisie whom the bohemiansare supposed to pater  seems un pater able What if it justdoesnt give a damn If there is a bohemia today it seems to be neither hatednor celebrated This strikes Culturebox as a mortal condition The greatbohemias of historyMurgers and Charles Baudelaires  th centuryParis Bloomsbury the French and German Dadaists the Surrealists the Beatsthe indie rock scenewere flamboyant and selfenthralled They hogged thelimelight They made themselves seem the center of the artistic universe In sodoing they really did change the world            There was a moment about a decade ago when the grouphouse dwellers andmusicstore clerks whose lives Powers details so minutely rose to the level ofa bohemia The streets of Seattle opened up and gave us Kurt Cobain New YorksStrand bookstore yielded Mary Gaitskill videostore culture belched forthQuentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith Now however when Powers returns to her oldmusic store she is bewildered by how little she finds I could see no sign ofthe Planet attitude no surly looks in the eyes of the kids behind the cashregister she writes Then she thinks she understands I realized that I wason the other side of it now To the sly members of the cultured proletariat Ilooked like an average customer not a fellow traveler who knew and approved oftheir tricks            Perhaps What Powers describes sounds frankly too subterranean to amount toa bohemia anymore At best the stonefaced attitudes of retailoutlet clerkshave become the manifestation of a subculture that is soon to disappear likeall the other subcultures that have faded into history One of the mostremarkable facts about this turn of the century so far is that if you want tobe on the cutting edge you have to leave the margins for the center That thedomain of American industry and entrepreneurship is where the interestingideasthe innovation the subversion the reimagining of the boundaries ofsocietyare coming from Thats the bohemia of the moment Great Americanbohemias have bubbled up from the depths in the past and more surely will inthe future But theres nothing going on down there right now
