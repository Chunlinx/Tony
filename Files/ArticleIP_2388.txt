                                 Asian or American            AsianAmericans who sorarely appear in print or on television can tell you that the media are nomirror of the nations complexion But they understand that the media doreflect the nations psycheand that is why the events of recent weeks havebeen so distressing First US intelligence analyst Robert Kim was accused ofspying for South Korea Then the John HuangLippo scandal broke raisingsuspicions about Asian money in American politics Suddenly there was noshortage of Asian names in the news Just as suddenly a question was in theair Do AsianAmericans have dual loyalties            No oneto my knowledge has framed the issue quite so explicitly William Safire forinstance has hyped the socalled Asian connection with dark mutterings aboutfavorhungry foreigners insidious networking and penetration by Asianinterests The pull quote in his Oct  columnSelling influence to richaliensveers into The Protocols of the Elders of Zion territory Buteven Safire felt compelled recently to throw in a someofmybestfriendsparagraph of praise for hardworking AsianAmericans The old Nixon hand knowswell that innuendo is effective only if well calibrated            Still the unmistakable subtext of Safires columns and thepress coverage of the Lippo affair is that Asians in America are justthatAsians in America sojourners and foreigners Thus when we learned thatHuang had raised over  million for the Democrats little distinction wasmadereportorially or morallybetween contributions from abroad andcontributions from Americans of Asian descent Moreover Huangs activitieshowever unlawful have now given rise to a presumption that AsianAmericanpolitical participation is merely a cover for some sinister foreignagenda            Of coursethe notion that AsianAmericans are torn between an outward allegiance to thiscountry and a hardwired fealty to some Oriental motherland has a long andundistinguished pedigree The indelible Chineseness of Chinese immigrants wasthe rationale for the Chinese Exclusion Act of  The indelible Japanesenessof JapaneseAmerican citizens justified their internment after Pearl HarborSmall wonder that AsianAmericans have protested the tenor of the Lipporeportage and the portrayal of AsianAmericans as people with dividedloyalties            But the source of these stereotypes is notsolely white racism or even the more subtle prejudices of Safire and his ilkIt is also to a lesser but still substantial degree the racialist language ofmodernday identity politics            One ever feels thistwonessan American a Negro two souls two thoughts two unreconciledstrivings two warring ideas in one dark body whose dogged strength alonekeeps it from being torn asunder So wrote WEB Du Bois in  describingin The Souls of Black Folk  a double consciousness that afflicted yetgraced the coloreds of his day            Nearly acentury later the metaphor of dual identity endures in our racial narrativesThe notion that minorities are instrinsically alienated from themselvesandthat the struggle is somehow ennoblingis a central tenet of multiculturalistideology We see it in ethnicstudies courses and academic talk of racialdestiny We see it in the deconstructions of OJ Simpsons blackness We seeit in the ghosts and doppelgngers who populate the melodramas of Amy Tan andher imitators            This bifurcation is intuitively appealing because it makesconcrete the ambivalence of assimilation the gnawing sense among many peopleof color that membership in the mainstream comes at a high personal cost Thesymbolism of split personalities and divided souls also has visceral power Andthere is a certain romance to the imagery adorning the ordinary lives ofnonwhite folk with the dignity of redemptive suffering            But thereis too much that is flawed about this pose For what do we presume when wespeak of the minority persons dual identity We presume that racialidentity is foreordained and monolithic and ever at odds with nationalidentity We presume also as Stanley Crouch has dryly observed that identityis never more complex than double            Black nationalists like their counterparts inAsian America or Latino Nation believe that race is primordial as organicas gender But consider the AsianAmerican Thirty years ago there was no suchcreature There were only Americans of Chinese descent or Japanese or IndianBut over the course of a generation activists and bureaucrats havemanufactured a single race out of a diverse mass of several million peoplewhose origins can be traced to dozens of countries            What hasbound this AsianAmerican race together is not its biological badgeeyelidfolds hair color pigmentationbut its cultural content Through magazinesand campus clubs and advocacy organizations selfappointed race leaders havesought to create an authentic AsianAmerican consciousness by inventingsomething called AsianAmerican culture The fact that they are succeedingtells us something about the magnetic appeal of racial fundamentalism Moreimportantly it reminds us that racial identity is utterly malleableandthat racial essence is utterly artificial            Yet even if we did believe in the fixity of races doubleidentity is meaningless unless we also presume that American identity isimmutably white As the critic Albert Murray has long argued that wasnt eventrue in Du Bois time It is even less true nowand not because America inthe classic pluralist formulation is a nation of nations a neutral holdingpen for various diasporas nor because America is some dehumanizingsinglemold melting pot            What giveslie to anyones whitewashed vision of national identityand what makes Americaexceptionalis the fact that American culture is more hybridized andmongrelized than anything humanity has ever before seen When CaliforniaCaucasians are practicing Feng Shui and Zen meditation when suburban Asianteens are reciting gangsta rap lyrics when salsa sales are surging pastketchup sales how can we speak with a straight face about the ineffaceablewhiteness of American life And how then can we sustain the racenationopposition central to double consciousness            Ultimately the weakness of the dualidentitymyth is that it reduces humans into bits of binary code It treats the Americanexperience as a simple equation plotted along two axes as if class or genderor birthplace or birth order or family structure mattered notas ifcontingency never sculpted ones sense of self And in the name ofantiracialism it recommits the worst errors of racialism Denying theminority individual his full complex humanity interpreting his voice as themere expression of a greater Volksgeist             In the milieu ofcontemporary multiculturalism that sort of illogic can be affirming So longas color is a proxy for entitlement there will be many who find it useful toostentatiously posit a conflict between their racial core and their assimilatedshell But the fallout from the John Huang debacle should remindAsianAmericans that claims of racial loyalty can cut both ways And it shouldremind us all that flimsy notions of the minoritys eternally dual identitywhether tinged with xenophobia or candied with race pride in the end amount tojust so much double talk
