        um what       things are you looking for in a car what kind of car would you buy   well right now i have a uh small Toyota Tercel   for your next purchase uhhuh   and i think next time i want something just a little bit bigger uh perhaps mid size i really dont dont like the the real big cars im thinking about maybe a Volvo   uhhuh well its funny because i currently also have a Toyota Tercel   you do   um when i first got married my my father gave me and my wife a a a used Toyota um Corolla   uhhuh   and we used that until we  until its about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so   umhum   um you bought what we could afford   right   and i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car   umhum how did your uh Corolla hold up   oh very well um   for real   it um did very well i mean   umhum do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end   uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um it was very reliable though for us though   umhum my my Tercel now has a hundred and forty six thousand miles on it   um uhhuh   and i really havent had any trouble out of it except the alternator went out at about a hundred and twenty six thousand miles i think   oh thats to be expected i would think   right right   hopefully hopefully it just doesnt  happen at a a bad time  i mean when youre far away from anything or something   right and um its really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know   uhhuh did you buy it new   actually i didnt i bought it from um Hertz Rent A Car and it had like twenty six thousand miles on it  when i bought it   uhhuh i see but well sounds like its been a good deal for you   umhum   um another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability   right   and um i just go by what my dad says hes a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but hes always never wanted to spend a lot on a car because i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didnt have a lot of money to spend on cars   umhum yeah   so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think theyre the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was  mechanic and he could fix them but i remember he said he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla   uhhuh   and i mean didnt even spend very much money for it i dont think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased   wow right   and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time   uh wow   and so um but i dont know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car   yeah im trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that   my next my next purchase   im really trying trying to consider but i dont know i i i dont want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs   thats true i have a cousin yeah one of my cousins is trying to tell convince me that um the American made cars are becoming reliable reliable but uh im not im not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good um and reliable that that ive ive used   have you heard that uh or do you know anything about the foreign cars being easier to steal than the uh the American cars   oh   because theres a lot of of um car theft going going on in Dallas right now i dont know about in your area     im in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i dont i dont know if theres even uh more than a one or two a month i mean um thats that thats not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i thats where i was going to school before and um   umhum yeah   also there um theres ive never had that concern um so im not really im not really sure
