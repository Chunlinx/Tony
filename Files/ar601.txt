                    Introduction        IL is a potent monocytemacrophage regulatory        cytokine that inhibits expression of proinflammatory        mediators      Monocytesmacrophages B cells murine        Th cells and some CD cells produce IL             Macrophages rapidly produce proinflammatory cytokines such        as tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF IL and IL        after activation with lipopolysaccharide or IFN while        production of IL is delayed Once IL is produced it        functions in an autoregulatory fashion to suppress        proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression and protein        production       In addition IL suppresses the        expression of MHC class II molecules and costimulatory        molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule  and B        leading to reduction in Tcell macrophage interactions                     The selective suppression of Th cell activity is        believed to be due to IL inhibition of IL a        differentiation factor for Th cells      The        release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates by        macrophages is also suppressed by IL      In        addition IL stimulates the production of cytokine        inhibitors such as IL receptor antagonist     In        patients with rheumatoid arthritis IL is produced by        synovial membrane cells and is found at high levels in the        synovial fluid      It has been shown that        suppression of IL production by synovial cells is        associated with increased levels of IL and TNF        suggesting that IL plays a suppressive role in        rheumatoid arthritis joints     It was also observed        that IL directly stimulated proteoglycan synthesis and        reversed the cartilage degradation induced by activated        mononuclear cells     These immunosuppressive        activities indicate that IL is a potential therapeutic        approach for autoimmune diseases        In animal models of arthritis systemic treatment with        IL and adenovirusmediated transfer of viral IL        moderately suppresses the development of arthritis but is        significantly more effective when combined with IL                 The evidence for the importance of IL        is further supported by the fact that         in vivo antiIL treatment        accelerates disease in collageninduced arthritis CIA                   Most studies focused on investigating the role of IL        in models of arthritis have involved administration of        neutralizing antibodies large amounts of IL or gene        therapy in experimental animals While these studies are        helpful in broadly defining the function of IL it is        difficult to determine the cytokine dose and timing by        these means To address the effects of complete elimination        of IL         in vivo on the development of CIA and        to understand the mechanism responsible for IL        regulation we examined the development of arthritis in        homozygous IL ILdeficient mice                    Materials and methods                  Animals antigens and immunization          procedure          The IL mice were generated as previously          described     The original genetic background of          these animals was a mixture of the strains Ola and          CBL These IL mice were backcrossed to DBA          for six generations and further backcrossed for an          additional two generations to DBA Jackson          Laboratories Bar Harbor MA USA in our laboratory          All mice were typed for the IL mutation by PCR          using primer sets that detect either the DBA wildtype          WT or the mutated IL gene In addition splenocytes          from IL mice activated           in vitro did not produce IL          The IL mice were maintained in sterilized          bedding and food with acidified water Chicken type II          collagen was used for generation of arthritis as          described elsewhere     Male and female WT          heterozygous IL and IL mice were immunized          once with  g chicken type II collagen emulsified in          complete Freunds adjuvant CFA Difco Detroit MI          USA by intradermal injection at the base of the          tail                          Assessment of arthritis          Animals were examined for the onset of joint swelling          every other day A standard scoring system based upon          redness and swelling of each paw ranging from  to  for          each paw thus resulting in a possible maximum severity          score of  was used for the assessment of disease          severity Histologic studies were performed to determine          the extent of joint damage At the end of the experiment          hind paws were dissected fixed and decalcified before          being embedded in paraffin and were sectioned at  m as          previously described     Sagittal sections were          stained with H  E

software          Becton Dickinson San Jose CA USA                          Statistical analysis          Analysis of the arthritis score and disease incidence          at different time points were carried out using the          nonparametric MannWhitney U test Students           t test was used for statistical          analysis of all other data Analyses were performed using          SPSS

inflammatory arthritis we examined the          development of disease using the CIA model Male and          female WT IL  and IL littermates were          immunized with collagen in CFA intradermally Data from          the male and female mice were pooled because there was no          significant difference between the two groups          All mice succumb to arthritis but the time of onset          was somewhat delayed in the WT and IL mice compared          with that in the IL mice Fig a Interestingly          the number of arthritic WT and IL animals began to          recede after day  whereas all IL mice were still          arthritic at the time of termination of the experiments          although with reduced severity Arthritis severity in          IL mice was significantly exacerbated in comparison          with that of WT or IL mice Fig b          Inflamed joints showed typical histopathological          abnormalities described previously synovial          proliferation leukocyte infiltration cartilage and bone          erosions      which correlated well with the          severity of the clinical symptoms          Taken together the results described demonstrate that          IL is important for controlling disease severity                          Anticollagen antibody is reduced in ILdeficient          mice          Induction of CIA is dependent on B cells and high          doses of antibodies are pathogenic when transferred to          nave recipients     IL can affect both the          viability and the production of immunoglobulin by B cells               To determine whether the augmentation in CIA          correlated with an alteration in anticollagen antibodies          we collected sera from animals at the time of sacrifice          Interestingly IL mice produced significantly less          anticollagen antibody than either WT or IL mice          Fig  Both the IgG            and the IgG           a isotypes of anticollagen antibodies          were substantially reduced          These results suggest that a decrease in anticollagen          antibody may be the result of a requirement for IL in          Bcell antibody production                          IFN levels are reduced in ILdeficient          mice          IFN production is observed early in          collagenimmunized mice and progressively increases with          the time of clinical manifestation of arthritis Although          the level of IFN correlates with disease IFN appears          to play a dual role in disease activity AntiIFN          treatment early in the course of disease suppresses          arthritis whereas neutralization of IFN late in          disease exacerbates arthritis In addition IFN          receptordeficient mice exhibit exacerbated disease                        We were therefore interested in determining whether          the levels of IFN correlated with arthritis in          collagenimmunized WT IL  and IL mice          Splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice and          cultured in the presence and absence of collagen Fig           IFN levels were significantly suppressed in the          IL mice in comparison with either WT or IL          animals          These results confirm that reduced levels of IFN          were associated with exacerbated arthritis in          collagenimmunized animals These data also suggest that          IL positively regulates IFN either directly or          indirectly                          CDb expansion correlates with reduced          IL          Matthys           et al  recently showed that the          enhanced severity of CIA in IFN receptordeficient mice          immunized with type II collagen in CFA is due to an          expansion of the CDb cells     Since IL          mice produce reduced levels of IFN we were          interested in determining whether there was a specific          expansion of CDb cells          Although the spleen cell number increased in IL          mice      in comparison with WT mice               there was a specific expansion of          the CDb cell population The spleen from WT mice          contained  CDb cells whereas the spleen of IL          mice contained  CDb cells Table  When the          percentage of cells was corrected for cell number there          was a fold increase in CDb cells in the spleen of          IL mice The net number of T cells B cells and          dendritic cells was not significantly different          These data are consistent with the inhibitory effects          of IFN on expansion of CDb cells The data suggest          that IL is important for controlling IFN andor          other cytokines involved in the process of CDb cell          expansion          In an attempt to understand the mechanism responsible          for the expansion of CDb macrophages in IL mice          we examined cytokines associated with inflammation and          Th cell phenotype We were unable to detect any          difference in the IL or TNF levels in IL mice          in comparison with WT mice However IL was          significantly increased in IL animals Fig           These results suggest the possibility that IL may          play a role in CDb cell expansion                            Discussion        IL appears to play an important role in the        regulation of several autoimmune disease models Treatment        with recombinant IL in CIA in proteoglycaninduced        arthritis and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis        reduced disease severity and neutralizing IL with        antibodies exacerbated disease        The        present data are consistent with previous results and show        that a complete absence of IL exacerbates inflammation        in CIA       The antiinflammatory properties of        IL suggest that endogenous IL may function as a        regulator of proinflammatory mediators         in vivo     It is interesting        however that disease severity inversely correlates with        the levels of IFN in IL mice suggesting that IL        may control disease activity via regulating IFN        responses        Although CIA is considered a Thtype disease mediated        by IFN the role of IFN in the pathogenesis of CIA is        not clearly understood IFN appears to have two separate        functions disease promoting as well as disease limiting            Neutralization of IFN with antibodies early in the        course of disease exerts a suppressive effect whereas        antiIFN treatment late in disease enhances arthritis            Also disease severity in CIA is enhanced in IFN        receptordeficient mice and loss of the IFN receptor        turns mice normally resistant to CIA into an        arthritissusceptible strain      IFN thus        provides a dominant protective effect in CIA The reduction        in IFN in ILdeficient mice is consistent with the        diseaselimiting properties of IFN These results suggest        that IL plays an unexpected role in regulating IFN        production in CIA        Recent work by Matthys         et al  demonstrates that the        protective effect of IFN is dependent on the presence of        the mycobacterial component of the adjuvant     Only        when mice are immunized with collagen in CFA is there an        increase in disease severity in IFN receptordeficient        mice Ablation of IFN in these mice is associated with        extramedullary hemopoiesis and expansion of CDb cells        Consistent with this observation a similar increase in        CDb cells was observed in the IL mice These data        suggest that IL controls the IFN concentration         in vivo and that the reduced level of        IFN in IL mice contributes to expansion of CDb        cells and increase in disease severity The increase in        IL we observed in IL mice may account for the        increase in CDb cells as IL is known for its        hematopoietic properties            In addition to the cellular immune response        anticollagen antibodies are required for the development of        arthritis In the studies presented despite the increase        in disease severity in the IL mice anticollagen        antibodies are reduced This reduction in antibody levels        may be a direct effect on B cells due to a loss of IL or        may be an indirect effect due to downregulation by IFN        The Th cytokine IFN is important         in vitro and         in vivo for enhancement of IgG         a secretion     It is expected        that loss of IFN should result in a reduced        collagenspecific IgG         a response but it is unexpected that        the IgG          response would also be reduced These        results indicate that IL has a direct effect on        maintaining antibody production in CIA In addition loss        of the antiinflammatory effect of IL appears to        overdrive the requirements for high levels of anticollagen        antibodies in CIA                    Conclusion        In summary these results suggest that IL is an        important regulator of inflammation         in vivo  In CIA a deficiency in        IL leads to an increase in disease severity The        corresponding reduction in IFN levels and the expansion        of CDb cells suggests a potential mechanism for IL        regulation of CIA                    Abbreviations        CFA  complete Freunds adjuvant CIA  collageninduced        arthritis ELISA  enzymelinked immunosorbent
