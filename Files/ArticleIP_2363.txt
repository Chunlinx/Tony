                                 The Virtue of Inefficient Government            Thomas Jefferson said Thegovernment which governs best governs least But Jeffersons wisdom needsupdating The lesson of the  th century is clear The governmentwhich governs best governs least efficiently            Efficiency in government is a more elusive concept than efficiency in theprivate economy which may be measured relatively easily as output per units ofinput What is the governments output But let us measure the efficiency ofa government by how well it is able to implement its own goals whatever theymay be This could be quantified in terms of money people or the totalelapsed time between the adoption of a policy and its complete implementationA perfectly efficient government would find its platforms instantlyimplemented a completely inefficient one would expend all its resourceswithout accomplishing any of its goals            By this reasonable standard the first place in efficiencymust go to dictatorshipsthe more vile the more efficient The more absolutethe power of the local tyrant the more rapidly and completely his policydesires are implemented Cruelty and unpredictability are the techniques of thereal efficiency experts Dissidents complaining Just shoot them Minor minionsacting up Torture themmaking sure to include some of your previousfavoritesand the rest will snap into line It does cost a few bullets butbullets are cheap And there is always a friendly arms merchant usually from acountry with an inefficient government ready to sell you some even to arrangeforeign aid to help with the financing            Despotic governments are soefficient that they are easy to administer Even the least capable or sanehumans can run them Look at Caligula Idi Amin and the current btenoire of the tinhat set Saddam Hussein Once the opposition is dead andall but the most compliant are purged from the dictators forces whats thereto worry about Foreign invaders or liberators They usually serve to merelyentrench a tyrant            That these leaders pillagetheir people destroy their economies and leave no legacy apart from largeSwiss bank accounts tends to obscure their achievements as models ofefficiency This efficiency hurts the citizenry because by and large the sortof person who wants to be a dictator is rather nasty and selfserving Anefficient government is dangerous in the hands of the wrong man Sadly theright sort of man never seems interested in the job            Hereditarymonarchies once provided a few wellmeaning rulers A despotic king might passpower on to more enlightened progeny The first Medici wasnt all that nice aguy but by Lorenzos time the Medici stock had mellowed a bit Such briefwindows of rationality did not last long but they gave mankind a muchneededbreak The Italian Renaissance flourished in small islands of such toleranceamid a patchwork quilt of fiefdoms run by local strongmen            There are no examples in the modern world ofabsolute power being wielded for anything like the greater goodand it is hardto imagine the situation arising How would Mother Teresa ever come topower Absolute power may corrupt absolutely but the applicant pool for thissort of job isnt pristine to begin with            The record of holy rulers isnone too good anywayreligious regimes tend to rank right after outright thugswhen it comes to efficiency The mandate of God might seem like the ultimatetool of power but in practice a theocracy is less efficient than thewhimsical brutality of a lone unfettered ruler This is not to say thatreligious governments cant be brutalthey are as a rulebut rather thatthey are bound by more constraints The word of God generally is written insome ambiguous form that is open to interpretation and there is never ashortage of interpreters The leaders of a religious dictatorship must alwaysbe on guard against some holierthanthou revisionist bearing a new andimproved Truth In addition the deity has a funny habit of prescribing morerules and regulations than even liberal Democrats do thus distractingreligious regimes with random rituals and requirements Religious movements areat their most efficient when they seek very basic goalslike subjugating womenor stifling free thought Complex agendas are much more difficult for them toaccomplish            Military dictatorshipsgenerally are less efficient than those run by lone despots or the clergyEvery selfrespecting dictator will decorate himself with grand militarytitlesbut let us set these baubles aside and concentrate on dictatorships runby genuine career military officers Perhaps it is the military respect forrank discipline and the maintenance of a chain of command ormorelikelythe military love of acronyms and paperwork in triplicate For whateverreason true military leaders are generally less effectual than plain old thugsand zealots although their political opponents get just as dead As furtherproof of my thesis rank seems to correlate well with inefficiency Few of thegenerals who have served their country as despots can hold a candleefficiencywise to Col Qaddafi And it was a sad day indeed for haplessLiberia when it suffered the ignominy of a coup led by a master sergeant            TheCommunists briefly occupied an intermediate stage in the hierarchy ofinefficiency Condemned in their heyday as having total or totalitarianpower their regimes were later revealed as corrupt bureaucracies moreinefficient and thus better than we believed Dismal images of Russiaunraveling after communism collapsed make an unintended point At least therewas something to unravel unlike in so much of the rest of the world Poorcommunism was inefficient enough that its people were able to accomplish somethings despite it but efficient enough that they couldnt have cable TV Itsat like a ball on a hill Ultimately it had to roll down one side of the hilland collapse into democracy or roll the other way and devolve into thepersonalitycult despotism of a local tyrant Tito and Castro are examples ofthe latter and they may soon have imitators for it remains to be seen howmany postSoviet democracies will last            It is popularly supposed particularly by people who livein them that democracies are good while various forms of despotism arebad The evidence favors a far simpler proposition Simply put governmentsare bad The fundamental prerogative of governing is to control the actions ofindividuals and this power is remarkably prone to misuse Quibbling that evilleaders are to blame not the institution of government itself is a patheticevasion reminiscent of an NRA bumper sticker that reads Governments dontkill people only criminal leaders kill people Sorry but with a correspondence why exempt the mechanism Without the force of governmentbehind them Pol Pot would have been fairly harmless and Hitler a thirdrateartist With it each killed millions Ted Bundy with the government behind himwould have been a lot worse than Ted Bundy operating solo            The examples of great evildone by governments are easy enough to rattle off But what about the examplesof great good to balance them There arent any Politicians and otherapologists for the institution gamely assert the supposed benefits ofgovernment but it is a short and shallow list Good is done to be sure butin little dribs and drabs that arent enough to cover the cost How manycenturies of good government would it take to balance the score for theCambodians            The reasonsocieties with democratic governments are better places to live in than theiralternatives isnt because of some goodness intrinsic to democracy but becauseits hopeless inefficiency helps blunt the basic potential for evil Theconstraint of maintaining constant popularity is simply too large a burden tobear So happily very little gets done that is extremely bador extremelygood            Democracy could always make itself efficient byvoting to anoint an absolute ruler Democratic procedures brought Adolf Hitlerto power for example But this rarely happens Instead democracies evolvedever more elaborate ways of tying the hands of their chosen leaders            The prize for ultimateinefficiency goes to America We have built in so many checks and balances thatour leaders are the most thoroughly hogtied of any on earth In a few weeksthose of us who overcome inertia and apathy will enter polling places to chooseour president with less real choice than ever Each candidate has tried tooutdo the other in adopting popular centrist stances and avoiding anythingdifficult We can rest assured that neither man will challenge the fundamentalstructure that will render winner and loser ineffectual come Inauguration DayPerhaps it would be better to have a restrained and less intrusive governmentas Jefferson envisioned A pleasant thought but one that relies on politiciansto restrain themselves Better to let them restrain each other throughinefficiency caught in a morass of checks and balances our freedom guardednot by fierce virtue but rather by simple unfeasibility Not an elegantresult but a practical one I think in this sense Jefferson would bepleased
