        uh lets see personal computers   yes   so do you use them   uh yes um we own one   terrific what kind   uh its an Emerson eighty eighty six um two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet but uh you know its it comes in mighty handy   mostly for word processing type things   uh yeah a big chunk of its word processing were also taking programming classes and uh so theres a fair amount of programming getting done on it but uh the uh right now we got a project going were trying to put um all my wifes stray recipes on the disk   nice did you buy a program to handle menus   uh it came with a menus program but uh that doesnt it is maceboast excuse me mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive   oh yes   and hopefully sometime this spring well be able to get one and get it configured   theres eighty eighty eight is what you said   eighty eighty six   eighty oh gosh its worth your time to just upgrade theyre so darned cheap now   which   computers   ah impoverished college student   oh no   this one went on a credit card and we got a way out while to pay it off yet so its     ah ive ive got one at home too its a three eighty six thirty three megahertz forty four meg RAM RAM and hundred and thirty meg drive and   uh oh that sounds nice   super VGA and yeah its fun i do programming too my job is uh EDP auditor and so im into computers all the time   EDP   electronic data processing   okay that sounds like a fine job   yeah i really enjoy it and it treats me well   yes   uh what are you studying in college computers   ah computer engineering   how nice   well its computer engineering technology uh which uh its all i can understand is just this slightly more hands on version of computer engineering but ive got a ways to go yet so far most of what ive done is getting gotten core classes out of the way taken some electronics classes and one class in um with computer logic   how they work is fascinating to me   oh yes yeah i rather enjoy it myself  the uh lab for that uh um computer logic class was a lot of fun   was it did you   yeah we got to hook up a few uh counters and and uh decoders encoders   hardware stuff huh   yeah   what do you think of that fuzzy logic   ive not gotten a chance to work with it although um my uh my data structures teacher was telling us something about why how fudgy fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it   uhhuh   now how youd implement that uh software wise or mechanically i dont know but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work   yeah theyre pretty amazing uh ive written a couple of programs for commercially uh   yes   and its a fun field   in the fuzzy logic direction   what no in uh no just regular uh but you have to take into account you know with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you uh to make your program crash or things you normally dont consider   yeah entering bad information of one sort or another and   yeah pushing certain keys certain times and   yeah   messing up your files and things like that   uhhuh   and your gonna be an engineer a computer engineer type   uh yeah well the what the computer well the CET program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from       you get programming a fair fair amount of programming you get uh hardware you get uh more or less uh you get basic electronics courses that uh deal with you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and and uh just the whole gamut but mostly towards uh computer electronics       so the idea is that um you can go in a variety of directions from CET major but i say i have more fun with the hardware than i do with the software so you know i pretty much plan on i mean so far im planning to go in the engineering direction   i dont thats good uh
