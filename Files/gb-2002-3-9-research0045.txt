                    Background        Flowering plants are composed of diverse cell types        organized into tissues and organs To achieve the        morphological and functional specialization of cells and        tissues suites of genes are expressed in spatial and        temporal patterns determined by regulatory hierarchies        responding to environmental cues Plants reiteratively        produce photosynthetic organs such as individual leaves        that often differ in morphology and physiology depending on        environmental cues and their positions on the plant The        finetuning of gene expression to permit such diversity        remains largely uncharacterized Flower development        provides one example where organs of distinctive        morphologies sepals petals stamens carpels are        produced in rapid succession specification of each floral        organ requires temporally and spatially refined expression        of specific genes          Although the functions and expression patterns for        dozens of genes have been characterized in particular plant        tissues and organs the number of well studied examples is        meager compared to the total number of genes          Using information and material from genomic and        highthroughput expressed sequence tag EST sequencing        projects several approaches have been devised to        investigate global geneexpression profiles In particular        spotted microarrays of ESTs have been used to initiate        functional analyses of thousands of genes simultaneously        The first microarray contained only          Arabidopsis thaliana genes   but        the demonstrated success of the method was quickly followed        by studies of human   and yeast   gene expression        Microarray analysis has been used in plants for such        diverse purposes as discovering genes responsible for        strawberry flavor   comparing mutant to wildtype        plants   and monitoring organismlevel responses to        environmental stimuli     In most studies treated        and untreated tissues of the same age were compared To        date there are just a few studies comparing distinct        developmental stages For example Ruan         et al   surveyed expression in        the three fundamental organ types  leaves roots and        flowers  of         Arabidopsis  using microarrays        containing  EST cDNA clones Fernandes         et al   compared the        hybridization of maize day endosperm and immature ear         cm RNA populations on separate endosperm and ear        microarrays containing approximately  and         distinct genes respectively They found that nearly all        probes on the ear array hybridized to cDNA prepared from        endosperm or ear whereas the endosperm array contained        many apparently tissuespecific elements        Using the  maize ESTs available  tentative        unique genes TUGs have been assembled as reported by the         Zea mays database April            Most ESTs are from the Maize Gene Discovery project          and a UniGene set is being developed from this        resource From the UniGene EST assembly  cDNA gene        probes were used to fabricate a spotted cDNA microarray for        a suite of hybridizations In addition  synthetic        oligonucleotides   or  nucleotides in length were        printed to explore whether hybridization and washing        conditions compatible with signal retention for both oligos        and cDNA clones could be devised Thirteen RNA samples from         distinct organs were hybridized on this array to ask how        many genes were expressed in all or most organs which        genes had discrete patterns of expression and whether        geneexpression profiles could be used to understand the        relationships among organs Among   genes selected        for analysis  showed less than a twofold difference and         showed a two to fourfold difference in mRNA amounts        compared to the reference sample  maize seedling RNA        These results imply that the differentiated state of maize        tissues and organs is characterized by combinations of        small numbers of differentially expressed  fold        tissue or organspecific genes among the  genes in        this study A complication of this interpretation is that        some members of gene families will crosshybridize making        it difficult to resolve whether there are large numbers of        organspecific genes within such families As a first step        in resolving expression patterns among recently duplicated        genes oligo probes for well characterized genes were        printed on the same microarray slides as the cDNAs The        oligo probes generated more accurate information about gene        expression than did cDNA probes for the genes examined in        this study We discuss how rationally designed oligo probes        can distinguish expression patterns of individual genes in        a gene family with similar sequences                    Results                  Internal consistency of hybridization          To examine the consistency of experiments from the          labeling reactions through to the scanning process a          pool of mRNA from dayold roots DR was used to          synthesize two fluorescent cDNA targets using CydUTP or          CydUTP These labeled cDNAs were subsequently combined          in equal proportion to perform control hybridization          experiments Signal intensities of the two          fluorescencemeasurement channels were linearly          correlated for a majority of the  PCR probes          indicating that nearly all targets were labeled with each          dye The mean CyCy ratio of the hybridized group of           genes was  with a standard error of  and          standard deviation of   Nearly all probes           of  or  were within the  to  range           to  on the log            scale and only two probe ratios          were slightly over   on a log            scale Of  EST probes          examined  generated signal intensities exceeding           intensity units in each channel and   in the          summation of the two channels indicating that the ESTs          on the array correspond mainly to moderately expressed          genes The few ESTs with signal intensities below these          values have been omitted from further analysis Another          data set selected with a lower standard   in the          summation of two channels generated very similar results          data not shown          To investigate hybridization consistency further          aliquots of mRNAs from immature ears IME and DR were          each labeled separately with CydUTP or CydUTP A          mixture of Cylabeled DR and Cylabeled IME was          hybridized to one slide and the same samples but          labeled oppositely were hybridized to a second slide          Probes with a red color on one side appeared green on the          other side and vice versa as illustrated in Figure          ab The hybridization consistency was examined by          evaluating signal ratios between the two channels          produced from each dyeswapped hybridization Signal          ratios were calculated by dividing the signal intensity          of DR by that of the IME Out of  probes           hybridized successfully to produce signal intensities          greater than the selection criteria in both          hybridizations One of  subarrays  probes in one          hybridization was excluded in this analysis because          there was a mechanical failure during array printing Of          highquality probes   showed a log            ratio difference between  to           Only six  showed a log            ratio difference of more than  in          the paired hybridizations Figure c These          hybridization results appear to be similar null          hypothesis not rejected           p             t test with an unequal variance           p value  twotail           t distribution  Therefore          hybridizations on two separate slides from the same          printing generate highly reproducible results                          Expressionprofile comparisons between dayold          roots and immature ears          The relative amounts of mRNA for each printed EST were          inferred from hybridization results in the dyeswapping          experiments of DR and IME Figure d The ratios were          averaged from a set of dyeswapped hybridization          experiments and  EST probes were selected for          further analyses In the comparison   of           probes registered within the range  to  log               that is within the          range of signal variations intrinsic to the experimental          procedures Figure d Table  Of the  probes            showed a  to fold difference            log               and   showed a           to fold   log            ratio   difference between          the two organs Only  or  of the EST probes          showed more than a fourfold difference log            ratio   Figure d Among          the  most differentially expressed genes  exhibited          a more than fourfold higher level of expression and  a          more than fourfold lower level in IME compared to DR          Among the  IMEabundant genes there are five MADSbox          gene family members In plants with perfect flowers male          and female sexual organs sepals and petals in the same          flower this gene family regulates inflorescence          development flower organ differentiation flowering time          and specification of floral cell type   In the          imperfect monoecious plant maize some MADSbox genes are          expressed specifically in the male tassel or in the          female ear inflorescences whereas others are expressed in          both    Other earenriched transcripts were for          three different heatshock proteins late elongated          hypocotyl gene and the           mudrA transposase Genes exhibiting          a more than fold ratio difference are listed in the          Additional data files          Hybridization results were further analyzed by          considering the cDNA library of origin There were           probes on the slides from cDNA library  DR           probes from  IME and  probes from  and           two samples of the same mixed adult tissue cDNA          library In the hybridization control experiment Figure           the behavior of DR dyelabeled cDNA sample on the          DR library  section of the slide was examined Some          probes of library  showed strong red on the slide in          Figure aand strong

expressed at lower levels in DR than in          IME Similarly probes originating from the IME  and          mixed adult tissue    libraries showed only a          small fraction of organspecific expression elements          Table  These data in part reflect EST and UniGene          consolidation methods see Methods and materials When          an EST is chosen for a UniGene set this does not mean          that it was found only in one cDNA library source          contigs assembled from maize ESTs typically have          contributions from several cDNA libraries                          Expressionprofile comparisons among thirteen          samples from seven organs          IME and DR are very distinctive in their          developmental origin location and functions in the maize          life cycle Despite this the majority of the microarray          elements appeared to be expressed in both organs          Interesting questions arose from this observation How          many genes are expressed abundantly in specific organs          How many genes are expressed in diverse organs To answer          these questions seven different organ sources were          analyzed The signal ratios were averaged from two          hybridization analyses for each organ in comparison to          the reference organ  dayold shoots with coleoptiles          The clustering by similarity of expression patterns is          shown in Figure for a subset of the data          Analysis was restricted to  probes that generated          intensities   in both channels and            summing both channels in  or all  pairs of          hybridization experiments Among these  genes only            showed more than a fourfold log            ratio   and   had a          fold   log            ratio  signal ratio in at          least one of the  organs compared to the reference          These are candidate tissue or organspecific genes The          majority  of the genes showed signal ratios between           and fold log            ratio   In Figure this          observation is visually apparent from the high proportion          of black elements depicting equal hybridization on the          farleft cladogram composed of  ESTs As shown in          Table  over  of the genes showed a twofold range          log            ratio   in most comparisons          confirming and extending the initial comparisons between          DR and IME This consistency of hybridization results          suggested that only a small number of genes were          expressed differentially in specific organs and that the          majority of printed ESTs had approximately similar          expression levels in many organs Among the  samples          adult leaf blades LL showed the highest number of          genes expressed at a lower level than the reference organ          Table  and see extensive green color within Figure           whereas the husks and silks showed the opposite trend          extensive red color in Figure                           Inferred hierarchy of organ similarity          Plant organs are classified on the basis of their          ontogeny a few key characteristics such as their ability          to photosynthesize and the expression of genes required          for this process and the discrete impact of mutations on          individual organs Using the expressionprofile data          organ relationships were analyzed using a large set of          characters Seven data sets were selected for clustering          as described in Materials and methods either followed by          a median centering and normalization or without this          process As shown in Figure  both analytical treatments          yielded nearly identical organ relationships Overall          branch lengths appeared longer but tree topologies were          more consistent among trees from the normalized method          than from the unnormalized one          Leaf blades at three developmental stages formed a          tight group in all  tree diagrams Figures   Short          terminal branches for these stages indicated a high          similarity of their geneexpression profiles Root          profiles at three developmental stages also group          together although their internal relationships were less          consistent among comparisons Immature ears plus embryos          or leaf sheaths from two developmental stages also          grouped consistently With more distant relationships          nodes were less well supported For example the          leafsheath pair appeared as a sister group to the leaf          blades in trees AF but as sister to the leaf blades or          roots in trees GL Figure  The extremely short          shared nodes imply a weak relationship of the leafsheath          pair to either group After collapsing short and          inconsistent nodes four distinct macrogroups remained          with unresolved relationships among them Figure  leaf          blades leaf sheaths reproductive ear silk embryo          husk and roots Within these four broad categories each          group has a unique set of expressed genes and these          patterns were relatively consistent during the          developmental stages assayed          The relationship of the husk a photosynthetic          leaflike organ   surrounding the ears of maize to          other organs merits special attention It appeared as an          immediate sister to the silk Figure  bottom panel or          sister to the inflorescence organ group including the          silk Figure  upper panel After collapsing ambiguous          nodes the husk remained within the reproductive group          and therefore distinctive from both leaf blade and          sheath Adjacent positions with the long terminal          branches implied a loose relationship between husks and          silks Of the flowerrelated genes  are expressed at          high levels in husks Figure  node c                          Organspecific gene expression          To gain greater confidence in deciphering          organspecific geneexpression patterns geneproduct          classification focused on  probes with a more than          fourfold ratio difference in signal intensities in at          least one organ compared to the reference Figure           According to the criterion of           E value  e in BLASTX          searches   only  of the  genes predict similar          proteins in public databases  of  genes matched an           Arabidopsis genome sequence and           genes did not have significantly similar sequence in          the public databases          Flowerrelated genes included hydroxyprolinerich          glycoprotein            hrgp   amylase          PID pollen allergen PID a bZIP          transcription factor PID four MADSbox genes             and several unknown genes Figure  A          relatively high expression of diverse transcription          factors in embryo immature ear and silk is consistent          with microscopic observations that many stages of organ          differentiation are occurring within the immature          inflorescence and embryos Because the husks were          morphologically fully expanded leaf sheaths surrounding          the ear it was surprising that they expressed the same          genes such as MADSbox genes that are associated with          early stages of flower development Heatshock proteins           kDa  kDa and  kDa were abundant in silks          husks and IME but not in embryos The genes for the           kDa and  kDa proteins are expressed at raised          temperatures    however in this study they          appear to be part of a developmental program Embryos and          flowers are distinguished by large quantitative          differences in expression of these three heatshock          genes Rootspecific genes included a nodulin homolog          PID putative lipidtransfer protein gene          PID physical impedance induced protein gene          PID and four additional unknown genes The          organspecific expression pattern of these genes may          spark interest in defining their physiological          functions                          Genes expressed preferentially in the leaf          blade          Twentysix transcripts were comparatively abundant          only in leaf blades Figure  node a The expression          ratio of these genes was more than twofold higher in          day week and adult leaf blades and more than          fourfold lower in roots immature ears and embryos in          comparison to the reference day shoots Twentythree of          these leafenriched transcripts shared high sequence          similarity to previously published identified or          putative coding sequences Gene products from  of          these  genes were previously characterized as located          in or predicted to locate to plastids Two well          characterized genes in this leafblade group are for          Rubisco small subunit            rbcS  and phosphoribulokinase key          enzymes for converting CO            into carbohydrate via the Calvin          cycle Other genes represented components of          lightharvesting complexes photosystems I and II          chloroplastic aldolase   and the           phosphoenolpyruvate          translocator gene   Most of these highly          expressed leaf genes are encoded in the nuclear genome          and the proteins are imported into chloroplasts          Interestingly three of the  leafblade genes are          known to be encoded in the chloroplast genome in maize          as in other flowering plants   None of them          contained a polyA tail track in the EST sequences          Transcripts for these genes are so abundant in leaf          blades that poly A selection apparently failed to          remove them during mRNA purification for cDNA library          construction and hybridization target labeling These          chloroplastencoded genes consistently showed a          coregulated expression pattern clustering with          photosynthesis genes encoded in the nuclear genome Thus          although they are contaminants their expression patterns          confirm the coregulation of plastid and nuclearencoded          genes required to construct photosynthetically competent          organelles          A second group of genes was also expressed highly           fold in leaf blades especially adult leaf          blades and was about twofold lower in most other organs          Figure  node b As listed in Figure  most of the          annotated gene products are involved in the C pathway of          CO            fixation Expression patterns of C          genes are consistent with previous reports that they were          highly expressed in leaves as well as at a low but          detectable level in other organs   and references          therein   Abundant transcripts of           carbonic anhydrase phosphoenolpyruvate          carboxylase pepc and           NADPmalic enzyme genes in leaf          blades are consistent with the NADPME type C pathway          known to operate in maize    In addition to the          NADPME type C pathway genes           phosphoenolpyruvate          carboxykinase and           alanine aminotransferase genes were          also highly expressed in leaf blades These encode two of          the three enzymes that distinguish the          phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PEPCK C pathway The          gene for the other key enzyme aspartate          aminotransferase was not included in this array          however EST sequences are well represented in diverse          organs including the green tissues of weekold shoot          and mixed adult tissue libraries ZmDB   All genes          involved in both the NADPME and PEPCK C pathways are          regulated similarly in all organs surveyed in this study          Figure                           Verification of hybridization ratios and ratio          interpretation          To estimate how well signal ratios reflect relative          transcript amounts an RNA blot hybridization was carried          out with an           hrgp probe There are three           hrgp TUGs which are            identical along  nucleotides and more definitively            and nucleotide unique indels insertions or          deletions distinguish them As shown in Figure  blot          hybridization with the           hrgp probe produced results similar          to the pattern of signal ratios in the  pairs of          microarray hybridizations which are listed by organ in          Figure  Overall individual signal ratios were lower on          the microarray hybridization than with the blot          hybridization measured by a PhosphorImager For example          the ratio between IME and the reference was fold on          the array but was fold by blot hybridization          Exceptionally signal ratios for leaf blades were higher          in the microarray analysis than by blot hybridization To          some extent these quantitative differences may reflect          the different properties of microarray and RNA blot          hybridizations The microarray utilizes a complex mixture          of labeled cDNA fragments targets to hybridize to one          kind of tethered probe at each position whereas an RNA          blot applies one kind of labeled probe to a mixture of          RNA targets separated by size using gel          electrophoresis          The blot hybridization also appears to report ratios          over a wider range The ratios from the microarrays for          EMB and silks were about  for both organs but they were           and  for EMB and silks in the blot hybridization          respectively These observations may reflect two features          of microarray analysis the nonlinearity of fluorescence          excitation and the saturation of signal intensities for          abundant transcripts The signal ratios from microarrays          in this study probably underestimate the actual          difference in amount for abundant transcripts Therefore          a small absolute ratio should be interpreted as a          reliable indicator for the presence of the transcript          type in both samples In this experiment log            ratios from  to  are          interpreted as simply indicating transcript presence          without ascribing a difference in absolute amount          Similarly we conclude that a fourfold difference          detected by microarray hybridization indicates more than          a fourfold difference in RNA abundance and could indicate          organspecificity of expression                          Hybridization pattern comparisons between oligos          and cDNA          There are five gene families on the element          cladogram shown in the middle of Figure  three            tubulin genes three            tubulin genes three           carbonic anhydrase genes four MADS          box genes and five putative           cellulose synthase genes          Individual genes in each gene family displayed almost          identical expression patterns in all  samples A few          individual            tubulin              tubulin   MADS box             and           cellulose synthase   genes have          been reported to be differentially expressed in maize or          other plants For these gene families individual gene          expression profiles on microarrays are obscured by          crosshybridization among family members             To test whether oligonucleotide probes can be utilized          together with cDNA probes to resolve individual gene          contributions multiple oligos were printed on the same          glass slide microarrays with the EST probes We wished to          determine whether multiple oligos designed to the same          gene would exhibit a coherent hybridization pattern and          whether the oligos from a particular gene would cluster          with known examples of genes coregulated           in vivo a powerful test of the          microarray   For this analysis  probes were          selected a combination of oligo and EST probes Oligo          probes from five genes            tub hrgp rbcS eEF            pepc  met the selection criteria          see legend to Figure  of demonstrating a high ratio in          at least one hybridization Multiple oligo probes for          each of these genes were printed as illustrated in the          gene models in Figure  After cluster analysis the          multiple oligos for each gene established wellseparated          groups in only one restricted branch of the cladogram of          the element data set Figure  left panel Within          the           rbcS block as an example both          nucleotide probes from each of two exons appear as          close neighbors no other probes separate them Such          tight groups are characteristic of all nucleotide          oligos present in this cladogram Similar results were          produced from data that were neither mediancentered nor          normalized          The multiple cDNAs for           rbcS hrgp and            tub genes cluster with the          corresponding oligo probes It is notable however that          two of three           hrgp cDNA probes showed fairly          reduced ratios in several organs Figure  triangles and          squares The signal ratios from these two PCR probes          differ significantly from the other probe and from the          oligo probes            p   in a paired           t test Differences between a          cDNA and multiple oligo probes are particularly evident          for           pepc Six of nine oligos are shown          on the cladogram with functionally related genes Figures            Three others were excluded during the selection          process because of weak hybridization On the other hand          the cDNA probe was not selected because it exhibited an          insufficient absolute ratio difference We suspect that          crosshybridization among           pepc family members or other          genes obscured the authentic gene expression from the          cDNA probe The ratio patterns of oligo probes in           pairs of duplicated hybridization experiments suggest          that mer oligos are a good alternative to          genespecific RNA blot hybridization to measure          expression patterns of specific genes Oligos of  and           nucleotides were also used successfully although          signal strength was weaker red dots on the gene list in          Figure  We conclude that the oligo hybridization          patterns reflect transcript levels relatively accurately          for the five genes presented in Figure  In fact the          representation is likely to be more accurate than that          based on PCR products based on the RNA blot hybridization          comparisons Figure                             Discussion                  Internal consistency of the microarray          hybridization          Internal consistency of the array hybridization          results was demonstrated by five pieces of evidence          First a control hybridization with one type of mRNA for          which aliquots were labeled with different dyes generated          signal ratios within  to fold for  of the          genes Second a dyeswapping hybridization with two          samples of mRNA hybridized on separate slides yielded          very similar expression profiles Figure  Third          multiple probes for each of several gene family members          for five families deposited at random positions generated          similar hybridization patterns Figure  suggesting          that local effects on hybridization were negligible          Fourth functionally related genes clustered together          demonstrating a coherent pattern in  pairs of          hybridization analysis Figures   Fifth groups of          oligos designed to match different positions within          several genes generated similar signal ratios and each          oligo group clustered together Figure  Collectively          these facts indicate that hybridization with these          microarrays containing a mixture of cDNA and oligo probes          was internally consistent                          Organ identity of husks          Each organ is expected to have a unique combination of          expressed genes allowing organ identification and          assessment of similarity with other organs as shown by          the cladograms in Figure  It is interesting that the          highly expressed genes in husks parallel what is found in          other floral organs Anatomically the husks around an          ear are composed primarily of leaf sheath with a reduced          ligule region subtending a highly reduced leaf blade in          most maize inbred lines Husks are usually classified as          modified photosynthetic leaves with the assumption that          they are vegetative organs on a branch that terminates in          an ear    According the work of Langdale and          colleagues   maize husks express mainly the C          pathway of carbon fixation in contrast to leaf blades in          which C fixation predominates We found that husk          geneexpression profiles are distinctive from both leaf          blades and sheaths For example Rubisco subunitbinding          protein PID was expressed at a similar level in          husks but at  fold lower levels in leaf blades          compared to the reference dayold shoot Figure  On          the other hand all other photosynthetic genes expressed          at high levels in leaf blades were at low levels in          husks relative to seedlings Physiologically          photosynthetic rates in husks are consistently measured          to be around fold lower in leaf blades   Both the          expression pattern of photosynthetic genes and the low          rate of carbon fixation in husks suggest that these are          distinctive organs In contrast those genes that are          highly expressed in silks and immature ears were          expressed at comparable levels in husks Figure node c          They included           hrgp   amylase PID          pollen allergen PID a bZIP transcription factor          PID four MADSbox    three heatshock          proteins and a dozen uncharacterized genes Consistent          with the hybridization results one MADS box gene ZAP          has been reported to be expressed in the sterile organs          of maize florets and in husks   The           Arabidopsis homolog AP is also          expressed in nonreproductive organs such as sepal and          petal primordia   The close relationship of husks to          maize floral organs shown by geneexpression profiles          suggests that husks could be considered as photosynthetic          floral organs arising from an inflorescence meristem                          Two types of C photosynthesis pathways in          maize          C plants have been classified into three subgroups on          the basis of the distinctive enzymes that decarboxylate          C acids in the bundle sheath cells Maize is a classic          NADPME type C plant   Interestingly we found that          the enzyme PEPCK is expressed in a pattern similar to          NADPME and two additional universal C enzyme genes          PEPCK catalyzes the reversible decarboxylation of          oxaloacetate OAA to PEP This enzyme has several          proposed functions such as gluconeogenesis in          germinating seeds carbon recovery during senescence          nitrogen assimilation during seed development and          decarboxylation of OAA in PEPCKtype C photosynthesis             The comparatively low expression level of the          PEPCK gene in dayold shoots weakens the hypothesis          that its major function in maize is for gluconeogenesis          in greening seedling parts Similarly highlevel          expression in seedling leaves and adult leaves cannot be          for senescencerelated carbon recovery We concur with          recent proposals that the major role of PEPCK in green          tissues is decarboxylation of OAA during C          photosynthesis in maize Maize leaves have PEPCK activity          equal to  of the activity levels of a pure          PEPCKtype C plant           Panicum maximum   Furthermore          the enzyme activity was localized in bundlesheath cells          where CO            is released from OAA for refixation          in the Calvin cycle   The cDNA was cloned from          libraries enriched for maize bundlesheath cells                     In addition to PEPCK two additional genes for key          enzymes of the PEPCK pathway were expressed coordinately                    alanine aminotransferase and           aspartate          aminotransferase Previously the proteins were          undetected by western analysis in purified maize          bundlesheath cells using antibodies against           Panicum maximum aspartate          aminotransferase and           Cucumis sativus alanine          aminotransferase Detection failure could reflect          weak antibody crossreactivity or enzyme degradation          during bundlesheath cell isolation   By EST          sequencing and microarray hybridizations all three PEPCK          C pathwayspecific genes are expressed similarly to the          NADPME pathway genes We therefore propose that the          PEPCKtype C pathway is active in addition to the          NADPME type C pathway for CO            fixation in maize leaf blades          Figure                           Extensive hybridization overlap by diverse          organs          The UniGene microarray contained  elements On          this microarray most genes hybridized to RNA from          diverse organ samples and very few genes hybridized to          RNA from just one sample According to the array          hybridization results over  of the genes produced          similar signal ratios log               between the reference          and each of  samples examined Thus most transcript          types appear to be present at near equivalent levels in          many organs of the plant The interpretation of organ          differences reported here reflects results based on a          subset  of the current tentative unique genes          defined by maize EST collections many of the EST          elements queried are likely to be moderately expressed          genes However microarray hybridization result is          consistent with DNARNA reassociation kinetic studies          using multiple organs of tobacco plants   About           of tobacco genes were expressed in all organs examined          leaf petal anther ovary root stem and  of          the genes were tissue or organspecific by the criterion          of RNA complexity The apparent low number of tissue or          organspecific genes observed in maize is also consistent          with other microarray studies indicating that only around           of           Arabidopsis genes displayed          significant  fold difference in three organ          comparisons seed root and leaf   or root leaf and          flower   Similarly only  of tested genes were          distinguishable at three stages of strawberry ripening            Studies of the same organ from different treatment          regimes such as darkgrown and lightgrown seedlings of           Arabidopsis   showed only a           difference During a more complete study of the circadian          cycle only  of genes examined showed differential          expression with a circadian rhythm   From the data          available it appears that plant organs differentially          express only a small subset of unique genes and that          physiological perturbations result in induction or          repression of an even smaller number          Why do so many genes appear to be expressed in diverse          plant organs including those of maize Some housekeeping          genes are constitutively expressed in similar amounts in          all organs to insure the maintenance of basic cellular          processes Differential expressions might be celltype          dependent such differences might not be detected in this          study because most tissues were mixtures of multiple cell          types In a geneexpression study during           Poplar wood development            genes were differentially expressed in different          development zones within the vascular meristem            Some genes may be expressed at similar RNA levels but          protein levels are controlled posttranscriptionally On          microarrays the correspondence between individual gene          expression and hybridization signal is not exact          Crosshybridization among similar sequences is a major          complication in microarrays fabricated with cDNAs          Substantial crosshybridization has been reported among          sequences showing  similarity over  nucleotides            Crosshybridization between related genes will be a          profound problem in the analysis of geneexpression          patterns in plants About  of genes are duplicated in           A thaliana through both chromosome          and local duplications    Maize has undergone an          allotetraploid chromosome duplication event within the          past  million years preceded by other genomewide          duplications    In the available studies          however there are many examples of maize duplicated          genes expressed in different organs   For example          two duplicated transcription factor genes            p p  regulating pholaphene          pigment synthesis are expressed fairly exclusively in two          sets of organs           p and           p arose following a local gene          duplication and insertion of multiple retroelements          between           p and           p Subsequently           p acquired a new regulatory          sequence  of the gene probably explaining its new          expression pattern   There are many retroelements          and DNA transposons flanking maize genes and they may          contribute to the rapid divergence of transcriptional          regulation   Another example comes from duplicated          chalcone synthase genes            C Whp  They share over           sequence similarity but are differentially expressed            It is also evident that some duplicated genes are          expressed redundantly at the same time in the same organ          For example five copies of           cellulose synthase genes   and          five copies of           eEF  genes   are coexpressed          in diverse organs                          Redundant expression among duplicated genes          Sequence comparisons among TUGs assembled within          individual EST sequencing projects  DR and           IME provide anecdotal information about the expression          modes of duplicated genes TUGs sharing   sequence          similarity over  nucleotides were identified by BLAST            Within library  immature ear            of the TUGs are similar at this criterion and            of the TUGs defined within library           seedling root appear to be duplicated genes When TUGs          assembled from libraries  and  are compared to each          other  appear to be duplicated The sequence          comparisons among TUGs probably underestimate the number          of duplicated genes because sequence data are incomplete          Comparisons of fulllength cDNA sequences of each gene          would increase the fractions of gene families both within          and between these two libraries Because microarray          hybridization conditions cannot resolve the precise          expression patterns of gene   similar the true          fraction of constitutively expressed genes cannot be          calculated          An important question is what fraction of closely          related duplicated genes are expressed differentially          during the maize life cycle For the moderately expressed          class of genes discovered by EST sequencing of specific          developmental stages it is striking that so many gene          families are expressed in all  samples examined here          Functional redundancy among individual genes within a          gene family would produce no detectable phenotype until          all functionally redundant genes are mutated see          examples in   Yet mutations in individual maize          genes within a large gene family can produce a visible          phenotype This evidence indicates that functional          specialization has occurred By RNA blot hybridizations          it is often observed that the relative amount of          transcripts varies among individual genes within a          family suggesting that promoter divergence produces          quantitative differences    In some cases          mutation that eliminates expression from one genefamily          member may be compensated by higher expression of other          members even if there is no visible phenotype a          molecular phenotype is predicted cDNA microarrays are          not sensitive enough to detect minor changes of          expression patterns or differential expression of          recently duplicated genes with the current hybridization          condition C hybridization and C washing Oligo          probes appear to be a good alternative for analysis of          individual geneexpression profiles either in          conjunction with PCR products or by themselves Oligo          probes can be designed to represent individual genes by          exploiting even small polymorphisms Our results show          that suitable hybridization and washing conditions can be          used for the analysis of PCR and oligo probes on the same          microarray slide                            Materials and methods                  Sample organs          The maize strain in this study has the genetic          background K  W  Robertsons Mutator           Seedlings were grown under  Em sec constant          illumination conditions of coolwhite fluorescent light          in a C growth room For the day seedling with          coleoptile reference sample the shoot was harvested          other seedling samples were taken at  days or  days          after planting Fieldgrown plants were the source of          most organ samples The same genotype was planted in

excluded from immature ears Husks          were collected from the same ear The two outermost husk          layers were excluded and all other inside layers were          collected Mature but unpollinated silks were harvested          from two ears the ears had been shootbagged to prevent          pollen contamination on the silks Adult leaf blades were          taken from fully expanded leaves                          cDNA probe preparation          cDNA clones were from three nonnormalized cDNA          libraries a mixture of adult tissue projects  and           W inbred line with active Mutator transposons          dayold roots project  W inbred line and          immature ears project  Oh inbred line The           cDNA clones chosen represent approximately  of the          tentative unique genes in the April  EST assembly            They were designated as UniGene members after EST          assembly of  available ESTs representing around           TUGs in September  A clone for each TUG was          selected on the basis of EST sequence length during          UniGene consolidation In many cases ESTs defining          particular TUGs were recovered from multiple libraries          Clone identities were verified in UniGene by          resequencing for approximately  of the clones to          confirm well positions in the consolidation plates          PCR

addition  oligos of           nucleotides and  oligos of  nucleotides were          synthesized from  different genes for comparison of          their hybridization behavior to PCR probes short oligos          were also prepared for the  genes for which the          nucleotides oligos were designed The calculated           T           m of exon probes ranged from C          while the           T           m of intron and intronexon junction          probes ranged from C Synthesized oligos were          dissolved in  mM phosphate buffer pH  at  m          Multiple nucleotide oligo probes for  genes were          printed on the same arrays as the cDNA probes Mean          signal intensities were calculated from each of  genes          represented by these mers that showed consistent          hybridization in all organ comparisons They were used to          examine the consistency of hybridization as positive          control elements and they were included in the cluster          analyses                          RNA purification labeling and          hybridization          Total RNA was extracted from  samples using the          Trizol method GibcoBRL mRNA was further purified from          total RNA with Oligotex minicolumns Qiagen Valencia          CA mRNA quantity and quality were examined by UV          absorption at  and  nm RNA quality was also          examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to monitor loss          of ribosomal RNA after mRNA purification About  g of          poly A RNA was used to synthesize fluorescently          labeled cDNA

Superscript II          GibcoBRL          Hybridization was performed as described at            Variations included hybridization at temperatures between          C and an initial washing at C mRNA from          dayold shoots with coleoptiles was labeled with          CydUTP which served as the common reference in all          pairs of hybridization for the cluster analyses with          CydUTP labeled samples from other stages Microarray          slides were scanned with an Axon scanner Axon          Instrument Union City CA Signal was initially          normalized during the image scanning process to adjust          the average ratios between two channels Grids were          generated and adjusted automatically then refined          manually to identify the microarray elements Those          probes whose signal intensity subtracted by background          was lower than  in either channel or less than           in the sum of both channels were excluded from further          analyses Signal ratios for each probe element on each          slide were calculated using the mean intensity of pixels          subtracted by median background for each channel Array          results are deposited at a public geneexpression          database Gene Expression Omnibus   and their          accession numbers are GPL for the platform and          GSMGSM for  samples                          Hierarchical clustering          Hierarchical clustering of the data was performed          using the computer program Cluster   The output was          visualized using the program TreeView available at            Cluster analyses were carried out before and after          a secondary normalization process to make the sum of the          squares  in each row and column Although the results          were very similar we prefer the results from the          unnormalized data for three reasons First the reference          sample is identical in all hybridizations Second          unnormalized data produced organ relationships consistent          with organ identities and the relationships inferred from          normalized data Third the normalization could compound          variation by combining an uncertainty from a computation          method on top of the variations from hybridization                          RNA blot hybridization          A  g sample of total RNA was loaded onto a glyoxal          gel as described in   Hybridization probes for RNA          blots were prepared by the random primer labeling method          to incorporate P Blots were analyzed on a
