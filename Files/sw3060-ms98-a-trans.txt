        okay do you like to listen to music   oh i like to listen to music i just am not a very educated person when it comes to music   well im not either as far as Bach and Beethoven and all that   what what do you like to listen to   well its really strange i like country music and my husband likes the older rock and roll stuff so weve had to kind of educate each other   okay     thats been kind of strange   oh im sure   yeah but being in from Texas from Austin youd think you get a lot of good country music   well im not originally from Austin im from Minnesota so it took me moving to Texas to start liking country music   oh oh yeah thats true   and now i really do im im really becoming Texanized     well have you ever gone to Austin City Limits     i havent but i watch it on i watch it on um television sometimes and and uh ive taken country western dance lessons oh yeah   uhhuh oh you have did you like that oh yeah   i love it i absolutely love it   yeah i took that in college one time as an easy course   and uh oh yes i definitely am am much more into country   yeah   um so you you which uh singers do you like i mean i can actually name singers im im not too bad   oh really well naturally i i like George Strait and uh   George Strait   and Garth Brooks went to the same college that i went to and he used to play in a little dive there in town  when   so you know him from   when he was a nobody no i dont know him personally but i do remember going to see him when he was a nobody   well thats great   yeah but i went to see George Strait when George Strait was a nobody too   wow   so yeah ive kind of followed them   well who are you going to go see now i mean who do you see now thats going to be somebody someday     well i really like um whats his name Jackson whats his first name   oh   i cant think of his first name hes a blonde guy and he sings um Alan Jackson   oh Alan Jackson   yeah   um   he has some kind of fun country tunes but you know its really funny because country music has changed so much from when like i remember in drivers ed in high school that that my teacher always liked to listen to country music as we were  driving and i thought oh God this stuff is horrible   well okay well maybe it just has changed and maybe its more accepted all over   it really has i mean country music is a lot easier for people to break into as opposed to other fields of music so i think a lot of people start out in country and then try to   right and then you you know you kind of think of Alabama you know that kind of brought everyone into a more country and and you know   yeah yeah definitely yeah i used to go see them they werent nobodies then but i did go see them before they got to be major big stars   yeah   so  it was fun but   Kenny Kenny Rogers hes kind of country and kind of rock you know   oh yeah yeah i remember because when i was taking drivers ed is right when You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me Lucille came out and it seemed like every other song on the radio was that song     had to listen to that one again   yeah   oh   but its fun i really i i enjoy listening to it i i keep my radio on at the office but i dont you know i dont have it turned up real loud unless its a really good song   uhhuh and then you just you you pump up the volume yeah   yeah just a little see its real funny because the guy that i work with is from um New Jersey and he is trying to learn now about country music hes gotten to where he really likes it but he doesnt know any of the names of the people or   from New Jersey yeah thats great   yeah  just yeah i was so amazed   thats like about the farthest call from country music you can get   yeah   oh   but hes got hes real funny because his office is across from mine and so hell turn up the radio real loud and say whos this singing   oh thats great where do you work   i work for a computer company   oh thats super   yeah its its fun because its small enough that we can do stuff like that and get away with it   so you can do things like that yeah im im im being envious well one thing that i did in music that i mean was a big extravagance for me but   so     i have two daughters that are eleven and fourteen and Whitney Houston just came to town and and she was coming to town the same day that my daughter was getting her braces off so i and i really like her so i thought well   uhhuh oh really oh wow   well well go buy tickets and this is how well celebrate getting braces off teeth   yeah   and she really she really i i wouldnt say it was the a great concert   uhhuh   not that ive had that many but i know it wasnt a great concert you know   yeah   but it wasnt a bad one either and the one thing that i really appreciated in going to hear her sing in person is her extreme volume for that tiny little body you know and she really does have to work to get it all out   oh really oh yeah   and youd you wouldnt catch that you know off of a  a CD or a cassette you know   yeah well did you happen to see her um welcome home show on the HBO for the troops   i did not no   she had so much energy i mean she danced and danced and danced  and i thought golly thats like a two hour aerobic class   yes i know i know so that that was really really fun umhum   yeah that would be neat i didnt know she was going to be in Austin   yeah that was just last week   wow   umhum   huh well thats neat   so we had a good time   yeah well are you familiar with Don Henley at all   im not   he um used to play with The Eagles have you do you know anything about them   i know Eagles uhhuh   okay well he was one of the original Eagles and hes broken off now and gone solo and he was in Dallas Saturday night and put on a wonderful concert he sang   wow   for like three hours and he sang a lot of old stuff and a lot of his new stuff so it was really exciting   well you know now that you mention it i probably had would know you know know a song of his   yeah im sure yo ur daughters do   oh yes i well theyre you know they know everything and then they always ask me if i know sport figures too so im a real flunky you know   yeah well i in fact i had older singers so or older older singers older sisters   oh so they kind of   so i got to listen i got to listen to Hermans Hermits and all that stuff so that was fun       and its but its really funny now because ill im going to be thirty in August and its sad because i listen to the oldies station and i know all the songs   i know i know   its kind of depressing   it is its its sad when you reach that age   i know   but youre not doing bad i have a a good friend that i mean shes much older than i am shes i think about fifty eight and shes really up on all the new music even better than i am and and i mean she just likes music and shes just a person thats really with it so maybe youll be like she is   oh really yeah well i hope its really funny though because ill be at the club working out and ill hear the aerobics music going and ill think God thats a remake of an old song   right right  and it really gets bad when you can remember what you were doing oh i remember     i know  remember the original   thats right       oh and were were just getting to that age where we date ourselves all over the place   oh i know its pretty sad but its real funny with my husband too because he really likes older rock and roll so   did he really like Beatles   yeah he i mean hes got Beatles and Crosby Still and Nash and you know all those songs that that my sisters know i mean my sisters listen to Beatles but not any of the other ones i mean like he likes Santana and some kind of off the wall ones so   uhhuh     im getting indoctrinated to a new a new uh line of music   youre picking up some new stuff   yeah its fun though we have a good time because   oh it is
