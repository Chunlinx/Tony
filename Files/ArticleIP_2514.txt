                                 Follow the Semen            Coverage of the Flytrapstory has focused almost entirely on one question Did Bill Clinton have sexwith Monica Lewinsky Yet very few Americans and almost none of thejournalists on the Flytrap beat have any doubts about the answer So why hasAmerican journalism concentrated on the least mysterious aspect of thisstory            Oneexplanation is that did they have sex is a question of fact whereas otherFlytrap questions are matters of judgment or policy or values The socialcritic Dwight Macdonald wrote in his great  essay The Triumph of theFact later reprinted in his book Against the American Grain  thatAmericans are in love with facts valuing Facts in themselves collecting themas boys collect postage stamps treating them in short as objects ofconsumption rather than as productive tools            Macdonalds point was that the obsessiveaccumulation of data had become an unsatisfactory substitute for formulatingnotions about what anything meantan argument that seems even more compellingsince the advent of the Internet and allnews cable TV channels His bestexample of empiricisms limits was the apocryphal story of how at the dawnof the Enlightenment a scientist tried to establish the existence of the humansoul not by speculating on the Vital Principle and the Intrinsic Substance ofthe Soul as described in Aristotle and the Church Fathers but by weighing acondemned criminal before and after execution            Similarly the US press corps has spent the last halfyear examining whetheradultery and perjury disqualify a man to be president by chasing a cocktaildress allegedly stained with the commander in chiefs semen This fact huntwhile somewhat insane is also perfectly understandableand even laudableinthe context of whats broadly understood to be the presss mandate to gatherinformation with rigorous impartiality As press critics never tire of sayingthe mainstream presss job isnt or shouldnt be to jump to conclusionsevenin instances such as Flytrap where Hypothesis and Conclusion seem separated bya very short evidentiary hop            Its true that some Flytrap allegations werepoorly sourced and that two respected news organizations the Wall StreetJournal and the Dallas Morning News  had to retract a couple ofparticularly lurid stories Media critics such as Pete Hamill and Steven Brillhave lacerated the press for getting the facts wrong But now that Flytrap isentering what looks like its penultimate stage all this highminded outrage isstarting to look a bit quaint Lewinsky is expected to tell a grand jury thatshe did indeed have sex with Clinton and that Clinton encouraged her to lieabout the relationship in an affidavit submitted to Paula Jones lawyers AndClinton has agreed to answer grand jury questions via closedcircuit TV            Thepresident of course is one of those few people who still claim there is afactual issue at stake Before the grand jury he may admit to having had sexwith Lewinsky thereby admitting to having committed perjury in the Jones suitThe general view is that perjury in civil suits isnt easy to prosecuteespecially if the suit has been dismissed as Jones was Or Clinton couldstick to his story and perjure himself before the grand jury a much moreserious crime Or Clinton might stick to his story because its true But thisscenarionever plausibleis even more unlikely now that prosecutors have whatthe New York Post dubbed the Love Dress            This dress is what Alfred Hitchcock used tocall the McGuffinthe allimportant object whose pursuit frames a narrativeexamples the Maltese falcon Charles Foster Kanes sled and theuraniumpacked wine bottles in Hitchcocks own Notorious  The LoveDresss existence was first speculated upon in the Drudge Report whereit was black and then on ABC where it was navy blue United PressInternational passing along the ABC report asserted Lewinsky had saved asemenstained dress in fact ABCs Jackie Judd had reported only that Lewinskysaid shed saved such a dress Then a few news organizations got thestained dress confused with another dress that Lewinsky allegedly hadreceived from Clinton This other dress was a multicolored peasant dressaccording to the New York Post  purchased for not much money onMarthas Vineyard  Time  that might not exist at all according toNewsweek Washington bureau chief Ann McDaniel or really be a longTshirt William Ginsburg to Barbara Walters on ABCs              Meanwhile the FBI reportedly was going through Lewinskys closets at theWatergate testing every dress in sight and finding no stains It turns out ifthe latest reports are accurate the dress had been in hiding with LewinskysManhattanite mother Marcia who turned it over last week to prosecutors inexchange for immunity An FBI spokeswoman quoted in the New York Timessaid the agency will first establish whether there is any semen on the dresseasy to do and then spend several weeks finding out whose semen it issomewhat more difficult but since the mids not all that hard accordingto the Washington Post  Assuming the genetic markers point to Clintonand that Clinton doesnt resort to claiming a heretofore undisclosed identicaltwin scientific empiricism in collaboration with the more untidy empiricismof daily journalism will have triumphed            But please permit an unscientificgeneralization There is not a reporter in Washington who seriously doubtsamid this furious DNA hunt that President Clinton had a sexual encounter withLewinsky Indeed it would likely be hard to find even a White House aide whoin the privacy of hisher home would tell a spouse that heshe buys Clintonsstory Whenever a Paul Begala or a Mike McCurry asserts in public that he trulybelieves Clinton its treated by the press as news because the commonassumption is that Clinton officials believe their boss is lying And when theysay they believe Clinton is telling the truth every reporter quoting themassumes theyre lying too            Theonly new fact in Flytrap that would qualify as genuine news would be oneproving Bill Clinton didnt have sex with Lewinsky The importantquestion is not whether Clinton had sex with her and lied about it but what thecountry should do about this            In dealing with the real issue the Americanpress is hobbled by its strengths as well as its weaknesses Like Macdonaldsfictitious scientist it is uncomfortable with abstractions Flytrap is a caseof journalists doing precisely what press critics are always hectoring them todojust supply the facts dont indulge in opinion or conclusionand showsthe inadequacy of that journalistic ideal Some might say the inadequacies ofthe Flytrap coverage are a point in favor of the British system in whichjournalists are freer to reveal their opinions The American convention is notquite what it seems American journalists are permitted to act on theirprejudicesthe news columns and air time devoted to Flytrap wouldnt makesense unless reporters and editors believed the accusations Theyre just notpermitted to express this belief At the very least Flytrapillustrates the need for less fact chasing and more analysis and illuminationof the what should we do about it question            Or maybe the moral is simplythe need for more humility about how useful journalism is in addressing mattersof public importance Fifteen years ago Sidney Blumenthal now a top adviserto President Clinton wrote an incisive piece for the New Republicexamining why thenPresident Ronald Reagans frequent factual misstatementshadnt made him as unpopular as Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter The answer wasthat the reporters who assailed Reagans howlers were empiricists but Reaganhimself was not He was animated not by Fact but by Belief Reaganunconsciously seconded this judgment at the  Republican convention whenbotching a quote from John Adams he declared Facts are stupid thingsBlumenthals boss has very little in common with Reagan and if anything wearshis beliefs too lightly But somewhere along the way he may have absorbedReagans lesson that while Americans like to gather Facts the power Facts haveto settle important questions is vastly overrated            More Flytrap
