        person ive ever gotten       yeah me too i guess its the east coast time you know everybody else is asleep     well i figured im available now and actually ive had this thing on speaker phone and its it tried about fifteen time   oh yeah yeah ive got ive initiated a few at the office like that and it takes a while during the day uh well its an interesting topic wanna get going   okay i oh okay here we go   okay   what are your thoughts on fitness   uh well i exercise fairly regularly  i work for a company out here uh in uh Livingston New Jersey Bellcore yeah Bell Communications Research and um we have in the corporate center where i work a health enhancement center HEC they call it   umhum   and its about as convenient as can be its uh just two floors down from me and uh so i exercise regularly during the daytime when im at the office   do they have Nautilus machines and that kind of thing   and they have oh a bank of maybe six jogging machines they have a a um        progressive weight machine that uh you know you dial up the weights on it its not Nautilus but its similar to that and then they have uh bicycles and free weights but they also have people who chart your progress uh and encourage you to come if you slip off for a couple of weeks they send you a a nice friendly aggressive reminder that says hey we havent seen you for a while       and they also provide towels and shower facilities and lockers and everything so        uh you ive been through the routine i guess like most people where you know ive joined health clubs ive been at the university where you know its a pretty good distance away you know quarter of a mile walk and uh nothing seemed to work for me as well as having it in my own building doesnt work at at at home you know ive bought home exercise equipment and stuff and   right is this something you do on your lunch hour   uh no i generally go down there um midafternoon um the time that seems to be best for me is around two oclock two thirty but   oh they allow you that free time to do that   but  yeah and thats you know there are people down there all the time you could almost hold meetings sometimes because people tend to set up a regular schedule and go down there uh but the the etiquette of the place is that you dont really talk too much business   oh i really wouldnt have thought theyd give you that much free time this is part of your day   when were down there uh yeah yeah it just you know works out that way um and there have been a lot of studies i have friends who uh   huh      who work in the recreation field for companies like this and actually um a break like that increases productivity and and with the commensurate um increase in physical fitness by the people who attend these centers regularly you have uh fewer absentees and things like that so the corporation can justify it pretty well   um   and its not like im taking time away from the company i probably put in extra hours because im now physically fit and        reenergized i mean that  my routine around two two thirty to go down there for an hour probably makes the last three hours of the day then more productive than i would if i  you know just sort of went on through so   well i i  i used to exercise at night and i found that you dont come home tired you come home with a  new found energy so you i can see what youre saying   yeah yeah and thats what the late kind of the late afternoon is i you know i have a very light lunch because i know im gonna be working out and uh you you know usually then my lunch is just a a quick tuna sandwich at my desk so then and i sort of skip that luncheon   right   time and uh you know catch up on reading and then work out so thats thats kind of my routine   hm i belong to a Y and i substitute teach so i would love to get there Monday Wednesday Friday or you know every other day but when the phone rings at six oclock in the morning thats it   umhum     and and its kind of upsetting because if you go once a week it hurts every single time   yes yeah   you know i what i like about exercise i love the inaerobic exercise i like the weight machines and i like the free weights i enjoy that its sort of a personal challenge to get better at that and you do see results real quickly um  you know the the   umhum   um stationary bike and those skiing machines thats work im not crazy about that   yeah yeah we have the Nordic machine and i tried it a couple of times it just made me feel stupid and uncomfortable and uncoordinated so i dont do that i sometimes it is used regularly by you know people but uh i i didnt like it   well i find i i you know i read somewhere that twenty minutes on the bike is what you need every other day and and i can do that and be pretty comfortable about it but i tried the Nautilus machine yes it you do feel kind of goofy but even five minutes makes you feel tired you work harder on that thing   umhum umhum yeah it it appears so i generally use the um the treadmill uh i kind of like it its its mindless you just get on and its a a way to sort of um reach a Karma very quickly you know
