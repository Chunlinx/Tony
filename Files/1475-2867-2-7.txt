                    Background        The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene        BRCA is located at q and encodes a  amino acid        protein Mutations in this gene account for  of        hereditary ovarian cancers     Loss of heterozygosity        in this gene occurs in  of sporadic ovarian        carcinomas     Species homology studies have shown that        while the entire  exon gene is poorly conserved the        terminal ends maintain over an  homology between rat        human and mouse     BRCA has long been known to        function in DNA repair Studies have shown BRCA is        upregulated in cells treated by DNA damaging agents such as        cisplatinum     BRCA has been shown to interact with        DNA repair proteins such as Rad and Rad the tumor        suppressor genes RB and BRCA transcriptional factors RNA        pol II histone deacetylase complex ctIP as well as        influence numerous cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases        contributing to cell cycle regulation                   More recently BRCA has been shown to influence        apoptosis in a p independent manner     This        apoptotic response involved the cjun kinase JNK pathway        though the details of this mechanism remain unclear                   The highly acidic carboxyterminal BRCT region of        BRCA has been suggested to play a role in transactivation            BRCT interacts with BRCA Rad other tumor        suppressing elements as well as numerous transcription        factors such as RNA helicase A and STAT             Recently it has been discovered that truncation of this        region resulted in suppression of apoptosis following        proapoptotic stimuli     Further these studies also        suggested that the BRCT region facilitates apoptotic        functions within the caspase pathway        The amino terminal BRNT of BRCA contains a highly        conserved zinc binding or RING finger domain also involved        in multiple functions within the cell Molecular modeling        has shown that this domain contains two zinc fingerlike        motifs connected through linking C          HC          regions     Naturally occurring        splice variants of the gene suggest at least two        transcription initiation points above and below the coding        region for the RING domain     Truncation studies have        shown that the RING domain may function in direct protein        binding of ER ATF and BARD a ubiquitin ligase              While zinc RING domains are common motifs in        several protein families such as oncoproteins and        regulatory proteins the actual function of the domain        differs among these proteins For example inhibitors of        apoptosis proteins IAPs contain one to three tandem        baculovirus inverted repeat BIR domains as well as a        carboxy terminal RING domain Previous studies have shown        this RING domain essential in the antiapoptotic function        of some IAPs            The most common mode a cell uses to undergo apoptosis is        the cysteineaspartate specific protease caspase pathway        This proteolytic cascade may be triggered by a wide variety        of stimuli and employs numerous initiation routes within        the cell While there is extensive crosstalk between the        caspases the two most common initiator pathways are the        FasFas ligand pathway involving caspase  and caspase         and the mitochondrial pathway triggering caspase              Caspase  a pivotal downstream protease functions in        virtually every caspase pathway and serves as an        executioner in the cells by cleavage of downstream targets        which lead to irreversible chromosomal degradation Perhaps        the most prominent caspase  substrate is DNA Fragmentation        Factor  DFF an inhibitor of caspaseactivated DNase            Following caspase mediated cleavage DFF        releases DFF the DNase responsible for DNA fragmentation        into the characteristic apoptotic DNA ladder Caspase         also deactivates vital DNA repair enzymes such as poly        ribose ADP polymerase PARP     Cleavage of PARP has        been regarded as a hallmark of caspasedependent apoptosis                   No study to date has explored the possible involvement        of the BRCA aminoterminal RING domain in caspasemediated        apoptosis Therefore ovarian surface epithelial cell lines        with and without the delAG BRCA mutation were used to        ascertain whether the RING domain of the aminoterminal        affected apoptosis This mutation common among families        with hereditary ovarian cancer is a frameshift mutation        occurring at the beginning of the C          HC          region of exon  that essentially        interrupts RING domain function       The results        showed that disruption of the BRCA aminoterminal RING        domain altered caspase  activation and subsequent DFF        and PARP cleavage resulting in accelerated STSinduced        apoptosis                    Results                  Loss of BRCA expression resulted in increased cell          death when exposed to  M staurosporine treatment          SV large T antigen transfected ovarian surface          epithelial cell lines from women with and without an          aminoterminal BRCA mutation were employed to ascertain          the function of the aminoterminal RING domain in          apoptosis     To confirm BRCA status in these cell          lines whole cell lysates were western blotted using a          monoclonal antiBRCA antibody against the aminoterminal          Figure  Using the MCF breast carcinoma cell line as          a positive control MCC cells expressed the full length           kDa BRCA protein and were confirmed BRCAwt In          contrast the HIO cells were found to have          significantly reduced levels of full length BRCA than          the wild type cell line confirming the mutated          aminoterminal BRCA BRCA in these cells Due to the          high molecular weight of BRCA actin could not be used          as a loading control Thus the membranes were stained          with  Amido black with the protein front used as a          loading control          Having confirmed the BRCA status of these cell lines          cell viability was then assayed under cytotoxic stress          Cells were treated with  M STS for  h and subjected to          MTS assay at   and  h Figure A Results were          reported as percent growth of respective untreated cells          allowed to grow in serum containing media BRCAwt cells          grew  greater at  h and  greater at  h than          BRCA cells This difference proved to be statistically          significant p   and p   respectively          BRCAwt cells appeared to recover at  h while BRCA          cells continued to decline in growth data not          shown          To confirm that the difference in cell viability was          due to alterations in survival response after STS          treatment and not an intrinsic property of the individual          cell lines growth of both cell lines was examined by MTS          assay under the same conditions in the absence of STS          Figure B Linear regression analysis of cell growth          revealed that the slopes of the BRCAwt cells  and          that of the BRCA cells  were essentially the          same          To ensure the survival difference after STS treatment          seen between the BRCAwt and BRCA cells was associated          with cell death a trypan blue exclusion assay was          conducted Figure C Cells were plated in triplicate          and both adherent and suspended cell populations were          assayed with results reported as percent of total          population dead No appreciable difference was observed          in the amount of death between the cell lines at   or           h   and  respectively There was          however a significantly higher percentage of dead cells          in the BRCA cell line at  h  p   and           h  p                            Aminoterminal BRCA mutation was associated with          elevated caspase  activation following STS          treatment          To investigate the role of aminoterminal of BRCA in          apoptosis the effect of STS was examined on elements of          the caspase pathway Figure  First to determine          whether a mutation in aminoterminal RING domain of BRCA          preferentially targeted either the mitochondrial             or FasFas ligand apoptotic pathway     levels of          the respective initiator caspases  and  were          determined Both cell lines produced activated caspases           and  by  h after treatment with equivalent levels at           h          Next levels of the executioner caspase  were          examined Once more both cell lines produced activated          caspase  by  h after treatment However BRCA cells          showed significantly more active caspase  by  h after          treatment than the wild type To quantify the difference          in caspase activation the immunoblots were scanned and          analyzed via ImagQuant densitometry Table           Densitometric analysis revealed that although BRCA          cells initially had lower levels of caspase  after  h          STS treatment caspase  levels were  higher Levels          of STSinduced caspase  a structural and functional          homolog of caspase     were also evaluated Figure           Procaspase  began to be cleaved at  h of treatment          and was completely processed by  h of treatment in both          BRCA wt and BRCA cells Although caspase  plays a          subsidiary role in DNA fragmentation and apoptosis          morphology     densitometric analysis illustrated          that BRCA cells contained substantially reduced levels          of procaspase  in untreated cells  of that seen in          BRCAwt and during initial STS treatment  of that          seen in BRCAwt at  h          To determine whether elevated levels of cleaved          caspase  resulted in increased cleavage of caspase           substrates DFF cleavage was studied Figure           Degradation of full length DFF was used to indicate          caspase  activity In both cell lines DFF began to          significantly degrade by  h after treatment In BRCAwt          cells the levels of full length DFF were  of          control at  h  of control at  h and  of          control at  h In contrast in BRCA cells full          length DFF was only  of control at  h  of          control at  h and  of control at  h Table                                    Aminoterminal BRCA mutation caused increased          degradation of caspaselinked DNA repair proteins          To ascertain whether increased caspase  activity in          BRCA cells could also affect DNA repair pathways the          DNA repair enzymes PARP a known substrate of caspase              and ERCC a repair protein not dependent on          caspase     were examined Figure  Interestingly          cleavage and inactivation of PARP was noted only at  h          after STS treatment in BRCAwt cells In contrast          accelerated cleavage and inactivation of PARP was seen in          BRCA cells as early as  h after STS treatment Levels          of ERCC were not significantly different between BRCAwt          and BRCA cells                            Discussion        A frameshift mutation in the aminoterminal of the BRCA        gene disrupts the RING domain and all domains after it Our        data showed that a BRCA mutation interrupting the RING        domain altered apoptosis in ovarian surface epithelial        cells While there was no difference in overall growth        between BRCA and BRCAwt cells BRCA cells showed a        marked reduction in survival following STS treatment        Reduced cellular survival in BRCA cells was associated        with increased cell death due to alterations in apoptosis        No difference was detected in the levels of caspase  or        caspase  among the BRCA or BRCAwt cells suggesting        that the reduced cell survival in BRCA cells was not        associated with a difference in initiation of either the        mitochondrial or the FasFasL apoptotic pathways In        contrast STS induced  greater caspase  activity in        BRCA compared to BRCAwt cells The enhanced caspase         activity in BRCA cells was clearly functional and        resulted in increased proteolysis of downstream targets of        caspase  That is we found  less full length DFF at         h and  less at  h in BRCA cells compared with        BRCAwt cells The cleavage and subsequent deactivation of        this caspase dependent DNase inhibitor suggested that        aminoterminal BRCA mutations enhance cellular apoptosis        contributing to poor cell survival        With BRCAs extensive connection to DNA repair already        established     we also examined whether an        aminoterminal BRCA mutation reduced cellular survival by        enhanced caspase dependent cleavage and subsequent        inactivation of the caspase dependent DNA repair enzyme        PARP As with DFF PARP cleavage was significantly        enhanced in BRCA cells suggesting that decreased DNA        repair capacity in BRCA cells may in part be due to        premature inactivation of PARP This pattern was not seen        with ERCC and may be due to the choice of apoptotic        stimulus used While the exact mechanism remains unclear        STS has been shown to initiate caspase driven apoptosis in        a manner distinct from chemotherapeutic agents such as        cisplatinum etoposide and tamoxifen which directly cause        DNA damage and tend to favor ERCC activation                    Previous studies have shown that truncation of the        highly acidic carboxyregion BRCT resulted in resistance to        caspase induced apoptosis     Further this failure of        apoptosis was traced specifically to caspase  and the        FasFasL pathway In contrast our data showed that the        delAG mutation affecting the aminoterminal domain of        BRCA conferred an increased apoptotic response with no        caspase pathway preferentially selected Instead this        aminoterminal mutation favored elevated caspase  levels        that subsequently facilitated enhanced apoptosis by        inactivating the caspasedependent DNA repair proteins PARP        and by inactivating DFF an inhibitor of the        caspasedependent DNase DFF The nature of the delAG        frameshift makes it difficult to determine if the apoptotic        alterations seen are directly caused by the mutation or by        downstream effects of it and certainly deserves further        scrutiny In this way carboxy and aminoterminal BRCA        mutations may target two distinct antiapoptotic pathways        Therefore disruptions in either or both BRCA terminals        effect apoptotic response        In summary our findings suggest a possible novel        mechanism by which the aminoterminal of BRCA suppresses        apoptosis and facilitates DNA repair in human ovarian        surface epithelial cells                    Conclusions        The delAG mutation in the BRCA gene disrupts the        zinc linker region of the aminoterminal RING domain        Disruption of this domain triggered an elevated caspase        dependent apoptotic response and affected downstream        proteins such as DFF and PARP                    Materials and Methods                  Cell Culture          SV large Tantigen transfected
