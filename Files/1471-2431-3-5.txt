                    Background        Breastfeeding is associated with a lower incidence of        infant diarrhoea and respiratory disease particularly in        less developed countries     A recent ecological study        on breastfeeding showed that more than half of all infant        deaths from diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory        infections in Latin America are preventable by exclusive        breastfeeding in infants aged  months and partial        breastfeeding throughout the remainder of infancy            The theoretical basis for this may be a combination of the        nutritional and immunomodulatory effects of human milk            Since  the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding        up to the age of  months World Health Assembly Resolution         based largely on work later published by Kramer and        Kakuma            In Bolivia the exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants        under  months of age has been found to be above  with         of infants still being exclusively breastfed when         months old     In contrast a later study in Bolivia        found that no infants were exclusively breastfed at         months of age even if practically all were breastfed at         months     Infant nutrition in Bolivia andor infant        and maternal health have been the topic of several studies                but none has focused on determinants of        breastfeeding        The main objective of the present study was to describe        the breastfeeding pattern in a sample of Bolivian infants        as well as the determinants of breastfeeding including        socioeconomic religious and ethnic background Such data        on socioeconomic determinants are seemingly lacking but        have elsewhere been proven important              Reported breastfeeding duration was also compared with        how Bolivian women thought infants should be breastfed To        the authors knowledge no such comparison has yet been        made and the notion that the actual and the desired        durations of exclusive breastfeeding differ has not been        substantiated At the time of the study the recommended        duration of exclusive breastfeeding was four to six months                               Methods                  Study area          This study took place in La Paz Bolivia The          interviews were conducted during a week period in July          through September  at four of the La PazEl Alto          hospitals Del Nino Number of infants    de          Octubre n   San Gabriel n   and Obrero n            The Del Nino hospital was selected to contribute the          majority of infants as it was the main paediatric          hospital in La Paz At the time of the interviews there          were ten hospitals in La PazEl Alto a number of these          did however cater mainly to adults The children at the          Del Nino represented all social and ethnic groups while          the  de Octubre catered mainly to a native lower          social class population Residents of the San Gabriel and          Obrero hospital catchment areas were more welltodo than          the rest of the population All mothers visiting one of          these hospitals on days when the author was present at          the particular hospital were asked to participate in the          study          The sample of infants in this study n            constituted about  of all infants aged one year or          younger who lived in the city of La Paz and El Alto in           n           According to data          from the Bolivian Institute of Statistics the total          numbers of children under five years of age who visited          the respective hospitals in  were Del Nino            San Gabriel   and  De Octubre       No          data were available for Obrero hospital The interviews          were conducted in waiting halls consultant rooms and in          the maternity wards                          Study population          Inclusion criteria were Bolivian mothers with a child          aged   year who came from the La Paz urban area or the          villages within a fourhour bus ride from the city No          exclusion criteria were applied The basis for the          selection criterion of within a fourhour bus ride was          that the three communities of Copacabana Sorata and          Coroico were all within a fourhour bus ride from La Paz          Both mothers of well children and of sick children were          interviewed The presence of illness in the child was not          recorded in the questionnaire Out of  mothers           agreed to participate The  who declined to participate          did so mainly because they did not speak Spanish The          interviewed mothers were between  and  years of age          n   mean    SD years and a total of           were teenagers Practically all the mothers were urban          dwellers and the majority  were Catholic Table           Just over half were native women and the rest were of          Latin origin In this study Latin ethnicity means          largely of European ancestry while native ethnicity          refers to those of indigenous origin A number of women          were of mixed origin they were nevertheless classified          as either Latin or Native Compared to women of native          origin Latin women more often had five years of          education  vs  p   and were          literate  vs  p   However gainful          employment Latin  vs native  p   and          urban origin Latin  vs

interviews were conducted using a structured          questionnaire All subjects were interviewed in Spanish          by the author No interpreter was used          Some interviews were interrupted by the consulting          doctor and therefore some of the questionnaires were not          fully completed All the socioeconomic data are based on          at least  of the  respondents except for ethnicity          n   and social class n   The numbers in each          calculation may be smaller than  because of missing          values in other categories The following number of          motherinfant pairs were analysed in the univariate          analyses prelacteal feeds and colostrum n            motherinfant pairs perception of optimal breastfeeding          duration n   number of breastfeeds per           hours n   and nighttime breastfeeding          frequency n   Univariate statistics for          breastfeeding patterns in           previous infants were based on           motherinfant pairs or  children some mothers had          more than one previous child                          Definitions          Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as not giving          anything other than breast milk at the time of the          interview In this definition of exclusive breastfeeding          the maximum allowable intake of nonbreast milk fluid in          the past week was set at  cucharillas teaspoons or           cuchara larger spoon or  fluid ounce Except for          this amount of fluid and for prelacteal feed the absence          of previous complementary foods or supplementary fluids          totalling more than the above weekly amount since birth          was demanded as proof of exclusive breastfeeding In          those cases where the weekly intake of foodfluid could          not be specified the end of exclusive breastfeeding was          set at the date of introduction of the foodfluid in          question The provision of vitamins did not preclude          exclusive breastfeeding Hence the definition of          exclusive breastfeeding used in this study differs from          that suggested by Labbok et al     In all analyses          of exclusive breastfeeding in the current paper a since          birth perspective has been used Any breastfeeding          included exclusive predominant and partial breastfeeding                       Colostrum was defined as the breast milk produced in          the first five days after delivery prelacteal feed as          foodliquid given to the infant before initiating          breastfeeding for the first time and nighttime feeding          as feeds between  pm and  am The mothers were          asked how many times they had breastfed their child over          a hour period during the last week before the          interview an average number was recorded When defining          a breastfeed no minimal duration was required However          at least  minutes did have to elapse between two feeds          for them to be considered as separate feeds Ondemand          feeding was defined as the mother breastfeeding solely          according to the needs of the infant                          Ethics          The study design was presented to the directors of the          four hospitals who were also briefed on the contents and          objectives of the study after which permission to carry          out the study was granted All women who took part in the          study gave their informed consent                          Statistical analyses                      Univariate analyses            Continuous variables were plotted against a normal            distribution curve With the exception of number of            breastfeeds per  hours and number of breastfeeds            during the nighttime all continuous variables were            deemed normally distributed normal distribution in the            two nonparametric variables was also rejected using            the KolmogorovSmirnov sample test     Normally            distributed variables were tested using Students            ttest or ANOVA Proportions were compared using the            Pearson Chisquare test Determinants of breastfeeding            frequency were analysed using the MannWhitney Utest            or the KruskalWallis test pvalues corrected for ties            are presented KaplanMeier curves were used to            establish the median duration of exclusive            breastfeeding                                    Multivariate analyses            The following main outcome measures and dependent            variables were analysed using regression analyses use            of prelacteal feed intake of colostrum exclusive            breastfeeding duration duration of any breastfeeding            in the previous child ondemand feeding and desired            exclusive breastfeeding duration The aim was to            identify environmental and socioeconomic factors of            importance to the dependent variables            For that purpose multiple linear regression was            used to analyse continuous variables logistic            regression was used for proportions and Coxs            regression for the duration of exclusive breastfeeding                The number of censored observations is given            in the text or in Figure             KaplanMeier curves were also used to evaluate the            relationship between exclusive breastfeeding duration            and socioeconomic determinants since Coxs regression            may fail to detect clinically important but            statistically insignificant relationships                Coxs regression and KaplanMeier curves are so            called survival analyses Survival analyses are often            used when the variable of interest is the length of            time that elapses before a certain event occurs This            event may be death but it may also be the end of a            particular condition In the current paper            introduction of complementary feeding terminated            exclusive breastfeeding and is therefore regarded as            death Data on exclusive breastfeeding duration in            children who had already been introduced to            complementary foodsfluids at the time of the interview            were classified as uncensored as opposed to censored            data in children who were still exclusively            breastfed            A             backward stepwise mode was used            in order to avoid dropping nonsignificant variables            that affected the model fitness In no analysis did the            number of independent variables exceed n variables            according to recommendations by Altman                                    Independent variables            Univariate analyses were carried out against the            following variables sex of the infant hospital age            of

       upper class mothers Mothers who were cohabiting or            were married were collapsed into one category before            comparisons were made with single mothers in the

authors knowledge the present study is the          first to examine socioeconomic and biological          determinants of the breastfeeding pattern in Bolivia It          also presents data on the diurnal breastfeeding pattern          in a less developed country and links actual          breastfeeding behaviour with that perceived by the mother          as optimal for the infant The use of only one          interviewer increased the consistency of interview          management and interpretation of the mothers          answers          In the current study the definition of exclusive          breastfeeding allowed for prelacteal feed Prelacteal          feed was not an exclusion criterion in the WHO definition          of exclusive breastfeeding at the time in which the          absence of food other than breast milk drops and syrups          is required during the  hours preceding the enquiry          page           httpwwwwhointchildadolescenthealthNewPublicationsNUTRITIONwhocddserPDF          With that exception the rate of exclusive breastfeeding          in this study was based on information on the current          status and the absence of complementary foods including          milks and other fluids at any time prior to the present          interview It has recently been shown that data based on          current status differ from data based on daily records of          feeding     and that longterm recall provides lower          estimates of the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in          infants under  months of age when compared to one h          recall in crosssectional studies such as Demographic and          Health Surveys     Different recall methods may be          one reason why the data in this study differ from those          of McCann et al      with lower rates of exclusive          breastfeeding among infants below  months of age in the          present study than in theirs  vs  Moreover          most of the infants in this study were of urban origin          This also restricts the possibility of extrapolating the          descriptive findings to populations where many          inhabitants live in the rural areas although data on          exclusive breastfeeding from the present study correlate          well with data from the whole of Bolivia data from

obtained in different          years          This is a crosssectional and retrospective study          hence no conclusions should be drawn regarding causal          relationships Nevertheless some of the findings in this          study such as the negative association between use of          prelacteal feeds and duration of exclusive breastfeeding          merit further research and if verified they could have          important implications          One possible drawback to the study is that both          healthy and sick infants were included There are no data          on whether the infants in this study visited one of the          study hospitals in order to receive an immunisation to          attend the wellbaby clinic or to seek assistance due to          illness Although vaccination coverage was around  in          Bolivia in the mids and only some  of infants in          urban areas never received any vaccinations              there is a risk that the reasons for some visits were          associated with their feeding pattern     The risk          of bias may be especially great among the older infants          who may have more frequently been brought to the hospital          because of illness and thus for example were possibly          less likely to be breastfed Many of the younger          infants were still exclusively breastfed at the time of          interview That was not the case for older infants This          could increase the risk of bias since the values entered          in Coxs regression of actual exclusive breastfeeding          duration were more often censored in younger infants than          in older infants More importantly this sample may not          accurately reflect the situation in La Paz as a whole          because it excluded mothers who did not bring their          children to the clinics Illness in the child may also          have worried the mother That could have affected the          reliability of her answers          A number of interviews were interrupted This caused          incomplete data sets For that reason crude data and          actual numbers have to a large extent been presented in          the present article Interviews were interrupted at all          hospitals and in all social classes and hence there is          little reason to believe that the interruptions would          have caused any of the observed associations it may          rather be the case that they blurred the results          This is an exploratory study where results are data          driven rather than conceptually driven The purpose of          the current study was to explore possible determinants of          breastfeeding duration and to do that the stepwise          backward regression approach was deemed appropriate Due          to the large number of tests there is a risk that some          statistical significance particularly those close to p            are due to random error rather than representing          true findings                          Main findings          The rate of exclusive breastfeeding was initially very          high but then declined rapidly during the second month          This is reminiscent of similar patterns seen in Mexico          Brazil and Honduras     The radical decline is most          unfortunate keeping in mind that the WHO recently          decided to change the recommended duration of exclusive          breastfeeding from  months to  months              In contrast the rate of any breastfeeding was very          high in infants under  year of age and in no age          subgroup was it below  This is a very high level          compared with reports from Mexico    and          neighbouring Brazil     but it is in line with the          high prevalence of any breastfeeding at  months in the          Simondon et al study from Bolivia     and data from          the Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry  out of           La Paz women had breastfed their last child              In the present study there was no correlation between          a range of socioeconomic and cultural factors and the          duration of any breastfeeding in the previous child One          reason for this may be that the rates of any          breastfeeding are equally high in women from all          socioeconomic strata in the study area These findings          are in contrast to reports from other parts of the world          indicating a significant correlation between          breastfeeding duration and socioeconomic conditions                Alternative explanations may be the moderate          sample size in the current study or lack of accuracy in          recalled duration of any breastfeeding There is also a          risk that the assessment used in the current study does          not mirror the actual economic situation of the          household          Consumption of prelacteal feeds was strongly inversely          related to the duration of exclusive breastfeeding These          findings confirm the report of PerezEscamilla et al              where both milkbased prelacteal feeds and prelacteal          water were negatively associated with exclusive          breastfeeding OR   and  respectively Similar          data have also been presented for Mexico     The          linkage between prelacteal feeds and short duration of          exclusive breastfeeding has strong implications In the          present study a relatively small percentage of the          infants had been given prelacteal feeds compared with the          results obtained for rural Bolivia by McCann and Bender              One reason for this discrepancy may be the          rather restrictive definition of prelacteal feed used in          the present study Whether prelacteal feeds are given          before the very first breastfeed or between the second          and third breastfeed is probably irrelevant regarding its          impact on infant feeding patterns It is however          evident that more knowledge is needed regarding the          circumstances surrounding the use of prelacteal feeds          The problem of prelacteal feeds must be confronted          The discrepancy between actual exclusive breastfeeding          behaviour and the perception of how long the infant          should be exclusively breastfed is striking Regardless          of the underlying mechanisms this discrepancy indicates          a potential for increasing the rates of exclusive          breastfeeding once the mothers underlying beliefs in          this regard have been systematically elucidated To the          authors knowledge this issue has not been studied          previously Active promotion of breastfeeding may          increase both any and exclusive breastfeeding rates with          resulting effects on the risk of diarrhoea among other          things     The author believes that efforts to          inform expectant and breastfeeding mothers are important          means for improving infant health both in Bolivia and          elsewhere It has recently been shown that extra          professional support is beneficial for both any          breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding     All          such strategies should also include the discouragement of          prelacteal feeds without this action being culturally          offensive and encouragement to feed infants          colostrum                            Conclusions        The present study showed a rapid decrease in exclusive        breastfeeding rates in Bolivian infants during the first        months of life There was also a discrepancy between the        actual and the desired duration of exclusive breastfeeding        Both avoidance of prelacteal feeding and use of colostrum        seem to be associated with improved breastfeeding patterns        This is however a crosssectional and retrospective study        with a risk of recall bias Prospective studies are needed        to confirm the results of this study                    List of abbreviations used        CI  Confidence interval        OR  Odds ratio
