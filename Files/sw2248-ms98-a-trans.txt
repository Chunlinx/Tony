        all right now we used to be big time campers but now were not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports     uhhuh what type of camping did you do   well  when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know we we went like twenty or thirty at a time we took uh just our little tents   uhhuh uhhuh   and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way   oh uhhuh oh how neat   so weve always enjoyed camping   uhhuh well i know i have um i just have a tent and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent and then i bought a van and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable   uhhuh yes yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times theyll just sleep in the van you know   uhhuh right   like one night and the next night theyll stay at the motel you know or something like that and they enjoy it   yeah uhhuh yes i dont i dont think im a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping all the bugs and stuff  but i i try   oh yeah oh me either  i hate to be on any that stuff   but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy   oh yeah oh   and its all over him the poor thing you know so theres definitely hazards to going camping if you dont know what youre looking at   yes yes   oh shoot   oh but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean its not something id want to do real often im a sissy i either want to do it in the fall or spring you know   uhhuh yeah right right definitely when its cool well have you done much camping around Texas   yes well not really because usually its when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so its usually like that   uhhuh uhhuh yeah well have you camped all over the United States   just about   wow see now i havent so that i bet you thats an experience there   just about oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family   uhhuh uhhuh right right   its a lot easier then   well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh theyve been going to Gulf Shores Alabama   oh uhhuh   and uh which is really really neat they said theyve got the white beaches and the sand and its not real populated so they can they feel like theyre in the outdoors and still close to the ocean and uh from what i understand from them its really really pretty there   yes uhhuh oh id like to go anywhere you know i just like to go   uhhuh uhhuh   i really do   well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains   no not really not that much um weve been well weve been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that but usually if were with a group of people we really dont stay any one place very long   uhhuh   you know like if were just going through and they camp one night and then head on   right right   but now that we have children and we go every blue moon id rather just go to Galveston   yeah oh yeah yeah yeah rent a beach house or something yeah thats thats my idea of camping   you know yes yes yes   but were uh were getting more into it and weve done uh weve done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so thats good you know theyre theyre becoming enthusiasts then of camping   uhhuh uhhuh it is my children really enjoys it they really do but by the time we really get a chance to its July you know and its so hot   right uhhuh uhhuh   and our camper does doesnt have an air conditioner   oh yeah   yeah its one of those popups im sure you could put one in probably but we hadnt did that   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah well thats really neat   yes we all enjoy camping and theyre you know theyre in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also   well uhhuh uhhuh   at least their daddy goes with them i dont when they do that but   yeah yeah oh thats neat thats really neat   that really is well how old is your boys your children   well i well i have um a son thats uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter thats thirteen   uhhuh   so theyre theyre getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too   oh yes yeah yes   and thats thats really neat   it really is mines eleven and eight   uhhuh   so they really enjoy it too   yeah yeah yeah i i agree with you they like to get out there and but this wasnt so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there and he didnt realize he was touching poison ivy and it got all into his eye and it was really swollen and uh so they had to give him shots and everything so oh well maybe next time hell stay away from those particular   yeah       yeah yes yes   trees or what bushes whatever they are   oh but i have uh brotherinlaw and a sister you know that just really just camp you know they love to go camping they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because theres nothing holding them back but im just not that involved in it   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh no now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season uh and and i just couldnt do that you know   yeah oh uhhuh me i havent really as far as entertainment i dont know what you would do if   yeah yeah   you know but i guess my entertainments television i guess   just getting away yeah right right see i see they just want to get away   uhhuh   but every Friday night theyll go home you know straight from work and theyll pack up and you know and then theyll leave and im just going you know by Friday night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so   oh i dont either uhhuh   but anyway thats their life   yes but they probably live in a city also dont they   yeah yeah thats true   well see were in a real small county area and you know that makes a big difference   uhhuh now thats true thats true   because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know   yeah  thats true   that makes a difference   well it was nice talking with you okay   it was nice talking to you too and well probably be talking to you again okay okay byebye   okay well take care byebye
