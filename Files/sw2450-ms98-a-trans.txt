                 so what kind of weather have you had in Dallas   well its been very windy and its uh probably unseasonably hot for time right now   really yeah see i didnt i dont i thought my uh i thought i live in Euless and i thought it was pretty normal but anyway but i guess youre right though it has been real hot because it um  ive had to use the air conditioner in March and that is pretty usual   yeah weve already had to use that and weve had like i meant this is probably typical though uh with like tornado weather and tornado warnings and um   uhhuh   so uh you know i i forget from year to year im getting too old but the um       it it the the the winds blowing very hard but i guess uh you know were just out of March and uh will bring the rain in April   yeah   yeah i know  the trees are real pretty right now and everything and uh i dont know i know the pollen is real high but i think its higher than usual isnt it   yes it is seems very high it hasnt bothered me but i know the people that have allergies it seems to be a pretty high   yeah i know its been bothering me a lot but yeah i think normally i think the weather overall has been um probably like you said probably a little bit warm and  so   a little bit warm and a little bit uh blowy i think   anyway so we basically live in the same area so its real hard to   really hard to make too big of uh different comparisons right yeah     i know i just think its been warm and its been hot and i like it and its beautiful and all the trees are pretty and i wish it would stay like this all the time   yes i could stand this all summer   so yeah i could too and uh gah i dont think we can say anything else really   i dont think we can either lets cut off   yeah that sounds like a good deal well you have a nice day and well talk to you later bye   you too byebye
