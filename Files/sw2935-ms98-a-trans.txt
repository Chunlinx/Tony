                well what kind of garden do you have   well weve tried having let me turn the TV off weve tried having uh vegetable garden and im from Chicago and the way that uh bug bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago       and we have tried several years in a row and weve given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer and we just kind of uh       decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden   oh   we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought whod want to eat that stuff   umhum umhum   you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly   umhum do you have a lawn   so right now were just yeah we we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now and the trees  we have a peach tree thats the extent of our um contributing to our food supply       but thats nice to have but yeah yeah so what do you do up there   oh yeah well um actually  it weve sort of had an ideal Spring   um   and um the the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks and the grass is uh this lush green and of course ive got lots of weeds in mine because i dont use any poison either   oh wow yeah   but um you know i just keep looking at and i say jeez you know this is the first year its been so perfect   really gosh   but and my garden you know  my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall   oh boy   the plants and   that sounds wonderful   you know im going im going gee this cant you know well have a freeze   if you dont have a frost youll be all right         thats what i remember from living up north is that youd get everything set and then youd have a frost and half the stuff would get frostbitten and youd have to   well thats it last year i think it was you know my peonies were were budding in January and you know there was no way that was going to make it and sure enough you know we did had really mild weather until   wow uhhuh   i think it was May or something and then you know everything just got hit hard   oh boy thats frustrating     so but yeah it its interesting and i enjoy gardening my son does the mowing of the grass   oh yeah my husband does that thank goodness because i thats not a pleasure for me   i dont think thats a pleasure for anybody the mowing the mowing       i love gardens that are well tended and i just theres been a few different places ive lived where ive just i dont know whether its little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long and uh i i was in England once and thats one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be three feet by four feet or something   umhum   so i do admire that but i havent really put uh too much energy into it course we have two little kids       are two and three years old so   oh they help you   so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry ill tell you   oh dear       oh but thats nice you know i mean the peach tree is is a start and   that yeah thats really lovely i would love to have different fruit trees its its been wonderful to have the peaches theyre just delicious and we we have we have still have to spray some but we dont have to just asphyxiate asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because i just i cant see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards   right what about tomatoes arent they pretty hardy   um weve tried them but again its just like the sun scorch weve tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the sun i mean its just   oh   see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation   umhum oh   and installed that and um thats really what makes the most sense because you dont have to use so much water and   umhum   it really does the job but its just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here       and if youre not really committed to it i mean me im you know im real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week and then i go oh yeah i need to do something and by then its burned up you know   uhhuh   its just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older ill find uh some joy in that   well i would assume assume too i mean youve got three or four months youre talking about of     yeah   of bad weather   yeah it just gets so hot so fast here we dont have really a Spring or a Fall and it just um   umhum   immediately heats up so thats one thing i miss about living up north as i remember um you know the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather you know it was really nice   umhum   we always had gardens when i was uh living in Chicago in fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard         and redid it ill never forget got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him       they remodeled the entire back yard then they sold the house and got divorced so i dont know what that says about it all   oh dear     oh but she used to love to do stuff like that   sounds like it would have been pretty   yeah it really was i enjoyed it there but maybe when the boys get a little older well do some more planting because they like to see things grow theyve done a couple of little seed projects and so i think it will be fun for them   oh sure   yeah yeah   sure well it sounds like you youve got your hands full   oh yes  theyre both running around now     and you know gardening isnt isnt high on the list but its not off the list   yeah well its very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know   umhum   they certainly enjoy that part of it       its just trying to keep anything i planted bulbs last uh Fall on the side guard and when i went out there in the Spring and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk   oh   he thought what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with       we use to didnt eat them i mean i guess i could be thankful for that   right maybe next year theyll do better     yeah really if they survive this year     oh dear   oh well good luck to you nice talking to you   okay well thanks it was nice talking to you too byebye   okay byebye
