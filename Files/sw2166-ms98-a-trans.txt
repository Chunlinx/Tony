            so what kind of eating out do you like   oh preferably Mexican food or seafood   yeah i i like seafood or Chinese or especially Mongolian weve got a real nice little Mongolian restaurant here yeah i go out there probably once a week its not bad you know   oh really hum wow   you have to find out the right things to get so you get the most for your money but the the two meat the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a pretty good deal   yeah yeah oh yeah we uh we havent found a whole you know the are the best Mexican food weve found is back in Houston   naturally   and uh same goes for the seafood of course to theres not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere   yeah no   but uh you know i think our luxury here is Red Lobster and uh but back home theres you know different places  family owned seafood restaurants   oh yeah do you do yeah do you have a Steak do you have a Steak and Ale there   uh not close about an hour away in Waco theres the closest one   um i havent been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good   yeah uh its been a while since ive been there i was always jumped on the steak whenever i went there   yeah   instead of the seafood   yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks   yeah yeah   uhhuh and now that im full time poor student uh i got to watch the pennies  consequently thats why you go out to Mongolian all the time   yeah oh so no i i pretty you know Mexican food or or seafood pretty much i could probably live on that   yeah i havent found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere i im at i usually do all my own Mexican food i my im partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere ive had out so   oh there you go   and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way   yeah yeah right right well what do you like about your your Chinese food place there that makes you keep going back   and places place uh basically the food and the price i its sort its set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the uh grill   uhhuh   and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that   oh   all the uh all the staff are uh are uh either Koreans or uh or Thais and they cant speak English very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain uh some things to them but if you can get past that its okay the food is really good   oh yeah   i dont know i to me thats the thing that you got to have if the food is bad youre obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again   right   course a yeah yeah i mean its its not worth the hassle just for the good food theres plenty of places that have good food   yeah uh right yeah um theres theres a couple places around here that well go back to now and again um   one being a a Chinese food place and and another one being another Mexican food place and and it it just seems that if the if the help is is good and theyre like theyre supposed to be that you know youre youre tempted to give the food a second try but not the people for some reason   uhhuh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebodys rude to me or   excuse me somebodys rude or something like that i wont go back i dont care how good the food was   yeah   but generally i i the places ive been where ive had trouble with the help generally the food hasnt been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem   yeah yeah   uh well gosh now what  i guess its been about five minutes   now what lets see how long do you eat do you go out once a week   i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to Charlotte and uh see my my excollege buddy down there and uh we go out running around down there and theres some pretty good places down there to eat   yeah   but weve got a uh family theres a family restaurant here i dont know if theyre over in Texas yet i know theyre in Louisiana its called Ryans um its a its a good restaurant they uh they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or   hum   uh just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and theyve just got tons of stuff and its really cheap one person for about its about six bucks and its all you can eat   uhhuh wow   and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because its serve yourself cant complain too much they they they have people come around and uh   yeah right so you cant complain about that really   deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they dont they dont bother you so its a pretty good place i bet you dont have those over there   i dont think so i havent heard of it   we have uh theres two of them in Charlotte and weve been to both of them and theyre both terrible it was it was i was amazed because ive been in a lot of Ryans in Alabama and Georgia   oh no   and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible   oh     and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte       yeah we we figured this is probably the best one but uh its its a pretty neat chain because they they dont take out loans for anything they   made you reconsider hm oh   when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door theyre making money immediately its its a smart operation   hum right well thats a good way to go about it yeah theres theres kind of a a little place set up like that i know that theyve got one in Austin and San Antonio and one in uh Houston its called You Are Cook       and thats exactly what you are and it a it turned out its a cattle rancher who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle so its an ongoing circle   uhhuh   you know and you uh you get your all your salad and everything for your salad is at one part of the restaurant and then everything for a baked potato and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section and then right smack in the middle is these three huge grills that they have set up for the p eople to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is and theyre just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive just massive i think the smallest the smallest they have is   umhum yeah um     uh i think a nine ounce filet i mean just were taking taking doggy bags home every time we go and its its its like twelve dollars a person but you are youre getting three or four meals out of it by the time you take it home   i would yeah exactly and and you and you cook it yourself   yeah you take it up to the grill and you flip it or or theyll cook it theyll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you   gosh thats half the fun cooking it yourself   yeah its really a lot of fun because they get up there and   well thats thats an interesting sounding place   yeah season it and throw it on the grill and and you know sit around and and just talk while its cooking and some people go back and eat their salads and leave it there most people stay up there so they get to take their own steak back to their table but uh its really neat i never thought it would go over much because nobody you know i dont want to cook my own dinner i want to go out and you know pay for it but its really a its really a neat phenomena how it all works out   yeah yeah   yeah that sounds pretty neat itd be worth giving a try   yeah yeah if youre ever in or around the area do give it a try because its really good food   thats pretty interesting ive never heard of anything like that   yeah im not sure where all you know hes Texas bound obviously because i havent heard him go any farther than those three cities but that its its really neat too so   yeah huh thats a unique idea i guess i guess thats part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea   yeah yeah yeah and its its and i and you know the fact that its his own cattle its just an ongoing   yeah he he surely doesnt have to worry about supply   right right   thats a pretty good idea huh maybe ill start a restaurant now   so yeah yeah you got all these tips     i dont know if i trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything though       probably burn the place down   oh yeah i bet you cant get find Mexican food over there i had always wondered what id do if i lived somewhere other than Texas   well come to think ive never even seen a Mexican here we got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis but  gosh   oh well hum   oh well well i guess that about does it on the fast food circuit doesnt it   i guess so     some of the subjects i tell you     yeah well theyve theyve been a lot worse   yeah right it was good talking to you Jackie you have a good night um byebye   you too Dave you too byebye
