                    Background        The mouse is rapidly becoming the primary model for        exploration of genetic influence on human biology However        in order to make best use of the information now available        from the sequenced genome phenotypic information is        needed This is also the case in taste where two novel        families of G proteincoupled receptors TRs and TRs        recently have been described in both mice and human taste        bud cells                  Each of these receptor families has been linked to one        of the human taste qualities in such a way that the three        members of the TR family are connected to sweet taste        whereas the much larger TR family also labeled TRB is        associated with bitter taste The demonstration of two        nonoverlapping sets of TR and TR expressing cells in        mice suggests that sweet or bitter tastes might be encoded        by activation of different subsets of taste receptor cells        TRCs within the same taste bud            There are regional differences in expression of the        taste receptors on the tongue     as well as in        responsiveness of CT and NG to stimuli of different taste        qualities In mice QHCl elicited larger responses in the NG        than in the CT while the responses to sucrose and saccharin        were larger in the CT than in the NG       However        it is not really known if the above applies to all sweet or        bitter compounds in the CBLJ mice Previous recordings        in CT and NG nerves have been limited to  bitter orand        sweet compounds All other studies have presented        recordings from either the CT or the NG nerves and to a        limited number of compounds           The        purpose of this study is to characterize and compare the        responses to a wide array of taste stimuli in the whole CT        and NG nerves under the same recording circumstances which        in several experiments meant that we recorded from both        nerves in the same mouse Such information is presently        scarce or missing                    Results                  Sweeteners          Figures and show responses to sweet stimuli in the          CT and NG All sweeteners elicited statistically          significant responses in both nerves except for NC          and cyanosuosan in the NG This may be interpreted as a          lack of response to these last compounds However they          gave an NG response in two out of  mice The graphs show          further that for many sweeteners the responses were          larger in the CT than in the NG Thus for cyanosuosan          fructose NC Dphenylalanine and sucrose at all          concentrations both the integrated response and the          maximum amplitude were significantly larger in the CT          than in the NG For acesulfameK Lproline saccharin          and SC however the difference was not          significant                          Bitter stimuli          Figures and show responses to bitter compounds          Based on the responses in the two nerves the stimuli can          be divided into four groups Compounds comprising the          first group cycloheximide denatonium benzoate and PROP          elicited strong responses in the NG and no significant          responses in the CT This was true both for integrated          response and maximum amplitude However as seen in Fig            mM denatonium and  mM PROP elicited a small          phasic response in the CT in the mouse MOF          The second group amiloride atropine and TEA          stimulated both nerves but the integrated response in          the NG was significantly larger than in the CT          The third group included compounds whose responses did          not differ significantly in the two taste nerves Several          stimuli such as brucine chloroquine quinacrine QHCl          sparteine and strychnine known to be very bitter to          humans were included in this group          In the fourth group the relationship between the CT          and NG responses to magnesium sulphate and          Lphenylalanine depended on the parameter chosen          integrated response or maximum amplitude Caffeine          represents a special case While it elicited a very small          response in the NG activity in the CT was inhibited As          a result the integrated response in the NG was          significantly larger than in the CT Naringine and          yohimbine did not elicit significant responses                          Salts acids and umami compounds          Figures and show that salts acids and umami          compounds elicited strong responses in both nerves There          were however differences between the CT and NG In the          CT  mM NaCl elicited a strong phasic response which          quickly returned to the level of spontaneous activity          while in the NG it elicited both a phasic and a small          tonic response See Fig  Thus the integrated          response to  mM NaCl over  seconds of stimulation          was significantly larger in the NG than in CT          Although the integrated responses to NHCl did not          differ between the two nerves the phasic component was          more pronounced in the CT than in the NG Fig  and          therefore the maximum amplitude was significantly larger          in the CT than in NG          The two umami compounds monosodium glutamate MSG          and disodium inosinate IMP performed differently          While MSG elicited a response that resembled that of          NaCl with a phasic CT response and a tonic NG response          Fig  IMP gave significantly larger both phasic and          tonic responses in the CT than in the NG          Finally the responses to citric and nicotinic acids          demonstrated very similar response profiles in the two          nerves with sharp onset and strong tonic responses over          the stimulation                            Discussion        As mentioned in the introduction sweet and bitter        tastes are presently the focus for a number of studies        using CBLJ mice with the intent to understand the        molecular mechanisms of taste by combining genetic changes        with phenotypical observations The identification of        intracellular transduction mechanisms such as gustducin            and more recently the sweet TR and bitter TR        receptor families       offer great possibilities to        further our understanding of taste However it is evident        that parallel information on how the normal CBLJ mouse        tastes sweet and bitter compounds is needed to fully        utilize these possibilities For example without the        information that aspartame has no taste or that SC        and its analog NC compound GA and GA in     are        very attractive to CBLJ mice it is impossible to use        these compounds as ligands to assess the impact of a        genetic manipulation for sweet and bitter taste It is        against this background we undertook this study to provide        basic data on the taste of a number of bitter and sweet        compounds with potential use as representatives of sweet        and bitter ligands for genetic and molecular biology        studies        In the following we will discuss distribution of sweet        and bitter tastes in the two nerves the choice of the        compounds used and two methodological questions how we        measure taste nerve responses and should the responses be        expressed in some kind of a standard for example as a        percentage of the response to NHCl        The results presented above show that generally sweet        compounds gave the larger response in the CT while the        response to bitter compounds was larger in the NG This is        summarized in Fig  which shows the overall difference        between the CT and NG responses for most of the compounds        used in this study To generate Fig  we subtracted the        integrated responses in the NG from the CT responses In        cases where several concentrations were used we averaged        the responses over several concentrations The values for        all bitter compounds were negative which means that        integrated responses in the NG were larger than in the CT        In contrast for all sweeteners besides saccharin the        values were positive which means that integrated responses        in the CT were larger than in the NG This graph        therefore shows the overall trend without showing whether        the differences were statistically significant In regard        to saccharin the response in the NG was larger than in the        CT at high concentration  mM but not at the lower        concentrations  or  mM These data correlate with        behavioral experiments in CBLJ mice They preferred        saccharin at concentrations up to  mM and rejected        saccharin at higher concentrations     In humans a        high concentration of saccharin has a pronounced bitter and        sweet taste This may also be the case in mice Together        these might indicate that saccharin stimulates both sweet        and bitter receptors but that the affinity to TRs is much        lower Thus the bitter component of saccharin can be        seen only at high concentrations and is reflected in a more        prominent NG response        Previously in all strains tested LP BDP DBA RF        BALB SlcICR SWR bitter compounds quinine        hydrochloride or sulfate or sucrose octaacetate only in        SWR strain elicited larger responses in the NG than in        the CT           In contrast responses to        sucrose and saccharin were larger in the CT than in the NG        These authors concluded that the response to sweet        compounds dominates the front of the tongue while bitter        taste is prevalent on the back However in these        electrophysiological studies only  bitter or sweet        compounds were tested Here we present a study of the CT        and NG responses to  bitter and  sweet compounds and        found a similar distribution of sensitivities in the two        major taste nerves This probably reflects the distribution        of the taste transduction mechanisms in the mouse        tongue        The distribution of the responses to bitter and sweet        stimuli in the nerves resembles the results observed also        in some other species In rhesus monkeys we found a larger        proportion of Q fibers than S fibers in the NG while the        CT contained a larger proportion of S fibers than Q fibers            Similar regional differences in taste sensitivity        or cluster distribution between the back and anterior parts        of the tongue have been documented in rat hamster and pig                       In the past such topographical distribution of different        taste qualities was interpreted in a way that the CT was        considered to play the more important role in sweet taste        while the NG in bitter taste However the size of        electrophysiological responses does not necessarily reveal        the relative importance of the taste nerves in        tastemediated behavior Recent behavioral experiments in        rats stress the prominence of the CT over the NG for the        bitter taste       We have found that mice with        bilateral CT cut have a significantly impaired ability to        discriminate water from the bitter stimulus denatonium        benzoate in two bottle preference TBP tests while mice        with bilateral NG cut showed no difference from the sham        surgery group own unpublished observations This suggests        that a small phasic response in the CT to denatonium        benzoate might be at least as important as the large NG        response for the decisions to be made in TBP tests        The choice of compounds Table  was based on a        combination of human taste experiences behavioral and        electrophysiological experiments in CBLJ mice and        molecular data The sweeteners we used here are preferred        by mice in TBP        own unpublished data on        NC and cyanosuosan Similarly behavioral data showed        that the compounds we characterize as bitter were shunned        by mice          own unpublished data on        sparteine chloroquine and TEA Additionally fructose        glucose Dphenylalanine Lproline saccharin sucrose and        Dtryptophan crossgeneralized in conditioned taste        aversion experiments     These results suggest that        these compounds taste similar to CBLJ mice        Furthermore recordings from single CT fibers in CBLJ        followed by hierarchical cluster analysis have revealed a        narrowly tuned cluster of sweet fibers predominantly        responding to fructose glucose Dphenylalanine        saccharin sucrose and Dtryptophan             Finally recent molecular data suggest that the        compounds we assumed were sweet or bitter have a taste        consistent with this conclusion Rat TRTR recognized        sweettasting molecules as diverse as acesulfameK dulcin        NC GA saccharin SC GA and sucrose            and mTR and responded to the bitter compounds        denatonium npropylthiouracil and cycloheximide        respectively     Thus although it is clear that the        murine taste world in many ways differs from that of        humans the taste of the compounds used here to the mouse        seems to be similar to their taste in human        There is however some discrepancy between the pattern        of TR expression and physiological data in mice Thus TR        and TR were coexpressed in circumvallate and foliate        taste buds but not in fungiform papillae     while        sweeteners elicited stronger responses in the CT than in        the NG We have also found that mice in TBP tests with        bilateral CT cut have a significantly diminished preference        for fructose and NC  while mice with bilateral NG cut        showed no difference from the sham surgery group own        unpublished observations This would not be the case if        there were no sweet receptors in the area innervated by the        CT It is possible that there is another sweet receptor in        fungiform taste buds as has been suggested            Here we used two parameters to characterize the summated        responses One was the amplitude of the response It is the        method used in most studies However which part of the        amplitude that is used varies We have used the maximum        amplitude regardless of when it occurs Some investigators        used the maximum amplitude of the slow phase of the whole        response     others measured the amplitude after a        particular time for example  sec      These        methods however do not take into consideration        differences in the temporal profiles which vary        considerably as shown in Fig  Therefore measuring the        amplitude at two different intervals for example within        the first  sec and at  sec gives a better        representation of the response             It is also evident that using maximum amplitude as a        measure of response can be problematic when the spontaneous        activity in the taste nerve varies considerably As a        consequence a small phasic response may pass unnoticed        Alternatively spontaneous variations of nerve activity        during stimulation may result in a positive measure        although there was no response This can be seen in Fig         and for zero stimulus concentration        The other parameter we used was the integrated response        which also suffers some shortcomings For example the        stimulus may only elicit a short phasic response which then        will be overlooked if only the integrated response is used        as for denatonium benzoate in Fig  The use of both        parameters best describes the responses        Another question is if the difference in temporal        profile was caused by some intrinsic factor in the        transduction mechanism or the result of the location of the        taste buds We think that the difference in accessibility        to the taste buds innervated by CT and NG is probably not        the whole explanation because the NG responses to NHCl        NaCl and citric acid displayed a similar phasic component        as their responses in the CT Thus it is likely that the        difference in temporal profiles may be related to different        mechanisms of taste transduction        The last issue to be discussed is if the data should be        normalized that is expressed in relation to a standard        NHCl is commonly used as standard in mice and rats        although responses to NaCl sucrose as well as an average        of the four standard stimuli NaCl acid QHCl and sucrose        have been used      Normalization might be necessary        when combining data from a homogeneous group of animals        with large individual variation in nerve activity or to        compare data between different groups strains of animals        with large variations in nerve activity between the groups        Another reason is if one nerve is systematically more        active than another Here there was no difference between        the integrated responses to NHCl in CT and NG        Consequently normalization to NHCl would not have changed        our results        A possible disadvantage of using nonnormalized data is        that the results can be affected by animal to animal or        nerve to nerve variations or by other external factors        such as anesthesia signal amplification etc In this        study we kept the level of amplification constant between        recordings of the two nerves in the same mouse and between        the mice Furthermore the level of activity during rinsing        with artificial saliva did not differ between the nerves        We conclude that there was no need to normalize the data        presented in this study                    Methods                  Animals and surgery          Thirty male mice of the CBLJ strain from the          Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME were used in three          series of experiments The mice were  weeks old and          weighed  g at the time of recordings Data were          obtained in three different series In the first series          we recorded only from NG In the second and third series          we recorded from both CT and NG In Table the figures in          the parentheses show the number of animals tested with          each stimulus in each series The first figure within the          paranthesis shows the number of CT recordings and the          second figure the number of NG recordings Thus for          example the top line in the third column shows that we          recorded the response to  mM NaCl in  CT and  NG          nerves          The mouse was anesthetized with an im injection of a          mixture of  mgml ketamine and  mgml xylazine in          saline  lg bw and then intubated The anesthesia          was maintained with  isoflurane Body temperature          and heart rate were continuously monitored The CT nerve          was dissected free from its junction with lingual nerve          to the tympanic bulla The NG was accessed through the          same incision as the CT and cut near to its exit from the          posterior lacerated foramen     In  mice we          recorded first the responses of the CT during stimulation          of the tip of the tongue Then we dissected and recorded          from the NG of the same animal The order between the CT          and NG nerve recordings could not be changed because the          tip of the tongue was damaged during the NG recording          when we stretched the tongue to insure that the foliate          and vallate taste buds were stimulated                          Stimulation          The stimuli were delivered to the tongue with an open          flow system controlled by a computer It delivered the          solutions at given intervals over a preset time under          constant flow and temperature C     Each          stimulation lasted for  s with  s rinsing time          between stimulations Table lists the stimuli and their          concentrations used in each of three series of          experiments All compounds were dissolved in artificial          saliva Between stimulations the tongue was rinsed with          artificial saliva which contained  mM NaCl  mM KCl           mM NaHCO  mM KHCO  mM CaCl  mM MgCl           mM KHPO  mM KHPO  mM HCl for pH  Because          the precise content of mouse saliva is not published we          decided to use twicediluted formula of the artificial          saliva we have used in other species monkey pig rat                It maintained the taste buds in good          condition and gave us stable and reproducible nerve          recordings for many hours Artificial saliva was also          used as a stimulus in itself Thus the nerve activity          during  s of stimulation with saliva was considered as          a response to  concentration of any other stimulus          Care was exercised to make sure that the tongue was          optimally stimulated This was easy during the CT          experiments when the flow was easily visible During the          NG recordings we checked with a surgical microscope that          the flow ran over the vallate and foliate papillae A          further test was to see whether the summated response had          a sharp onset to NHCl NaCl and the acids because the          sharp onset revealed if the taste buds on the back of the          tongue were adequately stimulated and assured that the          possible absence of a phasic component of the responses          to other stimuli was related to the property of the          stimulus and not an artifact                          Recording and analysis          Nerve impulses were recorded with a custommade          amplifier monitored over a loudspeaker and an          oscilloscope and fed into a recorder Gould TA For          the whole nerve recordings the nerve impulses were          processed by a smoothed absolute value circuit integrator             and changed to a DC potential whose amplitude was          related to the nerve impulse frequency here called the          integrated response This signal and a code related to          the tastant on the tongue were fed via a DASKeithley          interface to an IBM computer Its program sampled the          summated response before during and after stimulation          and displayed it on a monitor          To characterize the whole nerve response we used two          measures First the integrated response during          stimulation calculated as the surface area under the          trace and expressed in arbitrary units The integrated          response was obtained by deducting the area of          spontaneous nerve activity preceding the stimulation          from that during stimulation Thus it reflects the level          of activity during  seconds of stimulation time Our          second response measure was the maximum amplitude of a          response within  seconds of stimulation          To assess whether the CT or NG responses to the          stimuli were different from the response to           concentration we used twotailed ttests For compounds          tested in more than one series Table  responses from          different series were pooled          Then integrated and maximum responses were analyzed          with separate ANOVAs Because we found no correlation          between the integrated responses in the CT and NG in the          same animals data not shown we treated these responses          as independent measures Thus we pooled data from mice          with recordings from only one nerve and data from mice          with recordings from two nerves Responses were evaluated          with twoway ANOVA with nerve as a betweengroups factor          and concentration as a withingroup factor Post hoc          comparisons of stimuli using StudentNewmanKeuls test          were performed to check differences between CT and NG          responses at specific concentrations For stimuli          presented at single concentrations the differences were          assessed with twotailed ttests For all statistical          tests p   was considered significant                            Authors contributions        The authors contributed equally to this paper
