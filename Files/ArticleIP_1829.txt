                                 Ron Carey            To understand why Ron Careymatters ignore what he says and listen to how he says it There are only twoacceptable accents for a contemporary American leaderSincere Southernfavored by Bill Clinton and every other pol whos ever lived south of NewYork and Flat Corporate preferred by CEOs But Carey speaks neither TheTeamsters president delivers speeches and strike ultimatums in an accent bestdescribed as a Queens Bray Hearing him on the news this week was a shock Howlong has it been since such a broad brassy voice has been broadcast to thenation Or to pose the question another way how long has it been since anyoneoutside a union hall paid attention to a union leader            But whileCarey is the first union official in a generation to intrude on Americaspublic consciousness and while the UPS strike is the most important anddisruptive walkout since Reagan busted the airtraffic controllers in  theCarey backlash is already under way Careys difficulties began last fall whenhe narrowly defeated James Hoffa son of the Late Unlamented in the Teamsterspresidential election Hoffa accused Carey of campaignfinance irregularitiesThe Justice Department began probing whether Careys political consultants hadlaundered union dues into his campaign chest One consultant has alreadypleaded guilty to a conspiracy count Now Sen Fred Thompsons committee isinvestigating allegations that the Teamsters PAC engaged in a dirty quid proquo with the Democratic National Committee The PAC steered funds to stateDemocratic parties in exchange for Democratic donations to the Carey campaignMeanwhile a federal election monitor is refusing to certify Careys victorybecause of the investigations The New Republic and the Wall StreetJournal are stepping up attacks on Carey and his consultants And now mostdamningly some conservatives are contending that Carey instigated the UPSstrike in order to distract attention from his own troubles            Carey does not deserve the mud In an organization infectedby crime cowardice and greed Carey has been a beacon of honesty courageand restraint for  years To appreciate Carey you must understand theunions depravity From the early s until a federal takeover in racketeers dominated the Teamsters Of the six presidents who preceded Careythree went to jail including Hoffa and a fourth died while under indictmentThe union czars lived fat on union dues In the mids president JackiePresser squandered  on a party where he costumed himself as a Romanemperor and entered on a litter borne aloft by four muscled men The unionslocal bosses were no better The barons padded their payrolls with familymembers paid themselves enormous salaries as much as  a year tookbribes from employers in exchange for sweetheart contracts siphoned pensionfunds into mobrun operations and generally screwed their rank and file            Careydidnt A UPS driver and the son of a UPS driver Carey was first elected chiefof the Queens NY UPS local in the late s and he has run it cleanlysince then He took an extremely modest salaryless famously than the Frenchchef at the Teamsters headquarters During the s and s Carey took hislocal to the pickets against UPS and won huge concessions When nationalTeamsters leaders negotiated weak contracts with UPS during the s Careyopposed them When mobsters threatened him Carey defied them Again and againCareys colleagues returned him to office with huge majorities            Carey had a small moment of national fame inthe mids when Steve Brills The Teamsters depicted him as one ofthe unions only incorruptible bosses But it was a surprise when he upset twooldguard barons to win the unions first fair open presidential election in As president Carey has continued his upright ways He has slashed hisown salary by a third sold the unions fleet of private jets and canceled theconferences at fivestar Hawaiian hotels Backed by the federal monitors hestripped  corrupt locals of their autonomy placed them in trusteeship andpurged hundreds of local officials for consorting with mobsters In just fiveyears Carey and his allies have almost banished corruption from a union thatwas filthy to its bones His  reelection over Hoffa an unabashed championof the barons may have been the final nail in the coffin of the old guard            Carey hasalso fought to restore labors national credibility He spearheaded thecampaign to oust longtime AFLCIO chief Lane Kirkland and replace him with thedynamic John Sweeney Last year Teamsters membership rose for the first timein a decade Careys history is a bulwark against the recent charges Thereslittle doubt that his consultants broke election laws and no doubt thatDemocratic officials prefer Carey to Hoffa but that certainly doesnt meanCarey licensed or even knew about campaign hankypanky Hes a man whos spent years refusing opportunities to corrupt himself Why would he start now            Which brings us to the charge that the UPS strike is aCarey smokescreen One can debate endlessly about the merits and demerits ofthe walkout and that is exactly what Walter Oi and Thomas Geoghegan are doingin Slates Dialogue titled The UPSStrike but its hard to claim that Carey trumped up the strike Careyhas long objected to UPS employment of parttime workers and its widelydisparate pay scales two concessions that the old corrupt union leadersgranted and which are at the heart of the current strike Carey has spentmonths rallying the rank and file behind the strike and UPS protestations tothe contrary he seems to enjoy overwhelming support from the picketers Unionadvocates give Carey special credit for picking an opportune moment to strikeThe booming economy means that UPS is losing  million a day during thestrike and the tight labor market will make it difficult for the company tofind replacement workers            Carey is deservedly a greathero of New Labor yet a certain pathos clouds his achievements What exactlyhas Carey accomplished He has not been indicted He has sacked some crookedcolleagues He barely eked out a victory over Hoffa a mediocre bully And hehas led a strike whose aims are embarrassingly modest by the standards of oldlabor a piddling raise a few more fulltime jobs and a small change in thepension plan But this is organized labor in the s where even a hero mustaim low
