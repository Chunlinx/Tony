                            Harrowing tales of starvation and endurance epitomize Antarcticas heroic age when        men equipped with little more than fortitude struggled against a landscape seemingly        designed to thwart their intentions A menacing sea ice figures prominently in these        improbable survival stories Daunting to earlythcentury explorerstrapping and        ultimately crushing Ernest Shackletons         Endurance and derailing Robert Scotts          Discovery expeditionthe seasonal pack ice is the lifeblood of        Antarcticas marine ecosystem        But as winter temperatures continue to climb in the Antarctic the onceforbidding        winter sea ice is starting to deteriorate The ice pack is forming later and retreating        earlierand its having a serious impact on the abundance of krill the backbone of the        Antarctic food chain        Sea ice is the engine that drives Antarctic ecosystems says William Fraser a        principal investigator for the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program LTER and        president of Polar Oceans Research Group in Montana Many of the key species that govern        ecosystem dynamics in the Antarctic have life histories that depend on the availability of        winter sea ice The most important species in most sectors of Antarctica is krill        A major food source for Antarctic fish penguins pelagic seabirds seals and whales        krill         Euphausia superba  look like shrimp but weigh just a gram as        adults and measure about six centimeters long Figure  Norwegian for whale food krill        aggregate in superswarms that can reach a density of  individuals per square meter        attracting whales which can eat three tons of krill in a single feeding and fisheries        which net on average  metric tons per year        The waters off the Antarctic Peninsula favor high krill concentrations Once you get        into extreme environments such as the Southern Ocean diversity will decrease but the        number of individuals will increase because the production can be very high says Scott        Gallager a marine biologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Woods Hole        Massachusetts United States        Production is particularly high along the sea ice edge he says because the ice is        thinner which allows more sunlight to penetrate and because ocean mixing processes along        the continental shelf cause an upwelling of nutrientrich deep water Increased nutrients        support increased primary production along the ice edge If ice forms too late says        Gallager you dont get this higher production which impacts zooplankton populations like        the larval krill that graze the underice surface feeding on ice algae The ice edge is an        absolutely critical habitat a nursery for larval krill        But this krill hotspot is showing some of the most dramatic changes in sea ice extent        Fraser says the western Antarctic Peninsula has registered the largest increase in        temperatures on the planeton the order of  degrees Celsiusover the past  years This        warming trend he says has been particularly pronounced during the wintercrunch time        for many key Antarctic species        There was a time when almost every winter experienced very heavy sea ice Fraser says        reaching out into the Drake Passage Where once heavy sea ice would form on average four        out of every five years he says now it forms just one or two years out of five Box         In a typical year ice starts to form in the coldest regions along the southern coast in        late Marchearly April austral fall then works its way up the coast But late ice years        are becoming more common with ice forming two to three weeks later These patterns are        completely different from patterns that existed as recently as  to  or  years ago        says Fraser The whole system is becoming unhinged as a result of this enormous        warming                    Retreating Sea Ice and Krill Declines        In November  the most comprehensive study to date of krill distribution and        abundance in the Southern Ocean reported a catastrophic drop in krill numbers Angus        Atkinson a marine biologist with the British Antarctic Survey led the study We pulled        together all the net samples we could lay our hands on that had been obtained in the        Southern Ocean over the last  years Atkinson says analyzing nearly  krill summer        net hauls taken from  and from         The Southern Ocean is an enormous area and at least half of krill stocks were in this        comparatively narrow sector between South Africa and the Antarctic Peninsula he says His        team found a positive correlation between winter sea ice cover and the abundance of krill        the following summer Theres evidence of a general decline in winter sea ice extent and        duration Atkinson says and of a general decline in krill populationsdown  over the        past  yearsover the entire southwest Atlantic sector        Though krill populations showed big fluctuations in the early years their average        numbers were higher over a longer period explains Volker Siegel a krill biologist with        the Sea Fisheries Research Institute in Hamburg Germany who worked with Atkinson Where        in the early days you might have  krill per square meter on averagewith fluctuations        between say  and nowadays you might see  per square meter which goes from  to        five individuals per square meter        Neither Atkinson nor Siegel can say for sure whats causing the decline but both say        the winter sea ice is clearly playing some role Krill live about five to six years During        the breeding season from December to March embryos are released in the upper water        column and the larvae hatch at depths ranging from  meters to  meters unlike many        fish and other invertebrate larvae which hatch at the surface Larvae then have to swim up        through the water column to reach the sea surface Unlike adults krill larvae dont have        enough body fat to carry them through food shortages Theyll starve if they have to rely        on watercolumn food distributions and thats where the sea ice comes in says Atkinson        The ice may also shelter them from predators but one way or another ice in the winter is        good for young krill        Weve got to find out whats causing these changes and then we can start to predict        whats going to happen with future scenarios of climate change Atkinson says The other        thing weve got to do is look at alternative things which might be affecting krill We        might find there are other things declining as well as sea ice such as their food or        there might be a change in the fertilization of the waters        Accompanying the drop in krill abundance Atkinson and Siegel found an increase in        salps transparent jellylike creatures that typically inhabit warmer waters than krill        Expanding into the warmer waters salp populations are increasing in the southern part of        their range and replacing the krill Most krilldependent predators do not eat salp                    Krill Declines Ripple up the Food Chain        At a hearing on climate change impacts before the United States Senate Committee on        Commerce Science and Transportation in May  LTERs Fraser testified that the western        Antarctic Peninsulas cold dry polar marine ecosystem is gradually being replaced with a        warm moist maritime climate While all the major components of the food web are responding        to these changes Fraser said the clearest evidence comes from studies of two especially        sensitive indicators of climate change krill and penguins Trends in penguin populations        provided some of the first evidence that sea ice conditions in some areas were        deteriorating in response to climate warming Fraser told the senators        This evidence came from Frasers own studies over the past  years of three Antarctic        penguin species that share similar life histories including a penchant for krill but show        striking contrasts in their relationship to the sea ice Figure  For Adlie         Pygoscelis adeliae  penguins the presence of sea ice is        absolutely essential for survival Chinstrap         P antarctica  and gentoo         P papua  penguins on the other hand require the absence of        sea ice Adlie penguins have experienced a nearly  decrease in their populations at        our study sites on Anvers Island Palmer Station in the western Antarctic Peninsula over        the last  years says Fraser and theres evidence that other krilldependent predators        are beginning to decrease        Thats a loss of  breeding pairs since  The major factors underlying this        precipitous decline Fraser says are retreating sea ice and increasing snowfall The loss        of sea ice increases the flow of water vapor from the open ocean to the atmosphere        increasing precipitation When sea ice forms he explains it covers these regions of        high production and the birds are just able to plop into the water into very good feeding        areas With a life history accustomed to the formation of sea ice at critical points in        their life cycle Adlies are finding themselves faced with an unpredictable sea ice cycle        that outpaces their ability to adapt The birds just dont have the sea ice when they need        it Fraser says As if losing critical winter habitat werent bad enough Adlies must        also contend with the effects of increased snowfall When the snow melts in the spring        its flooding their nesting areas and drowning their eggs and chicks        The population trends for iceavoiding chinstraps and gentoos are quite different        Both species are increasing their populations and beginning to replace Adlie penguins        across a broad range in the western Antarctic Peninsula Were seeing breeding gentoo        penguins at Palmer Station Fraser says with a trace of astonishment The        paleoecological record does not show that species at our study sites in the last         years        Though chinstraps and gentoos also depend on krill theyve dealt with krill declines by        eating more fish and squid which not incidentally also eat krill Fraser believes this        dietary flexibility along with the increased availability of open water and a late        breeding schedule which protects their eggs and chicks from spring snow meltwater        largely explain their range extensions        Adlies dont seem capable of adjusting anything about their life history says        Fraser Theyre hardwired to their breeding area returning to an area year after year        after year even though conditions are deteriorating And so their numbers continue to        plummet as more chicks perish Another icedependent krilleating penguin species the        emperor         Aptenodytes forsteri  is not faring any better We have just        one emperor colony in our study region and its decreasing very fast Fraser says Its        gone down from  breeding pairs to nine Theyre on the verge of extinction in our study        region                    A Question of Sustainability        A major issue in devising strategies to protect krill populations concerns the impact of        krill fisheries Since drastic declines have occurred in the absence of heavy fishing its        especially important to establish the population dynamics of Antarctic krill Siegel works        with the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources CCAMLR to        develop sustainable fishing regulations Based on a point estimate of  million metric        tons of krill in the southwest Atlantic sector in  CCAMLR calculated a potential yield        of  million tons far above the average metricton catch today Siegel believes        the fisheries arent posing a significant threat to krill stocks at this point but says        much remains to be learned about krill population structure        Gallager is not so sure about the impact of krill fishing Some krill fisheries operate        near the island of South Georgia east of the Falkland Islands We know that these        populations are not selfsustaining but require recruiting of adults from other locations        and probably from regions along the western peninsula of Antarctica says Gallager If we        go in and fish out the populations that are not selfseeding then they could be entirely        wiped out Thats why its crucial to know which populations if any are selfsustaining        he says And we dont know a lot about that at all        Toward that end Gallager is working on an underice zooplankton observatory that        would sit on the bottom of the ocean floor and continuously release a flotation        packageonce an hour for hopefully the next ten yearsoutfitted with sonar and optical        sensors up to the surface then winch itself back down again The plan is to deploy the        observatory off Palmer Station in May  The hope is that data gathered on        overwintering larval krill will shed light on the factors influencing krill survival over        the long term It may be that this coupling between larval krill and ice is actually        underpinning the entire question of krill population dynamics says Gallagerin which        case understanding how the ice moves relative to the water currents and wind shear over        the top will be critical        Many other aspects of krill biology remain obscure as well Biologists still dont        understand the precise mechanisms required to enhance larval growth reproduction and        recruitment replenishing populations with new individuals or how temperature        fluctuations affect metabolism and larval growth rate Robust tests of longheld theories        of how the underice habitat sustains krill larvae require much more quantitative dataover        time and over a wide scaleon larval abundance distribution and foraging behavior But        netting krill is not easy Larvae tend to wedge themselves into nooks and crannies defying        divers attempts to nab them while protecting their expensive nets loaded with even more        expensive electronic gearfrom the ice        Whatever is behind the correlation between sea ice decline and krill declines the        future of the Antarctic ecosystem hangs in the balance A  report by the        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the Antarctic Peninsula will        experience some of the largest most rapid climate changes on earth If these trends of        rising temperatures and decreasing sea ice continue says LTERs Fraser what we are going        to see in the next ten   years is a system that is completely different from the one        that exists now Adlies will become regionally extinct        Concluding his testimony on climate change impacts Fraser warned the US Senate        committee that if future warming continues and the cycle of heavy ice years exceeds the        life span of krill the species will face a reproductive crisis And that he said will        have catastrophic consequences to the integrity of this marine ecosystem        In  for the sake of a few emperor penguin eggs Apsley CherryGarrard and two        members of Scotts illfated polar expedition endured what CherryGarrard called extremity        of suffering from which only madness or death may give relief The group believed the        eggs might prove that the penguins were the missing link between birds and the reptiles        from which birds have sprung        Our understanding has advanced light years since then rendering such notions nearly        quaint CherryGarrard and his companions thought the forbidding Antarctic landscape immune        to human assaults Today with this notion too proven false one wonders if the damage        can be reversed In Atkinsons diplomatic phrase there are political issues involved        where global warming is concerned But the clock is ticking If the Antarctic ecosystem        collapses it wont be because scientists were off on a misguided search for penguin        eggs
