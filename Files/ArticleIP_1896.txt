                                 Vietnams Most Harrowing Photo From Guilt to Grace            By CharlesPaul Freund                            words postedThursday Nov  to be composted Thursday Nov                         One of photographys mostterrible strengths is its power to accuse The ability of imagery to forgiveto reconcile is a good deal more circumscribedbut then that is true ofexpression itself Guilt will be borne grace is fleeting            Yet both guilt and graceshared space on front pages and TV screens a few days ago they came togetherin the face of Phan Thi Kim Phuc who after  years of mute and frozenaccusation stepped forward at this years Veterans Day ceremony in WashingtonDC to lay to rest that portion of a painful past that she has carried in herown face            Anyone old enough toremember the imagery of Vietnam would surely have viewed the pictures of Kim atthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial through Nick Uts harrowing PulitzerPrizewinning photograph of children fleeing a napalm attack on a villageoutside Saigon That  photo has lost none of its dark horror over theyears It still transforms its viewers into witnesses it still asks of themthe same fearsome question What have you to do with this            Kim  years old in had taken shelter with others in a pagoda when the American military orderedthe South Vietnamese air force to attack her village of Trang Bang because ithad been infiltrated by enemy forces The pagoda was hit killing amongothers two of Kims brothers Terrified survivors streamed onto the highwaywhere photographer Ut snapped them Kim is naked screaming in fear and agonyin the center of the image            In fact the image tellslittle of this story It is not a picture of a military attack and itsaftermath it is a picture of terror We know this is war The presence ofsoldiers tells us that And we know something has just happened because we seeblack smoke obliterating the horizon But what Terrified children are runningdown a hellish highway that disappears behind them into a smoky vanishingpoint a highway that seems to run through a barren and burning plain            What can they be runningtoward Perhaps they see something down the highway behind us But there is noanticipation of sanctuary to be found in their faces If it is succor towardwhich they run they will have to run forever            Especially disconcerting isthe naked girl in the middle of the highway It isnt clear to us why she isnaked perhaps the force of an explosion has blown away her clothes Is sheinjured We cant quite tell Oddly she is the only one in the image lookingback at us And we are the only ones looking at her Indeed the very act ofstaring at her nakedness seems to only intensify her humiliation There is adimension to her unending scream that seems to be in reaction to our very actof witness The effect is deeply disturbing            Uts was not the only camerapresent the sequence exists on film as well Because it is more dreadfulphysically the film is less potent emotionally The same is true for anotherof Vietnams most famous images Eddie Adams photo of the guntotempleexecution of a Viet Cong            VickiGoldberg in her book The Power of Photography  describes the fullfilmed sequence                           The naked girl andthe others  ran toward us rather slowly like people finishing their runThey passed the camera it followed from behind The girls back and arm wereseen to be completely covered with black patches of burned skin no longerresembling flesh American soldiers gave her a drink and poured water overher                        That is a level of atrocityfrom which most viewers must recoil Furthermore the filmed sequence closesout the event and gives viewers an opportunity to shrug it off Uts photo isof a crowded highway winding eternally through hell and it wont let yougo            Goldberg reports that thepicture ran on front pages throughout America Benjamin Spock who chose thephoto to speak for him in the  exhibition Talking Pictures certainlyechoed many of its viewers when he wrote simply It horrified me andcredited it with confirming his opposition to the war            The image was of course animportant piece of atrocity propaganda for the North Vietnamese who werethemselves responsible for significant suffering both before and after theyattained power Like all such atrocity material it undermined the morale ofthe side responsible for the pain it depicted But the political manipulationof imagery doesnt delegitimize its content The pain here is only too realKim still suffers from her wounds            In fact Kim herself became aprisoner of this image As she told National Public Radio her desire to studymedicine was thwarted by officials who wanted her to remain available for mediainterviews that stemmed from the photographs worldwide fame she herself hadbecome a propaganda exhibit Eventually she was able to study in Cuba andduring a visit to Canada she and her husband asked forand weregrantedasylum            If I could talk face toface with the pilot who dropped the bomb Kim said during her remarkableappearance in Washington I would tell him we cannot change history but weshould try to do good things for the present             A little girl naked and inpain and with burned arms outstretched staggers toward us down the middle of ahighway A quartercentury later she reaches us Who would have expected thatwhen she finally covered that last patch of pocked road she would offer herhand in grace
