        all right are you a music fan     oh by all means various types um my tastes range from rock and roll to classical in fact about the only type of music that i really find offensive would be uh country western   oh is that right   yeah i take that back rap but i consider rap music to be an oxymoron   yeah i guess i ill have to agree with you on rap uh thats uh its not my thats not my style my uh     yeah   lets lets see one more question here do you uh do you play an instrument   yes i do i play two a bass guitar and kalimba   okay so thats   i used to play three which was the clarinet but ive thats since gone into disuse   well now theres theres multiple kinds of country western music uh not that im an expert in that uh area but   yeah well there was rockabilly in the fifties and thats what gave rise to like Carl Perkins uh Jerry Lee Lewis uh Elvis Presley in the beginning   but theres yeah right   and that type of music i do appreciate it had some it had it had the spark of creativity it was it was out there   yeah   and uh since then its sort of fallen into formula and i guess thats my thing is i have a problem with formula music     now is is uh  i guess the other thing that that uh there there is one kind of music that i dont know i wouldnt consider it country western but but it is in a sense   huh   and thats bluegrass what about that   well ive only been exposed to that minimally and thats usually through occasional you know viewings of concerts of said type on public television   okay   you know   did you watch the the did did you watch it for very long or was it just   oh it was something i had basically for background it was not uh obtrusive   oh okay   it was something i could listen to and uh and do my chores around the house   okay so you listen to it i i mean its not   oh yes   it not   its not completely offensive   its not offensive to you is what im   yeah   oh thats thats interesting my uh there for uh a long time uh i i liked folk music but uh folk music is you know a a back in the seventies   uhhuh yeah   so to speak sixties and seventies and then   sure   and uh then i became a a bluegrass fan and i listened to it all the time and ive got lots of tapes of it and then   uhhuh   uh i like but im kind of like you i i i mean in some ways im like you i i dont uh uh i dont like  music that its this uh  where you where you know what the next phrase is going to be because you know they have these dumb rhymes like a lot of i mean the where the how shall i say it the words are just so predictable   uhhuh yeah   and although i do laugh at some of the country western things they have this one uh country western song about the guy the perfect country western song and he said it had to have trains and all that stuff trains and mama i dont know if youve heard that one     oh that that thats cute i wouldve liked to have heard that   and then he uh basically said okay so i went back to him and finally it what he came up with was the song about uh his mom got hit by a train and and uh she or it was the day she got out of jail she got hit by a train and and things like that  so you know and anyways went to see her in his pickup truck and stuff like that so it was kind of creative i like that but uh     oh yeah had to have some beer too or or some sort of alcoholic substance   yeah but uh the thing one of the things that that the northwest ive been told has has got a lot of uh its kind of the center of activity is uh uh i dont know if you would call it new wave music or or uh new age music i is that it   new age yes   yeah George Winston and which is hes a little bit uh uh well hes kind of the recognized  uh i dont know if hes the founder of it but   huh yeah its like the Windham Hill stuff its its   but they yeah Windham Hill   yeah its uh new age classical so to speak   yes   well what i what i often uh call air pudding yeah   now they have some of that uh uh some of its very interesting and other and and others uh is how shall i say it its very predictable now thats interesting youd say the air pudding some people would call it yuppie music   yeah yeah well i only use it when im studying and thats the extent of it its just its good background filter stuff and you know it what it is its pleasant but its not talent in in my view its not genius um when i really wish to get into listening pleasure uh with something of that nature i put on Mozart or Beethoven something that will evoke a response something that almost reaches in and and hits those proverbial heart strings   the i i can respond to that a little bit by uh i spent three years in the Far East and of course the some of the i mean what kids   uh
