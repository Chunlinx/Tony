                                 Zaire                           Mobutu Sese Seko president of the Central African country of Zaire for the last  years isconsidered the continents most brutal and corrupt living dictator SinceOctober rebels have battled his army Last week they seized Kisangani Zaires thirdlargest city and may soon topple him Some Africa watcherspredict that chaos could spread to Zaires nine neighbors Whats it allabout            Attributepart of Zaires current crisis to the boundaries it inherited from itsBelgian colonizers The countrythe size of Western Europe minusScandinaviaenvelops almost  tribes  They frequently conflictBantus the countrys largest tribe constitute the majority west of the rainforest that divides Zaire East of the rain forest is a hodgepodge            Zaire used to be called the Belgian Congo  Atindependence in  a Sovietbacked socialist party took power In  aCIAbacked military coup brought down this government and installed army chiefMobutu as president Using violence anticolonial rhetoric and a cult ofpersonality Mobutu consolidated his power and suppressed tribal tensions Aspart of a program called Mobutuism he changed the countrys name It allworked fairly well until recently            The mostunsettling development has been the civil war in Rwanda  Zaires easternneighbor The war is between the countrys two main tribesthe Hutusand the Tutsis  In  when Rwandas Tutsi minority seized power million Hutu refugees fled across the border to Zaire These refugees includedmembers of the Hutu militias that had led the murder of  million RwandanTutsis With the sanction of local Zairian officials these militias used campsin Zaire as bases for raids into Rwanda To avenge these attacks Paul Kagamevice president and defense minister of Rwanda arranged for the combat trainingof  Banyamulenge Tutsis indigenous to Eastern Zaire In October theBanyamulenge commandos attacked Mobutus army and the Hutu militias operatingout of Zaire They routed both forces causing them to flee into the countrysinterior rain forest                           Mobutus political opponents have joinedwith the victorious Tutsi commandos In November they launched a jointoffensive and so far have captured a thousandmile swath of territory in theEast The opposition army mainly consists of separatists from Shaba and Kasaiprovinces in East Zaire and supporters of the original postcolonialgovernment who have battled Mobutus army sporadically since the dictatorsascent The most powerful rebel leader is Laurent Kabila head of theAlliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of CongoZaire Though Kabilaa member of the pre government has renounced his Marxist past many inthe West worry about his socialist tendencies            Whilemilitarily successful Kabilas alliance with the Tutsis is a politicalhandicap for him because many Bantus have their own deepseated hatred towardTutsis Another obstacle to Kabilas revolt is the lack of nationalinfrastructure  Crossing the roadless rain forest from recently capturedKisangani to Kinshasa the capital will be arduous            Zaires economic collapse may make all these tribaldifferences irrelevant Groups normally hostile to Tutsis including Bantustudent protesters in Kinshasa have turned against Mobutu Despite Zairesnatural resources  including some of the worlds richest diamond andcopper mines the country has become one of the poorest in Africa In  itsgross national product was less than a third of what it had been in Zairian industry runs at only  percent of capacity American aid to Zairedried up after the end of the Cold War diminished Zaires strategic importanceAnd Mobutus corruption has siphoned off resources The president is said tohave plundered  billion straight from the government treasury making him oneof the richest men in the world He pays his civil service virtually no salaryrequiring them to earn their income through bribes            InOctober the yearold Mobutu went to Switzerland to receive treatment forprostate cancer Except for short visits to Zaire in December and February hehas been staying at his villas on the French Riviera and in Monaco His absencehas hastened the countrys disintegration Many Zairians consider Mobutu to bethe sternbutloving national father  Other more superstitiousZairians endow him with a supernatural aura something he has cultivatedthrough his identification with the leopard which signifies omnipotence inBantu iconography Mobutu made Leopard his nickname and always wears aleopardskin hat  In Mobutus absence various politicians havejockeyed for power creating serious harm to the war effort This week theparliament voted to oust the prime minister The army is in shambles and largesections of the country have been running themselves without oversight fromthe central government            Increasingly desperate Mobutu uses Serbianmercenaries to fight the rebels In addition the army relies on assistancefrom Jonas Savimbis UNITA army anticommunist rebels from neighboring Angolaformerly backed by the CIA Sudan and Uganda also neighbors have sent troopsto assist the rebels Their intentions are unclear Do they hope to grab landfrom Zaire Are they seeking to avenge Mobutus long support of rebellions intheir countries Some experts predict that their involvement in the war couldescalate the conflict drawing these countries into battle with oneanother            The Clinton administrationhas not officially taken a position on the civil war However it has tacitlyencouraged the rebels in the belief that Mobutus patronage of guerrillaforces in the region is destabilizing American opposition to Mobutu hasbeen a source of tension with France which supports the Hutus and resentsKabilas alliance with the Banyamulenge
