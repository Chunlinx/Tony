        uh i i hope i dont consider them a uh threat because uh  uh we sure have taken down a lot of security measures that that we once had um i dont know seems um um maybe a little bit young to remember the uh im only im im twenty two so i dont think i remember the uh uh you know the height of the Cold War and and whatnot but i   huhuh   i dont know i dont consider the Soviet Union a threat in that uh by any means just because of the fact that theres not uh uh anything that they have to threaten us with anymore   well there not i mean there really is no Soviet Union now unfortunately they still do have a lot of uh nuclear weapons   exactly thats thats true thats uhhuh   and uh the one thing that worries me is is question of stability and control   umhum   and uh i think its too early to say you know whether theyre going to develop some stable societies there in one form or another   umhum   or whether this uh  old uh Russian tendency to turn their fate over to some insane ruler is going to surface again   sure yeah       they didnt they didnt have a very good track record even before the revolution   no they really didnt uh now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so     no no   um its going to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess   right   all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not you know they just might sort of lose track of what theyre doing   right um i i guess im not so concerned about an organized danger uh maybe for the maybe for the simple reason that um despite the fact that they do have uh  you know probably a large uh substantial nuclear capability uh im not sure that that all of that capability is organized anymore i mean you know just along with it with the dissolution the that the of the uh Soviet Union i think that  a lot happened with the dissolution of their of their military power   but thats really part of the danger because they still have uh you know i think there still uh missile uh bases or silos in uh   umhum   in uh Kazakhstan probably in Ukraine   right right   as well as in Russia uh those in Russia may be some of them in areas that uh may have uh   right   strong local national sentiments because they arent all Russians you know theyre a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities   yeah sure uhhuh   and if even one uh missile silo got in the hands of someone who is uh determined to cause trouble for some for some reason they might launch a missile on someone   i think i see your point uh you have you have uh where once you had uh one government controlling a a a large number of missiles now you have several smaller governments uh highly volatile   governments and militaries and its not always clear which one of them is in charge   militaries yeah sure   well thats maybe the uh the uh extreme pessimistic view   umhum   um think if uh Yeltsin has a chance and if they can follow his lead in the other republics or whatever they want to call themselves now   yeah   um theyll probably come out of it okay   umhum uh do you see uh i have not perceived and i wonder if youve perceived any uh uh antiAmericanism uh sentiments uh  on any level like you know that that we receive from the from the Middle East for example   what in the former Soviet Union   yeah   um not much i dont think i think that uh probably or uh or uh image there is pretty good most places as i understand it   right umhum do you worry that we might uh overstep  i guess my question is do you do you think that there are ways that we might overstep overstep our bounds and provoke uh provoke anger in the Soviet Union and and what would those what would those steps be provoke a threat   what might make them angry at us may make the people angry at us or the governments or both or   umhum you know both i guess   well i think if they uh thought that we were taking advantage of their uh current preoccupations with internal matters or with   umhum
