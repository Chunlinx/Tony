                    Background        The iron status of an individual may play an important        role in cardiovascular health with either an excess of        iron mainly the storage form ferritin or iron deficiency        leading to significant problems Sullivan    has        proposed that excess iron ie any iron in the ferritin        form leads to formation of free radicals that can worsen        ischemic myocardial injury and contribute to atherogenesis        This hypothesis has considerable experimental     and        epidemiological     support However the iron        hypothesis has not been universally accepted     and        considerable debate on the role of iron overload on        cardiovascular disease continues               Iron deficiency has also been shown to lead to        ventricular hypertrophy in developing rats                  While the mechanisms responsible for this        hypertrophy have received little research attention        studies have documented an eccentric hypertrophic pattern             which has led investigators to suspect a        ventricular volume overload at end diastole as a primary        hypertrophic stimulus The hypothesized volume load if it        occurs does not result from a change in blood volume            It has also been hypothesized that a chronic elevation        in sympathetic nervous system activity is involved in iron        deficiencyinduced hypertrophy Evidence to support this        view includes the observations of increased levels of        norepinephrine in plasma and urine and decreased        norepinephrine content in the iron deficient heart               Rossi     after finding that reserpine        administration prevented the development of this        hypertrophy even suggested that norepinephrine is the        causal agent in the pathology While little published        research has subsequently focused on iron deficiency        hypertrophy there have been numerous studies investigating        the role of sympathetic neurotransmission with cardiac        hypertrophy induced via various methods coronary artery        ligation chronic pressure overload transgenic models        etc Most have demonstrated alterations in either plasma        or heart norepinephrine content and a desensitization of        the betaadrenergic receptors of the heart                     Recently the alphaadrenergic receptor        has been shown in vitro to be an important modulator of        ventricular hypertrophy However even in transgenic animal        models overexpressing alpha receptors the betaadrenergic        receptor appears to play an important role in hypertrophy        development and the transition to heart failure             Regardless of which receptors are involved in the various        forms of hypertrophy the sympathetic nervous system does        appear to play a role in most if not all forms of cardiac        hypertrophy and much remains to be done in this area                   Almost no attention has been paid to the peripheral        vascular consequences of iron deficiency     With iron        deficiency the poor oxygencarrying capacity of the blood        must be offset in order for the animal to develop to full        maturity Therefore the chronic sympathetic activation        associated with iron deficiency should result in increased        cardiac output In turn flow through the major arterial        network would be enhanced in an attempt to maintain near        normal oxygen delivery Kamiya and Togawa    have found        that increased flow stimulates remodeling of an artery to a        larger diameter through an endothelial dependent mechanism        It has yet to be demonstrated whether iron deficiency will        stimulate a similar arterial remodeling        Collagen is an integral component of the arterial wall        providing rigidity and support Iron is necessary in the        synthesis of collagen     and collagen content has        been shown to be reduced in iron deficient hearts            If this is similarly true for arteries in iron deficient        animals a significant increase in distensibility would        result altering the normal pressurevolume        relationship        We investigated three hypotheses using anesthetized        rats First we hypothesized that in iron deficient rats        intravenous norepinephrine would cause an altered        cardiovascular response either in heart rate or rate of        arterial pressure generation contractility dpdt         Second we hypothesized that iron deficient arteries would        be larger and more distensible than in iron replete        controls Finally we hypothesized that a daily injection        of the betaadrenergic antagonist propanolol would        significantly reduce the development of ventricular        hypertrophy        Our results suggest that iron deficient hypertrophic        hearts display a hypersensitive inotropic but not        chronotropic response to norepinephrine Second abdominal        aortas from iron deficient rats display not only increased        diameters but also significant increases in        distensibility Finally propanolol injections do not        prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac        hypertrophy drawing into question the potential causal        relationship between betaadrenergic neurotransmission and        this form of hypertrophy                    Results and Discussion                  Body weight heart weight and hematocrit          Experiments  and           Rat growth rate is shown in figure  There were no          differences between any of the experimental groups see          Materials and Methods until the animals reached  days          of age after which iron deficient rats are of less mass          than controls  p   Figure also shows the          final mean body mass of the four experimental groups          Iron deficient and control groups more than doubled their          body mass from  week to  month on the respective diets           p   The control rats also had a          significantly greater mass than the iron deficient rats          p   in the one month group  p   but          not at one week p   The control rats in this          study increased mass at a rate similar to that published          for the ad libitum fed CD rat      suggesting          growth was inhibited by iron deficiency It is likely          that growth inhibition is attributable to metabolic          causes arising from both oxygen delivery and          mitochondrial insufficiencies associated with iron          deficiency     The growth data for both the control          and iron deficient groups are also similar to that          reported for male Wistar rats fed an iron and copper          deficient diet     but the iron deficient rats at           days of age were larger than reports of  week old          Harlan SpragueDawley rats fed an AIN iron deficient          diet              Heart mass increased significantly from  week to           month of the diets figure   p   Diet          group differences were not apparent at  week p            but the hearts of iron deficient rats were of          greater mass at  month  p   indicating that          the heart has undergone hypertrophy by this time These          differences remained significant after normalization of          heart weight to body weight data not shown This time          frame for development of hypertrophy is similar to          previous findings with iron or copper deficiency                            Mean hematocrit levels figure bottom of iron          deficient animals were significantly less than controls          after  month  p   but not  week p            of the respective diets Many studies have          documented significant hematocrit decreases after one          month of an iron deficient diet                   However few of these report data for  week though one          published study indicated a small but significant          difference     and we have observed a group          difference after  week of iron deficiency in another          study Mullendore et al manuscript in progress We          speculate that the ability to create significant iron          deficiency in this short time is dependent upon the          purity of the iron deficient diet as well as individual          animal differences Nonetheless examination of several          time points during the progression of iron deficiency can          potentially provide important insights into the          development of resulting physiological alterations                          Experiment  Cardiodynamics          In these experiments an infusion of intravenous          saline was used to ensure that the delivery method          employed did not evoke a cardiovascular response In all          variables measured which include heart rate and          ventricular contractility figure  systolic and          diastolic pressures figure  there were no differences          between preinfusion and peak responses to saline          Therefore any differences seen with intravenous          norepinephrine were attributable to the catecholamine and          not the infusion per s Prior to the infusion of saline          group differences were already apparent between iron          deficient and control rats at  month in heart rate  p            systolic  p   and diastolic          pressure  p   but not contractility p            We believe these pressure changes are associated          with vascular remodeling as discussed below          Figure also shows heart rate and contractility          immediately prior to and at peak response to          intravenous norepinephrine infusions Prior to          norepinephrine infusion there were no differences          between iron deficient and control groups within each          duration in either heart rate or contractility p            Heart rate was unchanged from prenorepinephrine          infusion to peak response p   The only          difference in peak heart rate response to norepinephrine          was the iron deficient group at  month  p            which showed a significant decrease Contractility was          significantly increased for both control  p            and iron deficient  p   groups from          preinfusion to peak response At one month          contractility for iron deficient rats increased           upon norepinephrine infusion while the control group at           month increased only           Figure demonstrates a unique response pattern to the          sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter          norepinephrine For both control and iron deficient          groups the response to norepinephrine is to increase          contractility in the absence of chronotropic increases          Cardiac output therefore would be expected to increase          due to enhanced stroke volume with an uncompromised          filling time and a more powerful ventricular contraction          In fact this pattern is even more exaggerated in the          iron deficient animals at  month Heart rate in this          group was decreased which allows the animal two          potential advantages First ventricular filling time          would be increased potentially allowing for greater end          diastolic and stroke volumes This would be expected          chronically to result in a eccentric hypertrophic          pattern a condition that we and others     have          found in iron deficient rat hearts Second the decrease          in heart rate in iron deficient hearts when          norepinephrine was infused would allow for longer          myocardial perfusion time which would compensate for the          decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and          impaired mitochondrial function     The iron          deficient norepinephrine response compliments the finding          of an increase in capillary lumenal volume in iron          deficient hearts     which should also allow for          better myocardial perfusion during diastole          Norepinephrine infusion resulted in a dramatic          enhancement of contractility  in  month iron          deficient rats when compared to  month control rats           By utilizing a hypersensitive response to          sympathetic stimulation coupled with an unchanged or          lower heart rate the iron deficient heart can          potentially offset some of the oxygen delivery          deficiencies of anemic blood without risking myocardial          ischemia These appear to be positive adaptations at          least short term in response to a serious nutritional          challenge Iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy is not          unique in this regard as Lin has recently documented          enhanced contractility without increased heart rate in          hypersympathetic transgenic mice     In contrast          there is a large body of evidence which suggests that          cardiac hypertrophy which has progressed to the point of          pathology ultimately results in a decrease in          contractility             We have          not yet investigated whether the iron deficient heart          will similarly lose the augmented contractility response          in time          It has been suggested in several papers that changes          in sympathetic nervous system responsiveness may begin as          a positive adaptation but ultimately results in          pathologic failure of the myocardium For example          Engelhardt     in a study of mice genetically bred          with an increase in betaadrenergic receptor density          showed that increased contractility was an initial          response but by  weeks contractility was reduced by           and ejection fraction by  The genetically          altered hyperadrenergic heart ultimately failed after          initial enhancement of cardiac function          Mukherjee and Spinale     in a recent review          concluded that with hypertrophy comes a decrease in          cardiac contractility as a result of changes to the          Ltype Ca channel However the authors noted that this          adaptation while generally present in a failing          hypertrophied myocardium is not necessarily present in          less serious cardiac hypertrophies Similarly Tse             found that in compensated hypertrophy the population of          betaadrenergic receptors is relatively normal but in          heart failure the beta receptors have both          downregulated and desensitized Sheridan    and          Iaccarino    came to a similar conclusion regarding          heart failure and adrenergic downregulation          Figures shows systolic and diastolic pressures before          and after the norepinephrine infusion There was a          significant increase in systolic pressure for both the          control  p   and the iron deficient  p            groups from preinfusion to peak response          Diastolic pressure similarly increased from preinfusion          to peak response for both control  p   and          iron deficient  p   groups when          norepinephrine was infused These observations are          consistent with the vasoconstrictive effect of          norepinephrine Also increased heart contractility is          expected to increase peak systolic pressure The          diastolic pressure of iron deficient rats was          significantly lower than controls both before  p            and after  p   norepinephrine          infusion This is consistent with the idea of vascular          remodeling to a larger arterial diameter with iron          deficiency discussed below which could reduce the          afterload against which the heart must work to eject          blood                          Experiment           Representative aortas from control and iron deficient          rats after one month on the respective diets are shown in          figure  and mean aorta external diameter at  mmHg          pressure is illustrated in figure  There was a          significant duration effect  p   likely          due to body growth Overall the diameter of aortas from          iron deficient rats was greater than from control rats           p   The regulation of lumenal diameter in          large arteries is accomplished through the maintenance of          shear stress along the arterial wall                   As blood flow through an artery increases shear is          also increased and the endothelium releases nitric oxide          for vasodilation     Chronically the arterial wall          will remodel to a larger diameter to accommodate the          increased flow     While we did not measure arterial          flow through these iron deficient arteries the enhanced          inotropic compensation to iron deficiency combined with          the enlarged aortic diameter leads us to suspect a flow          dependent mechanism for remodeling Future investigations          will be necessary to confirm this assertion          Aortic distensibility the increase in external          diameter during stepwise internal pressure increases is          also shown in figure  There is a significant group          difference  p   with the iron deficient aortas          more compliant than the controls overall A decrease in          collagen production with iron deficiency could account          for this enhanced distensibility It has been reported          that collagen production is reduced in iron deficient          hearts     but we are aware of no studies that have          specifically examined alterations in collagen production          in iron deficient arteries Further research regarding          this issue is warranted                          Experiment           Figure shows the heart weight to body weight ratio          for rats that received a daily intraperitoneal injection          of either the betablocker propanolol or saline for           month This ratio was significantly greater in rats fed          the iron deficient diet than controls  p            Clearly iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy is not caused          by chronic stimulation of betaadrenergic receptors in          the heart          Many studies have shown that chronic intravenous          infusion of norepinephrine is sufficient to cause          hypertrophy and that various forms of hypertrophy are          linked to a decrease in either betaadrenergic receptor          density or a decreased responsiveness to betaadrenergic          stimulation               Barth          for example showed that norepinephrine infusion induced          left ventricular hypertrophy that could be prevented by          an adrenergicreceptor blocker     It has been          suggested that ornithine decarboxylase is a link between          betaadrenoreceptors and stimulation of tissue growth          factor which results in hypertrophy     However          recent studies have focused on alphaadrenergic reception          as a mediator of cardiac hypertrophy     although          some question the role of the alphaadrenergic receptor          as a hypertrophic mediator in vivo     To date no          published studies of which we are aware have examined          alphaadrenergic reception and the development of cardiac          hypertrophy with iron deficiency          The literature surrounding norepinephrine and its role          in the development of iron deficient hypertrophy          documents the following facts  prolonged iron          deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy                      the pool of stored norepinephrine in the          heart is decreased with iron deficiency                plasma and urine concentrations of norepinephrine are          increased with iron deficiency         and           chronic administration of reserpine which depletes          norepinephrine prevents the development of iron          deficient hypertrophy     but not hypertrophy that          results from aortic banding     This combined with          other studies that relate chronic adrenergic stimulation          to hypertrophy led Rossi to the conclusion that iron          deficiency hypertrophy was caused by chronic sympathetic          stimulation However our finding that a daily injection          of the betablocker propanolol does not prevent the          development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy          suggests that betaadrenergic sympathetic stimulation may          not be a causal agent in the development of hypertrophy          Future investigation is warranted into the potential          alphaadrenergic role in this hypertrophy                            Conclusions        The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac and        vascular responses associated with the development of iron        deficiency In our first experiment we tested the        hypothesis that the iron deficient heart would display an        altered response to norepinephrine the sympathetic nervous        system neurotransmitter In contrast to what has been seen        with most cardiac disease states we found that the iron        deficient heart is hypersensitive to norepinephrine This        suggests an adaptive compensation to the depletion of the        neurotransmitter stores in the heart sympathetic nerve        terminals Further we found that contractility was        enhanced but heart rate was not This would allow for the        iron deficient animal to increase cardiac output through        enhanced stroke volume while maintaining the amount of        time available for cardiomyocyte perfusion        Our second experiment was designed to investigate        whether vascular morphology would be altered with iron        deficiency Our results show an increase in abdominal aorta        diameter suggesting that a flowdependent remodeling of        the arterial wall occurred Also distensibility was        significantly increased which we suggest may be due to a        reduction in arterial collagen These morphological        adjustments can be seen as a positive adaptation to        simultaneously reduce afterload on the heart and improve        blood flow to peripheral tissues        Our final experiment was a simple test to determine if        the betaadrenergic antagonist propanolol would prevent        hypertrophy The failure of the betablocker to prevent        hypertrophy suggests that if the sympathetic nervous        system is a causal agent in the development of this form of        hypertrophy the signaling mechanism is not mediated by the        betaadrenergic receptor        In summary much remains to be learned about this form        of hypertrophy Further experimentation may serve to        elucidate not only the pathology of iron deficient cardiac        hypertrophy but other forms of this pathology as well                    Materials and methods                  Experiment  cardiovascular response to          norepinephrine

software Version  SAS Institute Cary NC to            determine diet iron deficient vs control and            duration  week vs  month effects Paired ttests            were employed to determine significant changes from            preinfusion to peak response Dependent variables were            heart rate contractility systolic pressure and            diastolic pressure Probabilities below  were            accepted as significant for all statistical procedures            throughout all experiments in this study                                    Experiment  remodeling of abdominal aorta                      Experimental Procedures            After experiment  the rats were decapitated The            abdominal aorta was carefully exposed and two            catheters were surgically implanted The first was            inserted just caudal to the superior mesenteric artery            and the other just cranial to the inferior mesenteric            artery The superior catheter was used for stepwise            saline infusions at a range of pressures from               mmHg Exact pressures were measured via a pressure            transducer attached to the inferior catheter Digital            images of the abdominal aorta were taken at each            pressure with a Kodak DC digital camera coupled to a            dissecting microscope Leica MZ The external            diameter of the abdominal aorta was measured using NIH            image software Version  National Institutes of            Health Bethesda MD on an accelerated Power Mac             Apple Computer Cupertino Ca The system            was calibrated by using the digital image of a ruler at            the same magnification                                Data Treatment and Statistical Analysis            Regression analysis was performed using aorta            external diameter and inflation pressure as dependent            and independent variables respectively Distensibility            was estimated as the slope of the regression line for            each individual animal The external diameter of the            abdominal aorta at  mmHg pressure was also estimated            from the individual regression equations Analysis of            Variance was then performed on distensibility and             mmHg external diameter                                    Experiment  propanolol effects on heart          morphology                      Experimental procedures            Ten rats  iron deficient and  control were given            a daily intraperitoneal injection of either propanolol             mgkg body mass per day or saline solution            After  month the rats were sacrificed by decapitation            and the hearts were carefully extracted and            weighed                                Data treatment and statistical analysis            The heart mass to body mass ratio was calculated            and Analysis of Variance was performed as above
