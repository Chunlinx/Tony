        okay you want to tell me first how you feel about     well um i i just think the way that things are going that um that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something   the proposal uhhuh   i know like the Mormon religion you know they require two years of service uh missionary service uh right the boys   the boys not the girl just the boys   yeah and um so but i think it would be good if for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know   uhhuh umhum   i i i dont know i just feel it would be good for them to do that   umhum i i thought it would be good too but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps   yeah   because not all young people would have uh what it takes to go like that   umhum   because i think it takes a certain person to to be able to do something like that but theres a lot of other public service things that could be done   oh sure oh yeah and and even in even in our home towns theres a lot of um public service things that they could do   umhum right   uh you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um   right   uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and i think that art of giving is something that um we dont have very much any more   yes yeah uhhuh yeah i think it would be  when they say this proposal is this something that theyre just suggesting or are they actually why why why did they call it a proposal that   oh i i think they just gave it a title but its its not something thats um in legislation or in works um uh yeah no no its not its just a just a topic but   uhhuh uhhuh thats what i wondered what itd be a good character builder   i i think so too i think so too um because theres so many um kids who have uh you know so much money and so much free time and uh nothing to do um and and nothing to give their time to   huh umhum umhum   um they dont even have a direction to give their their time to so i think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time in in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government   right   you know as uh aids to uh you know Congress uh people   umhum   so um yeah it would be uh itd be really good i think   umhum well people that are um have received sentences in jail they have uh some of them are going out and doing uh they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is is good   uhhuh right oh yeah oh yeah i agree with you yeah this is something that um like you say its its character building um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish and um   umhum    umhum well i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood uh   umhum right umhum umhum yeah   some of the people how they live or   oh i agree with you i agree with you and and i think uh young people are so um uh focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that uh   you know umhum umhum   you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about uh you know doing that that public service would be great yeah   umhum umhum umhum yeah because thats one thing thats hard with young people you you cant tell them how things are they have to see for themselves and   right umhum   now of course this might be after theyve gone through their teen years i dont know what their thought is on what age that this should be done   oh yeah i would think so like right after um high school you know even even if it was like the the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months   uhhuh umhum of course theyve already gone through the period of time where they need more direction   umhum   you know they their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go   uhhuh uhhuh   and something course now Peace Corps that couldnt be done of course until they were done with school   right right   in such   you know something that was that was outside of uh outside of school   umhum   yeah but yeah you know right right after you graduate from uh high school because a lot of people are just um uh well gee whiz what do i do now if if theyre not focused on going to college and uh you know having that that uh gung ho plan uh thats you know setting their life goals   umhum umhum umhum kind of an in between time   umhum umhum yeah so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know uh teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school   yeah umhum   but as for it being required  you know were were just not were not based on on on that uh type of a system um   yeah huhuh no and and like i said not now all young people should be able to do something but   umhum   not all certainly would be geared to even the the Mormon boys that go out not all of them go i mean its disaster if they dont go but  but some of them are not theyre just not made to do that type of thing   right oh right uhhuh uhhuh   and they just arent able to do it   yeah yeah so um yeah itd be good but like i said it requiring it would be uh   but
