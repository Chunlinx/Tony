                                 The Mystery of Life            Last month the New YorkTimes reviewed a book by Michael J Behe a biochemist from LehighUniversity Titled Darwins Black Box The Biochemical Challenge toEvolution  the book contended that the molecular machinery of living thingsworks too well to have been produced by chance alone Life must have beendesigned by some intelligent being possibly one that was divine Reading thereviewsurprisingly respectful considering that its author was a sciencewriterI had to smile imagining the veinpopping fury that it would arouse inRichard Dawkins Fools he would mutter  I am surrounded byfools                        Dawkinsan evolutionary biologist at the Oxford University is the most brilliant andcompelling propagandist of Darwin today as Wired recently put it Heis also an adamant atheist His work is basically one long argument thatnatural selection and natural selection alone is sufficient to explain theseemingly miraculous variety beauty and ingenuity of living things Themystery of life he declared in his  best seller The BlindWatchmaker  is a mystery no longer because Darwin solved it            Dawkins is one of those rare scientists whose writings bothpersuade his peers and charm the public He excels at coining pithy phrases andmetaphors that express anew the power of Darwinian theory In his first bookThe Selfish Gene  published in  he set forth his brutallyreductionist view that all organisms are vehicles created by genes seeking tomake copies of themselves In The Extended Phenotype  heintroduced the notion that culture consists of selfreplicating ideas calledmemes As many profilers of Dawkins have remarked Dawkins himself is one ofthe most successful memepropagators on the planet            His latest book ClimbingMount Improbable  is erected around yet another compelling meme Dawkinsasks us to imagine the myriad forms of life inhabiting a vast mountain At itsfoot are the least complexand hence most probableorganisms such asbacteria and algae On the peaks are species that seem least likely to havebeen produced by happenstance such as spiders whose webs are marvels ofengineering            Dawkinsreminds us that natural selection produces such creatures through a series ofincremental steps that smear out their improbability over long periods oftime To reinforce this point he tells us how he constructed a computerprogram that with only a few rules for guidance could learn to constructwebs remarkably similar to those built by real spiders                           A s in his previous books Dawkins tendency toward donnishdidacticism is more than counterbalanced by the transparency of his prose andhis genuine delight in the intricacies of nature His description toward theend of Climbing                Mount Improbable of wasps enmeshed in Byzantinepower struggles with fig trees is a model of nature writing at once lyricaland lucid            In an erawhen even reputable scientists indulge in mysticism Dawkins rejection ofintelligent design is also bracing He openly loathes those who discern divineintentions behind natural phenomena such as fundamentalist Christians who viewthe AIDS virus as divine punishment for sodomites Dawkins spares no one Hedescribes a conversation in which his yearold daughter speculated thatflowers were put on earth to make the world pretty I was touched by thisDawkins recalls and sorry I had to tell her that it wasnt true            Despite its blunt charms however Climbing MountImprobable strikes me as being the least convincing of all of Dawkinsbooks In focusing on the notion of lifes improbabilityor lackthereofDawkins has inadvertently drawn attention to the greatest weakness ofDarwinian theory There has always been something disturbingly retroactiveafterthefact about natural selection as an explanation of life even whenpropounded by someone as eloquent as Dawkins Life explained by naturalselection alone just does not seem inevitable enough            Addressingthis issue Dawkins sometimes resembles a flack for Lotto assuring us thatwinning the big one is easy He allows that at first glance it seems almostmiraculous that Joe Blow would win the  million jackpot But by retracingthe steps that culminated in Joes good fortunethe printing of the fatefulticket Joes purchase of it at his local liquor store the selection of thatnumber by Lotto officialsDawkins demonstrates that each conforms towellunderstood principles of physics biology and social science no miracleswere required Well true enough But that does not make Joe any lesslucky            It is not only religious creationists who arebothered by this problem but also some prominent scientists At the Santa FeInstitute biologist Stuart Kauffman claims to have glimpseddeep in hiscomputer simulationsa mysterious antichaos force that counteracts thetendency of all physical systems to drift toward disorder This forcesupposedly makes stars selforganize into galaxies and inanimate moleculesinto living cells            Othertheorists notably David Sloan Wilson of the State University of New York atBinghamton have proposed that natural selection may sometimes favoraltruistic individuals who sacrifice their own selfish interests for thoseof their herd or their species or even the entire ecosystem in which they areembedded The most extreme version of this concept called group selectionis Gaia which suggests that all of life cooperates so as to ensure itscontinued survival            Dawkins has rebutted these notions convincingly showingthat the phenomena they attempt to explain can all be accounted for withconventional Darwinian theory But his defenses of natural selection sometimeslend it more power than it really has In one passage for example he likensit to a force or pressure that drives evolution up the slopes of MountImprobable This image offers a grossly distorted view of evolution Forroughly  percent of lifes  billionyear history it was entirely made upof singlecelled organisms such as bacteria and algae Then for somereasonwe will probably never know precisely whythe era of trilobitestriceratops and other multicellular creatures commenced Viewed this way theascent from the foothills of Mount Improbable to its multicellular aerieshardly seems inevitable            Dawkins own honesty andthoroughness undermine his case in other ways as wellfor example when hebrings up the origin of life My guess is that life probably isnt all thatrare and the origin of life probably wasnt all that improbable Dawkinsremarks But there are arguments to the contrary There certainly areDawkins himself notes that after decades of searching scientists have found noconclusive evidence that life exists elsewhere in the universe The discoveryof organic matter in a meteorite reported in early August represents at bestan extremely circumstantial piece of evidence for life on Mars            Moreoveras far as we know life emerged here on earth only once In spite of theimmensely powerful tools of modern biotechnology scientists still cannot makematter animate in the laboratory They really have no idea how exactly lifebegan or whether its emergence was in some sense inevitable or simply aprodigious bit of good fortune            Theorists also disagree over why once lifebegan it was able to persist for so long and to proliferate into such anastonishing variety of species Dawkins enjoys pointing out that among all thepossible variants of a given species the vast majority never reproduce theyare failures dead ends There are many more ways to be a loser in the game oflife he asserts than to be a success Surely that holds true for all of lifenot just for its constituent parts The essence of the selfishgene model isthat each individual pursues its shortterm interests regardless of thelongterm consequences for life as a whole or even for other members of thespecies Given that premise why couldnt one speciesa bacterium or virusperhapsrun amok and destroy all other life on earth before finally succumbingitself But life has managed nonetheless not only to endure but also toproduce spiders newts and congressmen            I know Dawkins knows howutterly improbable we are because I have discussed the matter with him Yet heseems to think that if he allows us weakminded mortals to perceive that nakedtruth too directly we will succumb to creationism or mysticism or theoriessuch as Gaia which is wishful thinking dressed up as science Of course mostof us will succumb But Dawkins should at least give us the chance to savor oneof the great paradoxes of our era before we slip into darkness The more thatscience explains our existence the more implausible we seem
