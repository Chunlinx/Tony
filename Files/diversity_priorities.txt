address the identified issuesovercome the challenges and obstacles and to promote justicefairness and inclusionIn order to facilitate the ability of the participants to workfrom an agreed upon set of facts about themselves the facilitatorsdivided the conferees into three groups Each group represented atime in the history of legal services  The Past  years agoThe Present and The Future  years from now Each group was thenasked to answer the same set of questions about their particularera The thoughts and observations of each group are reportedbelowThe PastKey constituents included clients and communitybasedorganizations local bar associations client advisory committeesLSC other funders such as United Way and policy advocates likeNLADAThe client community included a high number of welfarerecipients was majority white and female with some regionaldifferences and included some undocumented individuals elderlynonworking poor and prisonersProgram staff was less diverse Fewer women worked inlegal services particularly as lawyers Management then was almostexclusively white male younger and inexperienced There werefewer indigenous staff membersProgram staff members were treated with a sink or swimattitude Although they were expected to handle large caseloadsalmost immediately they were also freer to pursue an issue areaand develop themselves professionally through that pursuit Programleaders believed that poverty could be eradicated and accordinglystaff energies were often focused on impact work rather than onaccess Legal services organizations were centered on theeradication of poverty and promoting equality and justice andindependenceAlthough there was concern about diversity there wasneither real dedication to making it happen nor any realaccountability with one exception  the importance of hiringAfrican American attorneys and having African Americanrepresentation on boards in regions where African Americanpopulations resided Other than that little attention was given toretaining and promoting people of color women people withdisabilities and others who reflected the client communityHowever there was an awareness of the need to hire nonlegal stafffrom the communities being served and this meant that staffworkforces often consisted of male white attorneys and femaleparaprofessional staffSome litigation was discriminationbased ie schooldesegregation and voting rights casesStaff training was usually not a priority for individualprograms and was generally provided by state and national backupcentersSome national organizations recognized the need forgreater gender diversity and pursued activities to bring women intothe legal services workforceThe PresentTodays key constituents include governing and policyboards and clients those being served and those not being servedOther constituents are Congress state and local bar associationscourt systems new funders IOLTA state government Department ofJustice Violence Against Women Office old funders LSC UnitedWay state and local governments staff social and human servicesorganizations and civil rights and other advocacy groups most ofwhich did not exist  years agoThe client community has changed Women senior citizensand the working poor still need our services but new groups haveemerged Programs are now expected to serve gay lesbian andtransgendered persons persons with AIDS children homelesspeople more immigrants many of whom do not speak English and havecomplex problems persons with disabilities unemployed personspeople of color rural and urban lowincome people people fromdepressed areas and those with mental illnessOur staffs include more women people with disabilitiesindividuals from the community eligible clients gay lesbian andtransgendered persons people of color people from diverseeconomic backgrounds and single and married parents These staffmembers tend to embrace the belief that each person who needs alawyer should have one and that this is critical to moving peopleout of poverty However although motivated by the desire to serveand empower all people with legal problems programs pragmaticallyrecognize the need to prioritize and focus their legal work on thecommunitys most serious problemsThe Present values include a commitment to quality workand respect for clientsTodays programs emphasize such activities as trainingand CLE opportunities for staff mentoring team building andstrategic planning Programs are exploring flexible work schedulesincentive awards higher salaries and loan forgiveness initiativesStaff are encouraged to be active in the community and in barassociation activitiesMany programs hold diversity training sessions for staffand boards Recruitment and retention efforts often reflect theimportance of a diverse workplace and the commitment of board andstaff to this value Client communities are more diverse andprograms have more bilingual staff members Offices are moreaccessible to people with disabilities in part because of theAmericans with Disabilities Act In some programs managementstructures have become broader to accommodate new supervisors andapproaches Some managers have shown themselves willing to addressuncomfortable issues give up power and make difficult financialcommitments to achieve a diverse work environment Nonethelessserious diversity challenges continue to affect ourcommunityA concern in the Present is translating the nationaldialogue on diversity to local action How can programs strengthentheir efforts to hire and retain a diverse staff as well as developdiverse leadership How do we encourage programs to hire people ofcolor women people with disabilities gays and lesbians and othernonmajority employees How do we create opportunities forminorities and women and younger staff to advance How do weengage Boards of Directors in these effortsTodays diversity approaches stress inclusion of peopleof color people with disabilities gays lesbians older peopleand women In the Present we recognize that barriers are notexcuses We realize that diversity can help programs reach clientsin a more appropriate and useful way and we recognize the need toincrease staff communication skills including fluency in languagesother than English We acknowledge that sharing power is often keyto achieving diversity in program leadershipThe FutureKey constituents will include older and aging clientsThe client population will be multinational due to the continuinginflux of immigrants There will be more women children andemployed people along with those with mental healthneedsCommunity partnerships will expand enhanced by thegrowth of state justice communities and the many stakeholdersengaged in state planning The importance and impact of nonLSCfunders will increaseStaff members will reflect the community population andinclude more people with second and third languages and individualswho are immigrants or

growand new definitions of diversity and leadership will be crafted Wewill pursue affirmativechallenges to institutional oppression and disparate treatmentWe will concern ourselves with the clash between groups as a resultof changing demographics and with the clash between the law andour vision for inclusion as a justice imperativeTHE NEED FOR A DIVERSE WORKFORCE WITHIN THE LEGAL SERVICESCOMMUNITYTurning to the importance of diversity participants agreed thatgiving diversity concerns their time energy attention andresources will generate big dividends Participants agreed that adiverse staff creates a better product and strengthens client trustin the program They felt that a diverse environment fosterspersonal growth and leads to an appreciation of differences inothers Diversity allows us to tap into human genius inspirationand excitement It makes us aware of the special needs ofdisenfranchised groups It empowers clients and staff strengthensthe organization and improves ties to other groupsHowever participants also agreed that a highly diverse staff isnot achieved without certain difficulties Diversity pioneersoften feel the fatigue and isolation of being the only or among afew people of color women persons with disabilities gays orother representatives of minority groups in their officeProponents of increased diversity may face criticism from staff orsupervisors for spending too much time on diversity Since legalservices people often think of themselves as progressives whodont need further education on issues of inclusion makingdiversity work within programs is not easy and requires the supportand the guidance of committed leaders Helping staff and boardsarrive at a common vision necessitates honest and sometimesdifficult conversationsAll participants agreed on the followingTurning words into action requires establishing goals andsetting realistic timeframes and benchmarks without setting an enddateSuccess is easier to obtain if people are not madedefensiveFraming diversity efforts in positive and practical termswill allow proponents to move beyond the moral imperativeapproachBudgets and other resources must be revised to supportthe new effortPolicies will need to be strengthened to accommodate moreaggressive and urgent strategiesBuilding and retaining a diverse staff and board is a majorchallenge for most programs Many conferees believe that increasingsalaries and benefits and developing loan forgiveness programs willgo a long way to attracting a more diverse staff Seeingopportunities for advancement and leadership positions in programsis critical to retaining women people of color and otherindividuals who contribute to a diverse staff An active andauthentic commitment to diversity throughout each program isessential A core group can begin the work but structural andprogrammatic changes  mentoring opportunities to talk about realproblems and see solutions implemented power sharing diverseboards of Directors new definitions of leadership will benecessary to achieve lasting change All conferees agreed that aprograms belief in the value of diversity is best shown by theextent to which it devotes time money and people to achievingitCRITICAL ISSUESAfter identifying the benefits and challenges of focusing ondiversity and developing strategies to maximize the benefits andovercome the challenges participants

yearsParticipants gave issues  and  the same number of votes tyingthem for third placeConferees found that programs lacked a common definition andvision of diversity Some felt that there had been loss
