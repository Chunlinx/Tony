                    Background        Gene duplications are traditionally considered to be a        major evolutionary source of new protein functions The        conventional view pioneered by Susumu Ohno holds that a        gene duplication produces two functionally redundant        paralogous genes and thereby frees one of them from        selective constraints This unconstrained paralog is then        free to accumulate neutral mutations that would have been        deleterious in a unique gene   Although the most likely        outcome of such neutral evolution is for one of the        paralogs to fix a null mutation and become a pseudogene        there is also the possibility of fixation of mutations that        lead to a new function              One of the predictions of the conventional model of        evolution of duplicated genes is the rapid loss of paralogs        due to null mutations      However this        prediction was not supported by studies on isozyme spectra        of polyploids in a number of organisms reviewed in          Furthermore a study of  pairs of duplicated genes in the        tetraploid frog         Xenopus laevis has shown that both        copies were subject to purifying selection   contrary        to the notion of neutrality of one of the copies   The        failure of empirical research to support Ohnos model has        led to the proposal of two alternative hypotheses        The subfunctionalization hypothesis is based on the        same assumption as Ohnos model namely that duplicated        genes are redundant in function and accordingly a        duplication event is selectively neutral    However        it was argued that as natural selection does not know        which duplicated gene should be under selection and which        is free of selective constraint both paralogs experience a        period of relaxed selection and accelerated evolution        During this period both genes might accumulate mutations        that impair different functions of the ancestral gene so        that after a certain point none of the paralogs is        capable of substituting for the ancestor           The second hypothesis holds that a gene duplication that        leads to a new function is preceded by a period of gene        sharing such that the original unduplicated gene encodes        two distinct functions When two paralogs of such a        bifunctional gene are produced by duplication each may be        driven by positive selection to specialize in one of these        functions which it performs more efficiently than the        ancestor gene leading to the creation of two indispensable        genes with distinct functions          The strong interest in the evolution of gene        duplications stems from the notion that duplication leads        to new functions     With the increasing        availability of genomic data it became clear that numerous        gene families have diverged in function through series of        duplications    including many lineagespecific        expansions identified in each of the genomes sequenced             Such creation of novel gene functions        obviously provides a longterm but not a shortterm          advantage for gene duplication        Duplicated genes have also been observed to affect        fitness immediately after duplication see Discussion        providing a shortterm advantage for duplication Although        these observations remained largely unnoticed by        evolutionary biologists investigating the evolution of gene        duplications such shortterm advantage is crucial to the        longterm fate of a duplication as group selection favoring        a duplication because of its longterm advantage cannot        overcome the individual selection that depends exclusively        on shortterm effects   A recent genomewide analysis        of duplicated genes of eukaryotes has suggested that they        evolve under purifying selection with an apparent early        phase of relaxed constraint or even nearneutrality          Here we show that the same pattern of purifying selection        is observed among bacterial and archaeal paralogs and        demonstrate that aminoacid substitution rate is greater in        paralogs than in orthologs with the same level of        divergence at synonymous sites We also present evidence in        support of genomewide shortterm advantage of duplicated        genes and discuss its relevance to the evolution of new        gene functions                    Results        We identified recent gene duplications in  bacterial        six archaeal and three eukaryotic complete genomes two        completely sequenced chromosomes from         Arabidopsis  and among the available        sequences from three mammalian species  human mouse and        rat Table  Because the duplications were identified        through the similarity of fulllength protein sequences        see Materials and methods this procedure primarily if        not exclusively detected functional genes rather than        pseudogenes For comparison orthologs with no apparent        recent duplications were identified in pairs of closely        related organisms namely the bacteria         Chlamydia trachomatis and         C muridarum  orthologous        pairsand two strains of         Helicobacter pylori         orthologous pairs and the three mammals         orthologous pairs        Selection was measured in terms of the ratio of the rate        of nonsynonymous substitutions K         n  which are usually subject to        selective pressure to the rate of synonymous substitutions        K         s  which are assumed to be nearly        neutral A K         n K         s ratio of  is assumed to indicate        neutrality K         n K         s   is a signature of positive        selection at the aminoacid level and K         n K         s   is indicative of purifying        selection which is the most common mode of selection           Such analysis is applicable to homologs with a        relatively low level of divergence in which synonymous        substitutions have not yet reached saturation        In all genomes analyzed the nonsynonymous substitution        rate was significantly lower than the synonymous        substitution rate such that K         n K         s   Figure aband Table         in agreement with the recent genomewide study of paralogs          Pairwise comparisons of the K         n K         s values for different clades revealed        that the strength of selection was generally similar in        bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic sets of paralogous        genes although apparently stronger selection was observed        among the yeast paralogs and weaker selection was seen in        mammalian paralogs Tables          The observation that K         n  K         s for most of the recently diverged        paralogs is in itself not sufficient to conclude that        both paralogs in each pair are subject to purifying        selection The same result would have been obtained if in        accordance with Ohnos original model one of the paralogs        was free from selective constraints whereas the other one        was maintained by purifying selection Therefore we        carried out a relative rate test on aminoacid        substitutions   on those pairs of paralogs for which        an ortholog was available that was more distant from either        of the paralogs than the paralogs were from each other        orthologs that were too distant to be used for the        relative rate test were discarded see Materials and        methods A comparison of the evolutionary distances        between each of the paralogs and the ortholog used as an        outgroup showed that of a total of  analyzed pairs        only five evolve at significantly          p   different rate The        proportions of paralogous pairs that evolved at        significantly different rates in each of the analyzed        clades are shown in Table  Thus in the majority of cases        at least both paralogs evolved under similar levels of        purifying selection in agreement with the results of an        early analysis of  pairs of paralogs from         X laevis and a more recent analysis        of  pairs of paralogs in human and teleost lineages                  We next sought to compare the strength of purifying        selection acting on paralogs to that acting on orthologs        with the same level of sequence divergence which were        identified as bidirectional best hits   between two        pairs of bacterial genomes          C trachomatisC muridarum and two        strains of         H pylori  and three pairs of        mammalian species humanmouse humanrat and mouserat        The results of this comparison indicated that paralogs were        subject to significantly weaker purifying selection than        similarly diverged orthologs compare Figure aand c band        d Specifically the K         n K         s ratio for orthologs was approximately        twice the ratio for paralogs in bacteria and approximately        three times the ratio for paralogs in mammals Table                Because we restricted our gene comparisons to cases in        which the synonymous divergence rate K         s  did not exceed  substitutions per        site a substantial part of the humanrodent orthologous        comparisons was excluded from the analysis Figure d The        use of the orthologous comparisons with a lower K         s  and thus with potentially stronger        selection in the synonymous sites could in principle        bias our comparison of the K         n K         s ratio To rule out this possibility        we calculated the K         n K         s ratio for the center of the rodent        orthologous comparisons   K         s   and compared it to the K         n K         s ratio of paralogs within the same        range of K         s  The difference in the K         n K         s ratio in this range of K         s  in paralogs versus  in        orthologs was not substantially dif ferent from the        difference between the K         n K         s ratios for   K         s   Table  Extrapolating this        observation to the humanrodent comparisons it appears        most likely that the exclusion of the humanrodent        orthologous pairs with K         s   did not substantially bias        the results        Weak selection acting on synonymous sites or differences        in mutation bias among related species might potentially        result in homogeneity of codon usage in genes within one        genome which would translate into a much greater        heterogeneity of codon vocabulary in orthologous genes        compared to paralogous genes Under this scenario        synonymous divergence could be substantially underestimated        for paralogous but not for orthologous genes in our        dataset falsely suggesting an acceleration of evolution of        aminoacid substitutions larger K         n K         s values in paralogous genes If there        was such homogeneity of codon usage in paralogous genes        paralogs should show a greater correlation between codon        bias and K         s values than orthologs This prediction        is not supported by linear leastsquare regressions which        fail to detect any substantial differences in the        correlation between K         s and codon bias in paralogous versus        orthologous genes data not shown suggesting that the        observation of a higher K         n K         s ratio in paralogous genes cannot be        explained by an underestimate of synonymous divergence in        paralogs        Because genes with different functions evolve at        different rates    the observed relaxation of        selection in paralogs could potentially be due to an        overrepresentation of fastevolving genes in the        paralogous gene set In an attempt to isolate the effect of        duplication         per se on purifying selection we        analyzed paralogs and orthologs that appeared to encode        proteins with similar functions namely secreted and        membrane proteins that were identified by signal peptide        and transmembrane helix prediction The difference in the K                n K         s ratios for paralogous versus        orthologous genes was approximately the same for the        predicted secreted and membrane proteins as it was for the        complete analyzed gene sets Table  indicating that the        acceleration of evolution probably is an inherent feature        of duplicated genes                    Discussion        The present analysis confirms the earlier observations        that paralogs evolve under purifying selection   which        typically acts with similar strength on both duplicated        copies of genes    Additionally however we found        that paralogs evolve significantly faster than unduplicated        genes with a similar level of divergence which is        compatible with the notion that gene duplications are a        source of new protein functions        The inconsistency of empirical evidence with Ohnos        model prompts questions on the validity of some of the        assumptions underlying this model One major assumption        which was inherited by the subfunctionalization model is        that one gene copy is sufficient to perform the respective        function so that a gene duplication is redundant and has        no effect on fitness    This notion has been widely        accepted and often becomes one of the central postulates        of models of duplicated gene evolution             Should this be the case however a duplication event would        only very rarely achieve fixation    moreover in        the event that a duplication is slightly deleterious it        would be effectively prevented from achieving fixation                 Although the notion of duplication producing redundant        genes is central to current theories of duplicated gene        evolution the shortterm benefits of gene duplications are        well known This is illustrated by the numerous        observations of adaptive gene amplifications in response to        antibiotics     anticancer drug treatments and        exposure to various toxins        or        heavy metals       nutrient limitations                 pesticide treatments            extreme temperatures    and symbiotic and        parasitic interactions    Combining this        information with the observations that recently duplicated        genes evolve under purifying selection   and our        present work it seems reasonable to hypothesize that a        majority of duplicated genes that achieve fixation in a        population increase fitness when present in two or more        copies in a genome and thus are subject to purifying        selection from the moment of duplication        Recently duplicated paralogs appear to be a nonrandom        group enriched in genes coding for proteins involved in        different aspects of the organisms interaction with the        environment see Additional data files In particular a        substantial fraction of these paralogs encode predicted        membrane or secreted proteins The prevalent functions of        duplicated genes varied among different organisms In        bacteria the majority of these genes encoded different        types of surface molecules which in pathogens are        involved in interaction with substrate cells In yeast        there was an emphasis on membrane transporters as well as        on genes involved in stress response for example heat        shock In multicellular eukaryotes receptors for        example olfactory receptors and predicted secreted        signaling molecules were predominant Proteins with a        predicted signal peptide were more prevalent in         Arabidopsis thaliana  of all        paralogs versus  of all unduplicated genes from the        proteome         Caenorhabditis elegans  among        paralogs versus  among unduplicated genes and         Drosophila melanogaster  in        paralogs versus  in orthologs and predicted membrane        proteins were more numerous in mammals  in paralogs        versus  in unduplicated genes Each of these        differences in the functional composition of the sets of        paralogs and unduplicated genes were statistically highly        significant p    test        A number of genes for which amplification has been shown        to have a role in adaptation to various conditions were        among the recent duplicates in our dataset Examples        include genes for the yeast hexose transporter whose        amplification has been shown to increase fitness in a        lowglucose environment   the nematode Pglycoprotein        gene the classical eukaryotic multidrugresistance gene          and the fruit fly copperbinding metallothionein gene        whose duplication is implicated in copper tolerance           Many genes that are known to amplify in response to        selection primarily during anticancer drug treatments        were found to be present in multiple copies in mammalian        genomes as well in particular aminoacyltRNA synthetases        glutamine synthetase and other anabolic enzymes adenosine        deaminase ornithine decarboxylase AMP deaminase and         N acetyl glucosaminyltransferase           Permeases transporters synthetases and various        detoxification enzymes which in general tend to amplify        as a response to stressful conditions               also showed a substantial presence among the recently        duplicated genes in all species see Additional data        files Duplication of genes belonging to these functional        groups is thought to be adaptive because increase in the        production of the corresponding proteins may either        increase the efficiency of transport of a nutrient into the        cell or of toxins out of the cell increase the rate of        catabolism of toxic substances or allow a greater rate of        synthesis of metabolites for example amino acids that are        required in increased amounts under the given conditions                      Thus the observation that purifying selection appears        to act on all recent duplicates and examination of the        functions of recently duplicated genes do not support the        notion that gene duplication results in true functional        redundancy and duplications may achieve fixation despite        being redundant   The alternative hypothesis  that        gene duplications are fixed in a population by positive        selection in all organisms  is supported by a combination        of evidence of adaptive duplications from many types of        living organisms prokaryotes                 protists     plants    fungi           invertebrates       nonmammalian        vertebrates   as well as mammalian somatic tissues             Combining these observations with the        suggestion that gene duplication may be a general mechanism        of adaptation to various conditions of environmental stress                   we suggest that        in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes most paralogs that are        fixed in a population have a direct effect on fitness from        the moment of duplication and aid in the adaptation to        various environmental conditions primarily through a        protein dosage effect        That the shortterm benefit of a gene duplication is a        direct effect on protein dosage also stems from a variety        of experimental observations in a number of organisms        prokaryotic and eukaryotic Gene duplication may be a        temporary mechanism to increase protein or RNA dosage as        in the case of rRNA genes in amphibian oocytes and ciliate        macronuclei the chorion genes in some dipterans actin        genes in chicken as well as drug transporters in somatic        tissues see    for reviews Protein dosage effects        have also been demonstrated in a number of other studies of        inheritable adaptive gene duplications                   Furthermore there is evidence        from the analysis of the yeast genome that duplicated genes        tend to be from those sets of functions that are more        highly expressed   supporting a general role for        selection on protein dosage in duplicated genes        We show here a substantial acceleration of evolution in        recently diverged paralogs compared to orthologs with the        same level of synonymous sequence divergence This        acceleration may be explained by positive selection or by a        relaxation of purifying selection or by a combination of        the two A few cases of differentiation of paralogs driven        by positive selection have been described             however such cases are notoriously difficult to        uncover Thus we make no attempt here to examine in        greater detail the selective forces that act on duplicated        genes In general however only a small fraction of sites        in some genes appears to evolve under positive selection          and relaxation of purifying selection is likely to be        the main mechanism behind the acceleration of evolution        after duplication        Our claim of the prevalence of the protein dosage effect        as the shortterm advantage of duplicated genes is not        incompatible with the possibility of a longterm advantage        in terms of new functions or the observation that        duplicated genes evolve at a faster rate Indeed evolution        of a new beneficial function in one of the duplicates once        a relatively high level of divergence which will be        different for different genes depending on the specific        function involved is reached appears to be common among        duplicated genes as demonstrated for several paralogous        gene families      Inasmuch as this happens        positive selection might contribute to the observed        acceleration of evolution in duplicated genes        However assuming that gene duplications primarily        evolve under purifying selection at least soon after        duplication the observed acceleration of evolution may be        explained by epistatic interaction between gene copies In        the absence of epistasis a fitness function is an        exponential function that depends on a single additive        variable called fitness potential             Assuming that the acceleration of evolution observed in        paralogs is primarily due to a relaxation of purifying        selection the fitness potential variable describing the        fitness function of diverging gene copies can be thought of        as the effective amount of functional protein which        depends both on gene duplication and point mutations        Assuming that all point mutations are equally deleterious        such that it takes for example  point mutations to        eliminate the increase in the amount of functional protein        resulting from one duplication         p          d          m  where         p is the fitness potential         d is the number of gene copies and         m is the number of deleterious point        mutations By definition in the absence of epistasis        selection against a deleterious mutation is constant for        all values of the fitness potential        However if a fitness function grows at a less than        exponential rate then a relaxation of selection against        deleterious mutations is expected      For        example consider a linear fitness function f         p            p  In this case the fitness of an        organism with one gene copy is f         p            p     and the fitness of the        same organism with one point mutation is f         p            p           d          m        thus the        mutation reduced fitness by     The fitness of        an organism with two gene copies is f         p            p     the fitness of the same        organism with two gene copies and one point mutation is f         p        in this        case the same mutation will cause only a  reduction in        fitness  Thus the observed acceleration of        evolution in paralogous genes implies that either their        divergence occurs under positive selection or that the        fitness function for gene duplications grows at a slower        than exponential rate        Experimental evidence from several organisms supports        the notion that the increase of fitness due to gene        duplication is far from being exponential more        specifically under static environmental conditions there        is an optimal gene copy number     As        duplication events are known to incur a fitness cost           the fitness function of duplicated genes most probably        resembles an inverted parabola such that it contains a        clearly defined maximum    Numerous observations        that gene duplications that increase protein dosage can be        pathogenic       further support the model        of optimum copy number for each gene        Thus it seems reasonable to hypothesize that for each        gene there is an optimum number of copies per genome that        may vary depending on environmental conditions Assuming        that the environmental condition that determines the        optimum gene number fluctuates positive selection would        regulate the gene copy number in the genome accordingly        Under this model if environmental conditions and        therefore the number of gene copies fluctuate frequently        then most paralogs will be closely related such that an        excess of nearly identical genes will be found within a        genome as indeed has been observed for many genomes          and data not shown        The present observation that duplicated genes experience        a substantial relaxation of selection compared to        unduplicated genes is compatible with the traditional view        that gene duplications make a major contribution to the        evolution of new gene functions Additionally the        repertoire of protein functions among recent duplicates        suggests that many gene duplications contribute to        adaptation of the organism to various forms of        environmental stress The results of the present analysis        of recent duplications suggest a twostage evolutionary        model of gene duplication in the first stage immediately        after duplication and during the early phase of their        evolution paralogs are retained and are subject to        purifying selection because of the shortterm advantage of        protein dosage regulation at a later stage in their        evolution gene duplications are likely to provide a        longterm advantage by enabling the creation of new        functions                    Materials and methods                  Genome sequence data          The complete genome sequences of bacteria and archaea          the yeast           Saccharomyces cerevisiae  the          nematode           C elegans and the fruit fly           D melanogaster  and the sequences          of chromosomes II and IV of the thale cress           A thaliana were extracted from the          Genomes division of the Entrez retrieval system            The complete sequences of cDNAs from mouse rat and          humans were extracted from GenBank                          Data analysis          Clusters of paralogs were identified by comparing the          protein sequences encoded by all genes from each genome          using the BLASTP program   followed by singlelinkage          clustering using the BLASTCLUST program I          Dondoshansky YIW and EVK unpublished results            Each cluster included sequences that aligned over          at least  of their lengths with a score density of           bits per position which approximately corresponds to           identity Probable orthologs were operationally defined          as bidirectional best hits between proteins from two          genomes   A subset of probable orthologous pairs          that met the criteria used for identification of paralogs          score density of  bitposition and aligned over at          least  of their lengths was selected Orthologous          pairs in which one or both of the members was identified          as part of a paralogous cluster were excluded from          further analysis to ensure a set of unique genes in the          orthologous dataset          Protein sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W          program   and the corresponding nucleotidesequence          alignments were derived by substituting the respective          coding sequences for the protein sequences The number of          synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site          K           s  and the number of nonsynonymous          nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site K           n  were estimatedusing the          PamiloBianchiLi method    Families of paralogs          that included more than two genes were separated into all          possible pairs and each pair was subjected to the same          analysis after which an average of both K           s and K           n was taken and used as a single          point However only paralogous clusters with two          paralogs were used for the relative rate test For the          substitution rate calculations the data from           bacterial genomes six archaeal genomes and three          mammalian genomes were combined into three          kingdomspecific datasets the remaining eukaryotic          genomes were analyzed independently The substitution          rates for orthologous gene pairs were calculated using          the same approach Pairs of paralogs and orthologs with K                    s   which approach saturation          in synonymous sites and those with K           s   which are subject to          statistical and databaseannotation errors were excluded          from all calculations of the K           n K           s ratios          For the relative rate test the closest ortholog from          the same taxon was identified for each pair of paralogs          To ensure correct identification those ortholog          candidates that were closer to either of the paralogs          than the paralogs were to each other were discarded In          the remaining triplets which consisted of an ortholog          and two paralogs           p

from the multiple          alignment The conversion between           p distances and corresponding          evolutionary distances           D           OP            D           OP and           D           PP  was carried out using the          gammadistance correction    with an  parameter          of  The significance of the difference between           P           OP and           P           OP was estimated using the normalized          deviation            P           OP            P           OP            P           OP             P           OP L           P            P

        difference between the paralogs evolutionary rates           D           OPmax and           D           OPmin were calculated as            D           OP            D           OP

calculated in the same          manner as for the real           P           OP and           P           OP  Triplets that failed to yield          significant difference between           P           OPmax and           P           OPmin because of paralogs being too          similar were discarded because no amount of evolutionary          pressure resulting in different rates of evolution in          paralogs  and  would be sufficient to produce a          significant difference in           P           OP and           P           OP on such short evolutionary          distances
