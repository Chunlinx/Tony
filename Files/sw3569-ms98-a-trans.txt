            what what how do you get your main source of current events   well until until recently i was taking the Wall Street Journal and i thought that was a good way but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things you know its a week or two late but uh thats how im staying up   i either watch the news or i or occasionally occasionally ill read the paper     uh do you like how its presented on the news   um no i think the medias a little bit too manipulative they  allow you uh uh they they try to lead you too much i believe and and sometimes theyre not very open i i dont know i think theyre a little bit biased sometimes like for example the Kennedy uh the Kennedy rape case the the coverage on that was   it it   you know when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty and you you you know they they they try to have you form opinions or whatever and and then i didnt i didnt like the things uh the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that you know basically i i i think they dont present the the whole sides of of everything   so it it makes you feel like theyre uh wanting you to take their opinion   right uh its it its uh its instead of reporting the news uh its more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues   yeah ive noticed that too and its kind of distressing isnt it   yeah   and they just ive noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words   well when i when i was in school i um i i was a communications major so im im im im im im well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and and so forth   so communications huh were you looking into becoming a reporter or     i was and um um i went i ventured off in a whole entire different field field um i work with the state   uhhuh   and uh i um work with the Department of State Treasury in retirement disability uh calculate benefits   i bet thats a interesting job   yeah so the and so i and you know work is you know working for state government you you hear all about current events about about things going on within the state itself so that thats another source that i i i i where i keep up with current events and   yeah theres one that im reading right now its Information Week it says ATT to account for the the benefits that the AICPA now says you have to show as a liability its going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety three to account for that     its a lot of money   and itll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more           its a lot of money   yeah it is and yeah you have to stay up on stuff and i bet in your your job that you have to do you read the Wall Street Journal   no well no i i i i i primarily deal with the state employees but i i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the like the state of uh uh North Carolinas budget and stuff like that and i i really know what the budget is and and and uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they couldnt pay taxes and to pay people their income tax refunds and stuff like that and you know im well aware of the billions of assets the that the state has and its its its its just funny you you know so thats thats thats thats so i dont have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news of course its they they get what they hear from but you know its not always i i think one hundred percent reliable   do you can can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective   i think they need to do a little bit uh go into a little bit more depth uh and before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that because i mean another example is the uh AIDS issue or whatever that you know someone said oh i found a cure they immediately the headlines on the news or whatever is so and so has found a cure for AIDS and then two months later its discovered its not you know its uh before they before they come out with something like that they need to to research the the the matter i believe a little bit more   i guess they do that so they dont get scooped you know so they have the big story   well that that well yeah i i think i it i think the  the
