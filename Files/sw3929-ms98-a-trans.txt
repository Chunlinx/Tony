        go now what kinds of things do you like to listen to     good well my uh uh my interests lie mainly in classical music   is that right uhhuh   and uh uh uh although i wasnt raised with opera its something that ive i come to enjoy how about yourself   well actually i kind of like those same things myself and um uh i did uh study some music in school although im not um a musician i just took it kind of as an avocation and i sing with the Brookhaven singers over at Brookhaven College you must be familiar with that name living in Dallas   right absolutely   and uh they have um a lovely woman over there who um teaches singing and um has a Saturday class as well as private lessons and uh we go and we sing for some retirement homes and at the Botanical Gardens and things like that and uh really very very very enjoyable and i do try to get down to the symphony at least a couple of times a year and i didnt get down to the opera this year though but i have in the past um but anyway i do enjoy listening to especially the classical music that has some kind of a story line or a theme like Beethovens Pastoral and things like that where you can   sure   follow um through some of the mood of the of the melodies and not just have um you know a kind of mathematical arrangement of the notes which is   sound   also fascinating many times but i like that break of a kind of a story line sometimes what kind of uh pieces are your favorites   well i uh i tend to shy away from anyone who uh uh is born later than nineteen hundred   uhhuh   other than Aaron Copeland uh Aaron Copeland i enjoy   oh yeah uhhuh uhhuh what about Gershwin   oh Gershwin uh Gershwins uh i i i uh i i havent uh quite found jazz to be enjoyable and and and a lot of Gershwin has a a some of some of his work is a little uh has has has a touch enough enough of jazz uh   umhum umhum   that uh that uh is not particularly enjoyable for me to listen to the uh   umhum um   uh uh like i i i suspect my favorites uh are in the uh seventeenth and eighteenth century uh uh musicians uh id   umhum uhhuh   the uh oh theres one uh uh i guess more recent one with uh Copeland uh is uh Raspegie who uh i was always amazed that he was uh so contemporary uh contemporary   umhum   um but i uh uh i our family gets down to uh the Myerson relatively frequently it its our uh uh our one enjoyable uh if if we can make it to Saturday uh everythings okay   umhum umhum uhhuh   so its uh its a relatively busy uh activity we uh one uh very nice uh uh opportunity that weve had is the is the Dallas Chamber Orchestra   uhhuh oh really   that has uh uh uh actually its its its wonderful they they have a Sunday matinee that uh uh if you buy two season tickets the kids go free   umhum oh   and uh that gives us an opportunity to uh uh to take the to uh uh make sure the kids uh get uh get dressed up and and go to the symphony whether they want to or not and   umhum   and uh and they uh their they oblige us by falling asleep so least thats pretty good     how old are your children   theyre uh eleven nine and eight which is and its its nice in that uh   oh isnt that wonderful though umhum   in that uh their their you their they you can get real close to the uh to the chamber orchestra and see the music and watch the musicians its uh its a very intimate setting and the the musics really very good   umhum i bet it is now i have never heard them um that Myerson auditorium is really is really quite acoustically beautiful i i have to admit that um i had the privilege of going to the uh piano concert that uh Yefgenya Chessum who is a young uh Russian artist gave i guess it was just before Christmas time   right   and im telling and and it was no orchestra orchestra or anything it was just he   it was just a recital   and yes and im telling you the sound the sound was so so perfect uh i i had heard you know the orchestra the symphony and we went for the toy symphony and the young childrens um uh uh orchestra from SMU and   oh umhum right   several things down there this is the first time i just heard like one artist and   right
