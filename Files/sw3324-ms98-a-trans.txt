        okay well just to let you know i have uh two uh children of my own ive got two boys uh one four year old and one two years old so so im just starting out     oh yes  i have two boys who are twenty eight and twenty four and a daughter whos twelve   wow  wow thats quite a spread   yes  same husband everything it just uh  but   thats great well i guess uh in one of things that that uh i like to do with my boys when uh when i get home is i like to try and spend a lot of time with them you know theyre not very old so they cant do a whole lot yet   umhum   but they like to uh spend time with me we just oh just do various things nothing really they like to be outside as much as possible   if its not raining   right uh but you know the weathers trying to turn now so   are are you down here in Texas oh   yes i im im in uh Dallas   okay yeah then you know what i meant with rain  ah   right right right   okay uh  what   you know one of one of the well one of the things ive noticed is one of the trends ive ive noticed is that uh its always too easy to to just plop your kids down in front of the TV and let them watch movies or or play video games or something   yeah i  i have can you hold on  just a second i have to answer a business phone i hate to do it on this call  good morning ARE this is Arlene Lister   sure sure thats okay   it was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway im sorry keep going   no  no its okay um        so that was the thing that i i noticed that i know a lot of the people lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible   um umhum   although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the TV and let them be um entertained that way and uh seeing as how youve got some older children i was im wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up   yeah well there there was not nearly as much of it in fact i i think things were were quite a bit different uh when my my big kids were were little uh you know if if all the mothers were home   umhum umhum   you know the the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around and then when they felt like it they went out to play you know when they were were little like that   umhum right   and uh  i i think its gotten ah yeah very different when my second one was little they were coming out with Sesame Street which he started watching and   right   other than that i mean there was basically there was not educational TV or uh   umhum   you know you got some cartoons and that was it but they they were never that interested in it anyway theyd rather i mean theyd take their trucks out in the backyard you know go out and play and stuff but we always did uh   right   oh just you know to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum we did a lot of stuff like that with uh with our kids and course when they got bigger uh   umhum umhum   they were both quite into sports and and you know so whatever you know they would do wed go along with and uh   umhum yeah   uh well a girl is very different  a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping  so theyre very very different but     right   uh you know kind of the same thing our you know she now lot of time spent with her shes so busy is uh you know going to you know like last night was a band concert and she   umhum umhum   she plays on her school volleyball team and uh stuff like that but uh we we still uh oh like to pack up you know just go someplace for the day or uh you know just stuff like that one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station so thats uh   right oh thats nice   we go down there fairly often you know for a weekend for you know family get togethers and stuff like that   thats great thats great i know wed id like to get into do more camping and outings and things and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older   ah umhum   but uh you know for right now they dont you know just getting out in the front just being outside is good for them they like just being outside   oh yes yeah i i think our kids just ours dearly loved that you know played bounce the ball or just  ah course when our big ones were little we lived up north you know and this time of the year it it the fun thing was to go out   umhum umhum   swoosh around in the leaves you know and yes you know so its its very different and and uh   right thats true you dont see many leaves around Dallas   you know we also come winter time  wed stick them on sleds and uh we had a pond across the street and and from little on uh you know im   umhum   it its so different down here where you you go and take lessons to learn to ice skate or something you know when our kids were little you you got them a pair of skates
