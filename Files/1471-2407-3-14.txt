                    Background        Among the  cancer registries that contract with the        Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER Program        of the US National Cancer Institute the Utah Cancer        Registry reports the lowest overall incidence of cancer        During the years  ageadjusted to the  US        population invasive cancer incidence rates in white men        for the leading  sites per  personyears were         in Utah compared with  in SEER without Utah            Lower rates in Utah were observed for all sites        except prostate cancer and melanoma of the skin  vs         for prostate  vs  for lung and bronchus         vs  for colon and rectum  vs  for        urinary bladder  vs  for nonHodgkins lymphoma         vs  for melanoma of the skin  vs  for        oral cavity and pharynx  vs  for kidney and renal        pelvis  vs  for leukemia and  vs  for        pancreas Comparatively high prostate cancer incidence        rates in the s among white men in Utah have been        reported previously             In  members of the Church of Jesus Christ of        Latterday Saints LDS or Mormon settled the Salt Lake        Valley in northern Utah     Over the next several        years LDS Church members settled over  communities        throughout the territory Today about  of Utahs         million population is affiliated with the LDS Church             Over  of the states population is white        nonHispanic     Low cigarettesmoking and        alcoholdrinking prevalence observed among LDS helps        explain the comparatively low rates for many of these        cancer sites in Utah     Whether the high prostate        cancer incidence rates reflect higher rates among LDS is        unclear        We linked electronic records from the LDS Church        membership files and the Utah Cancer Registry to examine        the magnitude and temporal trends in prostate cancer        incidence rates among LDS and nonLDS residents of Utah for        the calendar years  through  Cases judged to have        been incidentally detected through transurethral resection        of the prostate TURP a procedure typically used to treat        obstructive uropathy were also identified and considered        in the rate calculations to provide a clearer indication of        the effect of screening on the incidence rates of prostate        cancer We also examined results from a statewide health        survey to characterize prostatespecific antigen screening        patterns by religious affiliation                    Methods                  Utah Cancer Registry          The populationbased Utah Cancer Registry UCR was          established in  and has continuously participated in          the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance          Epidemiology and End Results SEER program since           UCR staff members and local cancer registrars identify          incident cases of cancer among Utah residents through          routine and systematic review of pathology reports          medical records radiation therapy records hospital          discharge lists and vital records Tumor characteristics          including histology

documented in the          Summary Staging Guide of the SEER program of the National          Cancer Institute     Registry records also include          information regarding treatment and patient          characteristics such as age at diagnosis gender          raceethnicity and place of residence at diagnosis          Information regarding patient characteristics cancer          diagnosis and treatment is ascertained from specific          statements in medical records reports from private          pathology laboratories and radiotherapy units and death          certificates Cancer surveillance in Utah is conducted in          accordance with standards instituted by the SEER program          and the North American Association of Central Cancer          Registries                               Linkage of cancer data with LDS church          records          UCR records were linked to LDS Church membership          records to determine membership in the LDS Church The          linkage process took place under direct supervision of          the Church and the UCR and was conducted in the Churchs          Member and Statistical Records Department          Confidentiality of record information was strictly          enforced After the records were linked all personal          identifying information was stripped from the          database          Records were linked using the probabilistic linking          program LinkPro     The program calculates          probabilities to identify whether a pair of records          refers to the same person Ten variables that were common          to both sets of records were used to link the records          first middle and last names birth day birth month          birth year gender zip code vital status and maiden          name SOUNDEX versions of the names were used in the          matching process while actual names were used in the          review process          There were  incident cases of cancer identified          in the UCR database from  to  and approximately           million records in the LDS Church database Records          were linked in three stages The first stage linked all          records that matched exactly on first middle and last          names complete birth date and gender There were           such records declared matches without review The second          stage consisted of taking the remaining records and          forcing them to link on last name and at least five          additional variables The  records that linked on          eight additional variables were declared matches without          review Of the  records that linked on seven          additional variables  were declared matches          without review and  were reviewed with  declared          matches Of the  records that linked on six          additional variables  were declared matches          without review and  were reviewed of which           were declared matches Finally of the  records          that matched on five additional variables  were          declared matches without review  were reviewed with           declared matches and  were declared          nonmatches without review The third stage of the          linkage process consisted of taking the remaining          unlinked records and forcing them to link on first name          and at least six other additional variables There were           such records All were reviewed with  declared          matches These stages resulted in   of the UCR          records being linked to a Church record                          Data          All incident cases of prostate cancer ICDO site          code C that were diagnosed among Utah residents          during the time period  were identified from          records of the Utah Cancer Registry Lymphomas of the          prostate ICDO histologies  were excluded          from the study Analyses were further restricted to          histologically confirmed cases that were  years and          older at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis Stage          categories of disease at diagnosis were localregional          distant and unstaged Local and regional stages were          combined because of the large proportion of cases          upsataged because of surgery                              TURP and Incidental Detection          Although the UCR has historically collected surgery          information on cancer cases including whether a prostate          cancer case underwent a TURP not until  did they          identify whether the TURP led to or was the result of a          prostate cancer diagnosis This change in the level of          information collected was made among all the registries          participating in the SEER program In the UCR during           the proportion of TURPs performed among cases          resulting in an incidental finding because of the surgery          for benign disease was  The log of the odds in          favor of this event was then regressed on age using          logistic regression Age was not statistically          significant ie Chisquare   p   Age          and agesquared terms were also fit in the model but          neither was statistically significant Because the          proportion of incidental detection among cases undergoing          a TURP was not associated with age we multiplied in each          age category for each year  through  the          proportion  by the total number of age and          yearspecific TURPs recorded among cases to get an          estimate of the number of TURPs that led to a prostate          cancer diagnosis                           Utah Health Status Survey          The  Utah Health Status Survey is a          crosssectional random survey sponsored by the Utah          Department of Health The Gallup Organization collected          the data by incorporating a telephone survey instrument          into a computerassisted randomdigitdialing software          program called SURVENT Supervised interviews were          conducted across twelve local health districts in Utah by          trained interviewers Although the survey questionnaire          covered several topics we only used data from questions          on PSA screening and religious status The interview          process occurred during June  through August            Interviews were conducted with one randomly selected          adult aged  years or older in each household If          required as many as nine telephone attempts were made to          contact a selected household The response rate was           In order to more accurately generalize the survey          results to the Utah population postsurvey weighting          adjustments were made Adjustments weighted the sample to          be proportionally consistent with age sex geographic          and Hispanic status distributions of the  Utah          population                          Statistical analysis          Ageadjusted prostate cancer incidence rates were          calculated for individual calendar years and for the          following year groups    and           These rates were calculated by the direct method          with the United States standard population for the year               Rates were calculated for both LDS and          nonLDS populations in Utah and are expressed per           personyears The Member and Statistical Records          Department of the LDS Church provided annual age and          sexspecific estimates of the number of LDS Church          members in Utah Larry Elkington Manager of Church          Management Information Center personal communication          Estimates for the nonLDS population of Utah were derived          by subtracting the number of LDS Church members from the          Utah population provided by the US Bureau of the Census              Poisson regression was used to estimate the          incidence rate ratio between LDS and nonLDS              Appropriate models reported below were selected based on          the deviance goodnessoffit test Analyses were          performed with standard packages of the Statistical          Analysis System SAS                                Results        A total of  incident cases of histologically        confirmed invasive prostate cancer in men aged  years and        older were diagnosed among Utah residents during the period         Based on linkage with LDS Church records          of these cases were determined to be LDS Church        members There were   with localregional        stage   with distant stage and          with unstaged prostate cancer Two cases had missing stage        information        The frequency of cases is presented according to        religious preference calendar year and age in Table         For both LDS and nonLDS a shift occurred over time from        cases being diagnosed at older ages to younger ages For        the first three time periods LDS compared with nonLDS        cases were less likely to be diagnosed in their  s and        more likely to be diagnosed in their  s The frequency of        cases is also presented according to religious preference        calendar year and stage Table  A noticeable stage        shift occurred from distant to localregional disease over        time for both LDS and nonLDS cases Only in the years         through  do LDS cases have a significantly higher        percentage diagnosed with localregional disease        Localregionalstaged TURP and nonTURPdetected        ageadjusted prostate cancer incidence rates for men         years of age and older in Utah are presented according to        religious preference and calendar year Figure         NonTURPdetected prostate cancer incidence rates are        generally higher for LDS men across the years particularly        during the PSAinduced peak Despite this observation        TURPdetected prostate cancer incidence rates are similar        Distantstaged ageadjusted prostate cancer incidence rates        for men  years of age and older in Utah are also        presented by religious preference and calendar year Figure         These rates are generally similar        A Poisson regression model adjusted for age and stage        at diagnosis calendar time and whether prostate cancer        was TURP or nonTURPdetected indicated that LDS compared        with nonLDS have   confidence interval           times the incidence rate of prostate cancer among men        aged  years and older in Utah The adjusted Poisson        regression model gave rate ratios of LDS to nonLDS of            in      in             in  and     in         Adjusted rate ratios also indicated significantly        higher rates for LDS compared with nonLDS for each age        group   in ages    in        ages    in ages  and          in ages  and older and for certain stage        categories   in localregional stage          in distant stage and   in        unstaged        Finally on the basis of the  Utah Health Status        Survey LDS men compared with nonLDS men were more likely        to have received a PSA screen in the previous year Table                            Discussion        Evidence that prostate cancer incidence rates are        sensitive to screening is well established                 Potosky         et al examined the potential        influence that adoption of transrectal ultrasound TRUS        and PSA testing had on increasing prostate needle biopsy        rates in the SEER areas from  through             Both TRUS and PSA testing rates initially near zero        increased to almost  and  per         respectively Their study further showed a correlation        between increasing needle biopsy rates and prostate cancer        incidence rates Legler         et al added to our understanding of        the role of PSA testing on prostate cancer incidence rates        by showing that first time PSA testing proportions not the        overall PSA proportion track closely with prostate cancer        incidence rates     In a comparison of prostate cancer        incidence rates among white men in five of the SEER areas        Detroit Utah SeattlePuget Sound Iowa and        Connecticut Brawley showed that the rates were highest in        Seattle from  through  but then highest in Utah        from  through      In a consistent manner the        proportion of men receiving a first time PSA tended to be        highest in Seattle in the earlier years but highest in Utah        in the later years     Because  of diagnosed        prostate cancer cases in Utah during our study period were        in LDS men we may assume that the relatively high        proportion of first time PSA tests in Utah primarily        reflects LDS men        The results based on Poisson regression indicate that        LDS men compared with nonLDS men residing in Utah after        adjusting for age and stage at diagnosis calendar time and        TURP experienced significantly higher prostate cancer        incidence rates Unfortunately our broad stage categories        limited our ability to adjust for this variable such that        differences in stage could still be explaining some of the        higher incidence among LDS men Nevertheless the higher        rates among LDS men could be because they more readily        adopted TRUS and digital rectal exams in the first time        period prior to widespread PSA screening and then more        readily adopted PSA screening but to a lesser degree        Historically physicians have used digital rectal        examinations in early detection efforts      In        general digital rectal examination has a  detection        rate and the PSA test which is relatively easy to perform        has a  detection rate in men who are older than  years        of age            Screening is further implicated by the fact that the        higher rate ratios of LDS to nonLDS prostate cancer        incidence occur in localregional stage cases Age and        stageshifts in the data are also consistent with higher        levels of screening among LDS men Unfortunately there is        little screening data available to allow us to directly        evaluate the role screening plays in the higher prostate        cancer incidence rates observed among LDS men        Nevertheless based on the  Utah Health Status Survey        we showed that LDS men compared with nonLDS men were more        likely to have received a PSA test in the past year        overall and within age categories Yet the order of PSA        received whether a first or subsequent PSA test is        unknown In addition we do not know whether higher PSA        screening use among LDS men remained higher prior to or        after         Studies have shown that men undergoing PSA screening are        more likely to display an overall constellation of        healthpromoting behavior such as not smoking and seeking        health care regularly      Smokers are less likely        to use medical services      with one study finding        that  of nonsmokers compared with  of smokers        receiving regular checkups     Utah has historically        experienced the lowest smoking prevalence in the United        States     Utah smoking prevalence is currently        closest to the         Healthy People  goal for the        nation of      with smoking prevalence in the year         of  compared with the next lowest prevalence in        California of  and nationally of      This        low smoking prevalence is primarily explained by the over         LDS population who attend church weekly among which        less than  are current smokers     Men who are        married and who have medical insurance have the highest        levels of PSA use in Utah     According to the         Utah Health Status Survey  of LDS men and  of        nonLDS men in Utah were married and  of LDS men        compared with  of nonLDS men were medically insured                   In a consistent manner studies have found that men who        are generally healthier      married      and        more educated     are more likely to be diagnosed        with prostate cancer than men with different        characteristics Yet these men also tend to experience        better survival        indicating that they are        possibly being diagnosed at earlier stages because of more        aggressive screening In addition to LDS having        comparatively low smoking prevalence a higher proportion        who are married and a higher proportion who are medically        insured  of LDS men compared with  of nonLDS men        reported having at least a high school education according        to the  Health Status Survey            In our study adjusting for TURPdetected cases allowed        us to better assess the influence of screening on prostate        cancer incidence trends Frequent use of TURP for benign        prostatic hyperplasia in the s and s and the rapid        introduction and widespread adoption of PSA screening        beginning in the late s tapped an extensive pool of        latent and preclinical prostate disease             Consistent with another study we found that in the mid        s up to  or more of all prostate cancer cases were        incidentally detected through TURPs     However as        medications with few side effects became available to treat        benign prostatic hypterplasia and PSA screening became        widely adopted TURPdetected cases declined from their        peak in  through      Our results showed a        similar decline in the TURPdetected prostate cancer        incidence rates followed by a leveling off between         and  for both LDS and nonLDS cases in Utah We also        found the level of TURPdetected rates to be very similar        between LDS and nonLDS        Data are not available to identify whether TURP rates        differed between LDS and nonLDS However if we assume they        were similar or even higher among LDS and given the        similar TURPdetected prostate cancer incidence rates        observed there is no reason to believe that prostate        cancer is more common in LDS men Indeed an older study        based on Utah data covering the years  through         found that the ageadjusted to the  US standard        prostate cancer incidence rates per  personyears        were  for LDS compared with  for nonLDS                   One goal of screening is to identify the presence of        disease before it becomes clinically evident If PSAbased        screening achieved this goal we would anticipate dramatic        increases in the number of cases diagnosed with early stage        prostate cancer The available data did not allow us to        restrict our analyses to cases with just localized disease        Results from previous studies have demonstrated that choice        of therapy for prostate cancer may influence subsequent        determination of staging Specifically many patients that        clinically appeared to have localized disease were        determined to have regional stage disease based on        pathological review of tissue that was obtained from        radical prostatectomy      Similar patients that did        not undergo aggressive surgical treatment would not have        had the opportunity for a comparable evaluation of stage        the latter group of patients would have remained classified        with localized disease Therefore it was not possible in        these data to distinguish between cases with true localized        disease and those who received a clinical diagnosis of        localized disease but actually had undetected regional        stage disease Hence cases of local and regional stage        disease were combined in the present study                    Conclusion        LDS men compared with nonLDS men may have adopted        digital rectal and PSA screening more readily Higher PSA        screening was observed among LDS both overall and within        selected age groups according to the  Utah Health        Status Survey In addition individuals in the LDS Church        tend to reflect a host of characteristics ie low        smoking prevalence a high proportion married a high        proportion medically insured and a high level of        education that are associated with good general health        Previous studies have indicated that these characteristics        are associated with more aggressive PSA screening and        because of the high prevalence of asymptomatic prostate        cancer in the population subsequent prostate cancer        diagnosis If LDS men adopted screening more readily we        may expect that they would have experienced higher prostate        cancer incidence rates Evidence in this paper indicates        that the comparatively high prostate cancer incidence rates        in Utah are likely due to at least in part more        aggressive screening among LDS
