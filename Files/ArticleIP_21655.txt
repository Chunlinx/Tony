                                  The Muteness of Prince George            Gov George W BushRTexas announced Sunday that he is forming a committee to explore whether heshould run for president After a parade of adulatory speeches from committeemembers he fielded questions One reporter asked whether abortion should beillegal in the first trimester Thats a hypothetical question said BushWhat about global economic instability I wont have specific remedies orspecific suggestions until I start moving around the country Bush repliedShould we build a missile defense system even if it violates the antiballisticmissile treaty I will be glad to answer all those questions once I get out inthe course of the campaign Bush offered ending the press conference            What a charade Bushscampaign has been underway for a year He has plotted strategy assembled acampaign team pitched to donors courted politicians and written letters topotential allies in key states His fundraisers expect to collect  millionby the end of March For the next three months his exploratory committeewill raise money and build a campaign staff Yet Bush remains clueless aboutmany national issues and on others he knows he can only lose votes by beingpinned down Moreover the longer he postpones his candidacy the longer hedeprives his rivals of a target thereby starving them to death For thesereasons Bush is claiming immunity to policy questions And hes getting awaywith it thanks to several excuses             Im doing my job At his pressconference Bush refused to answer questions about tax cuts and other issuesuntil Texas finishes its legislative session in May He explained that beinggovernor is his job and that he had promised Texans he would stay homethrough the session Im a person who does in office what I say I will do heinsisted Former GOP Chairman Haley Barbour a member of the exploratorycommittee seemed deeply moved I think Gov Bushs keeping his commitment toTexas shows what kind of leader George Bush is said Barbour            Lest anyone contemplatethe convenience of this excuse Bush spun it as a sacrifice He regretted thathe wouldnt be able to visit key primary states for months Some have saidWell youre gonna be too late in some state  he lamented But Ive got ajob to do The press swallowed this line whole Bush is understandablyreluctant to leave Austin at least until the Legislature concludes its worksaid US News  World Report  He has defied conventional wisdom byrefusing to travel the country to raise money and court supporters             Read my principles Bush outlined hiscore conservative principleslimited government low taxes free andfair trade local control of schools strong families and personalresponsibility When asked about specific issues he referred back to hisprinciples How exactly do you plan to preserve the prosperity of the UnitedStates asked one reporter When I start to emerge out of the state after thelegislative session said Bush Im going to lay out an economic stimuluspackage that will do just that You heard the principles by which Ill bemaking decisions On foreign policy he said only that his framework wouldemphasize whats good for America                            Read my testimonials Todeflect scrutiny from his own views Bush stacked his committee with people whocan vouch for him At the press conference President Reagans secretary ofstate George Shultz and President Bushs national security aide CondoleezaRice vouched for Gov Bushs toughness on foreign policy Reps JC WattsJr ROkla and Henry Bonilla RTexas vouched for his racial inclusivenessProchoice Rep Jennifer Dunn RWash vouched for his belief in individualfreedom When a reporter asked what Bush would do about Russias meltdown Bushcited his principles babbled about missile defense and said I of coursewill be relying upon the briefings on details from people such as Dr RiceWith friends like these who needs positions He has George Shultzadvising him on foreign policy observed ABCs George Will with delight            Bushs personnel movesserve him particularly well on social issues He has conspicuously courtedformer Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed and in January hemade a pilgrimage to coalition founder Pat Robertson Without publiclyembracing any of the coalitions positions Bush elicited from Robertson themagic words He loves the Lord Conservative pundits are particularly excitedover Bushs recruitment of conservative Christian speech writer Mike GersonNoting that Gerson wrote Bob Doles antiHollywood speech in  FredBarnes inferred on Meet the Press that one issue on which were goingto hear a lot from Bush is cultural conservatism             Read my polls Since Bushs advantageslie in politics rather than policy he steers attention to his campaignjuggernaut rather than to his platform The men and women on this stagerepresent the best of the Republican Party he boasted at his pressconference Rep Roy Blunt RMo handed Bush a list of  current members ofCongress who have already endorsed your candidacy and Bushs aidesdistributed a similar list to reporters On the weekend chat shows punditsmarveled at Bushs deluge of endorsements his bottomless coffers and hisgodlike standing in the polls Bush never explicitly brings up money or pollsbecause he doesnt have to But he counts on them to keep the press pining forhim while he stiffs policy questions                                          Shame on you When pressured to clarify hispositions Bush morphs the question into attack politics and attack journalismI will campaign on my beliefs and my principles and I will not engage in thepetty politics of personal destruction he insisted A reporter asked himabout conservative opponents who associate him with his fathers moderationIm going to try to work hard not to play the typical political game oftearing down your opponent Bush sniffed and I would hope others wouldnttear down my dad            Bushs wife and daughters provide another handy shield Ihad doubts and concerns about what a campaign would mean for my family heconfided to the assembled scribes I convinced my wife that I love her andIll always love her Thats the only thing thatll overcome the meatgrindingaspects of national politics From the podium Dunn and Rice two of thecommittees three front women implored Bushs wife and daughters to endure thecampaigns trial by fire Bush has milked this protective anguish for monthsNever mind that according to Time  he privately told several financialbackers in January I love my wife And I love my daughters  But theydont have a veto on this            Bushs portrayal of substantive interrogation asnasty nitpicking has completely suckered the media Time reported thathis rivals were trying to pose litmustest questions and tear Bush downUS News accused them of picking at his credentials and warned Bushwill accept only so much battering Quoting a Pat Buchanan advisers demandthat Bush take some positions on abortion taxes China homosexual rightsUS News groaned that Buchanan seems poised for another round ofbashing the frontrunner On Meet the Press  Lamar Alexander said ofBushs vagueness We need to define what we mean Are we for a singlerateflat tax Or are we as I am for tripling the tax deduction for each child to Are we for affirmative action based on need as I am or based on raceAre we for English for the children on the first day of school or are we forfederal bilingual education programs Im arguing for plain talk not weaselwords To which host Tim Russert replied Why wont you abide by the th Amendment and stop criticizing George W Bush            Meanwhile Bush suffersin silence as his fundraisers bleed the field dry Ill play the hand I wasdealt he shrugs stoically Poor George He cant help it He was born with asilver gag in his mouth
