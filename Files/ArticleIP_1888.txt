                                 Budget True and False                         You cant believe everythingyou hear about the balancedbudget deal You cant because so many of theclaims are contradictory Enemies agree friends disagree The Democrat in theWhite House calls the fiveyear plan a historic breakthrough The Republicanleaders of Congress agree But House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt callsit a budget of many deficitsa deficit of principle a deficit of fairness adeficit of tax justice and worst of all a deficit of dollars Writing inNewsweek  conservative David Brooks hails it as a triumph forconservative values a few pages later conservative George Will condemns it asa betrayal of conservative values And so on Whos right                                             ADeficit of Dollars                The overarching purpose of a balancedbudgetagreement is presumably to balance the budget Yet the deal rests on variousassumptions and the likelihood that all of them will work out is small             The deal presumes aneconomic scenario more roseate than any envisaged since the first Reaganadministration Now unlike then we have already enjoyed more than six yearsof uninterrupted growth Unemployment and inflation together are lower thantheyve been for three decades Some say this shows the economy has reached anew plateau of longterm prosperity Others say this suggests the good timescant last much longer The deal makers contend that the budget deal itselfwill promote growth and so create additional savings But five more years Overthat period your guess is as good as Alan Greenspans             Even if the good timeskeep on rolling the promised retreat of red ink depends on Congress and thepresident devisingand sticking witha taxcut package that includes bothsides favorite giveaways but still costs less than  billion over fiveyears According to a side agreement it must also cost less than billion in the next five years after that             On top of this someonemust find more than  billion in spending cuts and other deficit reducersmost of them now suggested in only the broadest outlines More than  percentof the cuts in nondefense programs are to come in the last two years Indeedtotal spending cuts are supposed to jump by  billion in the last year of theplanwhich also happens to be an election year By contrast in the next twoyearsthe only two years this particular Congress and president controlthebudget deficit will actually increase as a result of the deal             Miscellaneousimplausibilities The Bureau of Labor Statistics is supposed to recalculate theConsumer Price Index to save about  billion in inflation adjustments overthe last three years of the plan The forces of nature are supposed to avoidany multibilliondollar calamities such as the recent Grand Forks ND floodDoctors and hospitals serving Medicare and Medicaid patients are supposed toabsorb  billion in payment cuts without fundamentally altering thesystem Someone must be found to pay more than  billion for the unused partof the broadcast spectrum And of course lots of fraud waste and abuse isto be rooted out on all sides                                             ADeficit of Principle or a Principled Conservatism                Liberals charge thatPresident Clinton sold out his core constituency by agreeing to deep cuts indomestic spending True This depends on which you think is more important thespending increases Congress enacts nowor the spending cuts itpromises to enact five years from now By the first measure Clinton did quitewell securing GOP agreement to more than  billion over five years in newspending for children immigrants and the elderly Thats in addition to billion in subsidies for college kidsthough Clinton disguises these as taxcuts Domestic nonentitlement spending over the next five years will be justabout what Clinton requested in his January budgetthough that budget won himscant applause within his party            But the deal promises a hugewhack at unprotected domestic spending in  and everything fromcourts prisons and parks to highways housing and the weather bureau Thisis what excites the conservative Brooks By leaving Medicare Social Securityand other entitlements unreformed he argues when a recession hits Congresswill be forced to all but dismantle the remaining part of governmentall thethings liberals love Of course this assumes that Congress wont just forgetabout balancing the budget instead                                             ADeficit of Tax Justice or a Deficiency of Tax Cuts                Part of the sidedeal Clinton made with Congress obliges him to sign a bill cutting capitalgains and estate taxes even if it is not the bill I would write It is notyet clear how Congress and the president can squeeze all the tax goodies eachinsists upon into a  billion bag and come up with an honest  billion innew revenues to bring the net price down to  billion So there is no wayyet to know for sure who wins and loses But capitalgains and estatetax cutsof almost any sort will surely favor the welltodo in the long run In theshort run higherincome taxpayers may pay more taxes not less if a capgainsrate cut leads them to sell more assets than they otherwise would have doneClintons college breaks will be of primary benefit to middle and uppermiddleclass taxpayers The per child credit will be broadly distributedthough notto the poor who pay no taxes so cant use the credit However it all shakesout those who benefit most from the tax breaks almost surely will lose leastfrom the spending cuts            Social conservatives seemfairly content with the tax package since it includes their cherishedperchild credit But supplyside conservatives dismiss the tax cuts asminuscule The net  billion cut they note is less than  percent of thetaxes the government expects to collect over the next five years And if theinflationadjustment rules are changed that will raise taxes as well as trimspending                                             ADrain on Defense                Under the budget deal by  national defense willconsume about  billion a year compared with  billion now Inflationhowever would turn that into a  percent cut in annual purchasing power Thisdoesnt seem unreasonable when you consider that our political and militaryleaders have shown themselves increasingly reluctant to put either our troopsor our expensive weaponry at risk On the other hand the Pentagon feels itmust buy ever more elaborate and costly weapon systemsin part to counter theweapons we sell so freely to others Hardline conservatives argue moreoverthat the real measure of lost resolve is to be found in the fact that militaryspending will fall to less than  percent of gross domestic product by  Atthe peak of the Reagan Cold War buildup in the mids defense claimed about percent of GDP            Of course the magnitude ofthe threats faced by the United States bears no fixed relation to the size ofour economy Today our GDP adjusted for inflation is twice as big as it wasin  Have the threats to our security doubled since then            Looked at another wayduring the  years of the Cold War Brookings Institution defense expertscalculate the United States spent about  billion a year on defensemeasured in todays dollars Under the budget agreement it will spend theequivalent of  billion a year or  percent less Meanwhile the SovietUnion has disintegrated and its former minions are queuing up to join NATOThat ought to save the Pentagon at least a quarter on the dollar                                             TheBottom Line  Is the budget agreement on balance more likely to reducethe deficitor to increase it The answer depends on which you count as moreimportant the tax cuts and spending increases Congress is pledged to enactthis very year or the spending cuts it vows it will embrace in years to comeYou might want to keep in mind that back in the budget deal of  Congressvoted to cap spending through  As part of the socalled balancedbudgetdeal that passed both houses last week Congress canceled those caps
