Emergency Planning andCommunity RighttoKnow Act of  EPCRA  USC  andsection  of the Pollution Prevention Act of  PPA USC   and in addition revises the interpretation of thephrase otherwise use which is undefined in the acts but is one ofthree activitiesGAOOGCrequiring reporting The information obtained from thesereports becomes part of the publically available data base known asthe Toxic Release Inventory or TRI The TRIs basic purpose is toinform the public of chemical hazards in their areas which in turnpermits communities to respond to chemical spills and otheremergenciesEnclosed is our assessment of the EPAs compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule Our review indicates that theEPA complied with the applicable

OFFACILITIES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY SECTORS REVISED INTERPRETATION OFOTHERWISE USE TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORY COMMUNITY RIGHTTOKNOWRIN ACi Costbenefit analysisThe EPA has included a detailed economic analysis in itssubmission to GAO setting forth and assessing the costs benefitsand associated impacts of the rule The preamble to the rulecontains summaries of the aforementioned assessments Included inthe analysis is what can best be described as the social impact andcosts of toxic chemical releases and other waste managementactivities and the value of the information to society that will beavailable from the reports from the industries added by theruleEPA also has concluded that although there is some overlapbetween other reporting requirements for environmental releases andother management activities mandated by EPCRA PPA and otherstatutes the reporting requirements of this rule do not conflictbecause of the differences in information collected entitiescovered reporting frequencies how the data are reported and soforthThe analysis indicates that  firms submitting reports annually will be added by the rule to the  facilities inthe existing manufacturing sector submitting  reports for atotal compliance cost of  million for the first year decliningto  million in subsequent years The difference in cost for thefirst and subsequent years appears to be based on EPAs estimatethat each task required including compliance determinations for thenew facilities covered the overall affect of the modifiedinterpretation of otherwise use rule familiarization and reportpreparation will be substantially higher during the first yearBenefits are not monetarily quantified because of the lack ofany existing methodology to do so EPA notes that the benefits tobe derived are basically those to be achieved directly through theknowledge about the use and disposition of toxic chemicals and thechanges in behavior that may result from the information reportedto the TRIGAOOGCii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and Section   Initial Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisEPA published the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFAas required by    Fed Reg  June   The IRFAexplained that it defined small business as any firm having employees rather than the under  employee criteria used by theSBA Using this criteria the agency estimated that  of the firms affected by the rule would be small businesses and thatapproximately  small entities in the industry groups affectedby the proposed rule would not be affected as they employed lessthan  persons The IRFA also considered various alternatives tothe proposed rule including different reporting requirements andreporting thresholdsSection   Final Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisEPA analyzed the potential impact on small entities by theStandard Industrial Classification SIC code and concluded thatthere would not be a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities Nonetheless the agency prepared anextensive analysis of the impact on small entities This assessmentis based on an estimate of  businesses that will be affected of which can be categorized as small by SBA SIC code EPAsanalysis indicates that the first year  percent  of thesmall entities will expend less than  percent of their annualrevenue for the rules compliance costs  percent  willexpend between  percent and  percent and  or  percent willexpend  percent or more of their annual revenues for complianceThese figures drop significantly during the second and ensuingyears eg  percent  less than  percent  percent between  percent and  percent and only  or  percentwith an economic impact of  percent or greater EPA also estimatesthat  public utilities owned by  municipalities will beaffected by the rule and of that total the  small governmentalentities populations under  affected will expend less than percent of their annual revenues for complianceiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  The EPA has included an Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Statementwith its report to this Office That statement declares that therule will not result in expenditure to state local or tribalgovernments in the aggregate of  million or more inThe entities affected are  publically owned electricutilities with combined annual expenditures estimated by EPA to be the first year and  thereafterPage  GAOOGCany year but that the rule may result in private sectorexpenditures of  million or more annually  million thefirst year and  million thereafter The EPA avers that it hasnot identified any sources of federal financial assistance todefray the state local or tribal expenditures under the rule orother federal resources available to carry out theintergovernmental mandate included in the rule EPA claims thatbecause the expenditures by publically owned electric utilities areso modest the rule does not impose a significant federalintergovernmental mandate In any event EPA claims to haveengaged in a number of efforts to consult with other units ofgovernment as described in the proposed rule  Fed Reg at  and
