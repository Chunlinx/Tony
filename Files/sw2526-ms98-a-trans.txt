        okay what kind of car are you thinking about buying next   well what a what what do we currently have i have a Subaru uh G O X T   what year   eighty eight   oh okay well i have a ninety Honda Civic and im ready to get rid of it  actually no well   oh yeah its not pretty old   i had i had an eighty eight that i really liked then it got wrecked and so i bought a ninety um because i i really liked my eighty eight and ive had a lot of problems with this one  so   so you think their quality controls going down over there uh kind of   well you its its kind of funny um i know a lot   well i i i think were going to see that i think uh that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while American carmakers are trying to get their butt together so   oh yeah its its true its definitely true because   but but thats one reason i uh ive had no problems with my Subaru thats one reason i went with it because i Subaru had a good reputation uh for you know low maintenance so   yeah well Honda does too  thats why i was really   well no theres theres no question but you have a nineteen i mean ive got to see i mean ive seen and ive had friends that have uh like uh eighty one or eighty uh Celicas   uhhuh   and those things just keep ticking i mean they just it can rack up a a hundred fifty K on them and theyre still beating on them   yeah thats true thats true   and its just amazing and i mean they got and you know theyre not making them like that now   you know so but theyre still theyre still a lot i think definitely better than the uh American carmaker and stuff   no not at all oh i i definitely agree with you there  because i had uh uh uh Ford T Bird before i got my Honda and it was the worst car ive ever owned  and um thats why i mean i was so tickled with my Honda it was just a wonderful car and then it got wrecked   yeah   and you know i wouldnt even look at another car  i just went and bought a Honda i mean i didnt even i didnt look around or anything i just said that this is what i want  and i really have had a lot of problems with it  but   yeah well maybe you need to unload it on somebody else   i dont know well ill probably hold on to it since its still under warranty but in the first twelve months that i owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month  it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months  yeah it was i was really   yeah thats a lot   disappointed because i was you know so hyped up on Honda so yeah   oh well anyway so whats your next purchase supposed to be   well  i know this   oh really if you had a choice of your car what would you get   well its this is going to sound really strange  but i really like to have a Mazda MPV van  i really like those and i have kids  so   im not sure im real familiar with the body style on that   theyre a lot i dont like the new style like of the Toyota van and the the new Chevy Lumina van i dont like those styles um the MPV is more of uh uh just uh   uhhuh thats umhum   i dont know what you normal  i dont know how to explain more of an old fashioned type i im not sure how to explain it i mean it looks i guess kind of like uh the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow   yeah yeah   uh what Astro Astro i guess is what it something like that but i used to really like the looks of the MPV because it looks more like a minivan rather than i think   oh okay yeah do you have uh do you have a family okay well thats probably influenced maybe a little bit   yeah i have a couple kids  so oh yeah  definitely but i know that its got to have a radio its got to have air conditioning  im sure you can relate to air conditioning   oh yeah   um living in Arizona but and cruise control and tinted windows thats about it  i mean its got to have those things otherwise i dont care   yeah well when i bought my car it was right out of college and uh you know i always been looking for something sporty and i ended up getting you know basically something that i could you know afford   umhum   the only gripe i have is performance i i probably uh a few girls that ive gone out with ive had uh like Mazda RX sevens and stuff and theyre theyre pretty fun to drive so   yeah   so i think thats what uh i im going to have to get next time around i keep i keep holding holding off i mean i could i could upgrade now if i wanted to but i just i its just such a huge expense and   oh really   and uh i im just going to keep holding off but im definitely going to look for something uh in the you know nice performance you know yeah   sports car  id like to have a sports car too but its not practical for me  but   yeah  im in are you still there   yeah whoops theres some kind of problems hello   hello okay   are you still there this is somethings wrong i dont know it sounds funny though doesnt it   wonder what happened hum anyway   huh   um but ill probably um it just depends i know thats what i want but i dont know if ill get myself to spend that kind of money youre looking at you know for a new RX seven or a Supra or something youre looking at twenty five K or something like that so   oh at least yeah   anyway but   i know well new cars arent cheap anyway  but   anyway my ultimate car though the the one that i really want is uh five sixty or so Mercedes so maybe someday   huh  yeah we have we all have those kind of dreams too dont we  what id really like to have   yeah thats the only one that i you know i see you know i see uh you know early on that that that says  it says you there   yeah this is strange   hello okay   hello i think somethings wrong with this i hope its recording   i hope its not my  you there   yeah   it may be my phone um anyway its the only car that says you know sporty and class uh so   yeah youre right  yep   uh kind of what im but its at the other one my brothers got a Miata and those are fun   oh those are nice yeah theyre theyre cute cars   and uh i yeah well he did he had a a red  Miata   uhhuh   and uh he actually they came out with a European racing green uh Miata thats a limited edition theyre only going to make like three or four thousand so he went out and he traded the other one in and got this one and im like um   oh wow i havent seen those   but uh i havent seen one yet either but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel so its its very authentic and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be may be a good investment   wow oh yeah definitely if its a limited edition usually no matter what it is if its a limited edition its usually worth something later on   if it yeah uhhuh but uh i think   huh   hello   yeah   okay yeah i got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway uh hope its not going bad its going to bum me out um but he i think he he only spent you know the low twenties so   oh really   i dont know   now see i would have never figured that i would have figured that to be a lot more than that  for something thats limited edition   well i dont know i think the demands gone uh down a little bit i think you can the prices arent as high you know and the the Miata Miata was first introduced uh   and well they werent really that bad though when they were introduced were they   what yeah the demand is so high that uh you know they were going to retail them around like third you know thirteen standard you know and you get your options youre looking at fifteen or sixteen fifteen but there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty   yeah thats true umhum   and um they they may have gone down a little bit but i theyre still pretty much in demand   hum   i think theres another car coming in its supposed to come out and compete with that Miata and i cant remember what i read about that but so thats interesting i mean i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular so   huh yeah it really is have you seen the new uh Dodge Stealth the the real nice one  yeah yeah the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too now those are nice   but oh yeah yeah and the Mitsubishi three thousand GT is the same same yeah well thats thats thats the same manufacturer and stuff so they just market them but uh yeah those are and those are supposed to be   right right   very performance power i mean theyre there is yeah big time   the expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand but those are pretty stripped and theres nothing theres really that ones just more for looks you know it doesnt have any really the performance that the expensive one does   yeah   you know but ive seen one of those and its not that great i mean because they really   i think theyre theyre only around uh twenty nine K   yeah the like i mean they have um better its not quite as nice for a little bit less   yeah   yeah theyre not really that bad but i dont know  like i said its its still not practical for me  i have a hard time looking at cars like that because i think now theres no way i can do that   yeah im being single and no other responsibilities for yourself i guess you know its i can i can ive been pretty happy ive ive havent tried to upgrade myself right now thats uh   right   you know i could i could have you know get something nice and upgrade but i just uh im consulting right now so   oh really   i just made my first job hop about eight months ago so uh   uh what
