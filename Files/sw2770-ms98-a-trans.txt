        so have you got a pet   no i dont my kids would love a pet  i had a pet when i was a girl i had a Cocker Spaniel and i think one thing about pets is theyre a lot of company you can you can tell them anything and they wont tell anybody   yeah thats right thats like unconditional affection   right as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love they just give it and dont expect too much anyway do you have a pet   yeah i had a cat ive had several cats my cat uh was hit by a car New Years Eve but uh im gonna get another one as soon as i   oh   get back in town im going out of town this weekend when i get back im gonna find a cat   oh im so sorry but thats good that youre gonna get another one  i know some of my friends who have pets uh and they just are really   so yeah   you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think thats one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um really take care of them are and are protective of them   yeah i work and go to school and its kind of nice you know you come home your your pets there for you and wants to wants a little food a little attention   yeah and and like my kids um they really want a dog badly   and thats its kind of fun   and theyve been looking and looking and want you know theyd take anything i think  but um i dont know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat   yeah no it was an indoor kind of indoor outdoor it   a kind of traveled around traveled   it was well yeah i dont i dont care for the smell of a litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when you know it   yeah when i had a Cocker Spaniel it it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better uhhuh   yeah i i i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh im im kind of like big dogs big dogs and you have to have room for them   yeah thats true   and dogs take a lot of a lot more care than cats do cats are pretty independent you know you feed them and they keep themselves clean and   yeah thats true   if you if you raise them right you know you dont have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and   take them for walks right   things like that   yeah i see all the people on on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and and i im kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog im like i know itll be fun the first week maybe and then mom gets to take care of it or something so i guess   yeah yeah i got to take care a friend of mines dog hes just got a puppy and he was out of town  last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so its go over there and clean up after the dog and   umhum oh thats exciting   thats thats a major chore you know if you dont if you dont keep up with it and uh kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work   yeah yeah i think its really important to that that if you get a pet that theyre either spayed or neutered so that you know were not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but   yeah   but i dont know more and more people are aware   well if youre if youre gonna have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring and   right right but uh   and i think you know when i was growing up we had cats cats and you know just seeing the cats you know the the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is thats a thats a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand and and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you dont wanna   i think thats really true   youd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know theyre theyre theyre getting old now and its time to get rid of them so   yeah yeah exactly exactly i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too and  and thats good too   yeah   well i think thats all i have to say okay have a good night all right byebye   okay well its good talking to you yeah bye
