                                  Show Me the Numbers            The  presidential campaign has already begunalittle early for my taste The speech writers are busily at work spinning outtheir anodyne alliterations their balanced bromides their cautious clarioncalls They have already produced for George W Bush CompassionateConservatism and Prosperity with a Purpose Al Gore seems to be ditchingReinventing Government Inventing the Internet Global Warming TheThird Way and all those other nerdy notions He is aiming directly at thesoft American heart by offering himself as the Friend of the Family            With the change of a few words George Wscompassionate conservatisms could have been delivered by Bill Clinton or AlGore And Gores qualification to be Americas Friend of the Family is that heisnt Bill Clintona qualification he shares with quite a few otherpeople            After a while thecampaign will embrace the specifics There will be speeches or positionpapers about education the environment the budget and other issues conveyinginformation about the candidates intentions But it will still be in thedomain of advertisingfull of new and improved claims like the ones youfind on cereal boxes            I had direct experience with this process during RichardNixons  presidential campaign Nixon had two teams of policy advisers Oneteam accompanied him on the campaign and advised him about what to say to getelected The other team on which I served stayed home and wrote papers abouthow he should govern after he got elected The two teams did not communicatewith each other fearing I suppose diversion from their two differentobjectives            I dont complain muchabout this deviousness and evasiveness and I dont expect it to change I haveonly a modest request Before the campaign concludes I would like to see moreattention to the numbers Many of the policy issues confronting us hinge onquantitieson how much Whether a condition is a problem requiring governmentremedies depends on how much of the condition there is And whether a proposedpolicy is worth its cost or is likely to be effective also depends on itssize            One number we already hear relates to taxation The numberis zerono new taxes At some point we will get another numbera percentageby which the candidate proposes to cut income tax rates That is supposed totell the voter how much better off he will be if the candidate is elected Forthat purpose obviously the bigger the number the better But the tax numbersneed to be seen in national and historical perspective From the nationalstandpoint lower taxes are not necessarily better than higher ones In thepast  years federal taxes as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product havebeen  percent of GDP plus or minus  percentage points Surprisinglythe low point came in the Johnson administration not the Reaganadministration The candidates should tell us where inside or outside thatrange they would want federal tax receipts to be That would give us some clueto the national economic significance of the difference between them            The tax questionimmediately raises the question of the budget surplus For decades we had arule for the proper relationship between government expenditures andrevenuesor we pretended to have a rule The rule was that the budget shouldbe in balance meaning no deficit But we are beyond that now We have inprospect some years in which with existing policies there will be a surplusand there is a question about how big that surplus should be That is aquestion neither the president nor the congressional Republicans want to faceIn his recent budget the president tried to conceal the fact that there was asurplus and the Republicans with their talk about a lockbox for SocialSecurity have confused everyone probably including themselves But thesubject is important and the candidates should tell us how much if anysurplus they would plan to have            As long as the country continues to bask in prosperitythere will be no debate about general economic policy during this campaignEveryone will agree on the most important requirement for sustainingprosperity which is to keep Alan Greenspan healthy So candidates are likelyto focus as George W has already done on those who do not share in thegeneral prosperitythose who have been left behind But there are hardquantitative questions about this How many are left behind Is it a majorproblem We have official estimates of the proportion of the population who arein poverty It is something like  percent and has been near that for the past years But there are other estimatesequally plausible which may not bevery plausible at allsaying that the poverty rate has been falling sharplyand is now about  percent or  percent Which of these estimates you believemakes a big difference to the priority you give to this problem So if thecandidates are going to make a big issue about helping those who are fallingbehind I would like to hear their views about how many there are            I give examples only fromareas of policy with which I have some familiarity But one can also see thevalue of quantification in many other areas health care education theenvironment and others            Asking political candidates to quantify their stands mayseem unrealistic because they dont want to pin themselves down and because theaudience will tune out But there have been cases where the candidate gave usrelevant numbersand with success I think particularly of the  Reagancampaign Serious questions were being raised about whether the policies he wasproposing for taxes expenditures and the deficit added up He then made aspeech in September  in which he laid out the quantities involved and theunderlying assumptions Some people including me criticized parts of thestory But I think it helped to support the idea that he knew what he wasdoing In a limited way the Reagan speech served as guidance for his policiesafter he came into office So I dont think the request for more numbers issimply the idiosyncrasy of an old economist
