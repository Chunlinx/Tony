                                 Muslim Crosscurrents                         The victory of MohammedKhatami in the Iranian presidential election suggests the countrysrevolutionary zeal has been tempered While little change is likely to Iranspolitical structure or foreign policy a more moderate line in social policymay emerge In contrast Afghanistans Sunni Muslim Taliban is still in arevolutionary phase of development Currently its advance is generating thegreatest concern in the exSoviet states of Central Asia but the movement mayyet resonate more strongly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia The net effect ofthese contrasting trends on the attainment of US objectives across the regionis not likely to be positive Washington may come to regret its reportedsupport for the Taliban movement And while a more moderate social policy mayemerge in Iran the countrys resistance to a US military presence in thePersian Gulf is unlikely to soften            In IransMay  election Khatami received almost  percent of votes cast putting himfar ahead of his main rival the conservative speaker of the IranianParliament Ali Akbar NateghNuri The result was a surprise since NateghNurienjoys the tacit support of Irans spiritual leader Ayatollah Sayyed AliKhamenei and was viewed as the clerical establishments candidate forpresident            Khatamis huge mandate is a clear sign of the Iranianelectorates desire for change and may become a significant landmark in thecountrys history Offered a clear choice of candidates and policies for thefirst time since the  revolution an overwhelming majority of Iraniansvoted to overturn the social and cultural restrictions that have becomesynonymous with the Islamic republics revolutionary zeal            Khatamisreputation for supporting liberal policies during his tenure as minister forculture and Islamic guidance was combined with a populist campaign messagestressing the importance of civil society individual rights a wider role forwomen and greater freedom of expression This allowed him to appeal to a broadrange of constituencies that have eschewed electoral participation since therevolution In addition to the support of leftwing Islamic radicals Khatamireceived the overwhelming backing of the intelligentsia the urban middleclass and female and younger voters            Nevertheless and despite his reputation as amoderate liberal Khatami the son of an ayatollah remains a product of IransShiite Muslim clerical establishment He has emphasized his commitment to theprinciples of the Islamic republic and will do nothing to fundamentally alterthe existing political system Moreover moves to introduce radicalsocialreform legislation may founder in Parliament where there is aconservative majority            Ultimately the extent of any shift in domestic policy will depend on theposition adopted by Khamenei If the spiritual leader views the election resultas a threat to his own authority he could side with hardline Islamists tothwart reform initiatives However given the size of Khatamis mandateKhamenei may conclude that the desire for easing social and culturalrestrictions is compelling enough and opt to assist the new president inovercoming conservative opponents            Similar transformations in foreign policy particularlytoward the United States are far less likely Khatamis statements reflect arecognition that foreign policy remains the domain of Khamenei The ayatollahhas been dogmatic in opposing Washingtons policies in the region particularlydual containment which he views as US victimization of Iran Theleadership is particularly unlikely to moderate its opposition to the USmilitary presence in the Persian Gulf which it perceives as detrimental toIrans security interests            Both sidesbelieve that the other must make the first conciliatory move There is debatewithin the US foreignpolicy establishment regarding the efficacy ofWashingtons approach which is based on the perception of Iran as a roguestate and a sponsor of international terror However social reform in Iranwill not by itself be enough to facilitate a dramatic shift in US policy            Set against the evidence of moderation in Iranthe Talibans advance in Afghanistan has generated alarm particularly amongexSoviet Central Asian governments who fear the spread of Islamicfundamentalism northward Since most Central Asians are Sunni Muslims theTaliban potentially may be a more inspiring model for local Islamicrevolutionaries than Shiah Iran However while there is a real danger that thefighting could destabilize Central Asias southern flank the Talibansrestricted ethnic base may limit its attractiveness In contrast this may notbe the case in Sunnidominated Pakistan and Saudi Arabia Islamabad Riyadhand by extension Washington may yet come to regret their reported support fora Sunni movement that apparently now exceeds Shiah Iran in its fundamentalistzeal and potential appeal to discontented Sunni populations            Althoughthe Taliban operates autonomously its advance would not have been possiblewithout foreign backing Pakistan has been the key supporter but Saudi Arabiaand the United Statesboth keen to stem Iranian influence in the regionalsoare believed to have supplied finance All three countries have an interest instabilizing Afghanistan sufficiently to construct oil pipelines from CentralAsia through the country as an alternative route to Iran            The Taliban is both a product of and a reaction to thecivil war that has gripped Afghanistan since the demise of the Sovietbackedregime in  The movement developed out of refugee Koranic schools inPakistan Taliban leaders declared a holy war against the various warlords whocarved up Afghanistan and preached the role of strict Islamic rules as aunifying force This simple message found a ready audience among the largelyrural population of southern Afghanistan Like the Taliban leadership mostsoutherners are ethnic Pashtun Sunni Muslims who though accounting for themajority of the Afghan population had not fared well in the civil war            TheTaliban captured the southern city of Kandaharwhere its reclusive leaderMullah Mohammed Omar residesin late  and the capital Kabul lastSeptember In all conquered regions the Taliban has immediately implementedits own interpretation of Islamic law Among other things women are barredfrom work and most education and men may not trim their compulsory beards Insouthern rural areas such strictures have been accepted especially as theTaliban has provided a stable environment for the cultivation of poppiesDomestic drug use is severely punished but heroin production for export ispermitted            Taliban rule has not been popular withnonPashtun communities or the more sophisticated liberalminded residents ofthe major cities especially Kabul This is unlikely to change The recentheavy defeat of the Taliban in the northern city of MazareSharif highlightsboth its failure to incorporate ethnic Tajiks Uzbeks or Shiah Hazaras intoits leadership and its refusal to moderate its Islamic zeal Even if theTaliban succeeds in conquering the entire country many areas will remainsubject to guerrilla warfare
