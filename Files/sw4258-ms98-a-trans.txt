                 did you attend public school   i did attend public school for all but one year i uh went to a Catholic school for one year found that uh it did not agree with me or i did not agree agree with it and uh spent the rest of my education in public schools   uhhuh   uhhuh   uh i had mixed feelings on it uh because i thought that there was a greater range of students that a public school has to uh has to address   yes thats true they cant root out the troublemakers as easily   right and and the the programs have to be wider uh when i went to the Catholic high school uh there was nothing but a college preparatory course   okay   and in the public school there were uh a couple of different courses the uh the the socalled business course uh the college prep course and then there was the uh  the uh the the basic uh gas station manager track uh  you know   yeah i never yeah yes vocational education we called it   right and  im not sure that uh the college prep course was any worse in a public school than it wouldve been in a private school   uhhuh   but i think that the teachers were spread a little more thin because they werent always able to focus on the areas that they taught best   uhhuh uhhuh and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or   well a little bit of both uh the school wasnt very crowded when i went there although its since gotten its since gotten worse but uh there were   uhhuh umhum   there were some very good math teachers there there was one uh a science teacher in particular there who ended up having to teach a i i cant remember what course it was but it was really unsuitable uh it was some sort of uh   um   shop or mechanical drawing class and he just   oh uhhuh   he know he didnt know much about it but they figured he was a warm body in a room   uhhuh thats kind of technical so he could him it was him yeah   right right and i dont think that uh i dont i dont think that there are the resources in most public schools to be able to say well what we need here is a trained machinist to teach teach the metal shop course lets go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it   umhum uhhuh were already paying this guy   right   yeah yeah uh   did you go to a public school   i did i did and uh i felt i got a very i mean i feel i got a very poor education in general uh   umhum   but i think that i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations um uh in our case it think it was you know the teachers uh again spread thin but maybe in terms of just having too many student to really       do the job um im sort of i have a two year old son now and so im starting to think about   umhum   education you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do and im just sort of turned off by the whole uh the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible while the teacher lectures uh especially for small children   umhum sure   uh it just seems like its not the way theyre going to learn best but when you have one teacher and thirty students what else can you do   right   you know i mean it seems like the the style of teaching that we we have grown to think of as normal i think is dictated by economics in just in terms of uh student teacher ratios um   umhum so have you started looking into uh alternative schools like Montessories   um no so far im just whining         i havent done anything constructive yet uh we fantasize about homeschooling   uhhuh umhum   but uh we probably wont   right   although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun   i can see a lot of advantages to homeschooling but uh theres its its interesting theres uh someone here in Rhode Island who is very disgusted with the school system
