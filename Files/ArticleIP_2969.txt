                                 Valley Boys            Every so often friends inthe computer industry will develop an unrealistically charitable view of theirplace in the world Im not here to get rich they pronounce Im here tochange the world Easy to say when you happen to be getting rich Why dontthey work in pure research Research is an ivory tower they respondShipping products is the way you change the world And so they findthemselves in the cozy position of believing theyre beyond materialism whilethey cruise around in their Ferraris            Thecharacters in Po Bronsons novel The First  Million Is Always theHardest have it much harder The fictional nonprofit research laboratory LaHonda provides an opportunity to work with the best people in the fielddesigning products for other companies to sell They may be changing the worldbut theyre also underpaid They have their reasons for being there Formarketer Andy Caspar La Honda is an opportunity to leave struggling chip makerOmega Logic and prove hes one of the Ironmen who make the technologies thatdrive the information age For chip designer Francis Benoit its er a way toleverage corporate resources without corporate interference For La Hondadirector Hank Menzinger its a way to change the world without doing theactual work himself For Omega Logic CEO Lloyd Acheson uh  actually itshard to figure out why his company would fund an external research laboratoryinstead of having its own La Honda is an unlikely beast and pretty quicklyinto this book it starts to smell a whole lot like a plot device Only in sucha place would the motives of the engineers designers reporters andbusinessmen in this novel combine in the convenient way they do Fortunatelyabout halfway through Caspar and two engineers leave to form a startup andLa Hondas strange odor fades into the background            Theyre starting a company to make a  VWPCtheVolkswagen peoples car of Personal Computers They can do so only if theyignore the conventional wisdom that every new computer must be faster than thelast and do more Whats better their simplified software will run on anycomputer uniting the world in a new technological brotherhood Needless tosay these mavericks have an uphill battle to sell their idea            Where Million succeeds is as a character study According to the bookjacket Bronson has written about Silicon Valley for Wired  the NewYork Times Magazine  and Forbes ASAP  and he has clearly understoodsomething about the psychology of the place The misanthropic engineers themonotonic humanresource drones the evangelistic marketers even thenontechnical but talented girlfriend all strike painfully home I know thesepeople They are my friends my coworkersmy wife We see nerds at worknerds at play which is to say at work nerds in love and of course somenerd humor If Microsoft made cars  wed all have to switch to Microsoftgas says Caspar Have him killed            So long as Bronson stays inside their heads Iaccept everything that happens even when the technology and events veer awayfrom a world I recognize Its only when the plot forces him to hide the cardsof certain players which it does periodically that my disbelief isunsuspended When we can see into their heads Benoit and Acheson are avowedenemies The next thing we know they are teaming up to steal the VWPC fromCaspar and company and we cant really see how or why this might havehappened Suddenly they are characters in a novel not in my life            The lackof a profit motive is what really jars Even when our startup friends go outon their own they are doing it because its the only way to get things doneThey hardly seem to care about the money They give away rights for a songThey are totally focused on delivering technology to the masses I concede thatthis is admirable but everyone I know who has gone the startup route has beenpretty certain that they were also in it for the financial upside Its almostas if Bronson had started believing all the Im not in this to get richspeeches he must have heard as a reporter            Otherwise this book is pretty convincing and one of thereasons it is even or especially to those in the know is that its plot isessentially a novelization of reallife technology and events The fictionalVWPC and its enabling software Hypnotizer look a great deal like thereallife Network Computer and Java If you dont already know Java is aprogramming language well suited to the Internet Using Java you can createprograms that are downloaded directly off the Internet and run on almost anycomputer In theory this makes it possible to create a simple computer thatruns directly off the network and doesnt even need a hard drive            The soapopera that begat Java deserved to be written as a novel Sun Microsystemsengineers working on a settop box for interactive television devised a newlanguage They were ignored for over a year until someone finally realizedthis was the perfect language for the World Wide Web Suns marketers and topmanagement fought it out with the engineers for control of the language andwon Java is now Suns core technology asset and most of its designers haveleft the company            This userfriendly computer is not howeverthe magic bullet that both Sun and Bronson make it out to be Thelowestcommondenominator approach its creators take to solving the problems oftodays heterogeneous computer systems is highly controversial and not justbecause Microsoft and Intel who have the most to lose if the Java approachwins out say so Java works because it lets everyone run the same program butit is not clear that everyone wants to run the same program Forexample Microsoft has had a difficult time producing Macintosh versions of itsproducts Why Because Macintosh users want Macintosh programs not warmedoverWindows programs Java threatens us with a world where every program feelswarmedover in the same wayfunctional but not optimal                            Million would bea good read even if you know nothing about computers but its an even betterread if you do since it delves intriguingly in and out of the psychoses andoddball situations rife in this industry Just dont ask any hard questions ofthe book because it wont answer them
