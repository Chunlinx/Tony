              well Delphene do you own a P C   well yes i do i have a T I P C   oh   in fact i have two of them  i have i have one that i collected the the uh ports for one at a time   oh really uhhuh   like first i bought just the uh the central processing unit and the monitor   uhhuh   couple years later i bought a printer and then i needed a a hard drive   yeah oh   so uh there was this guy at TI selling a a TI PC for four hundred dollars and it had everything had the works   wow   and it had the hard drive and everything   umhum   so i bought that one instead of buying a hard hard drive for mine so now i have that one with the hard drive and mine with no  the the the other one with no hard drive   with a hard drive uhhuh   and what i thought id use them for was just to to do some work out of my house for you know people who needed uh word processing and stuff like that   oh okay well that sounds interesting   umhum the   my husband and i own a PC and i use mine for like keeping our home finances   uhhuh   and i also i i play several games on it   uhhuh   and i also was doing some work for my church doing some word processing on it for my church and that was really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done   umhum   with a PC   yeah i thought i might uh get some extra income somehow or another uh   i imagine if you advertise like in the   yeah   oh the i guess like The Texans or if theres another paper up there at at your office   yeah   you should be able to get some work that way   yeah i think ill Ill i thought about doing that one time in fact i saw somebody else advertise in the Dallasite once   uhhuh   and uh  thought about putting an ad in the newspaper also but then i might just get too much business   yeah you really you have to be a little more selective   but i right   you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper   umhum   uh there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because thats what it ends up being a cottage industry   umhum umhum well i i found a uh book once in the library that had sources for um work at home   umhum   uh you know some of them required that you have a PC but most of those wanted IBM compatibles   yeah is that what yours is   and as as you know the TI PC  is not IBM compatible   i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is   yeah they do the the um the Business Pro   ah uhhuh   which is thats what i have at work but uh   yeah   i still have the problem of upgrading mine either to a Business Pro or just going out there and buying a an I B M clone   yeah umhum there   then ill have three P Cs   well theyre real inexpensive to get the clones now   umhum   and i dont know if you watch your sale ads very often   umhum   but if you do particularly Best Buy   uhhuh and Circuit City   and Circuit City i saw a three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte hard drive with dual floppies and   umhum   oh gosh the VGA color monitor   umhum   and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a mouse for about two thousand or less   well umhum   and thats a really nice package for about that much money   uhhuh i saw um in fact i believe the one i saw was a three eighty six also it only had one one drive though but it had a hard drive   uhhuh   you know some of them have the little uh the the small   the three and a half floppy   yeah plus the the bigger one   those are nicer those i prefer that over the larger floppy   umhum ive never used one of those at all   they take up it you can get more information on the disk   youre kidding   no i dont know what it is i guess because its harder   umhum   that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones and theyre a lot easier to transport because its harder to to damage them   oh i didnt i didnt know that oh wow   being in the harder plastic case   umhum   so thats just a something that ive come across   umhum well im gonna look into getting one of those I B M clones   well thats mostly um now thats what we have we dont have a real IBM i dont know of too many people who afford IBM   but right   but uh weve had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute   umhum   and i would i would recommend it to other people
