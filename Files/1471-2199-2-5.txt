                    Introduction        The murine CD protein Ly a  kD        membraneassociated glycoprotein found on all T cells and        at low levels on Ba cells a CDexpressing subset of B        lymphocytes      CD levels on the developmental        and functional subsets range are ordered in a        characteristic fashion Thymic CD T  Splenic CD T         Thymic CD T  Splenic CD T  Thymic CD CD        T  Ba cells    The CD surface and mRNA        expression levels in these subsets are highly correlated        suggesting that CD expression is primarily regulated at        the transcriptional level        Structurally CD belongs to the scavenger receptor        family of proteins based on the homology of its three        extracellular scavenger receptor cysteinerich SRCR        domains to other family members   Several potential CD        ligands have been reported so far the panB cell marker        CD   an as yet unidentified lymphocyte specific        inducible glycoprotein   and VH framework determinants        on immunoglobulins   While none of these potential        ligands have been unequivocally shown to physiologically        interact with CD these potential CD receptorligand        pairs suggest that CD may play a role in TB or BaB        cellcell communication        CD has been shown to be physically associated with the        T cell receptor TCRCD complex in T cells and with B        cell receptor BCR in Ba cells     Although        several laboratories reported that crosslinking CD on the        surface augments T cells signaling by inducing calcium flux        and enhancing mitogenic response     recent        studies using CDdeficient mice indicate that CD may be        more important as a negative modulator of TCR and BCR        signal transduction    Consistent with this idea        the positive and negative selection in the thymus of        CDdeficient mice is altered in that their thymocytes are        hyperresponsive and hyperproliferative to activation        induced by antiCD antibodies   Similarly        CDdeficient Ba cells show higher proliferative        responses to surface IgM ligation than heterozygote        littermates          CD most likely exerts its negative modulation of        receptor signal transduction by associating with        SHcontaining signaling molecules This association could        be directed by an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosinebased        activating motif ITAM   or by a motif similar to        immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibitory motif ITIM        located in the CD cytoplasmic domain   Consistent        with SH interaction CD cytoplasmic tyrosine residues        are phosphorylated by p         lck kinases upon TCRCD ligation and        serve as targets for association with proteins containing        SH domains in both T and Ba cells            In human Jurkat cells and phytohemagglutininexpanded T        lymphoblasts the CD ITIMlike motif is crucial for        association with SHP a cytosolic tyrosine phosphotase        implicated in the negative regulation of antigen        receptormediated signaling   However in murine B        lymphoma cells the CD pseudoITAM motif mediates its        inhibitory action via a SHP independent mechanism                 Several studies have examined the CD promoter        Comparison of the sequences of the CD promoters cloned        from man and mouse    revealed conserved        transcription factor binding sites In addition deletion        analysis of the murine CD promoter indicated the presence        of lymphoidspecific regulatory elements          Here we present a detailed analysis of the CD        promoter Using unstimulated EL thymoma cells as a model        system we demonstrate that a CD expression is regulated        by a  bp region  to  bp upstream of the        methionine start codon for CD The presence of the Ets        binding site in this regulatory region is particularly        interesting because levels of Ets a lymphoidspecific        member of the Ets family    have been shown to        closely resemble the mRNA and protein levels observed for        CD in different T cell subsets      In addition        CD surface protein expression is greatly reduced in         ets  T cells           We show here that Ets protein recognizes and binds the        Ets site in the  bp regulatory region and that CD        expression is positively correlated with Ets levels in        cotransfection studies Thus we closely link Ets to CD        regulation In addition we show that two other        evolutionarily conserved regions located close to the Ets        site provisionally named CDX and CDY play a role in CD        expression Based on these data we propose a model for CD        transcriptional control in resting T cells that includes        interaction between CDX CDY and Ets                    Results                  Characterization of regions on the CD promoter          necessary for CD transcription          We constructed luciferase reporter constructs          containing progressively deleted fragments of a  kb          genomic DNA clone which contains the CD promoter             Figure a Each deletion luciferase construct and          a control LacZ reporter construct pON were          cotransfected into the EL T cell line and lysates          prepared after cells were grown for  hours were          assayed for luciferase activity          Results show that the  kb fragment induces a large          increase in luciferase activity which we define as the          full level of CD expression in resting T cells Figure          b Transfections with constructs containing successive          deletions of the  kb fragment show that removal of DNA          regions upstream of a StuI site at  relative to the          CD protein initiation methionine codon does not          significantly decrease luciferase expression from the          level obtained with the full length fragment However          the deletion of an additional  bp from StuI to HincII          site at  reduces the reporter activity by more than          fivefold to basal level which is somewhat higher than          the background level obtained with a promoterless          luciferase construct GLB  pGLBasic Additional          deletion from the HincII to the HinfI site at  further          reduced the basal reporter activity down to the          background level These deletion constructs define two          regions as important for CD expression a minimalcore          promoter region HincII to HinfI site that is required          for basal activity and a regulatory region necessary for          the full CD expression StuI to HincII site in resting          T cells                          The Ets binding site is important for full CD          expression          Three potential transcription factor binding sites           CCAAT E and Ets  were previously identified by          database sequence comparison in the  bp region          described above StuI to HincII   However only the          E and Ets site are conserved between mouse and human            To determine which of these potential transcription          factor binding sites is responsible for regulating normal          CD expression we performed sitedirected mutagenesis on          the CCAAT mutC E mutK and Ets mutE sites from          the StuI B reporter construct Wildtype control and the          mutant constructs were tested for their promoter activity          in EL cells As figure shows mutations in the CCAAT or          E binding site resulted in minor reductions in reporter          activity In contrast the mutation in the Ets binding          site completely abolished the full induction of          transcription and reduced the luciferase activity to the          basal level                          The Ets binding site is recognized by Ets          protein          The above experiments demonstrate that a potential Ets          binding site on the CD promoter is necessary for the          full induction of transcription Since Ets is          lymphoidspecific and its expression levels in T cell          subsets correlate with the CD expression levels we          focused our study on Ets interaction with this Ets          binding site          For the following experiments we used an Ets          expression plasmid pEVRFets which encodes Ets          protein    We then performed electrophoretic          mobility shift assays EMSA using radiolabelled Ets          oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts prepared from          pEVRFets transfected M cells figure a lane           This olignucleotide corresponds to the Ets binding site          in the  bp regulatory region of the CD promoter It          has the core Ets binding concensus with and additional           bases on each side          The pEVRFets transfected M nuclear extracts form          an additional proteinDNA complex complex  figure           lane  compared with the nuclear extracts from M cells          transfected with the control plasmid pEVRF figure           lane  This complex is easily competed away by          increasing amount of unlabeled Ets oligos figure           lanes  and  but not by increasing amounts of          irrelevant E oligos figure  lanes  and           Furthermore its formation is prevented by preincubating          the nuclear extract with antiEts polyclonal          antibodies which recognize the Ets DNA binding domain          figure  lane  but not by preincubation with          preimmune polyclonal antibodies figure  lane           Thus this complex represents true Ets binding          We observed two additional endogenous complexes          complex  and  that were competed away with increasing          amount of unlabeled Ets oligos However these two          complexes were also competed away with increasing amounts          of irrelevant E oligos Furthermore complex  and           are not inhibited by preincubation with antiEts          antibodies Therefore we conclude that complex  and           are not Ets specific          These competition and inhibition experiments          demonstrate that Ets specifically binds to the          oligonucleotide used for these studies As indicated          above this olignucleotide corresponds precisely to the          Ets binding site in the  bp regulatory region of the          CD promoter with the core Ets binding concensus and only          an additional  bases on each side Therefore we          conclude that Ets binds to the Ets site in the  bp          regulatory region of the CD promoter or very closely to          that site                          Ets affects CD expression in T cells          To understand the effect of Ets on CD expression          we cotransfected EL cells with increasing amounts of          Ets expression plasmid pEVRFets along with a StuI          B reporter construct containing either the wild type S          or mutated Ets binding site E As figure shows the          luciferase reporter activity from the wild type StuI B          reporter construct increased in a dosedependent fashion          with increasing amounts of Ets expression plasmid          lanes  Importantly the increase in reporter          activity from Ets expression was mediated by the Ets          binding site on the CD promoter as the increase in          reporter expression did not occur when the Ets binding          site on the CD promoter was mutated lane  and           Based on these transfections results and the EMSA          observations described above we conclude that Ets          regulates CD expression by binding to the Ets site          located with in the  bp regulatory region                          The CDY region is essential for basal          transcription in T cells          Using the Intelligenetics sequence analysis program to          compare the human and murine CD minimal promoter          regions we found two conserved regions provisionally          designated CDX  to  and CDY  to           figure a that abut the Ets binding site These          sequences did not show any homology to known          transcription factor binding sites Transfection studies          show that deletion upstream of CDX abolishes the          regulatory promoter activity but does not hamper the          basal promoter activity In contrast deletion of the          region containing CDX and CDY eliminates both the          regulatory and basal promoter activity figure b          To determine whether the CDX or CDY site is          responsible for basal level expression we generated          three mutations encompassing the CDX region Xmut          Xmut and Xmut and two mutations on the CDY region of          the HincII B reporter plasmid Ymut and Ymut These          mutant reporter constructs were transiently transfected          into EL cells and subsequently analyzed for luciferase          reporter activity          None of the three mutated sites on the CDX region had          any effect on the basal level of transcription figure          b In contrast both mutations in the CDY region          resulted in reduction of the reporter activity In fact          the luciferase activity was reduced almost to background          levels with the Ymut mutation Thus we conclude that          the CDY particularly the Ymut site is important for          basal transcription                          Both CDX and CDY regions affect full CD          expression          To determine whether either the CDX or the CDY          region can affect the full level of transcription          controlled by the  bp CD regulatory promoter we          generated the mutations described above in the CDX and          CDY regions in the StuI B reporter construct The Xmut          mutation had a measurable effect fold decrease on the          full level of transcription and the Ymut mutation          reduced the reporter activity by more than threefold          figure c However the Ymut mutation decreased the          luciferase activity more than five fold and brought the          transcription activity to slightly below basal levels of          CD transcription figure c These results demonstrate          that both CDX and CDY regions contribute to overall CD          transcription by modifying the transcriptional activation          from the  bp regulatory region and that the most          important regulation comes from the CDY region                          EMSA analysis revealed specific proteins binding to          the CDX and CDY regions          We performed EMSA using oligonucleotide probes          containing either the CDX or the CDY region to          characterize protein binding to the respective regions          As figure a shows several protein complexes can be seen          binding to the Plabeled CDX oligo lane           Competition with fold excess unlabeled CDX oligo          eliminated complexes  figure a lane  These          complexes are specific to the CDX probes as they can          not be competed away with the addition of excess          irrelevant oligos CDY CK and KE figure a lanes                    Similarly several proteinDNA complexes can be seen          in EMSA with Plabeled CDY oligo figure b lane           Competition analysis demonstrated that complex  can          specifically be competed away by excess unlabeled CDY          oligo figure b lane  but not by excess irrelevant          CDX CK and KE oligos figure b lanes           Thus we conclude that there are distinct intracellular          proteins that specifically bind to CDX and CDY and          likely mediate the transcriptional activity of these          newly recognized sites                            Discussion        Studies here define the regions within the CD promoter        that control transcriptional regulation in resting        unstimulated T cells growing in culture By constructing        a deletion series of CD promoter constructs using        luciferase as the reporter gene we demonstrate that a         bp region between the StuI and HincII sites at  to         is necessary for normal resting CD expression level in T        cells Further we show that this region contains an Ets        binding site that regulates CD transcription two        previously unrecognized regions that also control CD        expression one of which is responsible for controlling        basal expression of the promoter        Weichert and Schwartz   have also reported a        deletion analysis of the CD promoter Several of their        deletions overlap the deletions we report For those        constructs which were similar in both studies our results        agree However these workers observed negative regulation        with a construct that that we did not have None of our        constructs showed negative regulation We investigated        three potential transcription factor binding sites CCAAT        E and Ets within the  bp regulatory promoter region        and showed that only the Ets binding site influences CD        expression in EL T cells Further we showed that the        Ets protein binds to the Ets site and that overexpression        of Ets leads to increased promoter activity Thus we        conclude that Ets positively regulates CD expression        levels in T cells        Theses findings are consistent with previous evidence        showing that Ets levels in T cell subsets correlate with        the expression of CD on these subsets see Introduction to        this paper In addition they are consistent with evidence        demonstrating that CD expression is drastically reduced in        gene targeted mice in which the Ets locus is disrupted        While the possibility that the decreased CD surface        expression that was demonstrated in the gene targeted mice        is due to posttranslational rather than transcriptional        effects our cotransfection studies with the Ets        expression plasmid and the CD promoter constructs        demonstrate argue that Ets is regulating transcription in        all cases Thus the weight of our findings in combination        with findings with presented by others leads us to        conclude that the distinctive CD expression levels        observed in T cell subsets is due to the different amounts        of Ets protein in the cells in these subsets This        conclusion does not eliminate the possibility that Ets        family members other than Ets also participate in the        regulation of CD expression PU for example could be        important in the regulation of CD expression on B cells        since it is predominantly expressed in B cells and        macrophages    In fact preliminary evidence from        our laboratory suggests that this may indeed be the case        Ets which is ubiquitously expressed could also        contribute to CD regulation     However the        data from Ets gene targeted mice argues against this        possibility since disruption of the Ets gene is        sufficient to prevent CD expression on T cells Therefore        Ets is the likely regulatory molecule in T cells        We also characterized two regions CDX and CDY that        contribute to CD expression These two regions which        contain previously unrecognized transcription binding        factor sequence are conserved between mouse and human Our        results showed that the CDY region is necessary for basal        level of CD transcription Computer analysis of the CDY        region did not reveal any potential transcription factor        binding site or a canonical TATA box for establishing the        typical RNA polymerase II transcription complex However        the Ymut site contains a very weak homology to the TdTML        intiator consensus sequence PyPyCAPyPyPyPyPy          The Ymut site which is the most important site for        controlling basal expression overlaps a potential        initiator site fitting the consensus  CTT CCC TTT TCC         for the ribosomal protein Inr family with only one        mismatched base   Interestingly both Ymut and Ymut        are positioned near the most upstream transcriptional start        site          The initiator Inr element has been shown to be        critical in positioning RNA polymerase II complex for        transcription initiation in TATAless promoters          Since the CD promoter does not contain a TATA box these        initiator binding sites may play a more important role in        establishing transcription initiation        Several Inr binding protein have been identified TFIII          YY    and a  kDa TATA binding protein        TBP associated factor TAF         II    Recognition of the Inr        element by these Inr binding proteins ITF provides a way        for formation of transcription competent complex via their        interaction with TBP or with other subunits of RNA        polymerase II Thus we suggest that CDY region interacts        with these ITFs to regulate transcription        Like CDY CDX region does not contain any consensus        transcription factor binding sites This region is not        necessary for basal CD transcription but it affects the        overall level of CD transcription obtained with the full        length  Kb promoter At least three specific proteinDNA        complexes are formed in EMSA using the CDX        oligonucleotides We speculate that proteins binding to the        CDX region may interact with other upstream transcription        factors eg Ets rather than with proteins binding to        the CDY region This interaction we suggest acts to        stabilize a transcriptional competent complex and thereby        to increase the CD expression to normal levels        This suggestion underlies the model proposed in figure         for regulating CD expression in T cells In this model        the CDY region sets up the basal transcription machinery        by interacting with components in the RNA polymerase II        transcription complex andor with transcription initiators        since CD lacks a TATA box for establishing a typical RNA        polymerase II trancription initiation complex The CDX        region recruits transcription factors to the upstream  bp        region identified as necessary for overall CD        expression        The proteins binding to the CDX region in this model        recruit Ets protein and perhaps other Ets family        members to the Ets binding site Alternatively these        proteins help to alleviate the internal Ets inhibition        domains and stabilize the binding of Ets to its cognitive        site     In any event they facilitate the        interaction of Ets with other factors to form activate        transcription and increase it from the basal to the overall        level        Our studies here focus on characterizing the promoter        elements responsible for regulating the constitutive CD        expression in unstimulated T cells These elements we have        shown exist in a region proximal to the translation start        and quite distant from an enhancer element shown in other        studies     to regulate the activation of CD        expression in BCRstimulated LPSinduced B cell blasts        This enhancer element located at approximately  kb        upstream of the translation start on the CD promoter is        dependent on NFAT activation to induce CD expression in        antiIgM stimulated primary splenic cells cultured with LPS        for  days   It is reported to interact with proteins        in the proximal region of the CD promoter which contains        the all three regions characterized here        An Ets binding site also has been implicated in the        activity of the enhancer discussed above In addition this        CD response to BCR stimulation has been shown to be        mediated in part by vav which activates of NFAT          Our studies with constitutive expression of CD on B cells        are still in progress However preliminary evidence        suggests that unlike the stimulated CD expression in these        other studies the lowlevel constitutive expression of CD        on the M B cell line is enabled by the same  bp        regulatory region that we have shown here is sufficient to        induce full constitutive CD expression on T cells                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmids          The reporter constructs were created as follows The           kb genomic fragment upstream of the CD translation start          was excised by restriction digest with HindIII and NcoI          from p   a genomic DNA plasmid containing the          first two CD exons and the  kb upstream region Various          deletion constructs were created by first digesting the           kb genomic fragment HindIIINcoI with various          restriction enzymes blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase          and then cloned into pGLBasic luciferase reporter          plasmid The resulting deletion reporter plasmids were          further modified by mutating the blunted Nco I sites to          Bgl II sites The structure of all reporter constructs          were confirmed by DNA sequencing Amplitaq sequencing          kit PerkinElmer          The Ets expression plasmid pEVRFets contains          the parental expression plasmid pEVRF and the insertion          of the Ets cDNA The control expression plasmid          pEVRF contains the human CMV enhancerpromoter the          translation initiation
