        an interesting topic     yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh Mazda Miata     uhhuh   uh the uh im very much uh a fan of sports cars   ah boy you and my husband would have a whole lot in common   the uh yeah the um       uh though actually in some actually if i have i have avoided ive avoided buying a new car for quite some time id rather put my money into restoring my old cars i have a old Triumph TR Six   uhhuh   and uh       uh so uh but if i was to buy one probably something like a Miata its certainly it i wouldnt have to worry about it breaking down all the time  yeah   oh really whats the how old is your car   uh well i have a i have a nineteen eighty five uh eighty five CRX   oh   uh which is you know its it still works fine  but its  its actually its kind of annoying cause ive got no reason to  to replace it but uh   yeah right     oh yeah so what do the Miatas run     oh those are theyre about uh uh thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on but   well thats not too bad   the uh yeah thats a pretty good price and theyre theyre theyre theyre so so nice to drive uh   yeah really ive never driven one   uh its its its nice  theyre uh ive been down to a dealer and driven them and ive also driven one at a something Mazda put on where uh they went to uh auto cross events across the country uh which is where you race in uh you you race on in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of uh cones to see who can get through them fastest   oh   uh yeah about a minute or so and uh very twisty stuff and oh it handles so nicely   uhhuh and so youve done this oh okay oh   yeah yeah it was just it it its just so smooth and yeah nice car   really     what are you interested in   whatever my husband buys     you dont you  you dont get involved in uh car decisions   oh not too much no we um we just got rid of a full conversion van that that i i it that wasnt me that was my husband he wanted the van and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there T V you know the whole bit         but i never drove it so it just it wasnt me you know     yeah i can understand well would you want if you had to decide what would you want   and then oh id want a minivan  because im with the kids all the time yeah yeah and   okay yeah theyre nice oh yeah thats perfect for that its not it its small enough that its easy to drive   yeah you pick up i pick up my little one from preschool and the whole parking lots full of minivans but you know i i drive a little Subaru   holds a lot yeah yeah   and uh we i love that uh we were going to trade that in for the van but i just wanted to hold on to that because i just really enjoy that   right   and um thats really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back   yeah uh minivans are nice i have a friend who has a minivan and uh ive driven it a few times and uh its nice its nice of course   uhhuh   you know my family my family has always had cars like that uh in that yeah my father has had a had a always had a VW bus every since uh nineteen about nineteen sixty or so   oh really oh really   uh i       they  he he uses  he often has to transport plants or uh things like that cause hes he goes to orchid shows and and you know fills fills the car with plants and so on or   yeah yeah its amazing what a minivan can do we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan and pulled uh um the little trailer behind the pop up trailer and uh its so its really amazing how much a minivan can can you know what it can do     umhum umhum umhum yeah and theyre not that expensive   no theyre not   yeah   they probably we probably   mainly because everyone makes them you know you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be   yeah yeah and we we do a lot of um driving we do a lot of traveling by car and so thats the only time that the that the uh conversion van came in handy but it really didnt cause our our kids are still little   hum umhum   so um  that was the only time we really needed it other than that it got terrible mileage and   yeah yeah Minivans do do pretty well   yeah   you know twenty twenty twenty five miles per gallon or more   yeah   some of them probably even do thirty   yeah   the uh yeah there theres some other cars id like but i uh uh i would never be willing to spend quite that much money for uh like uh uh ill drool over them
