                                 Manning the Hospital Barricades            If you walk into thecafeteria at my hospitalor I suspect at any other academic medicalcenteryoull find a medical Bosnia We surgical residents sit at one end ofthe cafeteria the medical residentsor meddies as we call themat theother God knows where the psychiatrists sit In the hundreds of meals Iveeaten there over the last three years I dont think Ive sat down with themeddies more than half a dozen times            I remember one such timewhen the surgery table was full            Mind if I sit here Iasked            Thepack of meddies eyed me in my green scrubs suspiciously Someone grunted OKand cleared a corner of the table for me It was my own little Bantustan Thepack ignored me and resumed a boring conversation comparing how manyhitspatient admissionseach had and how little sleep each was functioningon Among surgeons its a point of pride verging on arrogance that we workharder than anybody else So I ate my meal silently looking faintly bemused attheir complaints Who wanted to talk with those donothing pillpushingpointy heads anyway            Later I took my share of ribbing from fellowresidents for going meddie at dinner Next thing you know someone saidyoull be wearing a dog collar Meddies you see wear their stethoscopesaround their necks Surgeons should we need anything besides our bare handskeep our stethoscopes coiled up in a pocket of our white coats like forgottenbut occasionally necessary detritus Like admitting youre tired being caughtwearing a dog collar is embarrassing It diminishes you            This allseems childish I know Why all this sniping along the medical front These areeducated professional people right If you pushed surgeons to explain Isuspect the response would be that the animosity is functional that patientswould not want surgeons accepting other specialties softer values            Surgery is not like other fields in medicinewhere it is commonly accepted that nature may defeat doctors efforts Becausesurgery is so violent surgeons generally do not undertake it unless theyexpect to succeed So surgical training inculcates the view that nothing mustbe allowed to go wrong One learns to take responsibility for almost anyunwanted surprisenot just death but an unexpected infection a dressingapplied carelessly anything Once I had a patient who refused to get out ofbed after surgery and soon developed a clot in his leg Medical residents mighthave thrown up their hands and said What could we do But the chief residentgave me hell for it It didnt matter that the patient wouldnt cooperate Whyshe asked didnt I figure out a way to make the patient cooperate            As theargument goes surgical residents quite naturally disparage specialties withless rigiddare I say less virtuouspriorities because our values arecentral to what we do So we seldom gripe about cardiologists because theyshare our ethic of personal responsibility and keep our long hours But pimplepoppers dermatologists Forget it Heres a joke we tell How do you keep adollar bill from a radiologist Pin it to a patient            This theory of discriminations functionalitydoesnt quite add up though Why not simply accept that our group has acertain set of skills and values that fit our needs while others have theirsIf we were sensible about it we shouldnt need to beat the meddies down            It turnsout however that to social psychologists there is nothing at all surprisingabout this antagonism In numerous studies they have documented a deep paradoxabout human relationspersons get along but people dont Encounters amongindividuals are generally positive supportive and rewarding but those amonggroups are ordinarily unpleasant and confrontational Whats more they observesomething called the minimal group effect Even if people are randomlydivided into groups the groups will automatically discriminate against eachother It seems we cant help ourselves            Afriend recently put me on to a classicdemonstration of the phenomenonthe Robbers Cave study In  someexperimental psychologists randomly divided  sixthgrade boys into two groupsand took them to Robbers Cave State Park Okla for summer camp Initiallythe two groups were kept apart and unaware of each other Almost instantlykids in each group formed bonds of loyalty and group identification Then whenthe groups learned of one anothers existence the boys immediately drew linesin the sand They spoke of our guys and those guys Each group nameditselfone the Eagles and the other the Rattlers Namecalling began at theirfirst interaction For example the Eagles called the Rattlers the niggercampers even though all the boys were white At common meals they gloweredfrom separate tables Cabin raids and fistfights ensued            Peoplediscriminate even when its against their own selfinterest In a  studyteenage boys were asked their preferences among paintings by two foreignpainters Afterward the boys were told that their choices divided them into aKlee group and a Kandinsky group In fact they were assigned to thesegroups at random Then each boy was taken aside and asked how he would divideup rewards among individual boys from your group and the other group            The results were depressingly consistent Theboys gave more money to those in their own group Furthermore when the optionswere fixed so that a boy could not give his group more without sacrificingprofits for both groups the boys still chose to maximize the difference inrewards between groups Although they knew each other from school althoughtheir groups were defined by flimsy irrelevant criteria and althoughselfinterest was not served they discriminated faithfully            In aninfluential  paper the social psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Learyreviewed all such studies and concluded that we have an instinctive need tobelong Given the advantages that would have come to our ancestors frombanding together in groups this is plausible Might prejudicethe hatredbetween the Rattlers and the Eagles the Klees depriving the Kandinskys thesurgical residents disdain for meddiesbe instinctive too I spoke withLeary and he wasnt ready to go that far            Given the pessimistic findings however wemight ask why groups arent always at war with one another Fortunatelyit turns out that despite how easily group hostility forms its not that hardto damp it down Sociologists have documented many methodsfor examplefomenting competition within a group even moral suasion At Robbers Caveanimosity rapidly disappeared when the counselors created common tasks forexample fixing a broken water tank Also these experimentslikeresidencyartificially isolate individuals from families outside friends andother social ties that produce bonds outside group lines            In fact one of thedifficulties I have keeping up my aversion to meddies is that Im friends witha few from my medical school class Why cant other meddies be like you I askthem It seems that given the chance we are legions ready to mass against oneanother Fortunately we keep getting distracted
