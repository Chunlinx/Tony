                well ive recently dropped my subscription to the local paper well not exactly local its a pretty big one the Atlanta Journal Constitution because i was thoroughly and totally disgusted with the quality of the paper was really pretty poor and i couldnt see spending half an hour a day looking through that   yeah i did the same thing actually i uh dont have a im not subscribing anymore   yeah i try and watch the news as well we get uh cable here and watch Headline news but its such a i dont know theres really very little depth to it they seem to be really out to try and entertain more than uh you know pass on any real information its pretty trashy im not happy with it   are you unhappy with the uh with the how should i say it uh the onesidedness of it or or the   uh the i think more the uh the just the the real lack of meat behind it i think there was an article in some local news magazine recently that mentioned it  talked about the uh uh level of uh reading ability or something or other and things like President Bushs uh statements to the public and they were comparing him with Michael Dukakis back during the old uh the the last election nonsense and they were talking about how Dukakis his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level while Bushs were down around an eighth grade level and by that uh being able to convey to that larger much larger of an audience you know he was supposedly that much more an effective communicator and i think thats the same problem with the news is theyre trying to communicate with maybe so many people that its just coming out really pretty poor   my my problem is that they just dont uh how should i say it i i can either get uh things on one side or the other but not uh a meaningful discussion   um   that relates to well how should i say i either get these highly polarized things   yeah i agree   and sometimes theyre i say okay were going to were going to do uh uh were going to be fair so were going to present two highly polarized articles which which is uh better than than one but uh   uhhuh yeah thats like uh trying to maintain a temperature in your house by running the heater and the air conditioner at the same time   so uh anyway so were uh one of the problems the other problem that i have is that that uh as you said uh a lot of the articles are theyre either fluff uh well actually out of the press theyre theyre fluff or theyre uh pretty shallow but   yeah     course i have i also have the option and i guess you do too of signing up for one of these uh specialty magazines which is like in the case of uh science you know you sign up for uh   yeah they are good   Nature or something like that but   im surprised at the the the range and quality of things that are out there like Scientific American theres such a broad uh spectrum of science and yet its really in depth at the same time   but when it comes to news uh its a i find it i i think the reason perhaps for that is that the uh the uh press like everything else is is becoming a uh how should i say is becoming theyre not neighborhood uh press anymore   yeah and national   theyre worried more theyre more like U S A Today type things uh pretty shallow and and can we make it uh and theyre run by you have ten newspapers that are run by uh   held by the same company   uh   yeah   yeah i agree we recently had Newsweek at the house but went ahead and dropped it decided it really wasnt what we were looking for and we started subscription to U S News And World Report but it hasnt started arrived yet going to try and evaluate that you know another interesting source of news is the is Email the network news do you get that   oh yeah thats yes thats one of the most interesting thats how i found out about this   yeah me too i really if if i when i move when i go to my next job im really going to be uh upset if i dont have access to that     well there are some places here in town uh for people that are uh having uh withdrawal pains so to speak uh theres a bookstore that has a uh uh subscription type thing where you can pay the guy forty dollars a a year which is pretty small potatoes   oh thats cheap and you get to call in across a modem   yeah call in on the modem and you can read your news i mean read your mail and uh and uh look at the all the different internet uh   oh man   uh groups   excellent yeah that really seems to be a a one of the cutting leading
