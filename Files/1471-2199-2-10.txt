                    Introduction        Transcriptional activation is one of the key elements of        eukaryotic gene expression A variety of genetic        biochemical and structural studies have revealed many        mechanistic details of this process see for review              In some cases the structuralchemical basis for        proteinDNA complex formation and recruitment of ancillary        factors that promote transcription have been elucidated        Mutational analysis has defined regions of transcription        factors  even specific residues  that participate in the        activation process          One of the most common        structural features is the acidic activation domain a        region with excess negative charge present on many native        activators as well as artificial ones These activation        domains are modular and can be effective when removed from        one context and transplanted onto other DNA binding        molecules             The yeast twohybrid system exploits this modular        feature of transcriptional activators      Several        variants of this general approach have been devised that        employ DNAbinding domain and activation domain fusion        proteins to assess andor recover proteins that interact        The exceptional flexibility and efficiency of this system        propelled it to the forefront of protein interaction        studies       The technology has also been adopted        for a variety of other applications including proteinRNA        interactions smallmolecule screens and screens for        random peptide aptamers               In this study we used the DNAbinding domain of a lexA        yeast twohybrid construct to recover short peptides from        random peptide libraries which function as transcriptional        activators A deliberate search for activator peptides        revealed that although Cterminal peptide fusions to the        lexA DNA binding domain had a higher probability of        activating transcription sequences inserted within the        structure of a green fluorescent protein GFP scaffold        also functioned as activators The selected peptide        activators were strongly biased in amino acid composition        compared to unselected library peptides However        structural features such as acidity observed in previous        studies were not absolute requirements for activation              Charge neutral and basic peptide activators arose        at significant frequencies A peptide  residues in length        was modular remaining a competent activator when grafted        into a new context These results are consistent with the        recruitment model for transactivation and suggest that        peptides may act as bridging molecules     Such short        peptidic sequences that activate transcription may be        useful in the context of drug discovery                    Results                  Construction of lexA binding domain peptide          libraries          Two random peptide libraries were used in the          experiments one that displayed peptides within the green          fluorescent protein GFP structure the other as          Cterminal fusions to lexA The GFP internal random          peptide library was fused to the lexA DNAbinding domain          constructed according to a method used previously             Figure  Each clone contained a different random          peptide sequence inserted within a loop located  amino          acids from the Nterminus which connects two of the beta          strands of GFP Thus the peptides were constrained at          either end by the structure of GFP A library of           million random peptides of length  was created in a          yeast expression vector consisting of a  circle origin          a selectable marker and the yeast           ADH promotor driving expression of          the hybrid proteins          Even though the library was biased at the DNA level to          avoid stop codons see Methods roughly one third of the          clones were expected to contain inframe stop codons          within the insert thus producing a truncated GFP          molecule containing only the first  amino acids of GFP          followed by Cterminal peptides of variable length up to           amino acids At least some of these truncated products          were expressed at high levels in yeast when fused to lexA          Caponigro unpublished The characteristics of the          library sequences have been described previously              No dramatic sequence biases were present          A second library in which  residuelong random          peptides were fused to the Cterminus of the lexA binding          domain was also constructed This library was expressed          from a vector that contained a centromere a selectable          marker and the           ADH promotor to drive expression          Again the library inserts were biased against stop          codons as for the internal peptide library Sequence          analysis of a random set of  clones revealed an average          Cterminal peptide sequence length of  residues with          no discernible bias for or against particular amino acids          Table                           Isolation of lexApeptide activators          To select for peptide activators the lexAGFPpeptide          and lexApeptide libraries were introduced separately          into yeast cells and plated on selective media Only          cells that contained plasmids which activated expression          of the lexAregulated           LEU marker grew The reversion          rate for the assay was low   Based on the          number of colonies per plate frequencies of  of          activating peptides in the lexAGFPpeptide library and           in the Cterminal library were calculated          Plasmid DNA from  individual lexAGFPpeptide          colonies and  lexApeptide colonies was recovered and          insert DNA sequences obtained For the lexAGFPpep          library these sequences condensed to  unique sequences          with only  sequences present in one copy Table  The          remaining clones  were observed multiple times one          sequence was seen  times not shown This suggests          that the total population of unique sequences was          relatively small Retests of individual clones revealed          that  were           bona fide activators For the          lexApeptide library only  were observed multiple          times leaving  single observations and a total of           unique sequences Retests confirmed   as true          activators                          Analysis of peptide activator sequences          Statistical analysis of the activator peptide          sequences from both libraries demonstrated biases in          amino acid composition and net charge The frequency of          amino acids among the sequences was skewed significantly          toward acidic residues Table  For the          lexAGFPpeptide library the ratio of acidic residues to          basic residues D  EK  R was about two           When the net charge assuming D  E  K  R   was          calculated for the  sequences a highly significant          bias in charge distribution was detected Figures             The preponderance of negatively charged sequences          exceeded that of positively charged ones by a factor of          about   vs  However one clone recovered  times          and confirmed as an activator in plasmid linkage tests          had a net charge of  and there was no significant          trend toward increased acidity among the more frequent          clones not shown For the lexApeptide activator set          the distribution was even more skewed Negatively charged          sequences exceeded positive ones by a factor of   vs           If the Cterminal negative charge was included the          disparity was over fold The D  EK  R ratio for          this sequence set was about   However there          were basic sequences among the set For example of the           sequences confirmed to have transcriptional activator          activity by plasmid linkage tests one was charge neutral          and  were basic  and  Table  Compared with          amino acid frequencies among the unselected lexApeptide          library sequences there was a highly significant          increase among activators of glutamate leucine          phenylalanine and tryptophan            p   Arginine was          significantly underrepresented A bias against short          peptides with stop codons that terminate translation          before the  residue limit is reached was observed among          the lexApeptide activators The mean length of          activators was  amino acids compared to a length of           in the unselected population          We also analyzed the activator sequences from the          lexAGFPpeptide library which encoded truncated GFP          sequences Based on their frequency in the nonselected          library stop codons were expected at a rate of  Of          the  unique sequences   contained stop codons          within the random peptide sequence Thus there was          neither a bias toward nor against truncated GFP molecules          arising from insert stop codons in this population of          activators However   of unique activator          sequences resulted in truncated GFP due to  or           frameshift alterations within the random oligonucleotide          Both the  and  frames hit stop codons in GFP within           amino acids of the random peptide sequence          Furthermore from the total set of  unique sequences           were  frameshifted When two sequences with           frameshifted inserts were picked from the unselected          random peptide library both behaved as activators not          shown Together these results suggest that translation          of the  frame of GFP after the random peptide insert          results in a molecule with activator properties                          Modularity of a peptide activator          One of the peptide activators from the          lexAGFPpeptide library derived from a frameshift in          the insert was tested for its ability to activate          transcription when separated from the GFP structure and          directly fused to the lexA binding domain This sequence          termed CoreActivating Sequence CAS contained  amino          acids WSFWIQEWNQS had a net charge of  and three          tryptophan residues Five of the amino acids were          contributed by outofframe translation of GFP one from          the random peptide sequence and  from the  linker          used to insert the random oligonucleotides for library          construction An expression construct was tested along          with controls for its ability to activate transcription          of           LEU  In a selection for the           LEU  phenotype roughly          equivalent numbers of colonies formed on plates for a          lexAGal control activator protein and for the grafted          peptide Furthermore cell patches revealed a level of          growth similar to the Gal control Figures and           Thus CAS was as potent a transcriptional activator as          Gal in this growth assay                            Discussion        In general native transactivating domains are        relatively large dozens of amino acids in length However        fragments of native activator proteins have been described        An aminoacidlong acidic domain from the RelA subunit        of NFB is capable of minimal activating behavior when        fused to the Gal DNAbinding domain GalBD     The        sequence when joined together in tandem arrays is as        potent as the wild type RelA transactivator Wu et al        showed that fragments of the Gal activation region between         and  amino acids in length provide activation        functions of a magnitude in rough proportion to their        length     This result suggests that short sequences        are capable of stimulating transcription when complexed        with promotor elements and that their effect is amplified        by increasing the total content of such short        sequences        A series of papers has explored properties of random        sequences including random peptides fused to DNA binding        domains in the context of transcriptional activation assays        similar to those used in the twohybrid system Ma and        Ptashne isolated a set of         E coli DNA fragments that when        fused to GalBD promote transcription     All         active sequences examined by the authors encode predicted        polypeptides that are acidic and a peptide as small as         amino acids was seen One sequence B  residues long        was shown to function as an activator when transferred to        the lexA DNA binding domain Yang et al serendipitously        discovered among a set of retinoblastomabinding peptides        three activators of length  residues that function as        GalBD Cterminal fusions     All three are acidic        with charge  or  Giniger and Ptashne found that a        designed acidic amphipathic alpha helix of  amino acids        activates transcription when fused to the GalBD            Using         in vitro transcription assays Gerber        et al demonstrated that homopolymeric stretches as short        as  residues of glutamine or proline fused to the GalBD        function as activators     Finally Lu et al screened        for Cterminal GalBD peptides  amino acids long Only        one basic residue was observed among the set of activator        peptides and no peptide had a net predicted positive        charge            An NMR structure for the lexA DNAbinding domain has        been presented     The structure is compact and        globular and probably interferes only minimally with fused        transactivating sequences In addition the success of the        yeast twohybrid technique suggests that the geometric        constraints on transactivation are not severe ie the        DNAbinding elements and the transactivating portion of the        molecule or complex do not require precise positioning        with respect to each other Because GalGFP fusions are        unstable we were unable to analyze the GFPpeptide        insertions identified in the lexA hybrid proteins in the        context of the GalBD not shown However a peptide        selected in the context of the amino terminal portion of        GFP functioned effectively when this GFP segment was        removed and the peptide was grafted directly onto lexA Due        to differences in expression levels among Cterminal and        internal GFP peptide constructs we did not consider it        useful to pursue more quantitative transactivation studies                    Activator peptides were present in the two libraries at        remarkably high frequencies   in the case of the        Cterminal library approximately the same frequency        observed by Lu et al     The fold lower frequency        of activators in the lexAGFPpeptide library may indicate        a role for the Cterminal negative charge the specific        geometry or the conformational flexibility of the fused        vs inserted peptides Considerably more than half of the        activator sequences we observed had a large excess of        negative charge a finding that is consistent with the        involvement of acidic residues in the activation process            However we observed several examples of charge        neutral and basic peptides Table  As a group the        sequences did not display obvious patterns of amphipathic        helicity based on the lack of   or  repeat units        Glutamine and proline residues were not significantly        overrepresented in the sequence set Instead in addition        to glutamate large hydrophobic amino acids were abundant        This result accords with mutagenesis experiments that have        pinpointed acidic residues and phenylalanine as special        contributors to transactivation             Two questions are raised by our and other studies of        peptide activators i what is the minimum size of an        activator and ii what is the significance of the        extreme sequence diversity evidenced by transactivating        peptides We identified and tested an residuelong        activator that functioned in two different contexts at the        Cterminus of a truncated GFP molecule and attached        directly to lexA Because we did not direct our screen at        smaller peptides we suspect that a deliberate effort to        identify smaller activators would be fruitful Indeed Lu        et al found mer activators though none was tested for        modularity     Nonetheless the tendency for        Cterminal activators to be longer than the average library        peptide suggests a preference for length in the        transactivation function            The recruitment model for transcriptional activation        stipulates that eukaryotic transcription is driven mainly        by recruitment of preformed RNA polymerase holoenzyme to        specific sites on the DNA     According to this model        peptides may bind one of numerous proteins that guide        holoenzyme to the lexA binding site Such proteins include        components of holoenzyme and perhaps other factors see        ref     Short peptides can bind proteins with        reasonably high affinity see ref     for review        Because transactivation is a process that involves        proteinprotein interactions it is not surprising that        peptides linked to DNAbinding domains function as        transactivators by bridging interactions that promote        transcription        The wide range of primary sequences and sequence        features described to date among peptide activators        supports the recruitment model Given the diversity of        proteins that comprise holoenzyme this model implies that        many sequences of different types would be competent        activators their sole requirement would be to bind        proteins within holoenzyme     The acidic peptides may        interact in a manner akin to native activators     But        the basic ones may for example bind other proteins that        contain acidic regions thereby forming a bridge to        holoenzyme Alternatively these basic peptides may bind        different regions of the holoenzyme components recognized        by acidic peptides or entirely different subunits                   Apart from scientific interest these findings may have        value in creating tools for drug and drug target discovery        using the yeast twohybrid system Isolation of a panel of        small peptides with different structural properties could        improve the performance of the system by providing an        option for multiple screens using a variety of peptides        This option might decrease false negatives and false        positives if applied intelligently For example a series        of positively charged negatively charged and neutral        peptides may enhance the accuracy of the method In        addition short activating sequences may prove useful in        the context of isolating peptides that interact with other        proteins Peptides that bind specific proteins of        therapeutic interest in the yeast twohybrid system have a        variety of applications in drug development These peptides        could be used as leadins for creation of peptidomimetics        Alternatively they might provide reagents for        highthroughput displacement screens     Typically        such peptides are isolated from libraries on the activation        domain of the two hybrid system     By substituting        small pepticals for the activation function it may be        possible to define binding sites with higher resolution in        the context for instance of the reverse twohybrid        approach     Caponigro et al unpublished Small        peptides active in the yeast twohybrid system may be        synthesized by Merrifield procedures labeled and used        directly in screens for small molecules     This        approach might avoid laborious testing of hybrid        proteinpeptides to determine which peptides bind        independent of their fusion partner Finally nonpeptidic        molecules that bind in a sequencespecific manner to DNA        have been fused to  and residue peptides These        hybrid molecules activate transcription      It may        be possible to produce smallmolecule activators or        repressors that bind DNA specifically but also activate        transcription of adjacent genes through a nonpeptidic        more druglike moiety                    Conclusions        Peptide activators are recovered from random peptide        libraries at high frequency These peptides display        significant sequence biases toward negative charge        However basic activator peptides are also present in the        set These results are consistent with the recruitment        model of transcriptional activation in eukaryotes and        support the idea that small molecules directed at the        transcription process may prove to be a useful therapeutic        strategy                    Materials and Methods        Yeast strain yVT EGY Clontech MATa ura his        trp leulexAop         LEU  was

    pVT was constructed by first filling the BamHI and        XhoI sites in pEG Gyuris et al  Cell         with Klenow fragment The resulting vector was        digested with EcoRI dephosphorylated with calf intestinal        phosphatase CIP NEB and a PCR product generated from        pVT Abedi et Al  that contained a version of the        GFP gene modified to have Xho and BamHI sites located
