                well how you doing   im fine i want to know where youre from   um i from um Plano Texas where how about you   oh are you i i am too   oh okay   are you at the Christ United   pardon   are you in Christ United Methodist   no um i i work for TI   oh okay   so thats how   well okay well um anyway um im with a a choir and and weve been doing this as a fund raiser i wasnt sure if they were still doing it or not but i know thats not what were supposed to talk about   uhhuh   okay im having dinner right now and and on the subject of food so just continue and you tell me something youd like to tell me about food   well are you are you having a Super Bowl party   uh no im not actually i wish i were   well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe  um   uhhuh   were not having one this year either but um im going to one and this year its pretty simple all i have to take is cheese  so i know i dont even have to make anything but   oh thats going to be easy oh well i guess my my favorite recipe that ive seen this week was fried green tomatoes did you see that in the paper   no i didnt uh uh its probably in reference to the movie im sure   right right   um i know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded really good are they i dont even ive never had fried tomatoes   well you know i dont guess i have i mean im from Mississippi originally and surely you know i dont even know that ive ever seen it offered to tell you the truth and but this this evidently is a Southern delicacy that i didnt know about   huh i didnt know about it either now we i have had um  marinated green tomatoes you know where you marinate them with onions and cucumbers but i dont ive never had fried     uhhuh uhhuh right well i tell you if you see that movie itll make you want them   fried green ones oh really   oh yeah it just they just really make it look good now i love things like fried okra       uhhuh   and i try not to ever have fried things but still you know if i  i think uh that the fried green tomatoes would be something like that   are they pretty does it look like its a pretty easy thing to make   probably you probably bread them and and uh you know like with corn meal and that kind of thing and then   uhhuh now i did i did go to a dinner this past weekend that was um   fry them in grease   at our church we had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were auctioned off were um services like a dinner for eight and then if you bought if you bought it   uhhuh   there were two couples that two or three couples that might cater the dinner   uhhuh   and one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines um years oh eight years ago and so they um auctioned off a Filipino dinner   ooh nice   and um so it was really fun one of the things that we had were was fried um bananas but but not fried bananas i dont know what theyre called but its a its kind of looks like the dough that they use for egg rolls   uhhuh   i dont know what its called but they put bananas in there and with cinnamon and i dont know what else and sugar and stuff and then they deep fry it and they use green bananas you know so that the bananas kind of stay together  and i have fixed fried bananas before   oh   as a um Cuban or Spanish dish   uhhuh   you know and theyre really really good but um when you were talking about fried tomatoes it reminded me of this the fried bananas that   oh i bet that was good i know i would like that   you know yeah it was really a fun a fun thing to do a fun way to raise money   do you work um in any particular what particular what area do you work in   im up at Spring Creek   at Spring Creek in what what area   uhhuh um manufacturing   manufacturing because my husband is works for TI also   oh really huh   uhhuh hes at hes at Spring Creek but hes manager of what are you manager of honey telecommunications   okay okay so hes in a different group   uhhuh always it its so funny you know his job is so complicated that i to me its complicated that i never can exactly describe this to anybody   yeah yeah i never can either i i mean i never can describe mine to my family or anything try to um i try to talk real real basic level when i get down to them   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh well um now back to Fried Green Tomatoes you be sure and see that movie       we saw it last Saturday and it was wonderful   okay was it   oh it really was   is it a girl movie i mean is it is it something my husband would enjoy   uhhuh well its either one yeah uhhuh it it has its a story that would appeal to both men and women uh Dave liked it a lot huh   because he doesnt like going to see girly movies like like  um Steel Magnolias he didnt want you know   oh no now but my husband liked Steel Magnolias but it was more like this is more like Driving Miss Daisy did you see that and um and this probably is even a little more   yeah yeah yeah   masculine than than Driving Miss Daisy even but its that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal   okay yeah i mean like i have to rent Beaches and you know some of those other movies   uhhuh
