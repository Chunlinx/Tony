               okay lets see um when i was working i would wear um comfortable casual type clothes nothing real dressy but um  mostly um i do like to wear shirts that are kind of longer and um   uhhuh   not real high high shoes i would say more   more flats with low heels   more more flat kind of shoes and something that would be comfortable to wear throughout the day nothing that would be too dressy   well i work in an office so i wear a lot of suits and but my shoes are lower heels im not able to wear high heels   umhum   and uh i wear but right now its kind its real casual in this office because were getting ready for this holiday and and were wearing pants and sweaters   which is nice thats thats   a lot of girls wear jeans but i just i dont approve of that in a office   umhum i felt the same way well i work in a private high school and i always felt like i had to dress i dress casually but yet i dress a little bit   oh yeah   dressy i dress totally dressy compared to what the kids came in to what the kids looked like you know i had to   uhhuh well youre an example for the kids then   right so i had this and real conservative my taste runs real conservative i like white blouses with little Peter Pan collars and sweaters and cardigans and turtlenecks and just kind of um just very conservative kind of traditional clothes and nothing nothing at all faddish i dont i get suits or dresses that i have that i had several years that i can pull out of my closet and they will still be in style just as they were when i first bought them   umhum oh thats good thats good uhhuh thats the kind to get   you know that kind of stuff yeah   kind thats in style for a long time thats the kind i have too   yeah and just just um   i like a lot of color though too   i do too i do too a lot of   i like the peaches and the   umhum well i have uh dark hair so i do like to wear the real bright i like bright bright royal blues and bright reds on on on me   uhhuh   and thats kind of nice especially for the holidays its fun to dress with all the bright colors   right well i have light hair its a kind of a reddish blonde so i wear the bright blues too and the   uhhuh uhhuh   uh but i cant wear red reds just too much   no too much for you uhhuh huh okay  umhum   but i like the peaches and the greens and the blues and and uh   and um lets see what was the question did we supposed to come   the seasons the colors in the seasons theres   okay     i like the darker colors in the fall the browns and the   yes now browns i stay away from browns because i have dark eyes and dark hair so for for me   oh okay well see i wear a lot of those i like a lot of brown   a lot of those who look pretty shirt umhum   uhhuh   that that i have a a little three year old that has very blonde hair and i dress her with different colors that i never get to wear like the bright the bright um she looks really pretty in yellow just like a real bright lemon yellow and um certain colors like that and she um   umhum   ill put on her and they look real cute  um thats it well   uhhuh yeah well i like a lot of nice i wear a lot of nice clothes too of course they are expensive it takes money to dress nice now   well thats the thats the problem i think its you know the way you would like to dress and the way you could afford to dress is two different   well when you work yeah when you work a lot of your money goes to your clothes because youre trying to look nice like everybody else in the office   yes thats right  i found that even just working parttime in this uh private school last year um it was it it was an expense just to get started to get the clothes after being home with the kids and like i said it was real important because i was working around teenagers and i like you said had to set an example and i   thats right thats right   well wouldnt have felt comfortable wearing jeans although some of the teachers did once in a while that i dont i very rarely even just wear jeans at home you know im not comfortable in them   yeah well now you could have mixed and matched them did you do that with different skirts and blouses and   yes   to make different outfits uhhuh   yes that that is a big consideration if i have a a solid navy blue blazer i might you know go ahead and pick up a plaid skirt or something and then maybe a solid whatever to mix and match that   yeah you can make umhum   i sit there and really kind of i really have to take a long time to think about what to to get because like you said you have to   can make your wardrobe larger that way by   right to make it right and also adding some accessories to different different things im not a real um i dont like to wear really big earrings i kind of have a few gold earrings that are my favorites and just little pearls so im really kind of boring in a sense conservative   well now the the scarves i didnt really go for the scarves did you     no they once in a while id id try one on and it would seem right and then before i walked walked out the door id have it off because it just didnt feel right   yeah i just didnt go for the scarves i dont know   i didnt um i didnt like that too much either   i knew some women that they in fact they still
