        okay ill let you start this time     well how much do you like lawn and garden work   well ah even though its totally out of my ah my degree training ive been working as as in the horticultural aspect uh for the last  you i dont know fifteen twenty years so uh im well i work for the state as as a groundskeepers   oh oh for goodness sakes what do you do uhhuh well thats interesting um so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work   no mostly snow removal  which weve had a lot of       but uh i dont know i i guess uh growing up on the farm and and that i ive always had a big interest uh i have a uh   right   when i have an area to do i i always had a big garden and   uhhuh   enjoy working on lawns and and everything   well  i love to work outside really and i enjoy flowers and stuff i dont do a whole lot of it um at this exact point in my life um because i have two teenage boys and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care   umhum     but i still take care of the yeah flower beds and things like that i was even planning to go out and to uh dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring   umhum   and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me and lo and behold about five days ago we had a freeze down to about oh twenty three degrees or something   umhum   so the hibiscus hibiscus plants no longer exist and i really feel bad about it its a plant that weve had for probably twenty five years that these were cuttings off of you know   oh thats terrible twenty three degree yeah yeah   so theyre all gone at this point gardening in Texas is really interesting though i grew up in Illinois   yeah   and um  Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry why you know everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land um a watering system   uhhuh   and so with that why our lawns do stay um you know pretty nice all summer if you water but in the winter we have Bermuda grass   huh umhum   and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack   right yeah   and  and i just think its ugly  when i go back home to my       parents in Illinois in the winter you know and their grass is fairly green   umhum yeah thats one one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant yeah i think the ah Saint Augustine and uh  centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there yeah those two   umhum umhum  yeah some people have i think its fescue   yeah   that stays green all winter but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer   um   they have to water an incredible amount but um those lawn those lawns look nice during the winter but you know they almost stick out like a sore i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb but you know when you look at the neighborhoods and theyre all brown except for one you know its sort of like well   yeah well i know my folks live uh in Arizona there and uh you know they just grow rocks and and stuff there       well and thats their gardening there so uh i guess as long as you can have ah some grass there   right   so i know i was uh in uh Houston and i i was working for a company once and we were taking care of lawns out there and uh that particular year they had just tons of rain it was raining continuously so   umhum   and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems   yes thats true yeah Houston is a a lot um a lot wetter than than Dallas Dallas area thats where Plano is and um  and just humidity   umhum   you know just all the time its an awfully lot more humid   are are you uh able to get uh sometimes a double crops of of certain things in your garden uh   yes uhhuh i think people do yeah i dont have a vegetable garden havent for i guess i never have here actually but um  but yes uhhuh ill we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio
