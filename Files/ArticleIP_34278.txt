                                 Dissension in the Rankings            An  and it must perforce be answered The chargeFiddling No not the fiddling of Nero or Nashville The matter is moreserious            For those not in theacademic racket or with kids long out of college or not long out of diapersit might seem a trifling matter But to anyone with an abiding interest inhigher education the stakes dont get much higher Because the fiddling chargearises in the context of college rankings  In the hushed groves ofacademia few things cause more consternation than an outsider using numeralmeasurements to gauge academic performanceeven though colleges anduniversities rely on similar measurements to rate their applicants            Heres the deal Many educators say its absurd to thinkthat the intangibles of a college education can be reduced to mere numbers andtheyre right But for more than a decade now US News  WorldReport has been providing kids and their parents a way to assess the mostimportant factor in choosing a college academic excellence Obviously thatsnot the only thing to think about when selecting a school But millions ofpeople find the magazines assessments useful And its a measure of theseriousness with which theyre taken that deans and admissions officers competefiercely to better their schools rankings from year to year            Comes now the fiddlingbusiness Writing in the pages of                   Slate                Bruce Gottlieb isadmirably forthright in his condemnation The editors of US News he writes fiddled with the rules in preparing this years college rankingsThe provocation for the charge This year the magazine ranked the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology first among national universities up from the No position just a year ago This was dramatic Mr Gottlieb writes sinceCaltech while highly regarded is not normally thought of as No             Fair enough We welcome challenges to our methodology anduse them to refine and improve our rankings To Mr Gottliebs gimlet eyehowever there is mischief afoot In awarding the No  slot to Caltech hewrites the magazines editors generated a sense of surprise by toppling lastyears uninteresting threeway tie among Harvard Yale and Princeton forfirst place Nobodys going to pay much attention to the magazines rankingsMr Gottlieb writes if its Harvard Yale and Princeton again and againyear after year Ergo the magazine fiddled the thing to generate a bit ofbuzz            The charge bearsexamination Never mind that Mr Gottlieb a former                   Slate                staffwriter is currently enrolled at Harvard Law School Ones attorney and onesmother abjure questions of motive But Mr Gottlieb is a selfdescribedstudent of econometrics which our Websters defines as the use ofmathematical and statistical methods in the field of economics to verify anddevelop economic theories Put aside for a moment that the US Newsrankings have virtually nothing to do with economic theory One may posit thata mind used to grappling with the kudzu of econometrics is more than up to thetask of dissecting something as relatively straightforward as collegerankings            How is it then that Mr Gottlieb falls so short of themark The magazines methodology for determining the rankings is based on aweighted sum of  numerical factors Mr Gottlieb the econometrician somehowmanages to misapprehend even the most basic of these The magazine he saysrates schools on average class size Wrong Its the percentage of classeswith fewer than  students and the percentage of classes with  students ormore US News  says Mr Gottlieb also rates schools on the amount ofalumni giving Sadly the econometrician gets it wrong once again Themagazine ranks schools on the rate of alumni givingthe percentage ofalumni who donate money to their school            But that is to cavil Itis not until he is well launched on his wrongheaded bill of particulars thatMr Gottlieb makes an interesting concession I cant prove that USNews keeps changing the rules simply in order to change the results hewrites No matter The charge is leveled and like a parched man finally led towater Mr Gottlieb keeps drinking and drinking            Summing up at long last Mr Gottlieb concludes that thesuccess of the magazines rankings actually depends on confounding mostpeoples intuition about which colleges and universities are the best Had hebothered conducting even the most rudimentary research Mr Gottlieb would haveseen that the charge is without merit Over the past  years  thetop  national universities in the US News rankings have remainedremarkably consistent Eleven schools have been in the top  every single yearfor a decade Every year the top  have varied from the previous years top by one or fewer schools In the past five years the top  have been exactlythe same top  Yes the uninteresting triumvirate of Harvard Yale andPrinceton has been there all along So have schools like the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology and others that virtually any expert would number amongthe nations best providers of higher education And yes Mr Gottlieb so hasCaltech            These are data even aneconometrician should be able to understand                                             Bruce                                                 Gottlieb replies                                       One week ago I wrote an in these pages criticizingUS News  best colleges rankings I had two gripes First thatUS News fiddles with its rankings to improve newsstand sales Secondthat the rankings suffer from a serious conceptual flaw            Brian Duffy and Peter Cary have written a rebuttalto which I have four objections             The DuffyCary response is padded with referencesto Nero Nashville and Websters dictionary but neglects to even address mysecond gripe This is especially odd since this chargethat the rankings arecargocult statistical researchseems the more damning of the two            Does their silence meanthey grant the point             Their comments also show a willful orinadvertent misunderstanding of my first gripe They essentially say theresnothing necessarily fishy about changeslike Caltech going from No  to Nothat surprise people Fair enough but totally beside the point Im notsaying theres something fishy about any eightplace jumpIm sayingtheres something clearly fishy about this particular jump            Specifically in  the magazines methodologysection rejected the very statistical procedureknown asstandardizationwhich this year propelled Caltech to the top of the listThe editors said that standardization would be unfair Now two years laterthe magazine performs a complete about face with no mention of theirprevious stance             DuffyCarys explanation for the flipflop is thatUS News welcomes suggested improvements presumably including theidea of standardizing variables The idea that they switched to this techniquebecause it was suggested to themby whom I wonderis preposterous Theywere surely aware that it was an option in  when they explained why it wasan inferior technique Furthermore standardization is not somewillothewisp notion whose stock rises and falls upon weekly pronouncementsfrom what DuffyCary call the hushed groves of academia It is a Statistics idea known to anyone whos ever opened an introductory textbook            So what can explain the flipflop that propelledCaltech to the top Perhaps we should follow the money In their rebuttalDuffy and Cary do not dispute that US News benefits financially whenthe rankings change            Moreover the magazine dishonestly implies that Caltech rather than the ranking formulas havechanged with the headline Caltech Comes Out on Top  employs linguistictrickery to downplay how much the methodological flipflop helped Caltech and fails to mention that Caltech probably declined in quality this year if theUS News standards are taken seriously Put simply the fiddlingtheory explains the facts better than DuffyCarys assertion that USNews strives for the truth             In addition to supposedly mimicking a parchedman finally led to water what on earth does this mean I standaccused as a selfdescribed student of econometrics At first glance I wasbaffled            For one thing nowhere in the article do I use theword econometrics And the only statistical example I give is aboutbaseball            Then I remembered myphone conversation about methodology with US News  residentstatistical expert Robert Morse He began our interview by asking me about mystatistical background presumably to know where to begin his explanation Ireplied that Id taken several econometrics courses as an undergraduate and hadspent a year working at a statistical consultancy firm in Washington DCcalled Mathematica Policy Research  At the time he seemed ratherpleased to hear this and flattered me that few reporters had similar groundingin statistical theory             DuffyCary end by noting that even aneconometrician can see that the top  schools on their list dont change muchfrom year to year This is meant to disarm my conclusion that US Newsfiddles with the rankings to confound our intuition and sell magazinesHowever as DuffyCary are well aware its perfectly possible to keep the top colleges static and still generate buzz by say moving No  up to No            Lastly they seem especially proud of the fact thatthe top  contains all those schools we intuitively feel are the nationsbest Well one question If the rankings just confirm intuition then why buythem in the first place Could it be to see who is No  this year
