                                      ITALY AND THE ITALIANS        From the Alps down to the southern tip of Sicily Italy        provides the most tangible proof that the world is indeed a wonderous        stage Architects and sculptors treat the myriad parks and gardens as        set designs and nature turns the landscapes replete with statuesque        cypresses tortuous olive and fig trees and rows of vineyards into so        many artful backdrops for the daily brio and histrionics of la vita        italiana        In the cities the cathedrals palazzos monumental public        buildings and openair piazzas are planned as if harmonious elements        in unrivalled stagesets Venices dazzling basilica the Doges Palace        Palazzo Ducale and the yearold Clock Tower Torre        dellOrologio all within the sprawling Piazza San Marco and adjacent        Piazzetta are the very focus of the citys life The same is true of        Romes grand piazzasNavona del Popolo and di Spagna Sienas        unique Campo and Florences elegant Piazza della Signoria Conceived        as a theater and emphasizing the decorative space as much as the        buildings surrounding it the piazza satisfies the need of        Mediterranean peoples to conduct their lives in the open air        And we mustnt overlook the players In each town at that        magic moment of the passeggiata at the end of each afternoon they        stroll across the piazza find themselves a wellplaced seat at their        favorite caf or stand in groups to argue business politics or        soccer the latter tends to be the most popular subject Their        celebrated gift for gesticulation aids the inherent air of drama that        reassures them of the appreciation of their audience No people more        joyfully live up to their legendary image than the Italians As Orson        Welles put it all odd million of them are actors with only a few        bad ones and those he added most unfairly are found on the stage and        in films        Watch them at the wheel of a car Long ago driving became a        major opportunity for the Italians to display their dramatic talents        An Italian designer observed that a nations cars are like its people        Scandinavian and German models are solid strong and reliable built        to resist an accident Italian cars tend to be more fragile but slick        and spirited built to avoid an accident They are designed above all        to indulge the national sense of style The imaginative flair of a        Neapolitan taxi driver zigzagging out of a traffic jam forces the        admiration of any nerveshattered backseat passenger        In the purely visual sphere style has been a national        preoccupation from the Renaissance masters such as Michelangelo and        Leonardo da Vinci to the grandiose cinematographic fantasies of        Fellini and Visconti in the modern era It is evident not only in the        splendor of the frescoes and monumental fountains but also in the        dazzling design of a scarlet Lamborghini a coffee pot or a fountain        pen The sartorially savvy manabouttown knows that good English        tailoring and the textiles used are not only to be found on Saville        Row but in the meticulous workshops of Milan Florence and Rome The        fashion followers of the world have long been worshipping at the altar        of Italys high priests and priestessesunrivalled fashion houses and        the generationsold textile factories that supply them        The world also stands in awe of Italian cuisine In the        simplest trattoria or most elegant of restaurants the experience of        your meal often begins before you sit down Not with the menu but with        the magnificent display sprawled across a long table as you enter        seafood antipasti stuffed eggplant and zucchini grilled peppers in        red yellow and green and whatever bounty this mornings market        yielded        If you take a plane or train the length of the peninsula        Italy offers yet another cornacopia of delights In the north the        snowcapped Alps and jagged pink pinnacles of the Dolomites the        gleaming Alpinebacked lakes of Como Garda and Maggiore the fertile        and industrial plain of the Po stretching from Turin and Milan across        to ancient Verona the Palladianvilla studded hills of Vicenza and        the romantic canals of Venice        On the west coast the Italian Riviera curves from San Remo        to Viareggio on either side of the venerable port city of Genoa Behind        the alternating rocky and sandy coastline from the marble quarries of        Carrara the mountain chain of the Apennines reaches south into        Tuscanywhere lie the ageless beauties of Pisa Lucca Florence and        Siena not to mention the smaller and arguably more magical hillside        towns of Montepulciano Volterra and San Gimignano        Landlocked Umbrias rich green countryside surrounds a        golden triangle of historic cities the Assisi of St Francis the        noble university hillside town of Perugia and the medieval mountain        post of Gubbio To the east the grand Byzantine citadel of Ravenna        dominates the seaside resorts lining the Adriatic        The Eternal City Rome lies halfway down the west coast        For more than  centuries it has witnessed countless declines falls        and rebirths and today continues to resist the assaults of brutal        modernity in its timelocked colorrich historical center        Another world unto itself the exhilarating chaos of Naples        commands its magnificent bay the visible isles of Ischia and Capri        and the ruins of Pompeii in the shadow of Vesuvius its still active        volcano To the south the former fishing villages of Sorrento and        Positano spill down the craggy cliffs of the serpentine Amalfi coast        justifiably tauted as one of the worlds most beautiful drives On the        other side of the peninsula off the tourist track in the peninsulas        heel are the curiously romantic landscapes of Puglia from its        centuriesold trulli constructions to the medieval fortresses of the        German emperors        Italys western approaches are guarded by two of the        Mediterraneans largest islands Sardinia and Sicily both rugged        mysterious and steeped in history Smaller islands with fabled names        such as Elba Stromboli and Lipari fill in the necklace of floating        gems many reached only by boat where the lifestyle is that of the        Mediterranean one hundred years ago        The Italian people with Latins and Etruscans mixing over        themillennia with Greeks Lombards Normans French and Spaniards are        as fascinatingly diverse as this panoply of landscapes Each region        sustains a solid and pugnacious local pride from historic division into        the citystates duchies kingdoms and republics of Florence Naples        Venice Lombardy Piedmont and Sicily Nurtured within the        geographical separations of the Alps the Po valley and the coasts on        either side of the Apennines it was this very diversity that created        the richness of Italian art and its competing regional schools of        painting and architecture Significantly the move toward national        unity in the th century coincided with a dramatic artistic decline        from which the country is only now recovering        Given its short history as a unified nation much of        Italys patriotic sense seems to be most visible in the national        football soccer team After the devastating experience of Mussolinis        fascism national government is rarely regarded as an obvious solution        to the peoples daily problems If some form of government proves        necessary they prefer the local town hall to the parliament in        Rome        Most Italians are naturally cheerful and friendly towards        foreigners In recent years there have been unprecedented numbers of        immigrants from the Balkans Eastern Europe and Africa The Italians        reserve their scorn for each otherVenetians and Romans or Milanese        and Neapolitans comically bemoan the new EUimposed automobile license        plates that no longer designate the drivers origin It is not so easy        to recognize the home town of a fellow driver        Beyond the regional identifications the country remains        divided culturally economically and psychologically between the        prosperous industrial North and less developed South or Mezzogiorno        Midday This division was perpetuated by centuries of feudal rule        in Naples and Sicily while the North developed more progressive forms        of economy and government The division has come almost to the point of        regarding the South as Italys own Third World as it offers a supply        of cheap migrant labor        But the warmhearted highspirited Neapolitans in no way        feel themselves inferior to the cool pragmatic managerial types of        the vibrant northern cities Italys two halves come face to face in        Turin where Fiats automobile factories have for generations attracted        thousands of workers from the Mezzogiorno Sociologists have noted that        the transplanted southerners tend to support the populist Juventus        football team owned by Fiats Agnelli family while the other more        bourgeois local team Torino is favored by the longerestablished        Turin citizenry        Foreign visitors are not obliged to take sides We are free        to fall in love with the entire country and invariably do its a        glorious lifelong love affair        FACTS AND FIGURES        Geography The Italian landmass covers  sq km         sq miles The familiar bootlike silhouette stretches         km  miles from the northwest Alpine frontier with France to the        southeast heel of Puglia Below the three great lakes Maggiore        Como and Garda the fertile plain of the Po river separates the Alps        from the
