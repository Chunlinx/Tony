                what are some of the things that you do with them   well my oldest son is eleven and he is really into sports and my little girl just started sports anyway my oldest son he plays baseball right now and hes a pitcher on his team and hes doing really well and we go to all the ball games and everything and his dads a scoutmaster and so hes a scout in the troop and they spend a lot of troop time together doing scouting things   wow   uh my little girl shes seven and and just got through with soccer and so we would wed have to split time and my husband would go one place and id go the other place but we one or the other would be at the games   uhhuh   and then i have a four year old and we spend time here at home i read to him and things like that as a matter of fact one thing our family does is we try to uh go to the library and everybody gets books and then i we get one book that we read together like story at the end of the day just before they go to bed and then i have a brand new baby and uh   oh   she takes a lot of time so i guess thats the time i spend with her feeding her diapering her you know  that kind of stuff rocking her   oh my well you have two boys and two girls dont you   yeah came out even   well yes oh well it sounds like really sounds like you do wonderful things uh in fact       uh i dont know uh enough families who do what youre doing now   a lot of families dont have that option   well um i think a lot of families dont but i think a lot of families do and dont exercise it   yeah yeah   uh sometimes i feel that acquiring things becomes uh so important and instead of uh just putting in your time in those early years   yeah   uh i ive seen it quite a bit with uh as you can tell probably know im older than you i have two only theyre both uh away from home and uh     uhhuh   they they engaged in the sports activities and it was interesting though our son really never wanted us to go we wanted to go because we had moved around quite a bit and thats a wonderful way to meet friends too other families   oh uhhuh   but he was a little shy about our going   uhhuh   but we did maybe every other game   well i get up there and yell and everything im a yeller and my poor son he says its okay as long as i dont call him honey   yes   as long as i dont say go honey   well when you said he was a pitcher i think oh gosh that is so hard on mothers   well its its um tense gets real tense sometimes   well being uh and i think other people uh tend to not uh remember that that is a child   yeah yeah it can be that way thats really true and you have to try and remember that too especially when theyre littler this year were kind of on a winning team   umhum   and we we beat a team rather profoundly and you cant help but feel bad but we had our years when they were growing up that we were beaten real soundly too   sure   so you know um i guess its all in the age and as you grow up and you get better and   and they should they need to have that uh feeling of accomplishment also   yeah yeah i think one thing like you were saying is we need to remember that it theyre just kids though this is not the pros or any big time thing we need to remember theyre children   umhum well i had friends whose uh son played basketball and uh he was on a team for two years and maybe got into uh two or three games both uh during the seasons for a minute or two   oh no   and i just think that is so terrible   yeah yeah   unbelievable i dont know how a coach could even do that   i know that here in Plano we have regular basketball and thats what my child plays during the basketball season and then they have what they call classic and the best players play and the ones that are just barely new sit on the bench most of the time they play a little bit just like what you just said   umhum    umhum   and and i we just dont want our boy to do that you know   no no well and i think after he gets older and if everybody knows that that uh theyre willing to when the son gets very good and they want to get on one a little bit more high powered team then he can excel   right   or if he wants to bid his buy his time a little bit sitting on the bench until he comes of age maybe another year or something   yeah yeah   but i think they certainly have to know what kind of team theyre getting on   right   well i love to hear about your reading too so many mothers and fathers dont uh uh take their children to the library i used to have a bookmobile that came by our house   oh thats great   it was wonderful and we could take as many books as we wanted to   yeah   they didnt come but about every two weeks and so you know you can go through a lot of books really   um well thats a good amount of time two weeks   yeah uhhuh so it was just really wonderful so   oh that sounds great you know i used to read to them and now my two oldest can read to me every so often and thats really been fun too that they read to me   yes there was an experiment here well i dont guess it was an experiment it was just a project in uh one of the schools here in Charlotte one of the elementary schools uh where the kids uh didnt watch television for a couple of weeks   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh there was a lot of cooperation i think uh among the parents and children with this and many that they interviewed afterwards said no they really didnt didnt miss it they they got kind of used to it and it was okay   yeah   so   yeah and they say when you dont watch TV as much youre more creative and and imaginative in your own mind of games to play and things to do   well of course   instead of just being entertained all the time   umhum yeah i worry about the couch potato uh   yeah syndrome   yes well Clarisse its been very enjoyable talking to you   yeah oh Terry i just appreciate you too   oh thank you so much   thanks have a good day   you too bye   okay byebye
