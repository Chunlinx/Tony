                                 Power Meet Money            The first time I saw AOL boss Steve Case was at the White House Correspondents Dinner the annual sniffandscratch statusparty for DC media Case was standing on the patio sipping a drink when a mobof reporters bullrushed past him and descended on Paula Jones Case watchedthis spectacle expressionless The moment crystalized the nonrelationshipbetween Old Establishment Washington and New Washington My indifference isgreater than yours            At this springs correspondents dinner reporterswill be swarming around Case In buying Time Warner Case has made himself thebiggest media mogul DC has known A Case deputy Ted Leonsis has become alocal celebrity by purchasing the Washington Capitals hockey team Leonsis andhis two selfmade zillionaire business partners will soon own the NBAsWashington Wizards as well Leonsis recruited Michael Jordan to run theWizards Daniel Snyder another new money tyro just bought the citys mostprecious institution the Washington Redskins And DC has suddenly noticedthat a yearold named Michael Saylor has made more than  billion running atech company called MicroStrategy            These are just a handfulof the thousands of people old Washington has never noticed who live inVirginia exurbs old Washington could not find on a map Herndon SterlingMerrifield who work for businesses old Washington cannot understand datamining and who have made enough money to do whatever they want which seemsnot to include socializing in or with Georgetown DCs elite ofpoliticians lawyers lobbyists and journalists has woken up andrealizedhalfthrilled halfhorrifiedthat it is no longer the center ofWashington            Until a year or so ago Old Washington and New Washingtonwhich isnt even Washington its Northern Virginia shared nothing but mutualdisregard Tech companies have been congregating in Northern Virginia and toa lesser extent suburban Maryland for three decades Most were defensecontractorsquiet bureaucratic firms that churned punch cards for thePentagon and had no social cachet Telecom and satellite firms such as MCI setup in DC in the s and s They were mostly lawyers who came to thecapital to be near regulators No one noticed as they wove seamlessly into thecitys lawyerlobbyist fabric The Internet companies that have emerged in thepast five years are different They are run by entrepreneurs not lawyers andthey arent near DC because they need the blessings of the government            The Washington Post established DCsattitudes toward the new suburban techies It didnt notice them AOL did notmake the Post s front page until  and made it only infrequentlyuntil  The Reliable Source the Post s gossip column mentionedAOL only once before July  a  item about Cases wedding Insofaras the Post did notice it was usually to point out AOLs very realbusiness problems a plunging stock price irritated customers harsh economicrealities The Post passed on chances to invest in AOL in  and  Leonsis told me with relish            Kara Swisher who coveredAOL for the Post in the mids and wrote the definitive book about thecompany aolcom  says the Post was antiAOL because the paperfixated on national politics All they cared about was who was going to be theDepartment of the Interiors undersecretary for trees Meanwhile  milesaway these guys are becoming billionaires and affecting average citizens morethan any of these political people ever will            The rest of elite DC followed the Post s leadWashington is a salary town not an equity one Elite Washingtonians can earn alotlawyers and lobbyists clear  million or more a yearbut dont amass hugefortunes Money has never been any criterion for success in Washingtonbecause power is the criterion says Sally Quinn the authority onestablishment DCs sociology Rich folks who have Washington cachet such asformer Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin acquire it by virtue of their powernot their wealth Homegrown fortunes have never impressed the establishmentRealestate moguls the only folks who made real money in DC until recentlywere shut out of power Washingtonexcept for sports team owners Jack Kent Cookeand Abe Pollin            Establishment Washingtonalso overlooked the nerd millionaires because the cultural clues are alldifferent In Washington important people of both sexes still wear dark suitsof conservative cut In cyberland you cant tell a senior vice president froma janitor at least not by his clothing Nor is Washington charmed by thepreening quirkiness of the tech culture We were weird We had guys putting upchandeliers in their offices or lifting weights or watching GeneralHospital  This was not the DC model says Mario Morino the founder ofLegent and godfather of the Virginia technology industry            The Virginians reciprocated Washingtons indifference Mostof the hot new companies are outside the Beltway  miles or more from theWhite House The techies labor like dogs on their suburban campuses live nearwork and spend what social time they have with each other They couldnt beless interested in Capitol Hills machinations They buy boats play the stockmarket fiddle with software and gadgets They buy mansions in Great Falls andReston not townhouses in Kalorama and rarely go into the city They areInternet citizens They could be  miles from Washington or  miles saysGary Arlen who runs a local technologyresearch firm They are here almost byaccident AOL is in Virginia because founder Jim Kimsey is a Washingtonian andhe resisted efforts to relocate the company to Silicon Valley            Most of the techexecutives are uninterested in politics though Case is an exception Theydont see a need for Washington They cant imagine being a part of it It isslowmoving There is compromise It does not involve the purity of starting acompany says Bill Regardie editor of the Washington business magazineRegardies Power             But in the last year the two elites have finally realizedthey need each other Most of the rapprochement is coming from the Washingtonestablishment which now understands that the Northern Virginians have ungodlyamounts of money energy and even glamour DC is succumbing to the money andnerd fascination that has captured the rest of the country The Post ispouring resources into tech coverage Scarcely a day passes without afrontpager on AOL or another local Netrepreneur made good When AOL and TimeWarner merged the entire business staff and much of the Style section divedon the story The highestprofile millionaires are becoming celebrities TheReliable Source now chronicles Leonsis exploits as the Caps owner Casesparty visits and Saylors dating habits The White House packed its millenniumparty with tech leaders Nonprofits are courting the new plutocrats in hopes ofscoring philanthropic millions            The tech millionairesmeanwhile have realized they can use the establishment Microsofts disastrousneglect of Washington reminded AOL not to make the same mistake Caserepeatedly says that policy will be more important than technology in shapinghis industry and he is striving to become a DC player He eats dinner withKatharine Graham socializes with Colin Powell and even hammed it up withWilliam Bennett at a benefit Case hired George Vradenburg a highpoweredlobbyist to represent AOL on the Hill Vradenburg is showering Congress withattention He estimates that he has brought  House members and senators tothe AOL campus for show and tell            Geek money is wedging into Washington society throughsports Leonsis has been deluged with invitations from old Washington groupssince he bought the Capitals Invitations he does not have time to accept Ihave a job he says Power Washington is miffed that Snyder doesnt think itis important but DC folks still crave an invitation to sit in his Redskinsowners box Kimsey is campaigning to bring a baseball team to the area            Sally Quinn contends thatthe nerd tycoons can only go so far in Washington Money is not what we dohere In Seattle thats what they do But this is the power capital of theworld No matter how much money you have power is going to be the main eventIt is not like they are going to come in and usurp that            But perhaps money has never gone very far in Washingtonbecause Washington has never really had money This is the first time DC hashosted large successful businesses All the Washington establishment folks Ispoke to admitted that they were fascinated by Case and his confreres Moneyhasnt supplanted power but may have matched it An ambitious young lawyerhungry for power used to join a big firm make partner schmooze senators anddie happy But these days Saylor is holding mixers for young DC associatesand picking them off to work at MicroStrategy with high salaries and stockoptions Tech venture capitalist and former Senate candidate Mark Warner saysthat his politician friends have been imploring him to get their children jobsat hot dotcoms            In the s and s young people came toWashington because they were idealists and they wanted to change the worldsays Warner In the s they came because they wanted to have power and makea good living as a lobbyist or lawyer Now they are coming because they want todo an IPO After all influence is hard to measure Equity isnt
