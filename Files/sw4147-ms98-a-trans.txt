        do you have any     yes we do have a pet we have a  a dog that we got from the uh well we call it the S P C A its the uh animal from an animal shelter uh hed come in there as a stray uh hes a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross uh   uhhuh all right yeah   well he was very well trained when we got him uh hes   oh thats good you dont often find that i dont think   no uh we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because   right   a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him   uhhuh   and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him   sure theres a okay uh thats interesting yeah the only pet that ive had uh im a im a doctoral student right now   uhhuh   and in my in my earlier days as a student  i kind of time shared on a dog with a a good friend of mine       and uh it was an amazing dog it really was they had he had gotten it from the pound and uh it its a Spanish Pointer named Domino   oh yeah   kind of looks like a Dalmatian a Dalmatian and we trained it from a pup and basically it right now it its fully trained and it can do   uhhuh   a lot of things it will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff so its really  its its kind of a show piece anymore and whenever anybody comes over we all have to show him Domino you know   oh i think so   yeah its uh shes been a real good a real good dog and uh just its kind of a shame that im im gone im away from it now i i just i actually live in Florida   uhhuh   but im on an internship up here for a year and then i go back down but uh yeah Dominos a real good dog uh   yeah   what uh possessed you to get the dog   well i i guess in one sense we felt that it its nice to have a dog even though there are you know complications come with it and then with our children uh at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight so   yeah uhhuh   it was an age where it was uh we thought it was be good for them to have the  discipline that goes with with having a pet uh   sure sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that thats good that kind of builds some character a little bit   yeah right   uh well thats the idea i think the reality of it is that they perhaps uh it depends on the on everyones discipline   umhum   and uh from that aspect im short on the discipline because i dont uh enforce that the kids look  after the dog and uh weve had him about four years now   uhhuh   uh but i think it does it it you know its necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh   yeah thats something thats important for sure   yeah   i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh  or   uh actually no we live in a in an area thats oh probably about two and a half miles from the university   oh i see   uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area   um   and uh so that is not as good uh  you know this dog being a small dog its uh more you more acceptable but again   yeah yeah its not that big of a problem With Domino she was full grown i would estimate seventy pounds   yeah   and you know we we lived in Oviedo which is a small town its a suburb of Orlando   uhhuh   but  theres not there wasnt a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run so that was the biggest problem i saw and i think thats one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or can you know i guess you cant really say for cats me and cats dont get along too well uh  but you know that whole space issue i think is real important   yeah its uh thats one of the biggest concerns its like uh theres a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal   right yeah that that   and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise   sure and thats all part of your of keeping your part of the relationship you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues   right well   you know and also the whole whole thing with noise my mother oh she freaks out because shes got neighbors that have dogs that dont train them   uhhuh   and you know we had we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had uh Brittany Spaniels and theyre very high strung animals to begin with but uh
