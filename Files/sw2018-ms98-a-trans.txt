        hello this is Lois   hello hi hi this is Lisa   and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions   umhum yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though   yeah this is about changes in women in the   umhum   uh theres really a lot isnt there i mean there really is   yeah its kind of an easy thing to talk about   oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldnt it it uh   yeah um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it   okay   all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations   okay yes yes i know because i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasnt very many opportunities for her i guess shes in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and ive never faced that at all   um no i think now now you go to work when theyre six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation youll probably just work right along with your husband you know   uhhuh yeah umhum i think its definitely gotten better   oh i do too much and its just gonna get better it really is   umhum because women are in every field now i mean i cant think of a field that theyre not involved in   oh i cant either not a one   i know at least in the medical field it seems like theyve come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i dont think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing   umhum yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved   yeah hopefully the next generation it wont even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal   yes yes oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it   uhhuh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess its kind of an ideal world though huh   yes yeah yes um yeah yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know youll go by social security numbers you know and that way they cant say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you yeah yeah     yeah exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think thatd be a wonderful way to do it   yeah theyll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have   umhum and then   and if you get it you know then   umhum also with uh women in the work force theyve gotten a lot more options as far as you know whats it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or   umhum oh yeah uhhuh as a matter of fact thats what im doing umhum it sure is it sure is   is it that would be great or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on LOA to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house   umhum   and she you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too   oh uhhuh yeah yes that is   i mean thats a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office   umhum yeah   so i think thats real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing   oh oh i do i really do i think its great   do you do you work like half days or half weeks or   uh well like one week shell work three days and ill work two and the next week you know ill work three and shell work two we just share off like that   hm oh is oh thats great uhhuh do you get the full benefits   umhum yeah we get the full benefits but weve just really got a wonderful system that were working under yeah   oh thats wonderful yeah especially with children and so many things going on that would be great   yes it really is and that way were not really missing anything out you know of those children uhhuh   either way yeah  you have your career and your home life and thatd be a nice way to especially if you have young children   umhum yes oh it is it is well both of ours is school age but we dont want to miss any of those PTAs and you know all of that so so   umhum oh no i think yeah my sons just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that youre involved in that   umhum yeah yes i think its great i really and i look for more of that in the next generation   yeah i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful   umhum umhum yes oh i do too yes   plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because youve got two days off that you can do everything so you dont have to you know unless youre just really sick or the childs sick   but yeah yeah because most time now you know its just a weekend or just forget it yeah   umhum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what ive done is found like doctors and dentists office with extended hours thats been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening   uhhuh oh yeah   so thats real helpful so you dont  you know have to do it  during office hours run out on your lunch hour i dont know how many times ive done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand   to do yeah umhum yeah i think weve really come a long ways in that because yes   so uhhuh i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just its always been that way but i know   umhum yeah but i can remember remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasnt that easy for her to just take off   oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didnt make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did   oh yes umhum where oh yeah yes   i think theres still some discrimination there where as you know men and work women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think thats improving its such a slow process its frustrating but   oh i do too yes yes yes   i mean you can see that its wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward   umhum they really are   yeah i think its getting better not worse well i should probably get back to my job   i know i know the feeling well it was okay and i sure will and byebye   call again okay byebye
