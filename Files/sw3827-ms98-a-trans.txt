        um Ashley um do you exercise regularly     yes i do i uh go on long walks whenever i can and uh well when i when i can fit it into my schedule and the weathers right i like to walk uh oh three four miles a day   uhhuh well thats pretty good i unfortunately uh am not um exercising regularly at the time um i weve recently made a move i used to be at the university where theres facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball   uhhuh   but um since weve moved to Iowa now um we dont have as many facilities like that um   well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool  every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment ive uh now its kind of difficult to find a pool thats convenient and affordable to swim in but uh what university were you at   i was at Brigham Young University   uhhuh   um actually i am working at a university right now i just graduated with my PhD at Brigham Young and im working at the University of Iowa however we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at Brigham Young but um oh its we the benefits here as far as um using the physical facilities are not free here so and plus theyre not as convenient were were further away so its not as convenient for like my wife to come in you know for doing things together   did you say youre at the University of Iowa Iowa City huh   uhhuh right uhhuh   i went i visited visited there once quite a few years ago had a friend who was in the linguistics department there   oh im in uh at the National Center for Voice and Speech which is part of the um Department of Speech Pathology   uhhuh   um   well you would do you have contact with any of the uh people in linguistics   well uh i just i havent been here uh uh only for several months and uh i im sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh im not aware of anything as yet   yeah uhhuh   um i   well if you ever run into uh to Cathy Reagan say hi to her for me  i think shes still there   okay   okay usually when the temperatures are warmer um i live about twenty minutes from school so um from the university so i often will walk in which i guess its im not sure how far it is um actually its twenty five minutes and its probably about a mile i dont know long its got to be maybe a   umhum well how briskly do you walk do you think how how fast do you walk do you think   what oh i walk rather briskly but i dont i dont do it during these winter months its just far too cold um   uhhuh well a brisk walker can go maybe what four or five miles an hour so if it takes you a third of an hour to get in youre probably going oh i would say at least a mile and a half probably   so yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um   yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to   uhhuh   this winter though its rained so much that uh thereve been times where see my uh favorite uh area to walk is a a greenbelt they have right through Plano here and uh you know its it surrounds a little stream over much much of its extent you can walk for miles there and never cross a street you you go under the streets   uhhuh   but uh when the uh when the water is too high uh youd get washed away i mean they have signs up there warning people to stay away so   oh   weve had that uh a number of times recently not to mention the mud of course   oh yeah   well you can get you can do the other thing i do is uh i have a little exercise bike that uh wasnt too expensive i got a cheap one but you can really work up a sweat on it   but yeah if i were to begin to begin exercise now i think itd be something that i could do um indoors something thats convenient um you know its like an exercise bike or something like that although i havent purchased one purchased one yet sometimes i do i have this little trampoline   yeah   small type trampoline that i do indoor jogging on sometimes for exercise but i havent really started been doing anything regular for the last several months since weve since weve moved to to Iowa   yeah i i really prefer outdoor exercise im afraid that my favorite indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesnt help very much           well outdoor exercise is uh more convenient however
