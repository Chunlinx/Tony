            all right   um  one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education because i went through the public um school system of Boston and uh   uhhuh   i always felt that i graduated high school and i still didnt even i i i couldnt put together a map of the United States   hm uhhuh   you know what i mean and yet i felt that i got a good education and and i did well in school but you tell me to name you know five continents and i couldnt do it  i just feel like there are some real basics that are missing from education   uhhuh huh   and that people are are leaving school  not even knowing some common sense things   yeah when uh well talking about public education um i was just just im were doing a proposal at were doing at NC State   umhum yeah   were trying to improve the computer science curriculum   umhum   so thats kind of at a higher level   right   so its interesting that you chose that topic   yeah um did you go through a a public school system or a private   yeah well i went through private until ninth grade   umhum  did you notice a big difference   yeah oh yeah big difference   like in what sense   well um in uh public schools i guess there were there are a lot of you know people can take lower level courses and get away with learning nothing   umhum   but um in private school you couldnt do that you know you had to learn   umhum yeah i work in a temporary agency and there are people that come in you know everyday to fill out an application and   uhhuh   theyll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed um four years of high school yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application   huh   they cant read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves   its bad   its just incredible   yeah our state just cut a whole bunch of uh like think its ten million dollars out of the school budget   really   so were making all kinds of cuts in college people cannot i mean the teachers cant make tests anymore and the the librarys canceling all its subscription   yeah   its pretty sorry   i know um they uh i forget what i think its um someplace in New York because theyre having budget problems theyre closing the libraries   uhhuh yeah   i mean theyre not getting rid of any of the sports   huh   or  anything like that theyre not cutting in any other corner theyre closing the libraries that to me shows a little uh switch in priorities you know   and uh yeah   so do you go to college right now are you in   yeah its my last year   youre so youre a senior now   yeah im working on my projects trying to graduate   oh good for you thats great um is is NC University is that uh uh state whatd you say   yeah NC State NC State   NC State thats a state university then i see  and youre from there also   yeah well yeah i was uh i was born in Raleigh and then i lived in WinstonSalem rest of my life   umhum i see   so now im back here  going to school   well pretty soon its gonna get to the point where no ones gonna be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college   yeah   its just outrageously expensive   luckily States the cheap one of the cheap ones   oh is it well still though i mean you know thousands of dollars   yeah yeah states not that bad      oh well thats good thats good i went to a private university and um   yeah   i i dont know i look back now and i i think that i probably wouldve done it differently if i um you know could do it over again but um   yeah   i i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didnt even go to school some some of them and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did       i really do and thats probably a pretty sad thing to say but um i dont know i i what   yeah whered you go where did you go sorry   i went to Brandeis University its in Massachusetts   uhhuh   and um i i really felt like ive been working now for about four years   uhhuh   and i i feel like what what ive learned working is a hundred times more valuable than what i learned in school   huh   and i know that im drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on learned but um i dont know my sisters a principal at a school and one thing that shes trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing um are just some the golden rules she calls them just some basics about um  you know you dont take whats not yours   umhum     uh and and if you want to you know you dont touch anybody else unless you have their permission like no hitting you know no pulling hair or anything like that   umhum   and uh the school that shes in is a um  its basically for minorities um theres uh a large minority population and um   umhum   shes really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there i think they dont value that type of student as much as you get in some   yeah thats sorry that that that they like pick on you know that the advanced stud ents and pay more attention to them ignore the others   yeah its true umhum   yeah   and i dont know if it makes them feel better i mean do teachers get i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking somebody that wasnt as successful   yeah   and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know thats not much of a challenge   yeah thats true   but are do you have any idea what youre gonna go into when you graduate   um graduate school  yeah   oh yeah do you know where yo ure going   i think im going to Chapel Hill   wheres that   thats in Chapel Hill  thats the name yeah never heard of the Tarheels   oh is that North Carolina oh okay no i dont know that area   the ACC Tarheels UNC   i dont know it   oh well   i dont get down there very often   they were in the final four dont watch basketball   oh really well the way i pick the final four was um by the the state that had the warmest climate   uhhuh   so thats how i chose all mine so you can tell that i didnt really have that much to do with any of it       but so obviously youre into education if you can be going my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now   no yeah uhhuh   and uh i dont know i give you a lot of credit i i couldnt do it i i couldnt wait to graduate and have it be
