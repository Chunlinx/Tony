                                 The Strange Case of Christopher Ruddy            On theoff chance that you havent followed every twist and turn of the case thereare two ways to reassure yourself that former Deputy White House CounselVincent Foster killed himself in Fort Marcy Park One is to read WhitewaterIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starrs justreleased report on the subjectabriskly efficient page document that makes an already overwhelming case forsuicide about as close to airtight as you can get The other is to readChristopher Ruddys new book The Strange Death of Vincent Foster Ruddy of course is the Inspector Clouseau of the Foster casea determinedif bumbling former New York Post reporter who has virtuallysinglehandedly spawned a cottage industry of conspiracy buffs dedicated to theproposition that a foul and monstrous coverup surrounds the circumstances ofFosters death            Financed by a cranky rightwing philanthropist RichardMellon Scaife Ruddys repeated bromides about the Foster case have beenrepublished in newspaper ads across the country his sheer persistence has ledsome casual observers to conclude he might be on to something The StrangeDeath  published by The Free Press a division of Simon  Schuster isendorsed as serious and compelling by former FBI Director William SessionsIn the New York Times Book Review  National Review senior editorRichard Brookhiser chides political journalists for failing to pursue Ruddysmany unanswered questions about the case            Dontworry when it comes to how Foster died there arent anyor none that matterRuddys bookand the entire movement he has helped createis utterlypreposterous Turgidly written and dense with  footnotes and sevenappendixes Ruddys plodding book repeatedly confuses the evidence and chasesafter scores of imaginary holes in the official verdictwithout ever positingan alternative scenario that makes the least bit of sense            To fully understand why the debate overFosters death is so phony it helps to review a few of the rawincontrovertible you would think facts Foster left his White House officefor the last time at around  pm on July   About five hours laterhis supine body was discovered by a secluded Civil War cannon near the PotomacRiver a bullet wound through his mouth his right thumb trapped in the triggerof an antique caliber revolver gunshot residue on his hand and bloodoozing from the back of his head There were no signs of a struggle his sportsjacket was later found folded over the front seat of his Honda Accord in anearby parking lot In the days that followed friends and family membersdescribed Foster as distraught over the demands of his job and suffering fromclear signs of depression Starr adds new details Just four days before hisdeath he reports Foster broke down in tears over dinner with his wife andtalked of resigning On the day before he died he phoned his family doctor inLittle Rock Ark According to the doctors typewritten notes published inStarrs report for the first time Foster complained of stress anorexia andinsomnia and received a prescription for Desyrel an antidepressant            It isRuddys contention that none of this should necessarily be believed thedoctor the widow the friends the Park Police officers that found the bodythe coroner who performed the autopsyall may well be complicit in acoverup But why As far as the Park Police goes Ruddy argues theymistakenly rushed to the judgment that Fosters death was a suicide and areconcealing the fact that they failed to follow proper police procedures byconsidering alternatives such as murder andor the possibility that Fosterdied somewhere else and his body was moved to Fort Marcy by an unidentifiedgroup of secret conspirators The argument begs certain questions such as Whowere these conspirators What possible motive would they have had Why depositFosters body in a public park At least the Mafia drops its victims inrivers And most curious of all how exactly could this dastardly crime havebeen carried off Consider There were at least a halfdozen people known tohave visited the park that afternoon It was broad daylight Foster was  feet inches tall and weighed  pounds To have transported the deputy WhiteHouse counsels lumpy dead body  yards from the parking lot to the cannonand have nobody notice would have been quite an achievement Wouldnt they haveat least waited until nightfall            Ruddy makes no stab at guessing who the criminals are Butas he plows his way through hundreds of pages of witness statements he thinkshe has discovered what they were wearing orange vests This is actually not ajoke Ruddy dwells ominously on the equivocal testimony of a Fairfax Countyrescue worker Todd Hall who initially told the police he thought he mighthave seen someone in an orange or red vest in the woods Hall later conceded itmay have been nothing more than a car or truck in the distance Still Ruddysmells a rat He speculates darkly that Halls possible sighting was evidenceof a suspicious group of orangevestclad bodymovers in the park that daymasquerading as Park Police volunteers            There isof course much more about Ruddys book that is equally absurdor simplywrong Like his fellow conspiracy nuts Ruddy argues that there was too littleblood in Fort Marcy for Foster to have been killed there In fact as Starrmakes clear when Fosters body was turned over three Park Police officersreported a pool of blood underneath his head and new wet blood pouring out ofhis nose The first independent counsel Robert Fiske is chastised for failingto identify supposedly mysterious white carpet fibers found on Fostersclothing Starr has The carpet fibers are the same as those found in Fostershome Ruddy and other critics have questioned where the caliber revolverfound in Fosters hand came from According to Starrs report Fosters widowsister and two of his children recall that Foster inherited a similar handgunfrom his late father in  and that he took it to Washington two years laterkeeping it in a bedroom closet When Lisa Foster ran upstairs to look for it onthe night of her husbands death the weapon was missing Are they alllying            In the days before his death Foster wasobsessing about the White House traveloffice affair and apparently fearedcontinued investigations would focus attention on Hillary Clintons role in thefirings That almost certainly helps to account for White House stonewallingover the documents left behind in his officean action that did much to fuelsuspicions about what secrets Foster might have known But that the man killedhimself is beyond dispute It would be comforting to think that Starrsreportreaching precisely the same conclusion as four previous governmentinvestigationswill finally end the matter Of course it wont On hiscontinually updated Web site the indomitable Ruddy charges on picking away atStarrs report and darkly suggesting that the Whitewater prosecutor with hisimpeccable Republican credentials has joined the coverup It must be headystuff taking on such giant conspiraciesand frightening too Can Ruddy be surethe men with orange vests wont soon be coming for him
