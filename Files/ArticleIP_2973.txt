                                 How the West Won            Titles can be dangerousJohn Lewis Gaddis the most eminent of Americas Cold Warhistorians has taken a risk by naming his book We Now Know  For thebig surprise of the opening of so many of the Soviet Chinese and EasternEuropean archives is that we have learned so little that seriously alters theknown contours of the year confrontation            True much has beenconfirmed by the ongoing opening of the archives and the sterling workof the special Cold War research project at the Woodrow Wilson Center inWashington DC on whose delvings Gaddis leans heavily To wit JosephStalins hopes that the Communist Party would come to power more or lesslegally in the western chunks of Germany can now be reliably dated back toJune  We can establish that but for Stalins veto in December  theSoviet Union might well have ratified the Bretton Woods postwar financialsystem Stalins role in egging on the North Koreans to invade the South in is now clear and so is the secret USSoviet accord that kept quiet theair battles between US and Soviet fighter pilots over Korea including theUS bombing of an air base on Soviet soil            None ofthis however changes the old consensus that the grand strategy of the ColdWar was set at the latest by  By then the NATO alliance was in place tocontain the Soviet Union on its western front The Korean War established asimilar containment on the eastern front where the Pentagon was buildingJapans ports railways and Toyota assembly lines and performing the samemiracle that Marshall Plan funds were achieving in Europe When the Westernnations fought they either lost Britain and France at Suez France inAlgeria France and later the United States in Vietnam or were held to abloody draw the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea But by avoidingdirect war and by learning to avoid entanglement in local struggles the Westeventually won the peace The West prevailed because nuclear weapons imposed abrittle truce shifting the conflict to the economic rivalry in which theWests greater resources and adaptability could produce both guns and butterboth family cars and aircraft carriers            It is within this generally agreedupon context that allthe historians Cold War debates take placeand Gaddis thoughtful but oftenlongwinded book broadly accepts this framework But here comes the surpriseIn the past Gaddis picked a careful course between the antiCommunists whoalways blamed Moscow and the revisionists who thought the United States hungerfor markets and raw materials was at least as responsible for the Cold War NowGaddis has finally taken sides On the politically if not historicallypivotal issue of who was to blame his conclusion is authoritarianism ingeneral and Stalin in particular            Havingidentified the Evil in particular Gaddis widens his argument to identify theEvil in general the Soviet system To prove his point he cites figuressuggesting that as many as  million German women had been raped by theconquering Red Army between  and  The point is worth making eventhough such awful spoils of war hardly address the moral argument of good andevil in the Cold War itself And even though it was widely known that many ofthese womens husbands and brothers in Wehrmacht uniform had fled to betaken prisoner by the Allies abandoning the women to pay for the dreadfulnessthe menfolk had inflicted on the eastern front            The moral superiority of the West has alwaysbeen difficult to argue Its advocates must grapple with the ugly facts ofracial segregation in the United States of the latters hardheaded ifspasmodic support of its allies futile efforts to cling to their colonialempires and of the Wests readiness to support loathsome regimes in the nameof the greater cause The US adventure in Vietnam that most tragic of theWests Third World campaigns falls outside Gaddis sadly truncated surveywhich ends with the Cuban missile crisis So Gaddis does not really tackle themost egregious moral disaster for the West            Nor werethe Wests leaders too nice in their discriminations Gaddis cites a  cablefrom Dean Acheson to his diplomats in Hanoi that bluntly states the case forRealpolitik  Question whether Ho Chi Minh as much nationalist asCommie is irrelevant all Stalinists in colonial areas are nationalists Withachievement of natl aims ie independence their objective necessarilybecomes subordination of state to Commie purposes Normally the mostclearheaded of cold warriors Acheson must have been dozing when he wrote thatOr at least he was conveniently forgetting that he had argued to supply million in civilian aid and  million in arms to Marshal Titos regime inYugoslavia which while nominally Communist had hardly been subordinated toCommie purposes Tito and Yugoslavia get disappointingly short shrift inGaddis analysis as does Stalins still mysterious decision to pull out of theSovietadministered sector of northern Iran These are areas where the SovietForeign Ministry and party archives have so far yielded little that isilluminating and the Soviet military and intelligence archives are stilltightly controlled where they have been opened at all Where Gaddis does lookat the breach between Tito and Stalin it is to buttress his case that asdemocrats the Americans were far more relaxed about managing alliance politicsthan Stalin was            Titos complaints about the SovietYugoslav relationshipGaddis points out were no more serious than those that arose routinelybetween London Paris and Washington over such questions as the treatment ofGermany But Tito and Stalin were not interested in keeping their disputes inhand Stalin wanted outright subservience Tito unique in having liberated hiscountry with his own partisan resources was far too prickly to knuckle underIn contrast Gaddis writes American officials saw nothing strange incombining executive leadership with a careful acknowledgment of individualsovereignties  Truman and Eisenhower handled NATO much as they did theCongress by cutting deals instead of imposing wills Gaddis claims inessence that this managerial style went beyond the difference between Westernallies and Soviet satellites even beyond the distinction between the UnitedStates soft empire of consenting partners and Stalins hard empire of secretpolice and satrapies In the end he says even the steeliest of US militaryauthoritarians were products of a more benign political heritage than theSovietsponsored regimes were The Truman and Eisenhower administrations ranthe alliance much as Gens Clay and MacArthur had run occupied Germany andJapan in ways that reflected democratic culture            The French and British governments would notunreservedly agree However foolish their  conspiracy with Israel torecapture the Suez Canal the US decision first to vote with the Soviets tocondemn them at the United Nations and then to apply what Gaddis callscrushing economic pressure on their currencies was hardly a collegial way torun the alliance France responded to this highhandedness by embarking on acrash program to develop its own nuclear force and by evicting NATO forcesfrom French soil And Gaddis concludes The Americans lost influence in theMiddle East as a result of Suez while the Russians gained it            If Gaddiswants to blame Stalin and authoritarian rule for the Cold War he must explainwhy the confrontation lingered on so long after the old brutes death in Gaddis answer of course is that the game was under way by then The heirs ofTruman and Stalin were condemned to play by Cold War rules But this undermineshis entire case about Stalins unique responsibility For Truman and Stalinbrought their own historic baggage to the task of creating a new world orderafter  They were locked into a Europe divided by military deployments anAsia in turmoil after Japans defeat and Maos triumph and a rivalry betweencapitalist and Communist systems that long predated both men            There is no doubt that Stalin was a brute We knew thatwhile the Cold War still raged It took a little more courage for a Westernhistorian to say that then than it does to say it now with the longconfrontation finally over But does Stalins guilt automatically establishUS innocence in other areas of the Cold War Obviously notit would be hardto fault Stalin for the destruction of the Vietnamese city of Hue  yearsafter his death However unsatisfactory and overargued the revisionist caseit did make one serious point that the United States had clear national andeconomic interests and found the Cold War an unusually congenial way to pursuethem            Perhaps the most acuteepitaph of the Cold War was written at its birth by Soviet Foreign MinisterVyacheslav Molotov who objected to US demands for an open door for itsindustrialists throughout Europe We would probably live to see the day whenin your own country on switching on the radio you would be hearing not somuch your own language as one American gramophone record after another  ongoing to the cinema you would be seeing American films sold for foreignconsumption Molotov argued Is it not clear that such unrestrictedapplications of the principles of equal opportunity would in practice meanthe veritable economic enslavement of the small states and their subjugation tothe rule and arbitrary will of strong and enriched foreign firms banks andindustrial corporations Was this what we fought for when we battled thefascist invaders            Yes Mr Molotov Given halfa chance Hollywood movies and British pop songs and Mercedes limos and all theglitzy glamour of rumbustious capitalism were exactly what people wanted TheWest prevailed because it was rich rather than because it was good It wouldbe nice to say that we were rich because we were good but the randomness ofthe market and the casual ethics of the hidden hand allow no such theocraticconclusion
