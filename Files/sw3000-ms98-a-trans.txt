              well lets see um i i like to go out to eat i really do but being from Dallas um i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every week month we have a really high turn over rate oh yeah and and this is i mean there are streets just called Restaurant Rows   oh really   uh you can get everything here from um a very spicy Indian meal to you know the favorite barbecue and and uh just anything your little heart desires around here so       here they have to entertain us to make us come back and i guess its all one big game because you you just never run out of places to go you really dont  yeah     uh thats good i never really thought about that but uh a good turn over would be sort of nice course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it would be sort of sad to see it go under   really and and we go to you know like an older part of town and we just notice how many oh well that restaurants changed and oh gee there theyve changed  and oh weve got to go try that one you know and its its really you have the pick of the you know the crop here   are they big into ambience ambience down there or is it more like uh Texas to me makes it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing   oh   yeah you know your your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff um you can get that too no theyve got everything here from the uh French Room which is ultra ultra to um um   yeah right uhhuh   Dean Ferrings uh uh restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek i mean weve got beautiful places to go you can get as dressed up or as you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out   umhum hum   so you know i guess uh some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the um um likes Chinese   uhhuh   and were always searching around for Chinese and now of course theyve added the Taiwanese and and um uh theres you know any any part of the country you want to hit they have got it i mean Vietnamese restaurant we went to you know last week its great its good stuff you know but its so its very very mixed and uh you know i think   um uhhuh   if you like food like we do i i dont know if that happened before or after we moved here but um  yeah you get a lot of uh great variety of things here   yes   so but if you were going to a restaurant say um where would you go   oh well we had uh we have a lot favorites here uh in Northern Virginia and of course weve got DC to call on you know and theres all sorts of things down there one thing about DC is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where you know its the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years you know and hes got a big clientele and um   oh okay   so there are there are some hangouts if you want to see people know its its sort of like Hollywood in a way because theres theres favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that   ah   um we dont hang around with them because usually its you know ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that   yeah right   so uh but uh my wife has a a friend that work runs one of the restaurants down there and weve been down there and had French cuisine and um i dont know i dont particularly care for that sort of thing just the the type of food just because i do like uh you know getting a meal   oh i see   and uh most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason i i dont know what they say about Chinese im always hungry after a French meal uh     thats true too   and uh but the the atmosphere is just wonderful you do feel like youve gone out you know and done something when you go to a French restaurant or a restaurant downtown well as out here you might   to another place yeah   have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied its not so much a an event you know out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant   yeah well   and theres theyre starting to get a little bit different um theyre theyre realizing that more of the the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs getting away from the city so there a couple of jazz houses that have jazz bands playing while youre eating and stuff like that which is kind of nice   oh there you go yeah oh were sort of in the middle of uh the extension of the Cajun country too so we have um a lot of ambience provided by you know the the bands and everything you know like you said jazz bands and things like that you know you go out and you   umhum   you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff you know i i really dont like that stuff but my husband does he loves to cook it so he and a friend of his get together and they cook i mean you know like for a bunch of people and   yeah right uhhuh   and uh its really in fact we do a lot more entertaining i think at home than we do going out so when we do go out we really you know want to be wowed by um the presentation so to speak   right   and uh you know but but there are little places um and like i said some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants just to and we do a lot of take out because everybodys so busy running around and its the fastest thing to do and   uhhuh yeah   so we sort of enjoy the you know both parts because   we have two uh two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to uh ones called Captain Pells   umhum   which is a crab house you know being so close to Maryland Maryland is you know a big place for crabs with the with the bay pretty much taking over most of Maryland   ah right yeah   and um Captain Pells is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside people just go in there and just       pig out and everything and then um the other place is called the Vienna Inn which is uh uh Vienna is a suburb of DC also in Virginia and uh that place is known for the the rudest waitresses in the country are are at the Vienna Inn and uh people go there to be abused i mean     just to be abused by the meanest waitress   you actually go in there to be abused by the by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff     oh thats a talent   and people come all over the country amazed at um the abuse they received       and then its on the honor system you pay totally on the honor system   um   and so you know you tell them what youve eaten and what you drank or whatever and they figure out the bill for you and youre lucky if you get change usually they they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks you know       because um   got to carry through with the abuse huh   they yeah carry on with the abuse they say you need needs mints here guy you dont get any change you know   oh gee well thats funny i we just went to an Italian restaurant this um just wonderful and they and its like being in it i mean ive never been to Italy okay but its just this big beautiful Italian restaurant very um low key in terms of the people are from California you know so they have their own adaptation of what Italian is i mean but its it was a wonderful wonderful experience know they have uh women there going to SMU going to uh Southern Methodist Univerisity and and graduating in opera or something like that and theyre all singing arias to you and   oh wow   and just walking around the restaurant singing and they make the food right there so its display cooking and and uh then they have wine casks all over the place so youre lined up waiting in line for this place and you just take a drink of wine and you know and they dont count that really they just
