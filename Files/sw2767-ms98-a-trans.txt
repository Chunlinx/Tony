        hi this is Judy im from Maryland and im in California visiting right now   hi Judy this is Norma and i live in Virginia     oh okay   we got a great topic   i know im sitting here going oh dear  should we give it a try   i guess we might as well   okay     okay   okay   well um so so so what changes have you seen   let you start   what changes uh i guess the biggest i dont know your age Judy but i in my lifetime the biggest is in       more women working definitely   well actually thats what i was thinking too   yeah   and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future   for the future right yeah   because i dont see that really yet in positions of power really   right i dont see them in positions in power in corporations either  not many   ah thats true thats true um do you work in private corporation or government   i did work in government   ah   and before that i worked in a bank for eight years   umhum umhum   and now im retired   oh are you  thats the best status  yes um i dont i see um in   thats right which do you work in excuse me   a government   in government   and i work in academia before   uhhuh   and um actually theres one um woman in our i dont know what youd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense perhaps um a lot of she gets protected a lot because uh its almost like a token   oh   and and its sort of unfortunate because i think that they dont accept her technically and but shes a good paper pusher   uhhuh   and its in a technical position really and you know she should be more technical for what she does   uhhuh   and i think thats sort of unfortunate because it doesnt it doesnt really help the cause in the long run   right       um but um you know i dont know and and teaching i still see that thats where most of the women are   in teaching   in teaching and you know and its always been that way   but not at the college level   right not well   we live in a college town and i worked at the university for a while and there are there are woman there but theyre not the high paid   uhhuh umhum not department chairmen   professors that the men are   yeah not the deans and things like that     well they did have one woman dean but and i guess she she probably did very well but thats the minority   umhum umhum hum and do you think its because women arent qualified or or just dont or dont want the job or just arent hired for the jobs   none of the above  i think they are extremely well qualified     uhhuh   uh i dont know how   theyre just not selected somehow   i think theyre not selected   umhum   and course at this university uh this its a big engineering school   umhum   and i dont think there are many women in the engineering college   uhhuh   and thats where the high pay is   oh okay but im wondering how many women actually major in engineering actually but you know i say that but yet i know two   quite an well i think there are more than there used to be   yeah im sure there are yeah   but they may not go into teaching   umhum yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but um   uhhuh   its it  i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored majored in engineering i dont know why i but i dont know that many men that have majored in engineering either     uhhuh   i mean its just because im in the humanities its just   oh uhhuh   you know its not not something that i tend to hear about   yeah uhhuh   but um yeah its uh   well i met one one day that uh had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering and that really surprised me   oh thats interesting     uhhuh   yeah yeah i mean i i suppose that that its difficult to really say why because you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified   uhhuh   and maybe there arent you know maybe they dont apply for the job   i dont know i dont i dont know how many go on and get a PhD in engineering   right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway   that could be thats true   so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified   uhhuh thats right   its a its a rough       its a rough a rough situation um and i guess what i what amazes amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works parttime a six hour day so that he can take the kids   oh   kids or kid im not sure to school in the morning and be home   thats interesting   when the children or child comes home in the afternoon     is it uh was she the major wage earner i mean did she earn more money that he did or do you know   th is is uh well see i dont know anything about the family but but yeah i would imagine she might um because hes you you know hes a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and hes now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job   oh uhhuh   so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but still but still its interesting that you know he hes been doing this evidently for a a good number of years   uhhuh     and but its unusual   i i know one uh gal thats shes a CPA and her husband is a house husband   uhhuh yeah i   and then they had a child and he he still was the house husband hes the one that was going to   oh he was even before they had children   uhhuh even before that right   oh now that that really is   she was a little perturbed about it at one time i dont know how shes moved away i dont know how it is now but i know uh   oh she was uhhuh   were we all went out one evening and after work and uh she was there was an underlying note that she was perturbed about it   uhhuh yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if theres no reason for   uhhuh   somebody to stay home that   i dont think there was a valid reason  because her statement was   yeah thats true   i told him lets face it youre a house husband thats what your going thats what youll always be           but but yet you know we have to think about that because if if she had opted to stay home we wouldnt have thought anything strange   she wouldnt have been thats right uhhuh thats right it would   so so were carrying our own prejudice   it wouldnt have been a downer uhhuh thats true   yeah oh gee  i guess we cant win     huhuh   oh   because yeah if if somebody does it and breaks tradition youre surprised but   thats right   oh dear so so   i think maybe more men would like to be if they  werent put down so badly   if they could get away with it oh dear you know well i mean it its an interesting topic yet i must say its not one that ive given a great deal of of thought to but um   huhuh   no i dont   in the past its um one of those things that you know seems to happen   how do you feel your career has gone   i dont i dont feel for the most part that ive been discriminated against   you dont thats good   no i was a department chairman i dont but i dont like administration   oh   so then im uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose   uhhuh uhhuh i was discriminated against very definitely in banking   uhhuh   it was terrible   oh really       you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be   right and the money didnt go with the positions   yeah yeah well i would   the promotion promotions came but there were there wasnt comparable pay for the responsibility and i was told you dont need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children or your husband has a good job and   uh oh jeez       yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of and and thats true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments   i think uhhuh   for you know even   i think we are programmed to just take it as it comes   right right thats probably true i hadnt i hadnt thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didnt like it when when i had to do it   uhhuh uhhuh     so i i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody  but i know some people thrive on it       oh gee well since i dont have a whole lot more to say on the topic   i dont
