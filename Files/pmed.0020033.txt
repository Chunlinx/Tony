                            Despite the significant progress in increasing our understanding of the immune        mechanisms of multiple sclerosis MS in improving clinical classification and brain        imaging and in developing new treatments the factors that determine the course of the        disease are mostly unknown  Currently it is nearly impossible to predict the course of        MS its severity in terms of disability progression or when a relapse will happen        The most commonly used diseasemodifying therapies are interferon  IFN  and        glatiramer acetate  Despite initial excitement these therapies have beneficial        effects in some but not all patients  Because of the potential favorable effects of        these therapies it has been suggested that they should be initiated as early as possible        to maximize neuroprotection  Additionally it has been recommended that patients should        be monitored closely to determine whether and when it is necessary to modify treatment in        order to maximize the benefit  The recommended monitoring is based on annual rate of        relapses neurological deterioration and evidence of disease activity on brain magnetic        resonance imaging scans However given the destructive nature of the disease if we rely        solely on clinical or radiological manifestations such as a relapse or a new lesion on a        scan to determine a patients response to therapy we will probably be responding too        late                    Gene Expression Patterns in Affected Organs        The diagnosis and management of disease could be transformed thanks to the completion of        the human genome project the availability of sequence information for nearly every gene        and the advent of novel high throughput technologies microarrayssee Glossary that allow        parallel profiling of thousands of genes By definition nearly every aspect of a disease        phenotype should be represented in gene expression signatures of multiple genes in the        affected organ Indeed studies that analyze affected tissues mostly in cancer clearly        show that it is possible to predict prognosis to identify new classes of diseases and        potentially to determine response to therapy         In diseases that do not require tissue resection for diagnosis or therapy it is rare to        obtain tissues for analysis This problem is even more pronounced in diseases like MS in        which the target organ is the very inaccessible brain and spinal cord Despite these        limitations several groups used microarrays to analyze brain tissues obtained posthumously        from patients who had MS and identified genes that characterized either acute or chronic        lesions  However although these studies identified some potential genes that may        be involved in the local pathogenesis of the disease they did not produce any information        that could be used for identifying biomarkers associated with disease activity                    Diagnostic Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression Signatures        In MS looking for markers of disease activity in the much more accessible peripheral        blood does not require a significant leap of faith MS is an autoimmune disease and it is        possible that some of the cells involved in the pathogenesis of the disease will be found        in the bloodstream Abnormal T cell populations have repeatedly been observed in the        peripheral blood of patients with MS  While these results supported looking at        the easily accessible peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs for potential markers that        reflect the disease some doubts persisted These revolved around two very strong        arguments The first argument was that if the signal comes from a minority of the cells        within the bloodstream it will be too low to be detected The second was that interpersonal        variability added to the inherent noisy nature of gene expression data will make the data        impossible to reproduce        Fortunately recent observations suggest that these doubts are unfounded Bomprezzi et        al  determined that gene expression patterns can distinguish patients with MS from        controls and suggested that at least some of the differences identified were derived from        activated T cells Achiron et al  analyzed the expression of  genes in patients        with relapsingremitting MS Gene expression patterns clearly distinguished patients with        MS from controls as well as relapse from remission Mandel et al  compared patients        with systemic lupus erythematosus and MS and identified a common autoimmunity signature as        well as diseasespecific gene expression signatures Interestingly similar findings were        recently described for pulmonary arterial hypertension                     Could PBMC Gene Expression Signatures Be Used for Predicting Response to        Therapy        WeinstockGuttman et al  analyzed the acute transcriptional response of  genes        in peripheral blood lymphocytes to IFN They identified increases in known        interferoninducible genes and in genes involved in antiviral activity and interferon        signaling Using complementary DNA cDNA arrays Sturzebecher et al  identified gene        expression signatures that distinguished IFN responders from nonresponders        And now in a new study published in last months         PLoS Biology  Baranzini et al  provide compelling evidence that        these PBMC gene expression signatures can be used to predict response to therapy Figure         They studied the expression of  genes selected for their presumed biological function        in  patients with MS followed up for at least two years after initiation of IFN        therapy Instead of using microarrays that carry probes for thousands of genes they chose        to use realtime PCR This method is highly sensitive specific and reproducible across        different laboratories It is often used to verify microarray findings Baranzini et al        identified MX interferoninducible protein p a known interferoninducible gene as        the marker of treatment with IFN They did not find overall differences between responders        and nonresponders but they did using supervised classification methods identify triplets        of genes that distinguish IFN responders and nonresponders        Interestingly individual and pairs of genes did not perform that well and all three        genes in a triplet were required for the highest accuracy about  The minimal        combinatorial number of genes that contains the most predictive information is not        available since combinations of more than three genes were not performed Although the        results were not tested on an independent dataset as is frequently requested  the        authors applied an array of crossvalidation strategies that convincingly suggested that        the identified predictive signal was robust                    Implications of the Study        What could Baranzini and colleagues findings mean Clearly the most obvious conclusion        is that the lack of response did not result from the deactivation of IFN The effect of        IFN on MX IFNAr and STAT was observed for two years in all patients suggesting that        the response did not depend on IFN bioavailability Considering that PBMCs represent an        admixture of multiple cell types the most plausible explanation is a simple lack of shift        in subcellular populations        However the importance of Baranzini and colleagues study lies not in its mechanistic        insights but in its clinical relevance The careful design of the experiment the use of        reproducible realtime PCR instead of microarrays the meticulous analysis and the        previous observations  support the notion that PBMCs express clinically        relevant gene expression signatures in MS and probably in other organconfined diseases To        further prove this notion will require a significant investment in large studies that        prospectively test the utility of these signatures in guiding the management of MS Only        when direct evidence shows that therapy guided by markers expressed in PBMCs improves        patient outcome will PBMC gene expression patterns take their place as biomarkers at the        center stage of monitoring MS progression and response to therapy
