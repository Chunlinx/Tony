                    Background        Autoimmunity is a wellestablished mechanism of        premature ovarian failure        It has been        suggested that the presence of ovarian antibodies may be        helpful in the diagnosis of ovarian autoimmunity             However presently there is no validated serum marker that        can establish a diagnosis of autoimmune premature ovarian        failure with certainty     Young women can experience        ovarian failure by several mechanisms other than        autoimmunity     A false positive diagnostic test        indicating autoimmunity as the mechanism of spontaneous        premature ovarian failure could put young women at risk for        inappropriate therapy Such therapy could have serious        consequences such as the development of osteonecrosis                  Some women with premature ovarian failure have ovarian        follicles that function intermittently      and        pregnancies have occurred after the diagnosis of premature        ovarian failure        Clinicians are in need of        an accurate method for the diagnosis of autoimmune        oophoritis a test with proven sensitivity and specificity            Here we conduct an investigation to determine        whether a commercially available ovarian antibody test        Immunodiagnostic Laboratories Inc San Leandro CA        might be useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune premature        ovarian failure We performed the test in women with        premature ovarian failure women with normal ovarian        function and in men We found that this commercially        available test has a high incidence of false positives        Therefore this test would not be expected to be useful in        the diagnosis of autoimmune premature ovarian failure                    Methods                  Patients and Controls          By local advertisement we recruited  control women          with regular menstrual cycles matched for age and parity          to our patients and  control men matched for age          The controls were also matched to patients for race We          recruited patients with spontaneous premature ovarian          failure by letters to physicians and notices in medical          journals The National Institute of Child Health and          Human Development Institutional Review Board approved the          protocol We diagnosed premature ovarian failure in women          who before the age of  had experienced amenorrhea in          association with serum FSH levels greater than  mIUmL          confirmed on two separate occasions at least one month          apart Twentysix patients with premature ovarian          failure participated in this study median age of           years range  years The women had been diagnosed          at a median age of  years range  years The          median time since diagnosis was  years range           years All patients had a normal karyotype and had no          history of chemotherapy or radiation Six patients           had hypothyroidism one patient had Addison disease and          one patient had Raynaud syndrome                          Ovarian Antibodies          We sent blinded specimens to Immunodiagnostic          Laboratories Inc San Leandro CA to be tested for          ovarian antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence          test system supplied by Scimedx Inc Denville NJ The          kit includes frozen sections of cynomologous monkey ovary          as tissue substrate a positive control of human serum          known to contain antibodies against the zona pellucida a          negative control serum and fluorescein isothiocyanate          FITC conjugated goat antibodies against human          immunoglobulins including IgG IgM and IgA Binding of          antibody to the zona pellucida at a  dilution was          reported by the laboratory on a scale of  to           according to the intensity of fluorescence  negative

samples of patients and controls were stored at          C After thawing at room temperature serum samples          were diluted  with PBS We confirmed the adequacy of          monkey ovary sections from individual lots in an          unblinded manner before using them For each experiment          slides of monkey ovary with the same lot number were          allowed to equilibrate to room temperature Twenty          microliters of blinded sample were applied to the tissue          substrate slides A slide containing positive and          negative controls was run unblinded with each experiment          Slides were placed into a moist covered chamber and          incubated for  minutes at room temperature Next the          slides were washed in PBS for three minute soaks          After blotting the slides  uL of FITCconjugated goat          antibodies against human immunoglobulins was delivered to          each sample and slides were again incubated in the moist          chamber for  minutes The washings and blotting were          repeated as above Mounting medium and a coverslip were          applied The slides were kept in a dark moist chamber          until evaluated using a Zeiss Axiophot Fluorescent          Microscope Carl Zeiss Inc Thornwood NY at           magnification with emission at  nM and excitation at           nM We graded fluorescence of the zona pellucida          on the same  to  scale as noted above                          Reproducibility          To evaluate the reproducibility of the test we          selected four patient samples previously determined by          this technique to be    and  for zona pellucida          antibodies In a blinded manner we tested each sample           times  tests each on three separate

San          Juan Capistano CA                          Statistics          We used the Fischer exact test chisquare and the          Spearman rank correlation test as appropriate We used          onetailed tests to look for an increase in autoantibody          as compared to controls and we set           P   as significant          Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Stat

of  women            with spontaneous premature ovarian failure  had            ovarian antibodies as detected by the commercial            laboratory Table  The frequencies were not

own laboratory we obtained similar            results Twelve of  patients  with premature            ovarian failure had ovarian antibodies versus  of             control women               P

results          correlated with the known graded samples r             P   the  readings were          reproduced in only  of the  tests  and the           readings were reproduced in only  of the  tests           Table  In contrast the  and  readings were          reproduced in   and   of the  respective          tests Table                           Efforts to improve the test          Because the  and  readings had poor          reproducibility we were concerned that this inaccuracy          might have impaired our ability to detect a difference          between patients and control women We therefore          redefined the outcome measure to be read simply as          positive  or negative  Positive was defined as the          presence of homogeneous fluorescence on the zona          pellucida above background and negative was defined as          any fluorescence less than this Tests were then repeated          using serum from the  patients and  control women We          were unable to demonstrate a significant difference using          the revised outcome measure Patient serum was positive          in  of  samples  and control serum was positive          in  of  samples  Table  When we tested the          sera on three separate occasions with this method we          found  patient sera  and  control sera  to be          consistently positive for zona pellucida

antibodies at  The positive control sample was          positive at  and negative at                           Specificity          To evaluate the specificity of the test we compared          sera from  normal women with sera from  normal men          matched for age The tests were performed at           dilution using the positive and negative outcome measure          as discussed above Women were significantly more likely          to have ovarian antibodies than men Eleven of  normal          women  had ovarian antibodies whereas none of the           normal men had these antibodies            P   These findings were          confirmed in a separate experiment  versus            P                            Other Autoantibodies          Results of other antibody tests are shown in Table           Women with spontaneous premature ovarian failure were          significantly more likely than control women to have          parietal cell antibodies            P   Fischers exact test          and thyroid peroxidase antibodies            P   Fischers exact          test                            Discussion        There is evidence to suggest that some patients with        spontaneous premature ovarian may have clinically        significant circulating ovarian antibodies In a seminal        study reported in  Coulam and Ryan demonstrated that        patients with premature ovarian failure as a group have        ovarian antibodies present in their sera as determined by        immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled human ovarian proteins            However the identity of these specific ovarian        antigens remains unknown It should pointed out however        that immunoblotting studies have failed to reveal a        consistent pattern of binding using the sera of patients        with premature ovarian failure            Presently there is no proven sensitive and specific        serum test to confirm that a woman has ovarian failure on        an autoimmune basis     Histologic evaluation of the        ovary is the only way to diagnose autoimmune oophoritis        with certainty     Nonetheless some clinicians        currently use commercial ovarian antibody tests for the        diagnosis of autoimmune premature ovarian failure and make        treatment recommendations based on these findings This        approach can have severe adverse consequences such as the        development of osteonecrosis related to glucocorticoid        therapy     Here we demonstrate that detection of        ovarian antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence using one        specific commercial test system has poor specificity as a        diagnostic test The test is positive in nearly onethird        of normal women Therefore the test is not a useful        diagnostic marker of autoimmune premature ovarian        failure        We found that women with premature ovarian failure are        significantly more likely to have positive thyroid        peroxidase and parietal cell autoantibodies than women with        normal ovarian function In this regard our findings are in        agreement with previous studies       In contrast        to one previous study however     we did not find a        significantly higher prevalence of antinuclear antibodies        in women with premature ovarian failure        Because little is known about the pathophysiology of        human autoimmune oophoritis experimental animal models        have been used to gain insight into possible mechanisms             The fact that we found an increased frequency of        thyroid and gastric parietal cell antibodies in our        patients suggests similarity to a model of autoimmune        ovarian failure that can be induced in certain strains of        mice by performing neonatal thymectomy These mice also        develop autoimmunity against thyroid and gastric parietal        cells     It is well established that these mice with        ovarian autoimmunity also develop circulating        autoantibodies against the oocyte cytoplasm the zona        pellucida and against steroid producing cells            While we found evidence that one half of our patients had        specific antibodies directed against the zona pellucida we        did not find any consistent pattern of immunofluorescence        to suggest that our patients had antibodies directed        against the oocyte cytoplasm or the steroid producing cells        of the ovary It is noteworthy that immune serum from mice        with ovarian autoimmunity reacts specifically with an        oocytespecific protein called MATER      We have        subsequently identified the homologous human         MATER gene and protein    In        ongoing work we are evaluating the value of MATER        antibodies as a marker for autoimmune ovarian failure in        women        The fact that we did not detect ovarian antibodies        binding to the zona pellucida in any of  men p          is intriguing This finding supports proposals that        preB cells undergo positive selection directed by the        presence of surface heavy chains with low albeit sufficient        affinity to the autoantigen It appears then that men        lacking the specific ovarian selfantigen fail to provide        positive selection for these preB cells clones Also this        finding suggests that the detection system is specific for        zona pellucida and that further refinement of the assay        system by using pure human recombinant zona pellucida        protein might be useful Sacco and Moghissi detected zona        pellucida antibodies in both men and women by indirect        immunofluorescence but they used porcine rather than        primate zonae pellicidae     Normal animal and human        serum are known to contain a wide range of lowtiter        autoantibodies that have been termed natural        autoantibodies     Even B cells from newborn mice and        human cord blood produce these natural autoantibodies              The low titer ovarian antibodies that we        demonstrate here in the serum of normal women are likely        natural autoantibodies and not antibodies with any        pathophysiologic significance        Identifying women with autoimmune premature ovarian        failure presents the opportunity to restore ovarian        function by proper immune modulation therapy However at        present we dont really know how many women with premature        ovarian failure develop it due to autoimmunity Currently        ovarian biopsy is the only way to diagnose autoimmune        premature ovarian failure with certainty However because        there is no treatment proven safe and effective to restore        fertility in our view ovarian biopsy is not indicated        outside a controlled trial                        Conclusions        We found that approximately onethird of women with        normal ovarian function have ovarian autoantibodies        detected by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey ovary        as substrate Hence this ovarian antibody test as        presently performed has poor specificity and therefore        appears to have no benefit in the evaluation and management        of autoimmune premature ovarian failure The specificity of        any ovarian antibody test should be established before it        is used clinically                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        JAN and ZBT participated in the
