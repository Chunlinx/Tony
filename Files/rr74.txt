                    Introduction        NO which may be synthesized by any of the three        isoforms of NOS is a vasodilator of the pulmonary        circulation in many mammals NO has been proposed as a        modulator of vascular tone and structure in the pulmonary        circulation and previous studies using NOS inhibitors           suggested that inhibition of NO increases acute hypoxic        pulmonary vasoconstriction Chronic NOS inhibition did not        lead to development of pulmonary hypertension          however possibly because of a decrease in cardiac output        These discrepancies have been addressed in recent studies        using mice that are deficient in NOS isoforms        Three isoforms of NOS are found in the lung The        principle isoform that is found in the pulmonary        vasculature is eNOS   iNOS is expressed in airway        epithelium and airway and vascular smooth muscle           whereas nNOS is expressed in the bronchial epithelium and        lung nervous tissue      Thus all three NOS        isoforms could contribute to modulation of pulmonary        vascular tone Studies using knockout mice for each of        these isoforms      suggest that eNOSderived        NO is important in modulating basal pulmonary vascular        tone as well as in attenuating the development of        pulmonary hypertension        Severe sustained hypoxia causes pulmonary hypertension        in many animals Upregulation of all three NOS isoforms        following severe hypoxia has been reported in rats              Less is certain about the expression of NOS in        the murine lung following hypoxia with previous reports           suggesting an increase in lung eNOS and iNOS        levels We therefore hypothesized that NOS isoforms are        upregulated following hypoxia and that this may account for        the increased susceptibility to hypoxic pulmonary        hypertension in mice that lack eNOS    In the        present study we exposed wildtype mice to severe hypobaric        hypoxia from birth and measured NOS mRNA and protein        levels We then compared the findings with localization of        NOS protein in the lung as assessed using        immunohistochemistry                    Materials and methods                  Mice          We studied Fgeneration SV Taconic Germantown          NY USA and CBL Jackson

pulmonary hypertension          RVsP was measured as an index of pulmonary arterial          pressure As shown in Fig  RVsP was elevated in          animals that were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia as          compared with those that were exposed to sea level and          ambient conditions Hypoxic animals were also more          polycythemic than were normoxic animals    in          hypoxic animals versus    and    for animal          subjected to sea level and ambient conditions          respectively           P                            Western blotting          As shown in Fig  lung eNOS protein levels were          increased following hypoxia with a trend toward          increased eNOS in ambient versus sea level conditions          However iNOS protein was below the limit of

     fold following hypoxia as compared with normoxic          conditions whereas iNOS expression was increased          fold Fig                           Immunohistochemistry          Localization of NOS in mouse lung was determined using          antibodies specific for eNOS iNOS and nNOS Fig           eNOS levels were increased following hypoxia and the          staining was more intense in large vessels and extended          out to the periphery of the lung and was also found in          smaller vessels In contrast iNOS and nNOS were limited          primarily to the airway epithelium and their levels did          not increase following exposure to hypoxia This was          confirmed using quantitative image analysis data not          shown                          Nitric oxide metabolites          To determine whether the increase in NOS in the          pulmonary circulation following hypoxia resulted in          increased NO we measured plasma NO metabolites Fig           There was a modest increase in levels of NO metabolites          in animals exposed to hypoxia as compared with sea level          or ambient conditions                            Discussion        The major finding of this work was the upregulation of        lung expression of eNOS and possibly iNOS in mice with        severe hypoxiainduced pulmonary hypertension The        increased eNOS was correlated with increased        immunolocalization to the periphery of the lung This        however was not observed for iNOS or nNOS Additionally        we found increased severity of pulmonary hypertension in        animals exposed to hypoxia during postnatal        development        The pulmonary hypertension in mice exposed to hypoxia        from birth was more severe than we had observed in previous        studies of  weeks of hypoxia in mature animals   The        degree of polycythemia was also greater in these animals        than in previous reports and might have contributed to the        increase in pulmonary pressure due to increased viscosity          This suggests that either the duration of hypoxic        exposure or exposure from neonatal life provided additional        physiologic stress that was not seen in more mature animals          No animals died however suggesting that the stress        was not sufficiently severe to decrease survival during the        study period This observation of increased susceptibility        to hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in younger developing        animals is in agreement with previous reports                  The increase in eNOS protein and mRNA levels and the        peripheral immunolocalization is in accord with previous        reports     LeCras         et al    found that the amount        of eNOS protein was increased in hypoxic hypertensive rat        lungs and that this was not entirely due to the presence        of hypertension and increased shear stress but was also        due to hypoxia This is further supported by Tyler         et al   who found that eNOS        protein levels were increased in rats with hypoxic        pulmonary hypertension but not in those with        chemicalinduced monocrotaline or genetic fawnhooded        rat pulmonary hypertension   As in the present study        increased eNOS levels correlated with         de novo expression in the small        resistance vessels in the lung    The mechanism by        which hypoxia increases eNOS expression is poorly        understood because a hypoxia responsive element has not yet        been identified in the eNOS promoter Recently altering        the redox state of pulmonary artery endothelial cells in        culture suggested that activation of redoxsensitive        transcription factor activator protein during hypoxia may        be responsible for the increase in eNOS expression          Despite the increase in eNOS however the mice developed        severe pulmonary hypertension this suggests either that NO        production was not increased see below or that NO was        consumed Under more physiologically relevant levels of        hypoxia the central role of eNOS in protecting against        hypertension is supported by our observation that loss of        eNOS leads to increased acute hypoxic vasoconstriction and        development of pulmonary hypertension             In contrast to the observations with eNOS iNOS message        was increased but iNOS protein remained below the limit of        detection in the lungs of hypoxic hypertensive mice        Previously LeCras         et al   reported an increase in        both iNOS mRNA and protein levels in rat lungs following        hypoxia In the present study however the increase in        iNOS mRNA levels was not associated with detectable iNOS        protein using several different antibodies in mice This        is in contrast to the study of Quinlan         et al   in which increased lung        iNOS protein levels in adult mice following hypoxia was        reported This discrepancy may be due to differences        between the present study and that report Specifically        animals in our experiments are a different strain and were        housed in sealed hypobaric chambers as opposed to being        flushed with  O          gas The hypobaric chambers used in        the present study have a higher rate of air exchange than        other hypoxic gas chambers thus limiting the buildup of        waste products including ammonia that may contribute to        lung inflammation and induction of iNOS as the combination        of hypoxia and inflammation has previously been reported to        increase iNOS expression   Thus the increased iNOS        reported previously may be due to the combination of        hypoxia and inflammation   Others have also reported        that lung iNOS protein was detectable only after        lipopolysaccharide administration          The iNOS promoter contains a hypoxia responsive element        and the increase in iNOS transcription in hypoxia may be        due to the transcription factor hypoxiainducible factor            Additionally recent studies also suggest        that alterations in redox state during hypoxia may also        increase iNOS expression similar to eNOS by activation of        redox sensitive nuclear factorB or activator protein           It is not known whether hypoxia interferes with        translation or degradation of iNOS protein In support of        our current finding however immunohistochemical        localization of iNOS to the airway did not change following        hypoxia We have recently reported that mice deficient in        iNOS do not have increased pulmonary vasoreactivity        suggesting that lungderived iNOS is not an important        modulator of acute pulmonary vascular reactivity          Mice deficient in iNOS do have a slight increase in right        ventricular pressure however suggesting that iNOS        especially in the upper airway may contribute to        modulation of chronic pulmonary vascular tone   Thus        the importance of iNOS in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension        remains uncertain        In rat lungs nNOS expression was increased following        hypoxia   but we did not find an increase in lung nNOS        in mice following hypoxia Increased nNOS has been        suggested as a compensatory vasodilator in the cerebral and        coronary circulation of eNOSdeficient mice but its role        in the pulmonary circulation is unknown    However        we previously demonstrated   that nNOS does not appear        to play a role in modulating tone in the pulmonary        circulation        Although we did not look at the expression of NOS in        other rat vascular beds following hypoxia other reports        suggest that the increase in NOS following hypoxia may be        species and tissue specific Previous studies of NOS        expression in systemic and pulmonary endothelial cells from        different species in cultures                have yielded conflicting results Recently Toporsian         et al   reported         in vivo downregulation of eNOS mRNA        and protein levels in the aorta of rats following prolonged        hypoxia which correlated with impaired        endotheliumdependent vasorelaxation whereas there was an        increase in eNOS protein levels in the lungs Conversely        eNOS levels were increased in hypoxic uterine but not        femoral or renal arteries of pregnant sheep          Whether increased NOS expression leads to increased        production of NO         in vivo is controversial   In        piglets         in vivo  acute hypoxia caused        decreased exhaled NO and decreased aortic and pulmonary        arterial plasma nitrite levels   Following chronic        hypoxia in rats Sato         et al   found that plasma NO        metabolite levels were markedly increased compared with        normoxic controls when animals were exposed to  O           but were not increased when rats        were breathing  O           This suggests that hypoxia inhibited        NO production despite the increase in NOS expression There        are several proposed mechanisms for the discordance between        NO production and increased NOS expression         in vitro and         in vivo  including impaired arginine        uptake   decreased heat shock protein levels          and decreased O          tension    In agreement with        previous studies the plasma NO metabolite content in the        present study was minimally elevated in the hypoxic group        Although we attempted to keep the mice continuously        hypoxic a relatively brief period of reoxygenation might        account for the slight increase in plasma NO metabolites        seen in the hypoxic animals which is consistent with the        observations of Sato         et al   Because the systemic        and pulmonary vasculatures can both contribute to plasma NO        metabolite levels if NOS was downregulated in the systemic        circulation as suggested by Toporsian         et al   then the lack of        increased NO metabolites could also be due to decreased NOS        activity in the systemic circulation However those        investigators did not observe any difference in plasma NO        metabolites in normoxic versus hypoxic rats in which aortic        NOS was downregulated but did observe a decrease in        acetylcholinestimulated NO release from aortic rings The        pattern of NOS expression in vascular beds other than the        lung following hypoxia in mice is presently unknown                    Conclusion        In summary we identified a unique pattern of NOS        upregulation in the murine lung with severe hypoxiainduced        pulmonary hypertension which may be important when        considering studies using NOSdeficient mice The present        study also suggests that exposure of neonatal mice to        hypoxia may lead to more severe pulmonary hypertension than        that observed in mature mice exposed to hypoxia and this        warrants further
