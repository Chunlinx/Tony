        okay what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy everyday     um hm well i dont like it when um people listen to my phone conversations like if theyre outside my door while im talking in my room       or when people like look through my things in my bedroom   yeah thats right that is really an invasion of privacy   yeah   i find i find it very annoying when ive worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly with solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and does that happen in your part of the country   umhum yes umhum definitely   i uh i come home and im trying to get a few things done and i cant do anything but answer the telephone   right   some evenings are worse than others but i wish i could put a stop to it but i dont know what to do to stop it   right even uh we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting and theyd still come to our door and knock and   umhum theyll think it didnt mean them i guess everybody but me  oh goodness   i guess not no yeah   are you still do you live at home with your parents   yes umhum   umhum  so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family   yeah yeah mostly yeah   now what can you do to stop that   oh i dont know well  im used to it now but  sometimes it still gets gets to me but theres not much i can really do no     no just have to live with it i guess try to remember to respect their privacy and maybe theyll respect yours and   you know it well i dont know  i always um no yes i do but they dont live at home   do you have brothers oh okay i was raised i had two younger brothers and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations and   oh i used to do that though because i was the youngest id pick up the phone and listen to theirs  but i   i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldnt hear me and then theyd go get on the other extension and i could hear them but i couldnt get them to hang up you know     oh i yeah  but i stopped doing that a long time ago and they still do it to me     even it in the office i uh find that people walk up and and when youre on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy theyll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up   oh like say yeah this lady does that to me at work when im taking an order or something and shell just sit there and listen and  like im doing something wrong and she just started and shes nice but   uhhuh   okay but you know it gets annoying when they stand right over you and watching everything you do   um yeah   but im   lets see i cant think of anything else id really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors about the only thing that really bothers me i dont have that many people coming to my door   no right well occasionally well have a person here or there but not not as many as the phone calls you know so   uhhuh and i guess thats really the the thing that really bugs me the most i cant think   but   that her kids in our neighborhood used to bother me but they have all gotten grown up now and we live in a neighborhood where theres not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up but   uh   yeah   what else would be an annoyance well i guess traffic could be an annoyance   oh yeah especially when youre in a hurry   do you have a lot of traffic in your area   um it can get busy yeah usually on the weekends its the most bit but   umhum some days its real real bad here and you would like to feel like its an invasion of privacy because you cant even ride down the road without people all the way around you you know but   yeah umhum yeah ive traveled quite a bit and ive been through Dallas Texas its pretty busy   it really is and pretty noisy   yeah   it really is   yeah   i live right on a main thoroughfare so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy because it at first youd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed   umhum oh yeah   and every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road id wake up but i guess ive gotten used to it because i dont even hear it anymore   oh yeah i suppose you do   and uh i just close it out i guess because i dont i dont remember waking up in several years at night when id hear a fire truck go by you know   umhum yeah   i think theyd probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me   yeah im am a real sound sleeper though  so that probably wouldnt bother me id sleep right through it   theyd have to chop down the door and get you out i guess   yeah it takes a lot   lets see what else is an invasion   i had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time  i was mad because those are mine you know theyre not   ooh well did you have has name all over them   no it was a a letter from a girlfriend of mine and i i just i was upset because those are mine and you know i thought he     that was yours yeah   right i thought hed respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me so that was upsetting i was mad about that my privacy there   yeah yeah
