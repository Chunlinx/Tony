        well i dont know what to do about the federal budget um there certainly been ideas surfaced uh recently um matter of fact repeatedly by many people and i sort of wonder what your what thoughts you had on that area     what the uh the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when when were talking in trillions of dollars   umhum   uh  which is an astronomical sum and and the people that are talking these numbers  have no concept of what that number means um   now are you are you talking about the elected people or are you talking about others umhum   the elected people yes umhum our our our Senate and Congress and and people that that deal everyday and and whats going to be done with those monies   yes   um and dont really understand what that is or how a budget even works   umhum   uh we need to elect people that are more uh  or   im not sure how you would achieve how would you achieve that i mean if   well  lets lets make them have a degree in economy uh or economics   uh so you would trust the decision making  economists   you you well   sometimes called the dismal science   yeah but but people people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar   uhhuh yes   um  when in in in the the uh lobbyists needs to be eliminated   umhum umhum   uh from Congress um   yes   they dont make pragmatic decisions they make a decision based on constituency constituency   yes   instead of a decision based on what they really believe   umhum   um you know the the  or or they tack on these uh pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country   right so so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists i mean right now lobbyists require to register youd just say   oh i definitely i definitely would yeah get rid of them   love that make them all no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for   totally uh i i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that   umhum   and be registered with what they ever contribute contribute but they should not have a oneonone relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them   umhum   that thats a conflict of interest as far as im concerned   yeah   when youre talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars   umhum   uh youre youre youre jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today and that   so uh you talk about jeopardizing the future would you be against any deficit spending   i i think to bring it in line youre going to have to have a generation thats going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you cant ease into it it took years and years to build up the momentum thats there now   umhum   uh i i i forget the figures on the interest rate but its something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second   umhum   in interest part of the problem is we dont loan from ourselves we we buy from intimate international banking thats why we have interest   yeah umhum   and and i i really i really feel that that that is part of the problem that we weve let things get so out of control that that we dont wanna put the brakes on them   but what what practical steps could one could one take um   by by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable   well but everybody will say that he is for that   oh of course yeah   uh and and and how will you make that actually happen   and then add on to it you take the gross national income   umhum   and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax   umhum   across the board everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax   yep sounds like a good idea nothing escapes right no no deductions nothing just ten percent   uh thats right right no deductions you pay a ten percent income tax thats what you pay if you make forty million dollars uh then youre going to pay four million if if you make forty dollars youre going to pay four dollars   yep right   and and thats it   yep so that thats it thats i mean i i agree with that thats a good idea idea and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what   and i dont know that it  that it would or wouldnt
