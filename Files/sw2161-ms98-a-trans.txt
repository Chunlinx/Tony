              okay   okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community   well well in our area we just introduced the um citywide uh Clean King Sport campaign and we have a recycling mascot called Kleanaroo hes a kangaroo and um were setting up curbside recycling bins for the city home owners and several of our local businesses also have recycling stations set up in their parking lots   umhum   and how about in your area   well in our i live in a very small community outside of the Dallas area and uh were just getting started as a matter of fact this last week we got a notice in the mail from City Hall and theyve informed us that uh wed be getting more instructions in the mail in a week or two but were going to start a separation of our refuse and separating the cans from the paper et cetera   umhum   and apart of that we havent really done much of anything except for uh separating your newspapers and taking those to uh an area that theyve designated um but in uh in the office place weve been doing it for some time separating our uh uh computer paper from our normal garbage   all right so have we weve been doing the computer paper and then weve also been doing our aluminum cans   uhhuh what do they do with the cans   i thats the one thing i dont know i i dont know if they take them to the local aluminum uh recycling plant   umhum   uh just locally or or what i assume thats what they would do   i would assume so and then maybe do something with the money for charity or something   i would hope yeah  i i think thats what they do i think they they give that to charity   i yeah thats a good idea and and uh other than the work place and here at home um i dont know too much is going on in the community i know that in Plano its a larger city in the area they they uh i believe about a month or two ago they started having the citizens separate their refuse   okay   and theyve even um got a particular  huge uh waste can that they have to use   oh for each different product oh okay   right uhhuh that makes it kind of easier then you remember you know   yeah i i was going to say ive seen in some of these um local mail order catalogs theyve got trash can dividers for for home owners who dont have those it it   umhum oh uhhuh   it like cuts  your trash can in half so you could put cans on one side and and other on the other side so   other side thats a good idea   i think i think a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon   umhum   um as far as you know should more be done i think theres i think theres always more that can be done   i think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning dont you think   yes ive even heard them talking about uh recycling Freon from refrigerators refrigeration systems yes there are people there are companies that recycle their Freon     oh really umhum   and um  im sure there are a lot chemicals that that can be recycled that   yeah i know the motor oil   theres a lot of umhum   we have places that we can take our motor oil to if you change your own oil at home i   now thats we we dont have that thats neat     um KMart does that some of the KMarts in the area where i dont have any except for the lawn motor lawn mower   oh uhhuh   um machine oil because i always have my oil changed out of the house but   but but youd think that uh garages could do that   yes im sure they do uh   i mean that would be great   umhum because thats something that doesnt go back into the soil does it doesnt break down   no its its really bad to not break down   umhum   i uh saw an article the other day in Ann Landers that talked about how long it takes like a cigarette butt to decompose and i think it was between twenty and thirty years   is that right i had no idea   yes i i was i was flabbergasted and i think plastic was um plastic never totally total breaks down   never breaks down um the Styrofoam   thats the one that never did yep   yeah never did some   plastic took fifty years   fifty years   yeah   um i know that i had heard that uh McDonalds has gotten so much flack about sending their hot foods out in the Styrofoam that they are going to work on something   they they have here yes i used to get my Egg McMuffin in one of those little Styrofoam cup uh cups like and now they wrap them in paper   other than that oh have they umhum do they well good   yes so i was really glad to see that   i think theyre one of the businesses at large that do things like that theyre more aware of it   they they are good   or at least they try and do something about it first   i think they recognize their their position as a community leader   umhum   and really work to keep that going   i think youre right   so and and the only other thing ive seen has been the setting up a compost heap in your own backyard   umhum   but thats thats hard if you dont have a big yard or if you live in an apartment   defiantly if you live in an apartment right     that might not go over real well   right thats for sure   so   well   lets see has it been i think have we been our five minutes   uh i really dont know i havent been timing it but i think   i know the last time i did this they came on and said       you you have exceeded your ten minutes time limit hang up within the next thirty seconds so   oh okay oh all right   um   well i guess well just say goodbye then   okay and and i think we just hang up i dont think we have to do anything else   okay   but its been very nice talking to you okay   thank you nice to talk to you also   all righty byebye   byebye
