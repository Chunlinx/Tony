        what are your music music interests   uh just about any kind of music except acid rock i i dont care for acid rock   me too  oh   but uh i grew up with country and western but uh just about any kind of music i even like classical music   yeah i did too and then yeah uh im pretty diversified too i i dont i dont like acid rock either ive  i grew up in a small town so uh the only  we only had one radio station so it was country music but then uh when i   yeah yeah i grew up with  Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs   oh really youre older than i am  oh     but uh i did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with James Galway   we dont get channel two my our cable doesnt i wish we got that one  it was it well we dont get channel two   oh that was fabulous when yeah when he played Danny Boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing     oh really   yeah and uh it was tremendous   now he he is a good uh actually i did i played flute for almost ten years  and and uh so i i i i appreciate his too his his music he he hes from Ireland isnt he   yeah yeah yeah uhhuh and it was uh mostly all Irish tunes they they had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then   was yeah   guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle and a couple of violins and a drum and they   yeah umhum   they played all the Irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous   yeah i he he is really good yeah ive ive i come from a musical background so uh um ive played flute flute flute and piano so  i i i have uh   yeah yeah   a big appreciation for music   yeah   up to a point i im getting now to the age where i dont like the new stuff thats coming and much of the new stuff thats coming out  husband says im getting old   yeah yeah yeah i love uh i like i especially like instrumentals   do you   yeah i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen   that yeah that thats nice to do that that is   yeah   ive got a ive got a two ive got a two year old whos now getting  im getting well well versed in in kiddy music   uh im i never played an instrument in my life ive always wanted to ive always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something   yeah yeah  well i was one of the forced ones   but uh but i id just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music   oh i could never do that  i was never that brave but um  yeah   hm hm    but i guess the closest ive ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir   yeah oh yeah ive ive done ive done that at church too havent done that in a long time   yeah yeah     so lets see what well what kind of music do you not like   well like i say the acid rock i just do not care and i dont care for rap music either   oh oh gosh thats not music  that is not i dont know what that is but thats not music   huhuh no no if i cant understand the words i dont wanna listen to it   well its its its not its not music its just its just uh uh beat talking in a beat it is just its not exciting at all it doesnt  it doesnt give you relaxation you cant dance to it you cant do anything to it yeah   yeah yeah yeah right but i and i love uh i look at the orchestra music too like the Boston Pops or or anything   did yeah have you ever been to the to to the Dallas Symphony have you is it are they good   uhhuh yeah yeah theyre good   are they i i have never ive never been   and uh we went and saw uh Les Les Les Miserables   oh really   oh the music in that was fantastic   ive ive heard ive heard that that is a really   yeah   i heard that was hard to get tickets to   yeah it it uh i cant remember how far in advance we reserved tickets but it was out you know out at the State Fair Music Hall   probably cost yeah  yeah that was a real   and uh it was well worth the price yeah   was it i i bet it was i bet i really bet it was  is that the only uh musical do you go see musicals musicals a lot of musicals   yeah just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one and   yeah the that that would be that would be nice   we went and saw uh i think it was uh Sugar Babies that was good that had good music in it   was it i how how i cant i dont know what thats about   uh that was the one with uh Mickey Rooney and uh oh whats that real oh not real old uh well she is old too dancer um       i cant think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and cant say it Helen something   uh oh oh i think i know who youre talking oh i know who youre talking talking about shes got black hair   uh real long legs and dark hair   yeah okay i know who your talking about i cant think of her name either yeah that was that was that was i remember that being uh here a few years ago     i cant think of it yeah but uh   oh oh the last country music  my my parents still uh really like country music and they they like um they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Stadler Brothers and   yeah oh yeah yeah   and uh well my my my my parents   Blackwoods   yeah my my husband likes uh country music real well and he he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah and uh yeah he really likes Shenandoah   yeah Alabama   yeah oh yeah Alabama well yeah yeah Alabama i think theyre i think theyre a bit too over exposed  i get kind of tired get tired tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio      yeah but i yeah either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior   oh i i i ive never cared for Hank Williams Junior   i never neither and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row   i  oh we we watch those award shows too we like we enjoyed watching the country and the Grammies and stuff but i just i just dont care for him i just never have i dont   yes yeah i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is uh probably Eddy Arnold   is is it okay uh i i i think i i know who that is uhhuh i think my parents have  have uh some of his records   hm   yeah um   but i got about ive got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight RPM records of country and western songs   wow   Smiley Burnette i dont know if youre old enough to remember him   ive heard the name   he was uh played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of Gene Autry i believe or they i think his name when in the movie was Froggy   huh   had had a real raspy voice   ive ive never seen a Gene Autry movie hm   and uh some of those old ones of course Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys and Ernest Tubbs and   no i never have yeah   Red Foley and   yeah those go back quite a ways   yeah i took them up here to Collectors Rector Records and was able to get a little money for them   yeah   but uh my mother mother and dad used to own a restaurant and they had a they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records   its hard to find oh yeah yeah   the guys would and the guy would give her the old records   well that would thats neat   so uh thats where i learned about   that would be great great if they werent too worn out at the time   yeah course theres not a whole lot of market for seventy eight RPM records   is there not you youd well youd think there would be   well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle   well thats true oh yeah   and uh they just wont play on a modern day uh   well thats a shame   phonograph   because i i we go to antique stores a lot and you see seventy eights   yeah   uh a lot at at the store at at at or in record stores youd   yeah   think thered be a market for i im sure you could find old players for them but thatd cost a fortune if you could find them that worked  oh   yeah yeah course they you know just dont have the quality of records nowadays either because you you you get that scratchy sound   no umhum well those things were big and thick werent they   yeah yeah   now you could kill somebody with them  and the one you buy go out and buy one now and theyre just so thin and flimsy and   yeah they warped real easy yeah   they just theyre not meant to last at all   no   no neither are tapes i i i buy we buy cassette tapes and machines will eat them you did so youre best bet any day anymore these days is a compact disk those things are practically indestructible   yeah yeah yeah yes but i i guess you know the old country and western music you back then when i was a kid there wasnt that much TV so thats all you had to listen to was the radio   oh no radio yeah   and uh   that thats just what  just what you had back plus i think it was better back then to the TV theres too much TV now   yeah   and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television  kept your imagination   yeah yeah   was it it it kept it it just didnt vegetate your mind like television does   yeah i remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opry   oh yeah   and   was that on the radio every week   yeah   what what day what day was that on do you have you can you recall   i i seems like it was on a Friday Friday or Saturday   Friday
