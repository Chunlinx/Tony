                what do you think about it   well i i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that i think there are some occupations that they should such as the health field the transportation field uh theyre already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth uh they do it to prisoners so i i uh   yeah   i i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions and i think if if uh an employer feels that he wants to to drug test employees and they dont like it then they should not be employed there  that was you know i would not mind it   yeah i i especially agree that if its an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely   right   and i dont have a problem at all with employers uh testing in the hiring process but i i i dont i dont have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact but i do a little bit where it where it wouldnt hurt anybody i dont know sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far   uhhuh   but   well  unless an employer has a reason to believe that his uh the work competency of   yeah um   of the employee employee is is hurting the business i mean maybe its uh number one because generally if if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft   right and then its not a problem yeah   and as an employer i would think that would be and the first its not going to be wholesale because of the cost theres no way but but my concern is uh school bus drivers   oh absolutely oh yeah   um im not even im in education im not even opposed to it for that   train the train drivers   uh im concerned in the medical field   yeah   i i i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because i consider that a drug   i wish they would i i wish they would and that i think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than than drugs so to speak   right right right but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or   so oh i know it   a train um and it doesnt take that long uh they they dont have be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could could mean life   and no just uh   yeah and now TI has the random testing policy and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool   oh okay uhhuh   you know so ive already been tested once when i was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program   uhhuh uhhuh   but i work with one girl who was tested her name got got randomly selected three times in six months   oh my word   and i think thats the only reason i have a problem with it when theres no you know theres no reason to suspect someone you know that thats getting a little bit thats enough to make anybody paranoid   control right       well as long as you accept that it is a random a random testing uh   yeah   you know to to alleviate that way you cant feel like somebodys out to get me if its almost like being selected for jury duty   right yeah     you know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel thats thats just the way it is   you were just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it   i would i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in   oh absolutely   because i i think theres when you let other employees turn in people   there are so many people with with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand and   right right so i i i would really rather know however theres got to be some backup to say that if if somebody does observe you at say at a party uh using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that   yeah to report it and i guess youd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something   personnel or something right   because i i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol id just id feel really uncomfortable   right well i dont know what kind of work you do but there there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way and   yeah we have we have a lot of people who work on the line im in accounting so it wouldnt you know they they couldnt hurt me with their ten key or something but out on the line theyve got people working some serious equipment   right right right its its   so   i i just think employers have to have especially given today the drug abuse that goes on i just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that theyre not being put at risk because theyre the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims et cetera and and im not sure but what some of the insurance claims arent due to   put at risk i agree totally   uh illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse   and in the long run were all paying for that so its i mean it it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that   right right   i i was trying to remember there was a court case uh here here where i live just a few months ago the city workers they wanted to um the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing   uh   and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first amendment the the search and seizure amendment   uhhuh uhhuh   and its still tied up in the legal channels they havent ruled on whether they can test them or not   huh   so im curious especially since TI a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what what theyll say about it especially since   to see how thats is it is it uh just a small group of the employees that are concerned   well its the whole its the whole city seems like the whole group of city employees thats raising a stink over it   they they just dont want to be drug tested   yeah so   you know weve never my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested   y eah   uh my husbands retired from i R S agents   uhhuh   however this isnt a problem that we have and either alcohol or drug and so we we in our minds were thinking whats the big deal   right yeah thats the way i looked at it if i had something to hide its one thing but im you know you know you dont so its not as big a deal and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether theyre really concerned about their rights or whether theyre really concerned about something else   right and and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then theyre going to take some other right away from you but i i a firm   i dont believe that   i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything and of course the big deal one of the big deals now too is to that when you come into a company as you sign a paper saying that i will go take a
