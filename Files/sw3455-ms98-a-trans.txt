        okay uh i guess our topic is about movies     umhum   and uh what a coincidence we got a baby sitter and we went to the movies this past weekend   oh so did i   and we saw Cape Fear   oh i heard that was excellent is it um i wanted to see that i was deciding between that and uh My Girl and my boyfriend and i went to see My Girl   it is its really good oh hows that   oh it was excellent it was a really really good movie id recommend it   i i heard thats a a movie that uh you really cant take children is that true   um i heard the opposite that um you should take children to see it   oh   um there were quite um few uh kids in there with their parents   oh   yeah um i dont know though i ive heard that and then what you just told me so   yeah yeah because uh the little boy dies   right yeah it was sad it was really sad but um   yeah oh   his it kind of shows how his um best friend this little girl deals with his death and how i think maybe how children should deal with death maybe   oh oh uhhuh   but it was really good it was sad very sad   oh i wanna see that one well Cape Fear was was more suspenseful it was really suspenseful so that thats thats a real good movie to see     yeah i heard it was um sort of like um not um too violent but it was kind of like um gross kind of like um Silence of the Lambs like   uh no and no it uh its kind of i dont know its kind of both i guess but its not its not as bad as Silence of the Lambs   oh oh really   but uh its just as suspenseful i think and it it was a real good movie   oh   and then we saw Beauty and the Beast  because we have two kids and Fievel Goes West   oh yeah uh oh ive seen um previews for them on TV but i   but uh those were those were okay   yeah   so and then oh boy its been its been so long since weve been to the movies but i weve rented some videos   oh yeah i like to rent movies too   and i think the last one i rented was uh Mortal Thoughts with Demi Moore   oh i oh i i didnt see that   and um that that thats okay thats pretty good oh and um What About Bob   yeah ive seen that at the theatres yeah that that was cute   yeah yeah we rented that one and uh uh i guess thats probably about it have you rented any movies lately   um the last movie i rented was The Hard Way with Michael J Fox and um   oh yeah that was good we rented that one too   yeah i liked that i like Michael J Fox a lot  hes one of my favorites so   uhhuh yeah yeah   i like his movies   so do you go to the movies often or   no not too often i i hadnt been to the movies for a really long time except for this last weekend but um   uhhuh   theres been movies out that ive been wanting to see i just you know dont get a chance to get out and see them   yeah yeah well we have two little kids so its hard for us to get out and go to the movies we have to dig up a baby sitter and   oh i see   and thats only the only time we can go out so our time is scarce   yeah oh   oh but um we we we try we you know were were big movie people and and we try and do and i dont i dont know about the last movie ive seen on TV that was real good um   yeah oh i watched that movie with um Barbara um oh what was her name about that um her sister got killed and um she had a baby the husband husband was a dentist and he had murdered her   oh yeah um   that was that was pretty good   Bertinelli or whats her name   yeah umhum oh Valerie Bertinelli thats it yeah   i cant yeah yeah yeah yeah  yeah that was real good i saw that one uh two part series and i heard it was a true story   yeah umhum   yeah i think that was probably the last movie ive seen too   yeah   and and then i saw that other movie about um Mother Daughter Mother Wife Murderer did you see that one   oh um with um Judith Light um   yeah did you see that one that was was really good too thats supposed to be a true story too   yeah i did see that yeah i did it that was on a while ago wasnt it   yeah i guess a couple weeks ago or something like that   um yeah i saw that umhum yeah that was pretty good i   boy we have we we see all the same movies     yeah i like um the true stories theyre more interesting   yeah umhum   you know its hard to believe that you know this really happened some of them are pretty bad   i know yeah yeah yeah huh well  we sure do have a lot in common     yeah   if youre ever in town well go see a movie   okay   but and we dont really do yall have do yall still have driveins up there or   yeah umhum yeah do you have them there   hm we may have just a couple over here
