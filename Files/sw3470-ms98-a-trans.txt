                 okay what kind of car would you uh  would you buy if you were going to by one these days   uh that uh to be real honest im thinking about a truck as opposed to a car   what kind of truck   um uh uh probably some sort of utility type vehicle either a um my  my particular favorite right at the moment is that Explorer the Ford um Explorer   oh i i think thats pretty good i uh i got to look for something too i i unfortunately i have a Ford Thunderbird that uh its been in the shop for three days and they cant fix the thing so im not real happy with Ford at the moment right i think i will try some other  line   oh some other brand or something yeah no i just am i have looked for a long time ive ive had since ive been out of school ive mostly had uh you know German cars like um i had i mean you know used ones obviously  um i had a Mercedes sedan and then i had a BMW     how how did those work how long did they last you they   well theyre excellent cars and if you uh my uh i was a little partial to the Mercedes i think i almost wish id kept it it was old it was by the time i sold it it was about fifteen thirteen or fifteen years old   how many miles you get on it   oh jeez um ah   did you get a couple hundred thousand   at least i mean the the the year model that i had was one that that um they say that those engines are built to be completely torn down and rebuilt like at least three times   really hm   thats the amount of metal that they have in them   yeah   that Mercedes really i mean the way look at a car is they built you know they build this car you buy this car you can drive this car your whole life   maybe thats the kind of car i better buy i drive too many miles i uh i drive about thirty five thousand miles a year and uh American cars i guess just dont do that kind of mileage   i think they dont build them to hold up to that for something   well well i think the cars do i dont think they have mechanics that can fix them thats the whole problem   yeah thats probably and all this computerized stuff is fine and good but you know something goes wrong and and it seems like   yep   you know its like yeah yeah you cant fix anything anymore you have to replace entire parts or something you know you cant you know back in the olden days   well they cant fix it they dont they dont have the no yeah where where do you live what city do you live in     i live in Dallas   you live in Dallas well you got the same problem with mechanics i think they i i just dont think theres good mechanics around   yeah yeah i mean i dont know i i do a lot of stuff myself because it seems like if you take something to a dealership you know they are even more inclined to not fix something and just like replace the entire part   i think youre right   and and and they dont seem to really know how to do anything else you know what i call parts changers and and so i get myself a little book and i start fixing a lot of stuff myself   want to fix my Thunderbird  they cant fix it   yeah if its a very new one i wouldnt even begin to you know all this computer stuff just loses me i dont like to look under the engine of the car and not see anything i recognize you know       thats the problem i agree with you used to be you could you could repair and do all those things yourself and theres theres so much pollution i i think the antipollution stuff is what really fouls up a lot of engines   oh yeah   and uh theres theres no way you can work on them   yeah i i think because the whole system wasnt designed with that in mind in the first place so they just came up with something they could slap on after the fact   yep thats right   you know i mean if if if you really wanted to i mean you know if we can send people to the moon       we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly efficient engine that would also be good for the environment   i think they can its just that   but the you know theres no percentages in doing that theres too much i mean they can make too much money doing the doing the other way around or something   thats why the electric car has has been made for some time but uh theres too much politics and too much gas and oil people that will prevent that from coming on the market for the time being im afraid   and ill tell you you know the thing i worry about is thats strictly short term i mean that you know we know that our oil supply is running out you know and what happens when it does is what i want to know   yeah then they bring it on board   i mean i may not have to worry about it because it happen in my lifetime but i worry about it anyway because i know its out there             i dont know its just   well we can always go back to horses   well thats you know   least you dont have to worry about maintaining them   this well this is true you could just like have them out there i dont know in the pasture grazing and theres not much fixing with them either         i dont know i dont know that id want to have to rely on that as my transportation but i dont know i just you know ive been looking at at some things and like i say ive been looking at these Explorers and these other kind of you know Blazers and whatnot and you know they open up the hood and they say you know it   you think they last a long time   i dont know they but they say they open up the hood they show you all these modern advances theyve made and they show
