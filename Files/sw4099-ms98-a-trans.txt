        okay i guess were talking about exercise huh     okay yeah yeah well first of all i i have have to ask you how how old you are   oh i am twenty seven   twenty seven okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are  but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis     you do what type of exercise do you do   well i do um jazzercise which is an aerobic um   oh you do   program that are you familiar with it   yes   its uh you know a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can   is that different from aerobics or is it the same thing   no its really its its an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again   and you do that every day   no i only do it  probably two or three times a week   oh okay   the minimum they want you to do is three times a week   oh and this is a club or uh do you belong to a group   well its really a i mean its called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can so like i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings   do you go with friends or do you go alone   no i go by myself and and thats one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me   yeah   and most of my friends that are my age dont exercise or they might play tennis     uhhuh   and since i am not a tennis player um you know i dont get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there arent many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers     umhum oh   you know with with children between the ages   oh yeah  young mothers or yeah   young mothers you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find well what do you do     uhhuh uhhuh uh i really dont have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and thats what i do everyday   oh great yeah so you play everyday   yeah pretty much when my wife lets me   well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just you know   no i just shoot around by myself   yeah   and uh thats about it i use to play soccer a lot in high school but when i graduated i havent done much i dont have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i dont have a problem with weight i could eat all day and not gain an ounce   well see thats thats thats really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising   uhhuh   i mean i dont have a problem with weight either but i think i dont have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and its because i exercise but i also watch what i eat   you do exercises you do exercise uhhuh   you know but youll come being being twenty seven you dont really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will   yeah and i well everyones told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but i dont know   well it might not  it might not because everybodys been telling me that too and so far it hasnt happened you know and i       i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself   uhhuh   and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high   yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so thats why ive kept active in that way   yeah but you dont play any other sports but basketball   uh basketball volleyball um just about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby i do that   but do you ski being in Utah i was wondering if you skied   um i used to but it got too expensive so   oh did it really   yeah   because i know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great   yeah a lot of people do that   yeah   and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things   yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to Utah all the time and they think its really and they ski i guess theres a place where you can ski where was it Tahoe where you ski from   oh they come up here   no thats Nevada to California i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line   thats in Nevada uhhuh oh yeah but   but theres a funny there is a place in Utah called a funny name   theres Snow Bird or Alta   but its like oh Heavenly is that it   Heavenly   yeah i think its called Heavenly   huh ive never heard of that one huhuh   youve never heard of that well maybe it isnt in Utah i dont know       but they said theyve skied Heavenly and  it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny   do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but   oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i can mean ive talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they dont get sore   oh yeah see im this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after   and and then is it your your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and   yeah my legs really really ache   yeah   but thats i am using muscles that i have never used before   yeah well and its strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding and still i was so sore and i couldnt get over
