                                                            A Bunchof Hot Air                        There are a couple ofproblems with the statistics cited in Jodie T Allens Killer AirBags            First Allen overestimatesthe cost of air bags Because each consumer only pays for the air bags in hisor her own car the cost of each life saved is no more than the cost to theowner of a vehicle The total cost of an air bag is this breaks down to per year on a threeyear lease Air bags lower insurance rates hencethere may be savings on the above figure And anyway that figure would seem tobe a rather small price to pay for additional safety            Second the article statesthat only  lives have been saved by air bags while  air bags havebeen deployed since  However the  figure is based only on accidentsin which death might have occurred if air bags had not been installed It doesnot take into account the number of accidents in which the injuries might havebeen more serious if air bags had not been installed It also doesnt reflectthe number of lives saved that might have been lost due to accidentrelatedcomplications            Restraintsystems arent perfect but they do offer another level of protection Beingaware that there may be a problem with air bags will help us minimize thatproblem in the futuresmall comfort I know to those who have already lostloved ones

economicsense            The Brookings study Jodie TAllen cites in Killer Air Bags calls at least implicitly for us to assign avalue to our time and to use that to determine the value of the total time wespend buckling up There are at least three problems with this approach            The first lies in theassumption that all threesecond periods are worth the same All time was notcreated equal A threesecond period before getting in the shower is worth farless than three seconds taken from the middle of my daughters weddingBuckling up always occurs between activitieswe are accustomed to treatingthat time between activities as a buffer period during which several smalltasks are addressed and uncertainties are guarded against So the time inpractice will not be missed            The second related problemis that the value of a unit of time is partially determined by the duration ofthe total period in which that unit falls Put simply  uninterrupted minutesare worth far more than  individually occurring threesecond periods Andyou dont get to cash in your buckleup episodes like casino chips            But as the last problemIll outline suggests neither of the previous two objections matters It onlymakes sense to worry about the time it takes to put on a seat belt if itactually results in a delay in our progress Does it Many of us put on ourseat belts while the car is in motion Others do so while warming up theircars The rest of us can live on the edge until the first red lightwhen wecan buckle up in obscene leisure            Asidefrom the problems with these basic assumptions I was duly awed and intimidatedby the complexity of Allens analysis                           Andrew Fano                                       SwollenInsensitivity

                       ActiveFaith                        StephenChapmans response to Andrew Sullivan is riddled with reductive thinkingand cheap rhetorical tricks Chapman doesnt realize that revelation is not aset of propositions one accepts but an encounter in which one is moved beyondoneself Its analogous to an encounter with a work of beauty Neither thebeauty of the artwork nor the truth of Scriptures word can be proved usingsome supposedly neutral line of reasoning Instead both are given to humanfreedom and each calls for a choice            But the real question is notwhat faith means but what Chapman means by illogical and without evidenceWhat exactly would count as evidence for Chapman Clearly many find it veryreasonable to believe that God exists despite their adolescent need to have itproved to them as if metaphysics and mathematics were the same discipline Forthese people there is evidence but not proof persuasive enough to meet themythological standards of neutral rationality a standard that no philosopherin his right mind would defend today Is there a rational basis for thinkingthat God exists Yes but the answer depends on what counts as evidence andwhat one means by rational            Finally anote on Gods concern We can of course continue to ask why there is evil inthe world But at some point we also have to face the fact that this is theworld we live in a world where evil often seems to triumph and death appearsto have the last word In this context the cross not only inscribes Godsconcern but also proclaims with the resurrection
