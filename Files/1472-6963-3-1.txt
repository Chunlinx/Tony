                    Background                  Origins of PRWORA          In the s Congress moved to reform public spending          by reducing the number of beneficiaries on welfare rolls          Reforms focused partly on immigrants following testimony          from the General Accounting Office estimating that          slightly more than half of the Supplemental Security          Income SSI benefits provided to elderly persons were          collected by noncitizens in       In          justifying PRWORA     the House Ways and Means          Committee stated that it had been a basic tenet of US          immigration policy since  that legal immigrants          should not be eligible for public benefits Though          Congress did not rescind emergency Medicaid from illegal          immigrants the legislation cited a compelling          government interest to remove the incentive for illegal          immigration provided by the availability of public          benefits     PRWORA was among several pieces of          legislation in the mids  including Californias          Proposition  in  and the Illegal Immigration          Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of               that embodied substantive immigration policy changes the          specific provisions of which have been enforced in          varying degrees according to government priorities                          PRWORA legislation and states responses          PRWORA made several key reforms restricting public          assistance for qualified immigrants     Prior to the          implementation of PRWORA qualified aliens were          eligible for the same federal meanstested benefits as US          citizens PRWORA makes an important distinction between          qualified and nonqualified immigrants The term           qualified alien is used          synonymously with           legal immigrant and designates a          noncitizen who falls into one of the following          categories  persons lawfully admitted for permanent          residence  persons granted asylum  refugees           persons paroled into the United States for at least one          year  persons for whom deportation is being withheld          and  persons granted conditional entry The term           nonqualified alien includes          nonimmigrant visitors and undocumentedillegal          immigrants          After PRWORA legal immigrants were declared          ineligible for nonemergency Medicaid for their first           years in the country with some exceptions as described          later The Immigration and Naturalization Service INS          estimates that there were  million   legal          permanent residents residing in the United States as of          April      To qualify for Medicaid coverage          after the ban noncitizens must not receive public          benefits during the year period     Legal          immigrants receiving benefits at the time of enactment on          August   were denied continuation of those          benefits starting January   Benefits both before          and after PRWORA for           nonqualified aliens remained          restricted to emergency Medicaid          Before PRWORA states did not consider immigration          status in granting Medicaid assistance After PRWORA          however most legal immigrants arriving after August           were barred from Medicaid and other statefunded          assistance at states discretion Exceptions were made          for  refugees  persons granted asylum and persons          whose deportation was being withheld  armed forces          personnel or veterans and their dependent family members          and  legal permanent residents with  qualifying          quarters of work              Under pressure from the White House and immigrants          advocacy groups Congress restored some Medicaid benefits          to certain legal immigrants as part of the Balanced          Budget Act BBA of       Under the BBA a          legal immigrant could qualify for Medicaid not          restricted to emergency Medicaid through SSI eligibility          if he or she was lawfully in the United States and          receiving SSI benefits on August   and          subsequently certified under the SSI program as blind or          disabled                          Immigrant populations and use of health care          Noncitizens in the United States numbered          approximately  million in  or  percent of the          total population     Previous research has shown          noncitizens to be more economically disadvantaged and to          possess lower levels of health insurance than naturalized          and native citizens Census data suggest that noncitizens          are more likely than citizens to be poor  vs           despite the fact that noncitizen families are as likely          as citizen families to have at least one fulltime worker           vs      In their report on insurance rates          for Hispanic immigrants the Commonwealth Fund Task Force          on the Future of Health Insurance found that the longer          Hispanic immigrants had been permanent residents of the          United States the more likely they were to be covered by          employerrelated insurance     Among lowincome          immigrants in the United States in   were          uninsured compared to  of lowincome citizens              The Kaiser Commission reports that immigrants may          underutilize health care regardless of insurance          coverage out of fear of jeopardizing their citizenship          eligibility by incurring costs as public charges                                       Objective          Using data from several sources we present snapshots          of information currently available and consider how the          financial impact of PRWORA on hospitals might be          estimated Based on a review of relevant literature we          hypothesized that uncompensated hospital care would be          more prevalent in states with lower rates of health          insurance coverage higher percentages of foreignborn          residents used to approximate the population of interest          affected by PRWORA higher rates of poverty and greater          percentages of teaching hospitals         We          outline the limitations of available data and discuss          what information is needed to accurately estimate the          outcome of interest                            Methods        Our goal was to examine the effects of PRWORA on        hospital uncompensated care expenditures The analysis        consisted of two parts a series of data snapshots to        describe relevant information and a multivariable        regression to model drivers of uncompensated care costs        The regression analysis was conducted at the state level        because no single source of data includes both patients        immigration status and the amount of uncompensated hospital        care provided thus precluding hospital or patientlevel        analyses        We collected the following statelevel data for the        period from  through  foreignborn noncitizen        population health uninsurance rates percentage of        teaching hospitals as a proportion of all hospitals        reporting data per state and each states decision        regarding whether to implement the PRWORA Medicaid bar for        legal permanent residents or to continue offering        nonemergency Medicaid coverage using stateonly funds        These factors are thought to influence expenditures per        admission for uncompensated hospital care               and were examined at the state level for the period from         to  for a total of  observations  years          states        Statelevel data on the percentage of the population        uninsured and the percentage of the population comprised of        foreignborn noncitizens were obtained from the         Current Population Survey March Supplement a detailed        description of which is available elsewhere            Because the Medicare program covers virtually all Americans        aged  and older data on insurance coverage rates among        nonelderly populations were used As the closest available        proxy for the percentage of legal immigrants per state we        used the foreign born not a US citizen category        available in the Public Basic Monthly Survey for  to                Statelevel poverty data were obtained from the        historical poverty tables of the Census Bureau            Poverty thresholds are stable across all regions and are        adjusted for inflation every year using the Consumer Price        Index for All Urban Consumers CPIU        Aggregate data on uncompensated care were obtained from        the American Hospital Associations AHA nationwide Annual        Survey of Hospitals     AHA defines bad debt as the        provision for actual or expected uncollectibles resulting        from the extension of credit Charity care services        however are provided free of charge to individuals who        meet certain financial criteria and are never expected to        result in cash inflows Total uncompensated care for        hospitals on the state level was estimated as the sum of        bad debt and charity care For each state we obtained a        sample of all hospitals for which both charity care and bad        debt data were available yearly from  to  We        calculated uncompensated care per hospital admission as a        per capita estimate of uncompensated care These estimates        were adjusted to  US dollars using the medical care        component of the CPI        Teaching hospital status also was obtained from the AHA        Annual Survey of Hospitals The AHA defines teaching        hospitals as those that are members of the Council of        Teaching Hospitals of the Association of American Medical        Colleges Teaching hospital percentage refers to the        percentage of hospitals classified as teaching hospitals        out of the total number of hospitals in a state reporting        data to AHA for the years of interest        Although every state excluding Wyoming and South        Dakota chose to preserve Medicaid coverage for immigrants        who were eligible before the enactment of PRWORA ie        entering the United States before August   states        decisions varied on whether to implement the year bar on        Medicaid eligibility for qualified immigrants after the        enactment of PRWORA Fourteen states California        Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maine Maryland        Massachusetts Minnesota Nebraska Pennsylvania Rhode        Island Virginia and Washington maintained Medicaid        eligibility for qualified immigrants entering the United        States after August   through stateonly funds            We included a dichotomous variable in the model        describing each states implementation decision        A multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the        hypothesis that total uncompensated care the sum of        charity care and bad debt per admission would be affected        by a states percentage of foreignborn residents poverty        rate uninsurance rate percentage of hospitals and the        states implementation decision Because total        uncompensated care was heavily skewed we used a        logtransformed variable as the dependent variable The        resulting loglinear model has the convenient property of        measuring the relative change in the dependent variable        uncompensated care for an absolute change in a given        predictor variable controlling for other predictors in the        model Each year from  through  was entered into        the model as a categorical variable omitting  as the        reference year We used the Huber    and White        estimator      clustered on states to obtain robust        error estimates that allow for the lack of independence of        observations within a given state over

uncompensated care though this result was only          significant at the  level Percentage of teaching          hospitals greater than  was found to be a weak          predictor of uncompensated care but was not significant                     P   A states decision to          implement PRWORA did not independently predict          uncompensated care expenditures in our model The trend          variables corresponding to years were not          significant                            Discussion        PRWORA marked largescale changes in health        immigration and welfare policy in the United States        Patients hospitals and state and federal governments have        all had a stake in PRWORAs enactment An accurate monetary        estimate of the effects of PRWORA on hospital uncompensated        care due to changes in Medicaid coverage would be useful to        policymakers as PRWORA periodically comes up for        consideration of renewal and as anecdotal evidence of an        adverse financial impact on hospitals continues to        mount        We hypothesized that hospital uncompensated care        expenditures would be greater in states with higher        percentages of foreignborn residents lower rates of        insurance coverage and higher percentages of teaching        hospitals Measured at the state level hospital        uncompensated care expenditures were not statistically        significantly related to percentage foreignborn        percentage of teaching hospitals or states implementation        decisions in our model higher uninsurance rates emerged        as the only significant predictor of uncompensated hospital        care expenditures This finding suggests that efforts to        reduce the number of people uninsured or underinsured would        reduce hospitals expenditures on uncompensated care This        implication reinforces claims that high rates of        uninsurance in United States have negative effects but        does not directly address our original hypothesis about the        immigrant eligibility provisions of PRWORA As with other        studies that have combined disparate data sources to assess        the impact of PRWORA on the health or welfare of wouldbe        beneficiaries     data limitations posed a significant        challenge to these analyses        The proxy of percentage foreignborn may not have        accurately captured the population of interest  legal        immigrants arriving after August   who were no        longer eligible for nonemergency Medicaid coverage Using        the foreignborn category from the Census data relies on        the assumption that states with higher foreignborn        populations would also have a greater number of legal        immigrants whose eligibility for nonemergency Medicaid        would be affected by PRWORA However the foreignborn        noncitizen category used in Census data defined as any        person not born a citizen of the United States and not        naturalized includes categories of persons exempted from        PRWORAs Medicaid cuts such as asylum seekers and        refugees Given that PRWORA requires states that provide        health services to report illegal immigrants to        authorities it is unlikely that accurate data on        immigration status and date of entry into the United States        can be collected in the health care setting In addition        it is unlikely that any institutional review board would        approve the collection of such data in present        circumstances        Because the main effect of PRWORA was to restrict        Medicaid eligibility thereby increasing demand for        uncompensated care the present analysis focused on        statelevel parameters linked to demand for medical care        Uncompensated care reimbursement pools common in states        with former allpayer ratesetting systems led to        increased uncompensated care expenditures throughout the        s In a deregulated health care system however states        tended to use these funds to expand Medicaid andor        Medicaid managed care thus shifting the focus of the pools        to reimbursement for charity care only     Because of        the nonuniformity of states approaches to uncompensated        care pools their limited use and their changing roles        over time we did not include this factor in our final        model        A monetary estimate on a national state or hospital        level of the financial impact of PRWORA remains difficult        to ascertain due to data limitations Ideally such        research would compare the costs before and after  of        the nonemergency care that hospitals provided both as        charity care and as bad debt to the category of immigrants        who lost nonemergency Medicaid eligibility due to the        implementation of PRWORA We would expect the extent and        implications of this financial impact to vary according to        both hospital characteristics and the populations served        Because a patients immigration status is not recorded        concomitantly with hospital resource use in any hospital        state or federal database it is not currently possible to        isolate charity care and bad debt expenditures on        nonreimbursed services for patients whose eligibility for        Medicaid has been changed by PRWORA        An additional complicating factor is the possibility        that as a result of PRWORA hospitals may provide and bill        for services as emergency services that previously were        categorized as nonemergency services in order to secure        Medicaid payment Similarities in incomerelated        eligibility criteria for emergency and nonemergency        Medicaid would facilitate reclassification Further        research should examine the extent to which providers        reclassify services        Traditionally safety net hospitals have been supported        though public funds such as disproportionateshare        hospital DSH payments The Medicaid DSH payment is based        on the assumption that certain hospitals in addition to        providing care to Medicaid enrollees also serve indigent        persons who are ineligible for Medicaid However there are        some indications that public support mechanisms to        hospitals may be in jeopardy     First DSH payments        are large and repeatedly become targets for budget cuts by        federal and state governments As a result of provisions in        the BBA for example it has been estimated that federal        spending on Medicaid DSH will decrease by  or         billion during the period from  through  Since        more Medicaid beneficiaries are being cared for in private        facilities public safety net hospitals may be affected by        both competition for feeforservice patients and decreases        in overall DSH allotments     Finally safety net        hospitals typically use Medicaid revenues to help fund        uncompensated care decreases in Medicaid reimbursements        may therefore further impede hospitals ability to        provide services to the uninsured            Existing studies of trends in uncompensated hospital        care expenditures have focused primarily on supplyside        covariates such as uncompensated care pools Medicare and        Medicaid DSH payments and the degree of competition in the        local health care marketplace         While a        focus on such hospital characteristics has helped to        elucidate the factors that affect uncompensated care at the        hospital level the present study sought to examine the        impact of the PRWORA legislation by identifying statelevel        characteristics affecting total hospital uncompensated care        per state from  to  Because data used for the        regression model came from multiple sources comprehensive        yearbyyear figures from  through  were available        for all factors in the model only at the state level        Because PRWORA gave states the option of changing Medicaid        coverage statelevel information is useful in        understanding how PRWORA was implemented across the United        States However to better assess the effects of PRWORA on        hospitals detailed hospitalspecific information at least        at the level of metropolitan statistical area MSA would        be needed on the immigration status of populations served        Data limitations currently hamper efforts to obtain a        monetary estimate of hospitals financial losses due        specifically to PRWORA To better quantify the impact of        health policy regulations on health care providers better        data sources particularly at the MSA level are        needed                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors Contributions        LDC conceived of and designed
