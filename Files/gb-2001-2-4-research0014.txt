                    Background        DNA arrays variously called microarrays complementary        DNA cDNA arrays gene arrays and gene expression arrays        have been widely heralded and are becoming increasingly        integrated into the current research and future plans of        many laboratories   The main utility of DNA arrays lies        in their ability to report the expression level of        thousands of genes simultaneously although other uses are        being continually introduced There are an increasing        number of different commercially available DNA array        formats These include the glassslide based        oligonucleotide array system     developed by        Affymetrix the glassslidebased cDNA clone Gene        Expression Microarray GEM line from Incyte Genomics        IGI the filter and glassslidebased Atlas arrays        developed by Clontech Laboratories composed of selected        regions of PCRamplified gene sequences filterbased        GeneFilters from Research Genetics RGI which like IGIs        GEMs utilize partial or fulllength cDNA clones Many        research institutions are also investing in core facilities        that after the fashion of the Brown laboratory           are producing their own filter andor glass arrays from PCR        products of clones from the Integrated Molecular Analysis        of Genomes and their Expression IMAGE consortium or        other clones A detailed explanation of the differences        between these various array formats and other aspects of        current DNA array technology can be found in the review by        Rockett and Dix          The efficiency sensitivity and reproducibility of        commercially available arrays is good and improving but        they are limited in three main areas their cost is still        somewhat prohibitive for some labs the number of species        for which arrays are available is small the genes        available are limited in scope and number Although many        companies offer a custom service for producing arrays the        process is expensive and cumbersome and does not lend        itself well to the commonly changing needs of the        researcher Most commercially available offtheshelf        arrays contain a cosmopolitan series of well characterized        genes expressed across many cell types As most researchers        focus on one or two tissues only this global approach to        array production is somewhat wasteful In many cases it        would be far more useful to report on the expression of        only those genes that are part of the transcriptome of the        tissue of interest Thus a group interested in the liver        may be better served by a chip containing only those genes        expressed in the liver and a group such as our own        interested in the testis should find more value in a        testis expression chip We are interested in the effects of        environmentally induced male infertility with a focus on        using components of the stress response as a means to        indicate qualitate or even quantitate the degree of        harmful exposure It may also be possible to use this gene        expression data to elucidate the mechanisms of action of        toxic agents and identify the causative agent thus        facilitating better preventive or palliative action The        development of an inhouse array is a complex process        however which must overcome a number of logistical        problems        We describe here our approach to developing a testis        expression array including the gene selection and printing        procedures We have assembled two lists of genes one of         mouse genes and one of  human genes that are        expressed in either mouse testis or human testis or both        These two distinct sets of testisexpressed genes        containing  homologs have enabled us to focus our        resources more efficiently and begin to develop a picture        of gene expression patterns in environmentally and        genetically challenged mouse models It is anticipated that        the production of human testis expression arrays will        follow thus permitting the direct comparison of gene        expression networks in mouse models and human clinical        samples This may aid in the elucidation of the molecular        mechanisms underlying genetically and environmentally        induced male infertility                    Results and discussion                  Availability of a publicly accessible clone          Although suppliers such as Clontech IGI and the IMAGE          consortium   provide public access to a vast number          of fulllength and partial clones from a number of          species not all genes are represented by a publicly          accessible clone of the gene or gene fragment This          problem is most often encountered when newly discovered          or characterized genes have been selected from the          literature                          Availability of a sequenceverified clone          It is important to select sequenceverified clones          where possible to ensure that correct sequences are          obtained For example clones provided by IMAGE by far          the largest selection of publicly available clones can          be mislabeled between  and                             end clones          When the choice is available with UniGene database            verification selection of a end clone is          desirable as the inclusion of the  UTR will in most          cases enhance the specificity of the gene fragment for          its gene in the hybridization process                          Length of clone          Selected clones should be checked to confirm that they          are not so small that they allow a high degree of          nonspecific hybridization and not so long as to          introduce concerns about being able to amplify the insert          by PCR for printing on the array Gene fragments in the          range of  base pairs bp are optimal          It should also be recognized that IMAGE and other          clones are frequently reassigned to different gene          clusters in the UniGene database and that UniGene          numbers and the genesclones they represent can be          removed at any point as new information becomes          available Consequently the tracking and naming of          clones is of central importance in projects such as this          and gene lists should be constructed to provide as much          detail as possible Thus it is prudent to include for          each gene such details as the UniGene number and note          the build from which it was taken the IMAGE or other          clone number the GenBank accession number   the          SwissProt number   the source of selection which          may be of value if questions subsequently arise          concerning specific clones          Selected details UniGene number IMAGE number and          gene name of the final gene lists for our mouse and          human DNA arrays are shown in Tables  and           respectively available with the complete version of this          article online The  homologous clones are shown in          Table  available with the complete version of this          article online More detailed lists have been posted on          the US Environmental Protection Agency MicroArray          Consortium EPAMAC website   where they are freely          accessible as a public resource          Assembling the list of genes to be included in a          tissuespecific array is perhaps the most challenging          part of the process The subsequent acquisition of clones          can be as simple as ordering the entire set from a sole          supplier In this case the assembly of the gene list          will be limited by the suppliers library However          distributors of IMAGE clones clearly have a very large          selection and are continuously sequenceverifying and          purging this vast resource of phage contamination          Proprietary clones are also available from companies such          as Clontech and IGI Although these tend to be a little          more costly than IMAGE clones they include genes that          are not available through IMAGE          To prepare DNA arrays clones of the genes to be          printed are grown the plasmids containing the gene          fragments isolated and the gene fragments amplified          using PCR see   for detailed protocols This can be          done inhouse or as in this case provided as a contract          service by the clone supplier In preparing PCR products          of a clone set for printing it is prudent to note that          clone growth may not occur in some cases Six of our           requested clones  were scored as no grows          However spots representing two of these clones produced          positive results in our TestisFilter hybridizations This          suggests that in these cases limited bacterial growth          did actually occur permitting the isolation of small          amounts of plasmid and subsequent production of small          amounts of PCR product whose levels were below the          detection limit of the gels used to check them          Hybridization signals from such spots should be treated          with caution as it is not known whether enough PCR          product was deposited onto the membrane to be in excess          of the target cDNA in the test sample In addition PCR          amplification of IMAGE and other clones can be expected          to fail at a small rate Of the  original          amplifications carried out by RGI   did fail          and had to be repeated under more carefully controlled          conditions to obtain product Furthermore a small number          of PCR products can be expected to produce multiple bands          or smearing Such results are most likely the result of          mispriming events in the PCR reaction although it is          possible that the original stocks may be contaminated          with one or more additional clones In fact we observed          that   of our PCR products contained a double          PCR band   contained a triple band            contained a quadruple band and            produced a smear Despite these anomalous amplifications          we printed from all wells without reracking to eliminate          the anomalous PCR products Although this saved time and          resources the caveat is that significant results from          all subsequent array hybridizations must be checked          against this list of potentially spurious clones If          hybridizations with the spots containing multipleband          PCR products repeatedly give statistically significant          changes it should be possible to isolate and sequence          the different PCR products and use this information for          confirmatory analysis perhaps using reverse          transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR          Genes from the mouse testisexpressed gene list were          procured as both clones and PCR products from a single          supplier RGI Five additional reactions were added from          PCR amplifications of heatshock protein clones available          in our laboratory This final set of PCR products was          prepared for printing PCR products were then printed as          filter arrays by a contractor Radius Biosciences          Relatively small amounts of DNA were required to produce          multiple arrays We obtained  arrays with each spot          printed in duplicate from approximately  g of PCR          product resuspended in  l x SSC          Preliminary hybridizations were carried out on the          arrays with adult mouse testicular RNA from CBL mice          Figure ab Bromochloroacetic acid BCA           mgkgday or water was administered daily by gavage for           days RNA extracted from these testes and hybridized          against the TestisFilters produced measurable signal in          the duplicate spots of virtually all the arrayed genes          confirming the expression of the genes we selected At          the time of writing there were a small number of genes           that did not appear to be expressed in the testis of          either this BCA model or a second metallothionein          knockout SvPCJ background   model which was          also investigated Four of these genes were no grows          The other ten may have represented genes that were not          expressed in the two models we tested although they          could also represent clones that had been          UniGeneclustered with the wrong gene As described          earlier the selection of some of the genes on this mouse          testis array was based on results with human expression          arrays showing that our crossspecies approach to gene          selection is a viable means of identifying candidate          genes for such tissuespecific arrays          We also produced slidebased DNA arrays of our          testisexpressed clone set at the Center for Molecular          Medicine and Genetics Wayne State University Detroit          MI A picture of one such array stained with POPO          iodide Molecular Probes is shown in Figure           Experimental samples had not been applied to this array          at the time of writing but the POPO stain clearly          shows the quality of printing and the configuration of          the subgrid of spots within the array The TestisSlides          were printed on barcoded slides the numbers being          visible to both the naked eye and in the          fluorescencescanned image The use of such slides is          highly recommended as it ensures that hybridizations          with different RNA populations can be identified quickly          and linked unambiguously to subsequent image and data          analysis          Data acquisition from both the TestisFilter and          TestisSlide requires that the identity of the cDNA spots          be related to their respective positions on filter or          glass slide This information can be embedded in          appropriate Excel spreadsheets For the TestisFilters we          are currently testing two approaches for acquiring          intensify values from digital phosphorimages of the          hybridized arrays In the first approach we designed          templates matching the arrangement of cDNA spots on the          filters using ImageQuant for Macintosh Molecular          Dynamics These templates were used for volume          integration as a measure of signal intensify Our second          approach utilizes Phoretix Array v software Nonlinear          USA to automatically generate an acquisition template          and perform volume integrations for the cDNA spots Both          these software packages accommodate background          determination and subtraction and the Nonlinear software          also supports data normalization TestisSlides are being          imaged using a ScanArray  confocal laser scanner          Packard Biochip Technologies and data acquisition          accomplished using QuantArray software from the same          vendor          Although it is widely acknowledged that DNA arrays are          most powerful when they contain as many different gene          probes as possible the cost of purchasing or producing          such large arrays is prohibitive for most researchers          Thus the primary advantage of developing a relatively          small tissuespecific array is its economy whereby the          researcher is not obliged to obtain prefabricated arrays          or libraries containing genes that are uninformative for          their favorite tissue andor genomic interests Another          advantage is that the clone set is also retained by the          researcher and can be reused at will to prepare nucleic          acid for further array printing New clones can also be          added to the set as they become available Such a set          also allows the researcher to be more or less focused in          their choice of genes for expression analysis permitting          use of the full set or subsets This approach enables the          researcher to select genes that are of specific probable          or possible interest in a particular context and thus to          tailor the final array exclusively to the models of          interest For example the researcher may wish to examine          the effects of a chemical treatment on a particular gene          pathway for example glycolysis or family of genes for          example heatshock proteins cytochrome Ps in a          particular tissue Relatively small targeted arrays can          be used in this context to provide a focused platform to          generate leads for the new kind of datadriven research          that is gradually supplanting hypothesisdriven          experimentation in genomics          Despite these advantages it should nevertheless be          recognized that like commercially available arrays the          final list of genes selected for this array is arbitrary          in that they were selected on the basis of the somewhat          restrictive combination of individual judgment and the          limited availability of sequenceverified clones and          therefore may not reflect           a priori the most versatile or          optimal set of genes for such an array For example at          the time of purchase we were unable to acquire          sequenceverified IMAGE clones of           Prm Dmc Msh and a number of          important cyclins all of which have key roles in          testicular function Fortunately the number of available          sequenceverified IMAGE clones is increasing daily as is          the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying cell          function Thus arrays developed in future will benefit          from this increased resource and knowledge base and will          therefore be less arbitrary than current versions          permitting an even more efficient use of resources          In an ideal situation one would perhaps like to array          whole tissue transcriptomes so that all possible          transcription profiles can be accounted for It should be          noted however that a complete normal adult mouse          testis transcriptome or that of any other tissue or          organ will be extremely difficult to assemble given          that expression differences undoubtedly exist between          strains and even between individuals of the same inbred          strain Migrating cells such as immune cells can also          complicate the issue Completion of the sequencing of          mouse and other laboratory animal genomes will facilitate          the production of more directed arrays but until the          full transcriptional and posttranscriptional that is          alternative splicing repertoire of every cell type in          every condition in every strain at every age is mapped          out developing a fully representative array is          unrealistic Nevertheless we have described the first          steps and the caveats to consider for those wishing to          begin developing the kind of tissue or cellspecific          arrays that will we believe be used with increasing          frequency by the array community                            Materials and methods                  Obtaining a mouse testis transcriptome                      Animals            Male CBL mice were obtained from Charles River            Breeding Laboratories at  weeks old and maintained in            a temperature and humiditycontrolled room on a  h            lightdark cycle The animals were housed singly in            polycarbonate cages with pine shavings bedding and free            access to food and water                                Heatshock treatment            At  weeks of age two animals were sedated by an            intraperitoneal injection of  l per  g body            weight of  ketamine Fort Dodge Laboratories in            phosphatebuffered saline pH  The lower half of            the torso of each animal was submerged in a C water            bath for  min after which the animals were dried off            and returned to their cages The testes from these            animals were harvested  h later The testes of two            untreated adult male CBL mice were harvested            concurrently                                Arrays            Total RNA was extracted individually from the testes            of the four mice using two extractions through Tri            Reagent Sigma The control and heatshocked total RNA            samples were then pooled and passed twice through the            Oligotex mRNA Purification System Qiagen to produce            polyA RNA One microgram each of normal and            heatshocked testicular polyA RNA was submitted to            Genome Systems now part of IGI for contract            hybridization against their mouse Gene Expression            Microarray I GEM    Hybridization of the            samples and analysis of the gene expression changes was            carried out by GSI staff and the data returned            electronically All named expressed genes were added to            the mouse testis transcriptome gene list The same RNA            samples were used to probe Atlas mouse cDNA expression            array  genes and StressTox array  genes            Clontech Laboratories Plabeled cDNAs were            produced from  g of each pooled RNA using the            reagents supplied with the membrane array kits            Hybridization to the membrane arrays was carried out            according to the manufacturers instructions The            control and heatshock RNA pools were each hybridized            against two different membranes of each membrane type            During exposures the arrays were kept moist with x            SSC saturated filter paper wrapped in plastic wrap            Images were developed using a Phosphorlmager Molecular            Dynamics Images were analyzed using Atlas Image v            Clontech Genes whose adjusted signal intensity            average intensity minus background were not at least            twice their respective background value on both            membranes were not considered genuine signals and            discarded as were those which were expressed on only            one membrane The remaining expressed genes were            added to the mouse testis transcriptome gene list                                Homolog search            In addition to the mouse array expression data a            search for mouse homologs of genes expressed in human            testes according to the Clontech and RGI arrays            which were not represented in the mouse arrays was            carried out using UniGene

           Homolog search            In addition to the human array expression data a            search for human homologs of genes expressed in mouse            testes according to the Clontech and IGI arrays and            the database search which were not represented in the            human arrays was carried out using UniGene andor            GeneCards Genes from successful searches were added to            the human testis transcriptome gene list                                Literature search for testicular transcriptome            genes            An extensive literature survey was conducted to find            human testisexpressed genes Genes that were not            already present in the human testis transcriptome gene            list were added                                Collaborator contributions for testicular            transcriptome genes            EPAMAC collaborators contributed the names of human            testisexpressed genes not present on the master            list                                    Assembly of a master mousehuman testis          transcriptome gene list          The mouse and human testis transcriptome gene lists          were brought together for comparison Paring of the lists          down to the final  genes was carried out sequentially          according to the following criteria all genes which did          not have a sequenceverified mouse IMAGE clone available          were removed assessed by checking against RGI inventory          of svIMAGE clones          All genes present in both lists were retained all          genes of specific interest to ourselves and our          collaborators were retained as were those with proven or          suspected toxicological relevance genes shown to be          expressed in the array experiments were selectively          retained over those obtained from the literature which          were in turn selectively retained over those obtained          from database searching which were in turn selectively          retained over those obtained from homolog searches          In this way we were able to produce two final master          lists of  testisexpressed genes for both human and          mouse all of which except five were obtainable from a          single source RGI                          Procurement of mouse clones and PCR products          Sequenceverified mouse IMAGE clones of the  genes          on the final testicular transcriptome gene list were          obtained from RGI along with PCR products of the same          genes containing  g DNA per gene Owing to undetected          IMAGE or Unigene number duplications on the submitted          list of  genes only  unique clones were received          PCR products of five heatshock proteins HSP          HSP HSP Hsc and HSCt were produced          inhouse and added to the library to produce a final          total of  unique gene PCR products                          Array printing          The PCR products were precipitated washed dried and          resuspended in  l x SSC in Vbottomed well          microtiter plates These samples were used by Radius          BioSciences to print   cm   cm filters Each gene          was printed in duplicate on each filter Slidebased          arrays were prepared by the array facility at the Center          for Molecular Medicine and Genetics Wayne State          University directly from the clone set Arrays were          printed using a Flexys robot Genomic Solutions on a             doublespotted grid with  m spacing between spots          Barcoded CMTGAPS gamma amino propyl silane coated          slides Corning were used                          Hybridization of TestisFilter with adult mouse          RNA          Eightweekold male CBL mice were dosed via gavage          with either water or  mgkg BCA for  days Four          hours after the final dose animals were sacrificed and          testes harvested Total RNA was extracted from half a          testis by homogenization in Tri Reagent Sigma and          treated with two units of DNase Ambion One microgram          of the total RNA from a single animal was primed with          oligo dT and incubated at C for  min followed by a          brief chill on ice Six microliters of x firststrand          buffer RGI  l  mM DTT  l dNTPs  mM           l reverse transcriptase Superscript II Gibco BRL           l  PdCTP ICN were then added to the primed RNA          Elongation was carried out at C for  min after          which  l water was added Unincorporated isotope was          separated using BioSpin columns BioRad Filters were          prehybridized in a solution containing  ml Microhyb          RGI  l mouse Cot DNA and  l polyA for  h at          C The probe was added and incubated overnight at          C Filters were washed twice with x SSC  SDS at          C for  min and once with x SSC  SDS at room          temperature for  min The filters were then exposed to          a Kodak phosphorimaging screen for three days and          visualized with a Molecular Imager FX BioRad                          Data acquisition from TestisFilter and          TestisSlide
