        thats thats a timely kind of a question isnt it     well it was yes what do you think about the uh former Soviet Union   i really dont think that i would consider them a threat any longer and i suppose thats primarily because their economy really wont allow them to uh expend a lot of resources on on war um if that were their primary concern   yeah   and itll be a while before theyre an economic threat for sure   it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isnt gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know   umhum umhum   but i think it would probably not be a a threat to the United States if that was the case but probably to Europe other other areas of Europe there   do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or   well thats what it seemed like even before they uh dissolved the Union was that it was becoming less and less of a of a threat to the United States uh more and more of an attempted   umhum umhum   uh you know relating on more or less normal bases   right   are you involved in   there thereve been such drastic changes in their political orientation that its hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years but certainly so far what weve seen is a turn around from where things were fifty years ago   oh thats right thats for sure are you involved in any kind of uh political analysis or anything   no no and yourself   no not really were involved in some of our company work in the Soviet Union in different places but not in   really   uh any area of uh endeavor that would be of any interest to you know militarily or anything like that   uhhuh  personal interests or business   uh linguistics primarily   uhhuh   and so its interesting to see uh how things are going there and and their the people that are there are facing the same kind of uh economic deprivation that uh you know the Russian citizens are but not it doesnt relate to much to the military uh situation   yes yes yeah their problems are definitely at this point economic it it seems that the whole infrastructure is focused on you know organizational um skimming off the top you know especially the government but um its gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that   yes   if you work harder you can also benefit personally and that   yeah i read an interesting an article in a recent uh Wall Street Journal uh interview with a family there and you know we think of uh how great it is to go to a you know free market uh sort of thing and and theyre saying facing uh something that most people are not even aware you know familiar with they wouldnt they dont know how to deal with it and uh how do you   umhum umhum   how do you compete when you youre whole you know life has been built on uh working for the state and everything you know things like that   and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so why spend the extra energy   yeah right you face the same uh uh bureaucratic uh headaches whether you work or dont work so and so now theyve you know so really it must be uh really traumatic time for the people as well as the uh   uhhuh yeah   lack of supplies or anything like that adjusting to the new way of thinking about things   i wonder too if their thinking hasnt been so influenced over the years that the Western way is bad that   umhum   it would its hard for them to look at some of the Western market place strategies as being good because theyve been   yeah right taught to understand thats right yeah     propagandized the other direction for so long   well perhaps the uh if we give aid of some sort you know maybe itll turn them around if its done done correctly you know economically   i think that theyre one economy that i feel that thats worth the investment you know there are some um places in the world where im not sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the kind of return that thats gonna benefit both parties but um it seems that theres such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the uh strategic assistance from other countries ill ill be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesnt seem as though thats forth coming right now um   sure   that   you mean in in our country or in   yeah i think well i was watching something the other day a news program that that indicated um the concern on Bushs part is that if he puts great interest in that area now hes gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength  so its a catch twenty two   sure yeah you cant thats right and well i hope you know just hope we dont wait too long and and uh you know
