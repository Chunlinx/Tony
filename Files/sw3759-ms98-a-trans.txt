                  did you hear the topic Carol   yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if theyre getting any better than they used to be   right   i havent had any real uh recent problems with that  ive been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video  camera from New York and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal   oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things ive purchased have been          you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted   uhhuh   you know for a good part   just  can you hold on just one sec   yes   i got a six year old thats  going out of  off of his mind  he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar   oh i think i think the only problem ive had in the last two or three years is i was i was in Germany a couple of years ago and        bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didnt receive everything but you know thats you sort of take that chance you buy something like that   uhhuh do you buy um do you buy much mail order   pardon me   do you buy much mail order   oh a little bit   uhhuh have you had any problems with that at all   no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when youre using youre the little small one that fit in your hands   oh uhhuh   i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item      oh yeah well some some places are good about sending them out by UPS or or other ways but       i think most of the time i uh maybe its just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and uh generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but uh maybe its the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i am saying   you bet yeah a lot of times ill do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and   uhhuh     two days after i bought them i picked them up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over   oh     he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference   uhhuh well at least theyre   which i thought was fair   trying to uh give you some kind of concession there   sure but overall i think im uh   im trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back i bought some clothing i dont know if you get these Lands End catalogs   no   they uh make mail order clothing and most of its very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years and um theyve been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it   right   and uh   any trouble getting it back   no theyre real good in fact ive had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year   sure   and the only reason i called them on it is because id had similar shirts that held up for several years       and uh they said uh regardless that youve you know worn it for a year or over a year well uh take it back and give you a new one   i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they dont have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything   huh yeah right   so youre just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didnt wear properly or it came apart or something   well i think thats uh thats really just good business you know   you bet   if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do youve got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back   you bet   you know thats like ive seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldnt take it back i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much   oh absolutely   you know   yeah mail mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk   oh yeah this theyre sporting arent they uhhuh   right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if youre dissatisfied with it in anyway and theyre very easy get along get along with and they dont mind taking something back   yeah uhhuh  you said youd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you boughten   i bought a Lincoln   oh   and uh up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit its been a very nice car about a ninety one its about a year old now   uhhuh uhhuh you havent had any problems with it though huh   no not really you know its like the old uh saying they dont build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars thats very true   uhhuh   but they dont build them like they used to but   whats your feeling about American versus foreign and
