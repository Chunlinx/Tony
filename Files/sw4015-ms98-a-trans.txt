        im Bridget   im Melissa Melissa Brigette Moore   yes what are you doing   nothing   im just sitting here trying to eat bread before i go to a meeting   are you in Dallas or Lubbock   no im in Lubbock   oh are you   yeah what are you doing are you at the office   how funny  huh   where are you   im at home   are you   yeah   cool       i know like listen to us were like trying to volunteer       okay are you ready for me to push one   yeah   do we know what were going to say   about crime   yeah okay ill push one   okay     okay so what do you think about crime in the big D   well im worried about my car  because i just got a new car and   are you   so im worried about it getting stolen or anything happening to it at all   umhum   so   i dont know i think in Dallas its a lot more scary just because its a big city i mean in Lubbock and stuff i know lots of people that dont lock their doors or you know leave their windows open at night because its so much smaller i mean it feels safer   yeah yeah   and i know that it happens here but its not near like it is in Dallas   yeah   people are more trustworthy i think   yeah   people have reason to be i guess   i dont know i dont it doesnt matter where i go i lock my doors   yeah   so   i know lots of people thatll leave their doors open you know if you have to go get something like get a book or something from their house you can just walk right in       theyre always unlocked or something and   gee i dont think id ever do that if i wasnt at home   i mean see i know and therere only like certain you know neighborhoods up in Lubbock that are that you wouldnt leave your doors unlocked you know   yeah   but besides that i dont know its fairly safe i think   God even up in like Highland Park i dont even think id leave it open seems like thatd where theyd really go for the big houses   really yeah yeah   hum   Dallas can be pretty bad though   yeah   i think it depend on the city really   yeah   i dont know though because i think that way of Lubbock and then uh like i was talking to this girl that lives way out in the country and she was saying how bad it is out there and i would think it would be less   uhhuh yeah   i would thinking it wouldnt be as bad   yeah i guess it just depends because therere certain part of the cities too theres no way i would ever i wouldnt even leave my car alone in south Dallas   see i know i know thats scary       um   i dont know though but i still think like out in the country when she said that i was like what   yeah   i was like no way and she goes yeah she goes you know people get broken into a lot because they you know its real easy to get away with there you know no one can see them carrying out the stuff if no one lives nearby   yeah   i was like well thats true but besides that i dont know and i think its just getting worse   yeah thats what scares me about living out in uh like off in the country i used to live out in the country   uhhuh   and that kind of scares me because i think you know you always hear about all those murders and its weird to think about but it happens  and thats the scary part   i know see i know   and i dont like living out in the country i like living in the city where im close to there might be more crime or as they say but it just makes me feel safer because im around someone   yeah thats true because you have neighbors and stuff at least you know   yeah if i scream someones going to hear me   i know someones got to   yeah   i know thats scary though   yeah   and it just keeps rising   yeah   i mean i cant imagine i dont know whats after ive been here so long its like i well youd have to pay me to move back to Dallas   yeah   i mean i dont like now now that im away from it and i can look back at how you know Dallas is and stuff yeah i dont like it   yeah   i dont like it at all really       i dont know i think itd depend on   hum   i dont know where you live i know thats not right though i think that but i dont think thats really   yeah i dont know i guess im sure there is a bunch of thieving of thieving going on in Lubbock its just not around you or not that you know of   yeah yeah   because i dont know i mean uh a couple of summers ago the people behind us got robbed and you know we were everybody was looking out but ever since like a week after that nobody just even paid any attention any more   really see thats sad i would think like car theft is a really big thing   yeah yeah yeah   wouldnt you   yeah   i think that or   especially here where we have so many cars   i know i know   everybody in New York takes a cab and weve all got cars   see i know i dont know because thats i think car i dont know if that is though thats what that d be my guess car theft for sure   yeah   because i dont burgalies burgurlaries i cant say that burgalies i dont know i dont know if thered be that       i dont know besides people that would be just have like kids that come in and burglarize and take like TVs and stuff that they could sell real easy whereas someone like cleaning you out you know   yeah   i guess that would depend on it too   yeah a friend of mines house he was gone all summer but he has a house here by himself   uhhuh   and um his own friends got in and robbed him   no way   yeah he has this he has this like gorgeous bedroom set and thats the   oh my gosh
