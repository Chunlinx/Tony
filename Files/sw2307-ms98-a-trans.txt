        okay well now im from Dallas   oh okay   well actually im living in Dallas im not from Dallas i uh was living in West Texas before this uh which is a very dry arid   uhhuh okay   well obviously its kind of a desert area   right getting uh close to Mexico or   umhum real close New Mexico anyway   all right and no and not the humidity i usually think of the South as being very humid   well he Dallas is and thats since ive moved up here now so im starting to get a little bit of this but   Dallas is   ill tell you uh considering well okay ive uh mostly throughout my life ive lived in in the smaller parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic   uhhuh   um the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had standard standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before   i see oh oh  you have to get used to hills   right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter   yeah oh thats good   i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldnt have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me   oh thats good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now   oh well today it was probably in the eighties um well yeah weve had uh weve had several days in the eighties in fact ill tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didnt do it   oh thats pretty warm already oh is that right   i didnt do it but i came close   actually last year uh um about a week ago at the same time last   umhum   last year um we had hit the actually uh nineties for about four days which is very unusual for this area at this time of year um what were having right now is a lot of overcast   i would imagine yes umhum   you know a lot of days with uh drizzle or uh actually weve had a thunderstorm But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds here and its a very windy month   right   um but right now were in about the sixties which is is fairly comfortable   umhum well i heard the uh that um Washington DC has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so   yes we do they peak on Friday so if you have a chance to be here Friday or somewhere somewhere around there that thats the best time to see them and they dont last too long you know   so thats hum well yeah thats i heard that   yeah and uh then after after this month itll quickly get get hot you know i mean March April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh   umhum   by May were hitting in the eighties sometimes even low low nineties uh but we dont really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months   umhum well thats thats sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little earlier and end a little later but uh   yeah right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the trees are   yeah theyve been theyve actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um   umhum   you know in fact its kind of funny uh you know youre watching the newscast i dont know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you whats all in the air you know the fungus and the trees yeah well   yeah oh right air quality index yeah   but mostly its you know allergy type index and its been like like i said about four weeks now that uh theyve had um multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so thats a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that   oh right is that like a pollen sort of a pollen count yeah yeah well were just starting now like i said the cherry blossoms are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so were probably a few weeks behind   pollen count yeah exactly umhum   uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh   umhum   that lasts everythings in bloom you know everythings green here till about October and then we lose it all   yeah   but uh i always wondered about the South i figured that there couldnt be too many months that that trees were were bare because its its hot most of the time   well its its um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited   umhum   winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter   yeah umhum umhum   and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you know when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there   i see oh okay here its sixties and were celebrating okay so theres thats the difference i remember being in Louisiana a few times and and it was uh   yeah yeah that umhum   i think it was in December one time and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked to see people all bundled up with scarves and hats as though  it were you know in the twenties because here in the fifties people have sweaters so you know i guess its what you become acclimated  to yes     umhum oh yes its a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses   umhum   to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean hes the only person i know   right   that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know its still not cold cold here compared to what hes used to so   yeah yeah yes right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here im im uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i dont know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to what you enjoy thats right   umhum well i think thats true yeah although theres you know theres you dont ever want to get too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where its desert and theres not a lot of trees and thats the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated   umhum right   seeing you know no trees i mean its just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles   yeah i can understand that sure yeah i mean no i wouldnt want to i wouldnt want to uh go to a desert type of area either you know you get once youre in greenery you get spoiled by that you know   well now thats thats not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that cant stand it here   no oh is that right   they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so its got to be somewhat true i mean   ah thats interesting umhum yeah yeah so i guess that once theyre used to the wide open spaces huh that that yeah that thats interesting so   exactly yeah i see i wouldnt have thought from the beginning but ive talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess   yeah i think ill take the area with trees huh yeah yeah   hum i agree i agree of course i wouldnt mind having an area with ocean but we wont get involved in that either   right  why am i too nice yeah that is pretty good oh but anyway well i thats thats about all you know i have right here on on this area so   yeah yeah that sounds good umhum okay well   okay well nice talking to you alright well bye bye   it was yeah nice talking to you too byebye
