                                  Capital Control Freaks            I didnt want to go to Malaysia The Malaysiangovernment would surely expect me to deliver a stronger endorsement of itsheterodox economic program than I was prepared to offer And of course itwould try to use me politicallyto provide a veneer of respectability to aregime that has lately developed the habit of putting inconvenient people injail But sometimes an economist has to do what an economist has to do Since Ihad been the only highprofile economist to advocate the economic heresy thatMalaysia had put into practice sooner or later I would have to face the musicAnd so last month I agreed to spend a dayincluding a minute dialoguewith the prime ministerat the Palace of the Golden Horses a vaguely LasVegasstyle resort outside Kuala Lumpur            Some background hereMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been the wild man of the Asiancrisis blaming all his problems on manipulations by Jewish speculatorsdenouncing the prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund as part of aWestern conspiracy to recolonize Asia and so on In the early days of thecrisis his position seemed absurd and it was easy to make fun of himwhich Idid right in                   Slate                But eventually it stopped being so easy todismiss Mahathirs views For one thing the crisis turned out to be worse thananyone had imagined possible and anyone with an open mind began to suspectthat the IMFs initial policies had been misconceived For another while thevast conspiracy Mahathir envisaged was a figment of his imagination I know thesupposed conspirators and they arent that smart a few hedge funds reallydid engage in concerted manipulation of Hong Kongs markets in the summer of Mahathir still has a distorted view of the way the world worksmore onthat belowbut then so do the freecapitalmarket faithful            Where do I fit in In the summer of  I began toreconsider my own views about the crisis The scope of global contagiontherapid spread of the crisis to countries with no real economic links to theoriginal victimconvinced me that IMF critics such as Jeffrey Sachs were rightin insisting that this was less a matter of economic fundamentals than it was acase of selffulfilling prophecy of market panic that by causing a collapseof the real economy ends up validating itself But I also concluded that thethreat of further capital flight would prevent Asian economies from simplyreflating that is increasing public spending and cutting interest rates toget their economies growing again And so I found myself advocating temporaryrestrictions on the ability of investors to pull money out of crisiseconomiesa curfew if you like on capital flightas part of a recoverystrategy            Now it turned out thatjust at the time that I went public with those views Mahathir and his adviserswere secretly working out a plan to impose capital controls as part of arecovery strategy According to what I have been told my own public statementplayed a small role in the final decision essentially some of Mahathirsadvisers were worried by the absence of any support for such controls amongmainstream economists but the appearance of my August manifesto inFortune silenced the doubters Almost surely Malaysia would have goneahead with the plan anyway but I had inadvertently found myself one of thefew outsiders to express any kind of support I quickly put out an open letterto Mahathir warning that the controls should not be abused used as a cover for but I know from friends in Washington that people started referring to theKrugmanMahathir strategy of recovery via capital controls And so I reallycould not avoid going to Malaysia to discuss those controls a year after theyhad been imposed            I  arrived at a moment of celebration When the controlswere put on many Western analysts predicted disaster a collapse of theeconomy hyperinflation rampant black markets It didnt happen Two daysbefore I arrived the latest statistics had confirmed that Malaysia was in factexperiencing a fairly strong economic recovery The actual implementation ofthe controls had been careful and selective and important economicreformssuch as strengthening the banking systemhad if anythingaccelerated after the new policy was introduced A few days after my visitrestrictions on removing money from the country were eased and hardly any moneywas pulled out So I guess the Malaysians expected me to join them in a mutualadmiration society Surely they were disappointed when I expressed someskepticism about the payoff from the controls            But the truth is thatwhile Malaysias recovery has proved the hysterical opponents of capitalcontrols wrong it has not exactly proved the proponents right For there is arecovery in progress throughout Asia South Korea which did not imposecontrols though it did get an early and crucial rescheduling of its foreigndebt has bounced back with stunning speed Thailand is growing too evenIndonesia has bottomed out In general the market panic of  was itturns out coming to an end just about the time that Malaysia decided to makeits big break with orthodoxy You can argue that the controls may have allowedMalaysia to recover faster with less social cost than it would haveotherwise But the vindication that Mahathir probably imagined for himselfatriumphant recovery in Malaysia while its more orthodox neighbors continued tolanguishhasnt quite played out            What then are the lessons of Malaysias recovery In ourstaged dialoguewhich was played out in semipublic in front of adisturbingly obsequious audience of a hundred or so businessmenMahathircontinued to sound a minorkey version of the conspiracy theme insisting thatcapital controls were necessary to protect small countries against the evildesigns of big speculators Thats an unfortunate emphasis While there are bigspeculators and they do sometimes make plays against vulnerable economiesthey are not the main reason that controls sometimes make sense In generalcontrols should be imposed to prevent panic rather than conspiracy and theinvestors who panic are if anything more likely to be respectable bankers andwealthy domestic residents than nefarious rootless cosmopolitans Indeed eventhe occasional market manipulation by big speculators wouldnt be possible ifit werent for the possibility of generating a panic among other investors itis a familiar point in the academic literature that Hong Kongtype speculativeplays can work only if the economy is vulnerable to selffulfilling crisis inthe first place And the emphasis on big foreign speculators may encourageMalaysia to control too much for too long Panic is a sometime thing but hedgefunds ye will always have with you            Nonetheless Malaysia hasproved a pointnamely that controlling capital in a crisis is at leastfeasible Until the Malaysian experiment the prevailing view among pundits wasthat even if financial crises were driven by selfjustifying panic there wasnothing governments could do to curb that panic except to reschedule bankdebtspart but only part of the pool of potential flight capitalandotherwise try to restore confidence by making a conspicuous display of virtuewere the watchwords The alternativepreventing capital flight directly andthereby gaining a breathing spacewas supposed to be completely impossiblewith any attempt a sure recipe for disaster Now we know better Capitalcontrols are not necessarily the answer for every country that experiences afinancial crisis sometimes confidence can be restored without the need forcoercive measures and even when calming words fail burden sharing by banksand other lenders will often be enough But it would now be foolish to rule outcontrols as a measure of last resort            Mahathir can therefore claim a partial vindication for hiseconomic heresies That is not a political endorsement Some rightwingers haveclaimed that anyone with a good word for Malaysian capital controls me inparticular is also in effect an accomplice in the imprisonment on whatcertainly sound like trumpedup charges of Mahathirs former heir apparentAnwar Ibrahiman advocate of more conventional policies Well I stillremember the days when leftwingers used to claim that anyone with a good wordfor Chiles freemarket reforms had bloodstained hands because he was ineffect endorsing Gen Augusto Pinochet The point is that economics is not amorality play Sometimes bad men make good policies and vice versa And thejob of economic analysts is or ought to be to assess the policies withoutregard to who makes them            The objective fact is that whatever you think ofMahathir Malaysia has gotten away with its economic apostasy You can questionwhether that apostasy was necessary but you cannot claim that it has been adisasterand you cannot disguise the fact that those who predicted disasterwere letting politics and ideology cloud their judgment
