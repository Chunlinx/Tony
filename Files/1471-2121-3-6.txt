                    Background        Differentiation is commonly associated with intermingled        changes in gene expression and cellular proliferation In        some differentiating cell types changes in both gene        transcription and proliferation are regulated by the same        transcription factor             CCAATEnhancer        Binding Protein alpha CEBP is a transcription factor        that is required for the differentiation of a number of        tissues             Mice homozygous        for CEBP null alleles have severe defects in tissues        involved in metabolic homeostasis       Cellular        proliferation is elevated in the liver of these knockout        mice    suggesting that CEBP blocks proliferation         in vivo In cultured cells CEBP        expression leads to decreased colony formation upon        antibiotic selection       decreased DNA synthesis               and an enhanced proportion of cells in        the G phase of the cell cycle     Thus CEBP        regulates cellular proliferation as well as gene        transcription        CEBP contains a bZIP domain conserved at the carboxy        terminus of a number of transcription factors             The bZIP domain consists of a basic region that binds        directly to DNA followed immediately by a leucine zipper        CEBP dimerizes via the leucine zipper This dimerization        is required for DNA binding      At least three        transcription activation functions have been described in        the more amino terminal regions of CEBP              CEBP domains and activities associated with proliferation        arrest also have been identified but vary considerably        between studies                 CEBP binds to and activates transcription of the gene        promoter for the p inhibitor of cyclindependent kinase        CDK     This led to speculation that p gene        activation may contribute to cell cycle arrest by CEBP            Similarly suppression of mitotic growth during        adipocyte differentiation was associated with CEBP        activation of the promoters of gadd growth arrest and        DNA damageinducible gene  gas and gas growth        arrestassociated genes  and         However        CEBP mutants defective in DNA binding still blocked        proliferation      This suggested that direct        promoter activation was unnecessary or redundant for        CEBP proliferation arrest            Possible mechanisms of transcriptionindependent        proliferation arrest by CEBP have been suggested by a        number of studies Decreased proliferation was associated        with CEBP stabilization of the p protein             p interacted directly with a large internal segment of        CEBP that included transcription activation domain            see Fig A CDK and CDK also interacted with        segments of CEBP close to and within transcription        activation domain      CDK also interacted with the        basic region of the CEBP     p also has a second        interaction site within the leucine zipper of CEBP                    in vitro CEBP enhanced p        inhibition of CDK activity CEBP inhibition of CDK        activity correlated with p binding to CEBP        transcription activation domain      However        proliferation arrest by CEBP still occurred in cell lines        not containing p genes     This indicated that        proliferation arrest by CEBP did not rely solely upon        CEBP enhancement of CDK inhibition by p        Another mechanism reported for proliferation blockage by        CEBP involves the EFDP transcription complexes EF        complexes activate genes required for entry into S phase        CEBP binds to and inhibits transcriptional activation by        EF      The complex of EF with the        retinoblastomarelated p protein is prevalent in cycling        cells Transcription activation domain  of CEBP was        observed to interact specifically with p to disrupt        pEF complex formation      Disruption of EF        activity also was associated the basic domain of CEBP                    Thus a variety of interactions and mechanisms are        potentially involved in proliferation arrest by CEBP        This variability may indicate divergent mechanisms for the        block of proliferation by CEBP in different study        conditions andor cell types In pituitary cells CEBP is        part of a multisubunit complex     that activates        the growth hormone    and prolactin            promoters Fulllength CEBP is absent from the pituitary        progenitor GHFT cell line     in which ectopically        expressed CEBP activates cotransfected growth hormone        and prolactin promoters       We show here that        ectopically expressed CEBP prolongs GHFT cells in the        G and S phases of the cell cycle in a        transcriptionindependent fashion Different CEBP domains        were required for G and Sphase arrest CEBP domains        previously described for the interaction with p were not        required for arrest in GHFT cells Rather domains        previously implicated in the regulation of the EF and CDK        pathways by CEBP were required for arrest of these        progenitor cells                    Results                  Transcriptionally active and inactive GFP fusions          with CEBP          The domains of CEBP and their known interactions          with cellcycle proteins are summarized in figure A We          conducted studies to determine which if any of those          activities affect the proliferation of GHFT pituitary          progenitor cells In prior studies we noticed that fewer          cells were present in GHFT cell cultures transfected          with the CEBP expression vector than in cultures          transfected with control vectors X Wang F S          unpublished data The decreased cell number might be due          to impaired proliferation of GHFT cells expressing          CEBP To examine if CEBP affected the progression of          GHFT cells through the cell cycle we needed to          distinguish transfected cells that expressed CEBP from          those that did not We fused the cDNA for the green          fluorescence protein GFP to either the  GFPCEBP          or the  CEBPGFP end of the coding sequence of the          CEBP cDNA The cDNAs for the GFPCEBP and CEBPGFP          fusion proteins were inserted into an expression vector          and transfected into GHFT cells Flow cytometry was          used to specifically identify green fluorescent          CEBPexpressing cells          We initially characterized the abilities of the          CEBPGFP and GFPCEBP fusion proteins to bind DNA and          activate transcription in GHFT cells Fig  The          CEBPGFP or GFPCEBP expression vectors were          transfected into GHFT cells with a promoter consisting          of a single CEBP binding site upstream of the growth          hormone TATA box This minimal promoter was specifically          responsive to CEBP expression in GHFT cells               Cells transfected with the CEBPGFP expression          vector showed a statistically significant p n              fold higher promoter activity than did          cells shamtransfected with the same expression vector          deleted of the CEBP cDNA Fig A In contrast          activation by GFPCEBP was a statistically          insignificant   fold Fig A Promoter          activation by CEBPGFP was reproducibly less than          promoter activation by unfused CEBP Western blots of          nuclear extracts from the transfected cells showed that          unfused CEBP was expressed at marginally higher levels          Fig B          CEBPGFP and GFPCEBP both were expressed as          intact fulllength proteins of the appropriate molecular          weight    Fig B arrow In addition both          CEBPGFP and GFPCEBP bound similarly to DNA Fig          C Extracts of cells expressing either CEBPGFP or          GFPCEBP shifted the electrophoretic mobility of a          radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a CEBP binding          site Fig C No shift was observed with          shamtransfected cells not shown The shifted bands          were specifically competed by a fold molar excess of          the cold oligonucleotide and were supershifted with an          antibody directed against CEBP GFPCEBP truncated of          its leucine zipper Fig B was ineffective at shifting          the binding site Fig C LZ Flow cytometry          discussed later showed that comparable levels of green          fluorescence were emitted from cells expressing          CEBPGFP GFPCEBP and LZ Thus CEBPGFP and          GFPCEBP were expressed and could bind to CEBP          binding sites in DNA but differed in their ability to          activate gene transcription                          Cell cycle distribution of GHFT cells          Transcriptionally active CEBPGFP and          transcriptionally inactive GFPCEBP were compared for          their effects on proliferation of GHFT cells We first          determined the distribution of untransfected GHFT          cells in each phase of the cell cycle GHFT cells were          grown to subconfluence collected and the DNA within the          cells was stained with propidium iodide The DNA content          within each cell was quantified by flow cytometry as the          amount of orange fluorescence from the propidium          iodidestained DNA see Materials and Methods for          details The fluorescence intensity measured from each          cell falls into one of three populations cells centered          around the lowest level of orange fluorescence cells          centered around the highest level of orange fluorescence          which is twice that of the lowest and cells with          intermediate levels of orange fluorescence This          corresponds respectively to cells containing a n DNA          complement prior to duplication of the genome in G          phase cells containing a n DNA complement following          genome duplication in growth phase  or in mitosis          GM and cells containing a partially replicated genome          intermediate between n and n in S phase As averaged          from nine independent experiments the proportion of          growing GHFT cells in G S and GM corresponded to            and  respectively Fig  white bars          We next synchronized GHFT cells in particular          stages of the cell cycle GHFT cells were treated for           hours with nocodazole which prevents microtubule          polymerizationdepolymerization and exit from M phase              The delivery vehicle DMSO was added to parallel          cell cultures Cells also were treated with mimosine in          DMSO which blocks cells in late G immediately before          entry into S phase     Mimosine also prolongs some          cell types in the S phase itself     GHFT cells          grow with an average doubling time of approximately  to           hours  hours of treatment allowed most cells to          pass through one cell cycle and to accumulate as n cells          upon nocodazole treatment Fig  light gray bars or as          n cells at the GS boundary upon mimosine treatment          Fig  stippled gray bars Thus GHFT cells can be          synchronized at particular stages of the cell cycle          Synchronization facilitated characterization of the cell          cycle stages blocked or prolonged by CEBP          expression                          Transcriptionally active and inactive CEBP both          retain GHFT cells in the G and S phases of the cell          cycle          We determined if either CEBPGFP or GFPCEBP          altered the distribution of GHFT cells in the G S or          GM phases of the cell cycle GHFT cells were          transfected with the expression vectors for CEBPGFP or          GFPCEBP or with the sham expression vector not          containing the CEBP cDNA The cells were incubated for          one day to allow time for CEBP expression Cells were          then synchronized in Mphase or in GS by hour          incubations with nocodazole Fig A or mimosine Fig          B Cells were collected and stained with propidium          iodide Flow cytometry was used to measure DNA content in           cells transfected with the sham expression vector          Fig  Sham  green fluorescent cells expressing          GFPtagged CEBP Fig  CEBPGFP or GFPCEBP or           the subpopulation of cells from the CEBPGFP or          GFPCEBP transfections that did not express measurable          amounts of green fluorescent CEBP Fig  No CEBP          The No CEBP cells represent an internal control for          cells not expressing CEBP collected simultaneously with          cells expressing CEBP The No CEBP controls also          indicated the extent to which green fluorescent          CEBPexpressing cells were distinguished from          nonexpressing cells by flow cytometry For all our          experiments the distribution of cells in the G S and          GM phases was similar for the No CEBP  and          shamtransfected cells          The expression of CEBPGFP or GFPCEBP resulted in          a statistically significant decrease in the amount of          cells blocked in GM upon nocodazole treatment compared          to shamtransfected cells Fig A p   n            This indicated that CEBP expression prevented a          significant proportion of GHFT cells from reaching          GM to be blocked by nocodazole When cells were blocked          in G by mimosine treatment CEBP expression caused no          decrease in the proportion of cells in GM Fig B          This demonstrated that CEBP expression did not actively          decrease the proportion of cells in GM          The CEBPinduced reduction in cells blocked in GM          was associated with a highly statistically significant          increase in the proportion of GHFT pituitary          progenitor cells in G p   and a statistically          significant increase in the proportion of cells in S          phase p   Fig A This retention of GHFT          cells in the G and S phases of the cell cycle occurred          for both the transcriptionally active CEBPGFP and          inactive GFPCEBP fusions The independence of          CEBPinduced proliferation arrest from CEBPregulated          transcriptional activation also has been observed in          other studies      Thus simple transcription          activation mechanisms do not account for the effect of          CEBP on the cell cycle                          Targeting of CEBP to the presumed centromeric          GS checkpoint is insufficient for prolongation of          G          Our prior fluorescence microscopy studies showed that          CEBPGFP GFPCEBP and antibodystained CEBP               concentrated at specific intranuclear domains in          GHFT cells see Fig A GFPCEBP These domains          coincide with regions that stain with the blue          fluorescent DNAbinding dye Hoechst  Fig A          Hoechst  Hoechst  stains ATrich DNA that          concentrates around the centromeres      Given the          role of the centromere as a checkpoint for regulation of          the mitotic phase of the cell cycle      it was          hypothesized that CEBP localization around the          centromere could play a role in CEBP regulation of the          cell cycle              To investigate if targeting of CEBP to the          pericentromeric chromatin is necessary or sufficient to          cause G and S phase prolongation in GHFT cells we          first determined the domain of CEBP required to target          CEBP to the pericentromeric chromatin It was          previously suggested that the pericentromeric targeting          of CEBP was a function of DNA binding CEBP binding          sites are concentrated within the repeated DNA sequences          that comprise the bulk of pericentromeric chromatin              Indeed CEBP truncated to contain little more than          the DNA binding bZIP domain still concentrated at          pericentromeric chromatin     By contrast CEBP          deleted of amino acids  to  Fig B LZ no          longer targeted to the pericentromeric DNA Fig B          This deletion disrupts DNA binding Fig C by          eliminating the leucine zipper required for DNA binding          by all members of the bZIP family of transcription          factors     Thus as predicted     the bZIP          domain is necessary and sufficient for CEBP targeting          to pericentromeric chromatin          When expressed in GHFT cells LZ was as effective          as fulllength GFPCEBP in prolonging both G and S          Fig A Thus leucine zipper dimerization          sitespecific DNA binding and targeting of CEBP to          pericentromeric were not required for CEBP          prolongation in G and S In contrast the isolated          CEBP bZIP DNA binding domain Fig B DBD which          still targeted to pericentromeric chromatin did not          prolong G Fig B S phase remained prolonged upon DBD          expression The different effects of the isolated DBD on          G and S blockage indicated that CEBP regulation of G          and S phase arrest was mechanistically distinct Thus          CEBP regulates proliferation by two distinct pathways          Both pathways do not depend upon sitespecific DNA          binding which is commonly considered a prerequisite for          genespecific transcription                          Prolongation in G requires the amino terminal          domain of CEBP          The CEBP DBD therefore was insufficient for          prolongation of G Fig B We next determined which          additional domains of CEBP were required for G          prolongation CEBP amino acids  or  were          appended to the DBD see Fig B The addition of amino          acids  Fig  DBD   caused a statistically          significant increase relative to shamtransfected cells          in the proportion of cells in G p   n            The proportion of cells in G was not statistically          different in cells expressing DBD   from that in          cells expressing fulllength CEBPGFP Adding amino          acids  instead of amino acids  caused a          similar prolongation in G Fig  DBD   Thus          an element in the amino terminal domain of CEBP was          required for G prolongation          In contrast addition of amino acids  to CEBP          DBD did not rescue G prolongation Fig  DBD            Again appending amino acids  to this          mutant restored G prolongation A as did amino          acids  A  All of the mutants contained the          DBD and prolonged the cell cycle in S phase Fig           Thus the DNA binding bZIP domain was sufficient to          direct S phase regulation by CEBP whereas amino acids           contained a domain required for G regulation                            Discussion                  CEBP prolongs GHFT cells in G and S          The differentiative and antimitotic actions of CEBP          have been observed in a variety of cell culture models                  To date studies of the CEBP block          of proliferation have relied on comparing the growth                or DNA synthetic        rates of          CEBPexpressing and nonexpressing cells These studies          suggest that multiple possibly independent mechanisms          may contribute to CEBP arrest in a variety of cells                           Studies          that distinguish the antiproliferative actions of CEBP          at different phases of the cell cycle and in specific          cell types may clarify these discrepancies          Our studies showed that CEBP expression prolonged          the proliferation of GHFT pituitary progenitor cells          at two different phases of the cell cycle G and S Fig           A G block has been reported previously in          CEBPexpressing mouse L cells     However those          studies did not define the activities within CEBP          required for that blockage Here we observed that          prolongation in G required the amino terminal  amino          acids of CEBP Fig  In contrast amino acids  to           were not required for S phase arrest Figs            This showed that CEBP prolongation of GHFT cells in          the G and S phases occurred through molecularly distinct          pathways Such distinct effects on G and S may          contribute to the wide variations in mechanisms reported          to date to participate in proliferation arrest by          CEBP                          Cell Cycle Proteins and CEBP Inhibition of          Proliferation          Candidate mechanisms for the block of proliferation by          CEBP include  activation of the gene promoters of the          cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p     gadd               gas and gas       posttranscriptional          stabilization of p     or  interactions of          CEBP with cell cycle proteins including p                 CDK      CDK     retinoblastoma              the retinoblastomarelated protein p    and          the GSregulating EF transcription complex              Fig A We found that transcriptional activation          domain  and the leucine zipper were not required for          prolongation of either G or S Fig  These domains          interact with p CDK and CDK                  Thus CEBP interactions with at least p and CDK were          not required for the antiproliferative actions of CEBP          in GHFT cells CDK and other proteins also interact          with another domain of CEBP    required for          proliferation arrest discussed below          Arrest in S phase was associated with amino acids           to  Fig  which include the basic amino acidrich          DNA binding region of CEBP CEBP deleted of the          leucine zipper dimerization domain also required for DNA          binding    Fig C was as effective as fulllength          GFPCEBP in prolonging both S and G Fig A Thus          DNA binding           per se was not required for          proliferation arrest The basic region of CEBP blocks          the transcriptional activity of EF by unknown mechanisms             and contains another known CDKinteraction site              Either of these activities may contribute to basic          regiondependent S phase arrest of GHFT cell          proliferation          G block in GHFT cells required CEBP amino acids           Fig  comprising activation domains  and               Amino acids  to  have been implicated in CEBP          growth arrest via the EFpl complexes               CEBP interaction with p is believed to prevent the          formation of an Sphase promoting complex containing p          and EF       Thus G block in GHFT cells          may be related to the ability of CEBP to interact with          p However the amino terminus of CEBP also          functionally interacts with a number of other factors                any of which might contribute to          proliferation arrest                          Subnuclear Architecture and CEBP Inhibition of          Proliferation          Tang and Lane    showed that CEBP becomes          associated with pericentromeric chromatin upon          expression during adipocyte differentiation We observed          that CEBP expressed in mouse pituitary progenitor          GHFT cells also localized to pericentromeric          chromatin     Here we show that targeting of CEBP          to pericentromeric chromatin in GHFT cells required          the DNA binding domain of CEBP Fig  However          CEBP deleted of the DNA binding domain was as effective          as fulllength CEBP in prolonging GHFT cells in the          G and S phases of the cell cycle Fig A Thus the          specific association of CEBP with pericentromeric          chromatin speculated to contribute to CEBP growth          arrest     was not necessary for disruption of the          cell cycle by CEBP The independence of CEBP          regulation of proliferation from its intranuclear          localization may even be necessary since we have recently          determined that pituitary cell differentiation is          associated with the dispersal of CEBP from          pericentromeric heterochromatin by the          pituitaryspecific transcription factor Pit J F E          M A Kawecki F S R N D submitted                          TranscriptionIndependent Inhibition of          Proliferation          Transcription factors like CEBP may regulate cell          proliferation by directly controlling the expression of          proteins required for cell cycle progression Indeed          CEBP activates transcription of the p     gadd               gas and gas     genes However similar          levels of p mRNA in the livers of wildtype and          homozygous CEBP knockout mice    argue against a          physiologically significant contribution of CEBP to p          gene transcription in the liver We also observed that          transcriptionally inactive and DNAbindingdefective          forms of CEBP still blocked GHFT cell proliferation          in both the G and S phases of the cell cycle Figs             DNAbindingdefective mutants of CEBP have also          been observed to block proliferation in other cell lines               Together this suggests that CEBP          regulation of transcription in general might not          contribute to the regulation of cell proliferation It          remains possible that CEBP activation of the          transcription of some cell cycle regulatory genes does          control proliferation in some cell types or under certain          conditions                  The absence of a dependence of GHFT cell          proliferation on transcription factor activities that are          more classically associated with transcription regulation          strongly suggests that CEBP and perhaps other          transcription factors control proliferation and          transcription through completely separable pathways The          effects of human papilloma virus E proteins on          CEBPinduced differentiation and growth arrest also          suggest that the effects of CEBP on proliferation are          mechanistically divergent     Having distinct          mechanisms for regulation of gene transcription and          proliferation allows a transcription factor to regulate          these two critical processes completely independently of          one another This may be particularly important in          differentiated nonproliferating cells in which events          that regulate a transcription factors contribution to          gene expression must be disconnected from that          transcription factors continuing blockage of          proliferation                            Conclusions        CEBP is a transcription factor that controls both        proliferation and gene expression CEBP uses molecularly        distinct mechanisms to prolong the G and S phases of        pituitary progenitor GHFT cells The antiproliferative        effects of CEBP do not require activities in CEBP        commonly required for genespecific transcription        Proliferation arrest instead corresponds with CEBP        domains previously implicated in posttranscriptional        effects on EF andor CDK activity                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmid construction          The GFPCEBP vector was constructed by inserting the          cDNA encoding the ST derivative of GFP    at the          start codon of the cDNA encoding rat CEBP The fused          cDNA was cloned into a previously described expression          vector     The GFP and CEBP portions of the fusion          were separated by a  amino acid long linker including          the epitope for the FLAG antibody The CEBPGFP vector          was constructed by inserting the ST GFP into the NcoI          site present near the carboxy terminus of rat CEBP          also tagged at the amino terminus with the FLAG epitope          in our previously described CEBP expression vector              This resulted in a deletion of the last four amino          acids of CEBP The DBD and DBD   derivatives of          CEBP were constructed by replacing respectively the          amino terminal  amino acids of CEBPGFP to the          SgrAI site of CEBP and the amino terminal  amino          acids of CEBPGFP to the NotI site of CEBP with          oligonucleotides containing a strong Kozak sequence DBD            was constructed by replacing amino acids  to           from the NotI to SgrAI sites with an          oligonucleotide The remaining constructs Fig  were          generated by appending CEBP fragments to the NotI site          of DBD   or to the SgrAI site of DBD LZ was          constructed by deleting amino acids from amino acid           TthII site at the junction of the basic region and          leucine zipper of CEBP to the carboxy terminus of the          GFPCEBP fusion The CEBPTATA reporter used to          determine the transcriptional activity of the two GFP          fusion proteins was previously described                              Transfection          GHFT cells were propagated at C and  CO            in Dulbeccos modified Eagle          DMEH medium supplemented with  fetal calf serum          Approximately    cells were transfected by          electroporation as previously described     with           g of either the CEBPGFP GFPCEBP or control          expression vectors Following transfection cells were          propagated at C Incubation at C results in          significantly higher levels of green fluorescence          unpublished data presumably because of better folding          of the jellyfish GFP Transfected cells were maintained          in the dark throughout the experiment to minimize          fluorescence activation of GFP prior to flow          cytometry                          DNA Binding and Promoter Activation          Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays were done by          mixing a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a          consensus high affinity CEBP binding site          GATCGAGCCCCATTGCGCAATCATAGATC together with extracts          prepared from transfected cells as previously described               Competition with the same unlabeled          oligonucleotide in   or  molar excess of the          radiolabeled probed indicated specific binding The          protein DNA complex was supershifted with an antibody          directed against CEBP Santa Cruz Biotechnology          sc For studies of the transcriptional activation          properties of the fusion proteins  g of the CEBPTATA          vector    was cotransfected and transcriptional          activity was assessed by measuring the amount of          chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter expressed with          and without CEBP expression                              Fluorescence Microscopy          Following transfection most cells were plated into           cm dishes and allowed to grow for  hours This ensured          that the cells were not confluent by the time of          collection for cell cycle analysis A small portion of          the transfected cells were cultivated on a    mm No           borosilicate glass cover slip in a separate well dish          and treated with nocodazole mimosine or vehicle alone as          described below The coverslips were removed for          fluorescence microscopic observation immediately before          collecting cells for flow cytometric analysis of DNA          content and GFP expression Cells were stained           minutes with  gml of the cellpermeable DNA binding          dye Hoechst  The green fluorescence emitted from          CEBP tagged with GFP and the blue fluorescence emitted          from Hoechst stained DNA were readily distinguished          by selectively exciting each fluorophore and capturing          fluorescence emissions specific for each fluorophore          using appropriate excitation and emission filter sets          Chroma Technology Corporation Brattelboro VT              The images shown in Fig were acquired using an Olympus          X PlanApochromat  numerical

transfection after which we added to the cell          culture media  ngml nocodazole Sigma in          dimethylsulphoxide DMSO  mM mimosine Sigma in          DMSO or DMSO vehicle In some experiments cells were          also grown for  and  hours posttransfection before          applying nocodazole data not shown The distributions          of cells in G S and GM in the presence or absence of          CEBP expression were similar for cells grown for           reported here  or  hours data not shown prior to          nocodazole addition Following nocodazole mimosine or          DMSO addition the transfected GHFT cells continued to          be cultivated at C                          Flow Cytometry           hours after drug or vehicle treatment transfected          cells were trypsinized collected in DMEH media          containing  fetal calf serum and washed twice with          PBS The harvested cells typically    to             cells were resuspended in  l of  gml propidium          iodide Molecular Probes in PBS containing  NP          and  gml RNAse A then incubated at room temperature          in the dark for  minutes The cell suspension was then          analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer Becton Dickinson          at a flow rate of  lmin Fluorescence of the GFP and          propidium iodidebound DNA was excited with a  nm          argonion laser Green GFP fluorescence was collected          using a nm band pass filter and orange emission          from propidium iodidebound DNA was detected using a          nm band pass filter Photomultiplier tube voltage          and spectral compensation were initially set using          singlestained cells cells expressing GFP fusions with          CEBP but not stained with propidium iodide and cells          transfected with the control vector containing no GFP          cDNA but stained with propidium iodide Electronic          compensation was adjusted among the fluorescence channels          to remove residual spectral overlap The area and width          of each event were measured to discriminate intact single          cells from debris and from doublet or multiple cells          stuck together GFP fluorescence and propidium          iodidestained DNA fluorescence was thus collected from          single cells A minimum of  cellular events was          collected for each sample Data was analyzed
