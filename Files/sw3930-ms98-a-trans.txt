            okay hello yeah okay   hello yeah yeah well i uh on capital punishment here in Utah it uh we do have the death penalty for murder and uh the uh the either the jury or the judge can make that determination depending on the crime the seriousness of the crime   uhhuh   its been uh uh its been uh oh its been four or five years ago since uh someone was actually uh put on death row well theres some quite a few on death row but uh before one was executed   yeah thats the same way it is here   and it uh weve got some that uh have been there for ten or fifteen years and i dont know my opinion on on uh the death penalty i think its uh personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals but they appeal and appeal and uh it just goes on forever but   right right its just nothing but cost the taxpayers lots of money huh   uhhuh it really does and uh uh i i have ive always felt that uh if they murder someone in cold uh in cold blood they know what theyre doing and uh that they should be uh pay made to pay for it but if we dont have a deterrent of some kind then it just gets to the point where and if people its just if they want to do it they do it and then they they think well ill be out in uh two or three years and a lot of them are   yeah and then they end up doing it again   uhhuh right   no i think thats very very very wrong um im with you i think if they if theyve killed somebody they should they should pay for it   uhhuh   you know period no you know none of this going on and on and on and on   right what if the where its so clear cut weve had a couple cases here where they were actually caught and they uh and they had witnesses where they had killed two or three people and there was one that they thought theyd killed but they hadnt and they had the witness and and uh they did all kinds of things to these poor people   uhhuh   and this one they thought they had killed him but uh they hadnt and the the police were able to get them but they they did uh were able to uh have the one uh executed but the other one is still appealing and uh its uh its really a sad thing especially for the families of those that were involved   yeah you know i dont in other countries i dont think they do that if someone does something bad like that they just   uhhuh   do it right now you know   right and and they dont have the crime rate that we have here i know my son uh was over in Saudi Arabia but he was over there during the war and he said man somebody over there   uhhuh   uh they they kill someone and the and uh thats it theyre killed or they   yeah they pay for it right now yeah   right and so he says you really dont have that he could see the crime rate was very low over there because people knew the consequences   right   but here its got to the point where i think its gone too far the other way   yeah you know like like you say you know anything they do they dont care they could go out and rob somebody if they get caught they know theyre just going to be out in just a little while anyhow   uh thats true   so its the same thing you know but uh i just dont think that they should let it go on and on and on like they do   well i know made in the point you made about the taxpayer paying for it when you start considering the cost of fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year to keep them in prison   yeah right   plus all the attorney costs  all of that the taxpayers pay for   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh the victims they dont get anything other than just the heartache and going through this and going through it appeal after appeal and i dont know i   yeah they make it wait for so long and then people forget actually what did happen you know   uhhuh and then they find some little glitch uh in the law and uh you either turn them loose or or put them in prison for life and then maybe after a few years theyre paroled   yeah right right   so i dont know its its uh quite a situation i     yeah   i wish theyd get back to that but uh every once in a while there was a fellow that was executed in uh Wyoming the state next to us       uh about a month ago and uh of course he he said he wanted to be because he he had done the you know he he admitted to it and everything he said i just dont want to stay in prison and   uhhuh   so the lawyers couldnt do anything to stop that one  but anyway its uh   uhhuh uhhuh it makes you wonder how they can live with themselves when they do something like that huh   i well it does and then you try to teach your children uh respect for for uh
