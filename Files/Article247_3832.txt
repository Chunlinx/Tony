                                 Write Off Tice on Tyco                        With absolutely no malice aforethought honest its just happened thisway Moneybox this week has been devoted to the thoroughly scintillatingissues of doubleparking and corporate accounting I promise next week toreturn to our usual diet of sex and scandal But in any case class todaystopic is writeoff charges after acquisitions good or evil            Hey you in the back row stop snoring And you put down that Game Boy            Ahem Actually writeoffs have been in the news all week Intelreported its thirdquarter results which included a hefty writeoff related toits acquisition of Level One Communications upon which some commentators casta jaundiced eye Motorola meanwhile announced that it would be taking a million writeoff because of its investment in troubled satellitephone companyIridium and added that it might have to take an additional  millionwriteoff in the next quarter Those writeoffs were generally described assensible since Iridium may very well turn out to be a complete bust andMotorola needs to make sure it has enough money on hand to account for itslosses from the investment            The biggest writeoffrelated news though has to do with Tyco which untilthis week has been one of the hottest companies and hottest stocks in AmericaThis is Tyco International not Tyco Toys Along with GE its one of the fewtruly successful industrial conglomerates left in this country with lines ofbusiness ranging from disposable medical products to underwatertelecommunications Tyco has turned itself into a  billion company throughan aggressive program of acquisitions a total of  in the last seven yearsacquisitions that it has done a rather remarkable job of integrating into itsbroader management structure            This week though David Tice who runs the Prudent Bear Fund out of Dallasissued a report calling into question the quality of Tycos earnings whichis a nice way of saying Tice is suggesting that Tycos acquisitiondrivenstrategy may be a way of masking slow growth in its underlying business Inparticular Tice pointed to Tycos hefty writeoffs of its acquisition costswriteoffs that have totaled something like  billion in the last fouryears            Companies take onetime writeoffs because theyre better than having towrite off a little bit each year Investors and analysts tend to treat largewriteoffs as onetime events and therefore disregard them Skepticalinvestors like Tice dont like this especially whenas in the case ofTycoa company is taking large writeoffs year after year The writeoff inthe minds of bears can be a way for companies to hide the costs ofacquisitions            This critique of writeoffs is completely wrongheaded If the cost ofacquisition is hidden by a writeoff its hidden in plain sight since thecompany announces it quite publicly And while its possible that there areinvestors who get tricked by writeoffs into believing that an acquisition wasfree its also true that there are people who still believe their fates aregoverned by the stars Companies are no more responsible for the former thanthe latter The market as a whole cannot be systematically deluded byaccounting gimmicks as long as the gimmicks are publicly disclosed            Here though we get into the other potential problem with writeoffsEssentially when a company takes a writeoff with regard to an acquisitionits setting aside a reserve of money that it says it believes it will need tocomplete the acquisition The danger is that an unscrupulous company will setaside too much moneysince with a big writeoff investors tend to disregardthe hit to earningsand then use the excess to make its bottom line lookbetter in future years In other words I set aside  billion to pay for theacquisition of Company X but in reality it only costs me  billion givingme  million that I can feed back into my income statement in upcomingyears You need a couple of pennies of income to meet Wall Street estimatesYou got em            This for instance is exactly what Sunbeam did when Al Dunlap was CEODunlap denies knowing about the shenanigans that took place under his watchAnd although Tice hasnt come out and said it this is what hes implying mayor could be happening at Tyco The charges have had a dramatic effectdriving the stock down  percent on Wednesday and another  percent onThursday even though the companys CEO denounced the charges as utterlybaseless and just about every Wall Street firm reiterated buy ratings on thestock            Looking at the numbers I think Tice is completely off base about Tyco Andin theory feeding a writeoff reserve back into operating income shouldnteven be possible The reality though is that this kind of stuff still happensall the time even though eventually everyone does seem to get caught AndTice was onto Sunbeam before almost anyone else But to a man with a hammereverything looks like a nail Writeoffs themselves are not the problem Itsthe lack of transparency in the way that companieslike Sunbeam and not likeTycouse them that is
