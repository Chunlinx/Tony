                                 ER Authoritarian and Aristocratic                        Dear Marjorie            At the risk of letting you lure me into a very old argument Id say Eleanorwas a force for ill Not great ill and not unmixed ill but illmostly inthat she helped establish the modern social compact under which citizens tradefreedom or as Cook puts it  freedom  for security The balance sheetgets complicated if you think as I do that a lot of her most noble goalssuch as racial integration would have happened anyway and consider that alot of her least noble ones such as disarmament on the verge of World War IIwere never achieved            What tips the balance for me is that Eleanor was a far more authoritarianfigure than Cook lets on Granted paternalism was in the air Churchill toourged that we treat the jobless man like a patient in hospital Cook saysEleanor resented it when people compared Roosevelt to a dictator and treats allcomplaints about Franklins dictatorial ambitions as cynical rabblerousingmeant to protect private interests Maybe at times But Frank Freidel saysthat in an era that saw the rise of Hitler and Mussolini fears of Rooseveltas an elected dictatorwhile ultimately misplacedwere understandable evenhealthy in a democracy He adds that during the Hundred Days Mrs Rooseveltlamented that the nation lacked a benevolent dictator to force throughreforms            Ninety percent of what politicians do is selfactualization Some makethings better some make things worse most do bothbut thats a secondaryproject And thats why I dont exactly fault Hillary for her bad luck inruling in good times which makes a lot of her rhetoric as you sayinappropriate She would have been more Eleanorlike during a depression andEleanor would have been more Hillarylike during a boom            What makes Eleanors growing love of power so fascinatingandtroublesomeis that it had to be wielded with either extreme ingenuousness orextreme disingenuousness and its hard to figure out which Eleanorsinstincts were aristocratic She ushered in or more accurately restored anera in which political power was seized not through backroom deals andexchanges of money but through causebased kudosaccumulation The fact thatshe gave to charity the millions she made as a radio star does not to my mindexempt her from the charge of Gingrichian buckraking            You cannot lament as Cook does Americas stingy attitude toward thenations neglected and rejected people without asking Eleanor to open up herown books You cannot carp as Eleanor did about privileges of race and genderwithout begging the question of your own megaprivileges land familyconnections fame not to mention having a husband whos president Thelatifundium on the Hudson the Astor and Morgan relatives Eleanor enlisted tobankroll her schemes the yearly visits to Newport to which Eleanor washardly pace Cook dragged kicking and screaming the government andcharity connections that allowed her ValKill furniture company to breakevenwhat would Eleanor have been without them            As for money Eleanor said If you could give it all where it would do themost good that would be grand but we cant always do that Im with her Imwith her But the moment she berates the privilege of those who couldntafford to make a down payment on her carriage house or invokes the greed ofthose making  percent of the mean per capita income Im with Hick who saidto Eleanor during a White House dinner God damn itnone of us ought to bewearing velvet dinner gowns these days            BestChris
