               so uh hows the weather by you   if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have plowed everything under and had a rice field     i i heard that its been raining down there a little bit but its really been that bad   its so bad wanted to mow today i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it its still so mushy if i took a mower out there id tear the sod up so bad   really that bad huh is it is it typically this rainy i dont think its typically this rainy by you down there is it   its steady but its not in the amounts that we been getting normally we get an inch here and then a week or so will pass and you pick up another inch inch and a half were getting hit by three and four inch bursts at a time   oh God i guess youre getting all of Californias rain   well thats where the front had came come from they said it came out of the Pacific run across California who was really needing the rain it shouldve it shouldve stalled over them for a couple more days   right oh theyre getting another one later in the week there there was another one that was another storm um that was supposed to hit them like on Wednesday or something so i suspect itll itll wind its way to you afterward its not a pleasant thought so   well maybe i maybe i can get the yard mowed before it hits     well well i can uh i can understand that weather were having uh we are it we had a late um um an ice storm here about two weeks ago which is you know um and and its and its theyre calling it the worst ice storm in like the last hundred years and um and then to the point where about three hundred thousand people in our in our area lost power   isnt it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though   and yeah oh yeah this is this is um well yeah up here in in in Rochester winter usually doesnt you know spring comes about this time March or April and um this was sort of unexpected it had actually been pretty fairly nice you know in the in the forties and um it had even been in the uh in the in the low fifties a couple of days in a row and then they actually they predicted it they said well were going to have an ice storm coming up and then no one knew how bad it was going to be and it came in and in one night it basically destroyed it destroyed approximately one third of all the vegetation in um in like the three county area by us and about half the city owned trees in the city of Rochester are destroyed um we had i uh um my wife and i own our own home and we have a very big willow tree in our backyard that um that ninety percent of which came down in one night things like that it was a it it definitely is very um it was it was it wasnt supposed to be as bad they they have i i guess apparently you know ice storms here occasionally but never anything this bad this late in the season   yeah id seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area uh they had a little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it   oh yeah it was it was utterly amazing i mean we we would um we got up in the morning you know um we didnt we you you didnt sleep very well because every all all around you there were crashing sounds and and there were sounds of things breaking and you know you look you know we at one point we woke up to the sound of the uh the electric lines being ripped off our house and and things like that and then you go outside and everything is covered in ice i mean um youre talking about the lawn before being too mushy to mow um in our case it was just the opposite i mean the lawn was just a solid sheet of ice each blade of grass had a small individual covering of ice you know um maybe you know two or three millimeters thick but thick enough that you could actually see it my car was covered completely in ice it was in ice of about a half inch thick at one point   how do you thaw one out after its been coated like that ive always lived down in this part of the country and im not used you know we had an ice storm or a sleet   well it   and a good freeze and the windshield ices over and you take hot water or warm water out of the tap and thaw your windshield   yeah um actually it turned out in our case um i know somebody who when they tried to defrost their car cracked their windshield um though occasionally it can be dethawed in our case we didnt um we didnt have the problem because my we keep my wifes car in the garage so her car didnt get iced over you know it wasnt um um it was a little bit cold in her car in the morning but it wasnt iced over so i just left my car out there for a couple of days and um within two or three days it was it was actually warm enough that everything melted um it was it was actually one of the most beautiful sights ive ever seen because everything looks you know if you can imagine just seeing everything coated in a nice clean sheet of ice and and and it looks really nice the whole whole place but um it got you know after the initial storm it got worse as things started to melt because um as things melted branches shifted and started to fall again so were still cleaning up we actually left the last people got power i guess yesterday and we left the state of emergency last night or something at like midnight so its its its not fun   just hearing what it does to the lawn i hate to even guess what the road conditions would be like in something like that   strangely enough the roads werent that the the roads themselves were okay um there wasnt given that um sort of things hit and and for some reason i dont i dont quite understand why they maybe the ice didnt have anything to grab onto the roads themselves werent werent like covered in a solid sheet of ice things seemed to be okay um especially given that you know the next day it was forty degrees um you know  everything started to melt and then the roads themselves icewise were okay it was just that um there were there were power lines down everywhere on the road and there were trees downed everywhere and wherever you drove was sort of like driving through an obstacle course you didnt want to have to wind up hitting um you know hitting a tree or hitting a power line or hitting a phone line or anything else that was the rough part of it they closed school for kids for like a week just just because of that so   sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here   yeah thats what im actually told ive ive never experienced a hurricane   well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground   oh God yeah well i guess um but typically it down there though you dont get much coldness right you get   we get maybe all winter long we might end up with twenty five days of really cold weather and of those by the time it gets lunch time as as long as the winds not blowing its bearable   how well when you say cold what do you mean by cold   uh i think of any thirty five and below as cold   oh sheesh yeah um um its right about now when theyre talking about hitting thirty five and forty degree days were thinking heat wave because occasionally whatll whatll happen here is with the wind chill it can go below zero quite often which is not not fun i personally hate it im only here for school   another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze coming straight off the Gulf the wind chill factor       blows everything out of proportion uh most of the time during the winter that weve got an offshore wind which is blowing straight out   uh so you dont get the wind chill there thats nice thats nice uh i uh my my goal is to move some place south so that i dont have to worry about winters any more and just worry about you know an occasional thirty five degree day i can handle but the the the sad part about here is that winter starts in um in you know early September or September October and then it ends in March or April so there isnt that much summer and spring and fall here its pretty much you know lots of winter and uh its a very long winter semicold winter and a very gray winter usually so not uh not fun   trying to think wheres the warmest the warm lines start i guess probably if youre drawing a line across a map of the country put the middle of your ruler on Dallas   is it that low you think uh   they get snow up there but its its not a long lasting snow itll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high thirties and forties   um thats not too bad   you get much above you get much above the Texas border on in that sector sector of the map and get up into Oklahoma theyve got a little bit longer winter theyre catching   yeah   all the cold breezes coming straight off the Rockies straight across Kansas and Nebraska and theres nothing the only thing that stands between Oklahoma and Kansas and Nebraska theres a barb wire fence somewhere around Topeka thats the only thing to slow down the wind     a little barb wire fence huh well ive only been out uh ive only been in the west once so uh i was i was in Iowa and it was bitter cold when i was there and thats the way thats north um thats sort of north midwest though so way way north of where you are so i i uh my experience wasnt wasnt quite down there i i i like i said i want to wind up somewhere down in that range where its nice and warm and you know when when when you get twenty five cold days a year rather than twenty five warm days a year       which is what we wind up with
