                what do you usually wear to work   well lets see it turns out that uh Tektronix i work at Tektronix and its a very uh low key place as far as dress goes  you just wear uh lets see   umhum   when i first came here i wore suits but after a while i got uh  found out that that wasnt all that important im an engineer   oh i see   and uh so i get to wear  just uh how shall i say it uh walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and   umhum   well walking how shall i say it kind of like Avia uh walking shoes uh   well thats nice comfortable stuff   yes open shirt open at the neck you know no tie and uh   wow   just uh reasonable looking how shall i say it uh sports clothes or well some guys wear some people even wear Levis   wow thats nice   now being from Philadelphia i dont expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right   well  actually right now im a full time college student so my dress code is very very expensive yeah i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime but over the summers ive had a job internships with the newspaper   oh okay umhum   and thats  so generally then i dress you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that so then its still you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because its a lot of walking and coming in out of the office but you still have to have a professional image kind of thing to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that so   yes yeah well i uh i just recently applied for a different job in the company here and   oh really   so i decided well id wear a suit and it it was very interesting uh like i said most of the people at at this company dont wear suits uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that youd wear to school   umhum wow that must be nice atmosphere then   well it has been although the new president and CEO of the company is from a much more formal eastern uh background   oh   and so the result is that uh so anyway i wore this suit and i went over to uh uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it and   umhum   i i was almost converted because uh  the effect of that suit on the way people responded reacted and responded to me as opposed to the uh just to kind of how shall i say it they know youre there but they dont uh you dont theres no notice at all but when i wore a suit that day uh it was obvious that people didnt know whether i was a worker bee or a manager   wow   so people uh how shall i say it made a made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello and uh things like that so   thats interesting its like a mini little study there  thats really interesting   yeah and so this dress for success thing i think is uh by and large ive im kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh unless youre in a an environment where theyre going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off   right hum thats interesting   doesnt mean they have to be uh how shall i say it they they dont have to be the the most uh the absolute best   umhum   but uh a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would uh pay off so im in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again   thats neat thats neat   and uh i i dont know no i know eastern now the other thing we do here of course is a single not quite a single climate we have uh we do have some snow in the wintertime and it can be quite warm in the summertime not hot like uh i lived in the midwest for a while   umhum oh   and i know that uh you know it can be freezing cold in the wintertime and and hot and uh sticky in the summertime   umhum   we dont have that much its uh its a very mild climate   oh well thats nice thats good for the clothes budget i would imagine because here   yes it it is   gosh we had uh the winter hasnt been bad this winter its it its only snowed maybe once or twice but its been cold low twenties lets say and then the summer gets up to eighties nineties so
