        uh what kind of car would you uh buy next     well thats a good question we just got in from looking at cars and weve probably been looking at them for a couple months and we havent bought one yet  so that almost answers the question how about you     oh you have okay oh and you havent um we just bought one um we bought one about a month ago it was a ninety one Ford Thunderbird   oh   um we really liked it because um we just moved here from South Dakota and we have we do some quite a bit of traveling and that was a nice car to travel in but we have also a Ford Probe and thats better to get around town in because the Thunderbird takes a lot of gas   uhhuh yeah umhum   but um the reason were stuck on Fords i guess is because i used to sell Fords and so were kind of stuck on that kind of a car but i really like um that kind of car myself but   well we weve been looking at  just about everything i guess because we really dont need a car we just sort of  want the luxury of buying a new car and um   yeah   i dont know we were today we were looking at Lexuses and we keep going back to Cadillacs   oh do you   and looking at those and then you dont know if you wanna spend thirty thousand dollars and buy a new car or whether you wanna buy uh like a ninety one Cadillac a ninety or ninety one for you know twenty or nineteen or fifteen you can get them   yeah umhum yeah   fairly cheap compared to buying a brand new one  and the new Lexus that that they have that you you pay sticker price for those   a Lexus yeah uhhuh and isnt that neat though that is a neat car dont you think   yes yes we we were  we were all in them today but you know when it comes to oops     were you   you know do you wanna spend about thirty thousand dollars and uh itd probably be a little over that with the tax  so thats thats really where   right oh i know   where we are or should we just buy you know a little Volkswagen weve right weve you know the one of those Cabriolets i guess theyre called uh its a convertible its sort of like you know square in the back   yeah and get around town uhhuh yeah i like those   but the the selling point i guess that that i or it has to pass my test im im short and i need to sit in the seat see if i can get the seat high enough to see over the steering wheel like i like to see   are you shorter   yeah im  about five two   are you oh then thats yeah   and to make sure the seat belt doesnt hit me in the neck that it comes really over the shoulder and not up around your neck so   yeah its got to be a comfortable car   right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough   right uhhuh   to do that so uh so on those we just we just forget about   yeah that certainly helps   and weve been looking at cars with leather seats but uh   uhhuh   i dont know this is a new experience for us just just mainly because my uh my mother had died which meant that we were coming into some money that we could   yeah   splurge and buy a car but but yet its difficult to do though when youre not used to it so thats why were were out uh   oh and isnt that nice yeah   sort of doing this and uh   yeah buying a car is hard you never know for sure if youre getting a good deal   yeah well weve always bought used cars before and they havent been very expensive um so this is just just a new   umhum   a new thing you know weve had vans weve had a new van and you know some other another new car that that wasnt used but the prices are what   uhhuh   used to buy a house for   yeah oh i know because we came down here and you know and well you know from down here it but price of housing is a lot different   umhum i bet   but the but the price of our house up in Aberdeen was as much as some cars and its like you know oh my goodness   umhum right its hard to adjust to it and and you just dont want to really   no because its like this thing it moves moves and could be wrecked and thats like we you know get a house for this and uh it just blows our mind um but   umhum thats right uhhuh well i hope you enjoy your car uh we we looked at Thunderbirds um i guess maybe about a couple weeks ago we seem to do this every   oh yeah uhhuh umhum   every weekend weve been out looking for  for we still havent bought yet so i guess every every month we dont buy we save more money than we  were just shopping shopping is free until you buy   yeah thats right interest   yeah well thats great you know because you might as well get what you want you know   yeah but it would be it would be nice our son works for EDS and and we could use his um   oh really   discount that he gets through General Motors   yes thats right   except uh we were only out looking at General Motors cars except Cadillac and were not looking at the at the new ones anyway and in the Cadillacs and theyre not using theyre not getting um discounts on the new   uhhuh   Cadillacs that were looking would would be looking at to begin with so   uhhuh are you in Dallas   yes Plano   yeah so am i  are you looking at the Crest or Crest   umhum yeah we were just got back from there yeah that was our last stop about you know about eight thirty i said oh we can always swing around Crest so there we go and were swinging around yes weve gotten two cars two used cars from Crest   you did uhhuh and we got our i oh you and good
