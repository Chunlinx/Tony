Helping Out at Tax TimesBy Anthony Perez CassinoFor the past few weeks my usual stack of junk mail has beensupplemented with a steady stream of  tax statements and formsreminding me that the clock has begun ticking towards April  Iadmit that even though my taxes are relatively simple and I took atax course in law school I still hire an accountant to completethe forms I found law school discussions concerning the concept ofbasis or steppedup basis to be about as easy to follow as therule against perpetuitiesOf course the one tax concept that we all understand is anaudit The prospect of being audited may be one of lifes moststressful experiences so I can only imagine how daunting it wouldbe if I had to do so without any professional assistance But thatis the exact situation that many low and moderateincome taxpayersface when being audited by the Internal Revenue Service With thepush in recent years to move people from welfare to work there aremany new lowwage firsttime filers who are often automaticallyaudited Still others fail to file file incorrectly or fail totake advantage of programs like the Earned Income Tax CreditLegal ClinicsIn an effort to redress this problem the IRS has taken theunusual step of funding legal clinics that assist lowincometaxpayers Under the project which was created as part of the IRSRestructuring and Reform Act of  the IRS provides funding toprograms that offer tax education and representation to lowincomeindividuals This may seem a little bit like supplying a rival armywith ammunition but in fact it is entirely consistent with thestated mission of the IRS In a press release referring to theprogram IRS Commissioner Charles O Rossotti stated that theclinics mesh with the IRS mission statement of providing Americastaxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meettheir tax responsibilities by applying the tax law with integrityand fairness to all He went on to say that these clinics fill acritical need They reach out to help people who frequently havenowhere else to turn for legal assistance on tax matters A numberof programs in New York that are funded by the IRS rely heavily onvolunteer lawyers to serve clients including The BrooklynLowIncome Taxpayer Clinic of South Brooklyn Legal Services and theLow Income Taxpayer Clinic operated by The Legal Aid SocietysVolunteer Division These programs address a valid complaint bycorporate tax lawyers that there are not enough opportunities forthem to use their unique skills to help individuals on a pro bonobasis However participation in a taxpayer clinic is not solelylimited to tax experts since these programs provide extensivetraining and mentoringOne of the most important services provided to clients oftaxpayer clinics is assistance in seeking a refund under the EarnedIncome Tax Credit provisions While every year brings a new roundof partisan battles in Washington over the tax code the EITCprogram is one proposal that satisfies a broad crosssection of thepolitical spectrum It is a vital income supplement and workincentive program targeted to lowincome working families withchildren It has been called the nations most successfulantipoverty program distributing over  billion of assistanceto almost  million families Twentyeight percent of the familiesthat benefited from the program had incomes below  and percent were below  In  it lifted more than million individuals out of povertyDespite all of its success there are still many families who donot apply for the credit because of a lack of awarenessIronically for those who do apply the EITC represents the fourthlargest area for audits by the IRS Both of these scenarios pointto the importance of having professional assistance throughout thisprocess and to the vital role of the lowincome taxpayer clinicsAlthough these clinics are relatively new they have beenwellreceived by volunteer lawyers who have been instrumental inestablishing the programsThis collaboration is noteworthy for at least two reasons it isa model for future partnerships between the government and theprivate sector and it is an example of some of the very diversepro bono opportunities for lawyers that have been created in recentyears Unfortunately during the past decade government funding forlegal services for lowincome Americans has declined at almost alllevels In the mids there was a concerted attempt in Congressto eliminate funding entirely for the Legal Services Corporation anationwide program dedicated to providing civil legal services tolowincome Americans Although the program continues to survive itsfunding has been reduced by more than  million On the statelevel funding from the Interest on Lawyer Account fund hasdecreased by half during the s due to declining interestrates The IRS should be commended for recognizing the importanceand benefits of ensuring equal treatment for all taxpayersJust a few years ago pro bono work usually meant litigationAlthough litigation continues to be a leading pro bono activitynew projects have been created that tap into the multitude ofexpertise within the profession There are pro bono programs thatnow partner with volunteer corporate lawyers to assistnotforprofits and microenterprises as well as on economicdevelopment projects The taxpayer clinic is unique because it isone of the few opportunities for tax practitioners to assistindividual taxpayers on a pro bono basisI cannot say that I am prepared to give up my aversion to thetax code but the lowincome taxpayer clinics are an innovative wayfor those who are comfortable with its provisions to help others inneed In the case of the Earned Income Tax Credit it is also arare opportunity to significantly enhance the living situation of alowincome family by obtaining funds rightfully due them If youwould like to get involved please contact The Brooklyn LowIncomeTaxpayer Clinic of South Brooklyn Legal Services at  or the
