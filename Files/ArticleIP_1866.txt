                                 Marion Barry            Critics of Marion Barryandwhos not onehave been saying for years that his Washington DC is like aThird World capitalsqualid dangerous and corrupt The District has neverseemed more like a banana republic than in the past few weeks Barry AmericasminiSuharto has dragged it into an embarrassing protracted drama It is inrack and ruin he had overstayed his welcome everyone wanted him to leave andhe wasnt sure he wanted to oblige            From thebeginning of April until this week the mayor toyed with his city about whetherto seek reelection to a fifth term this fall Largely ignored during hiscurrent term Barry was at the center of attention again His Hamlet act hadthe city on edge and he loved it His press conferences were packed TheWashington Post launched a daily Barry Watch column National mediawere calling His every hintand he dropped lots of themwas parsed forsignificance Each week was supposed to be the week he announced his decisionbut having the time of his life Barry kept putting it off            Now with his usual excruciatingexquisite sense of timingBarry has followed Indonesian President Suhartos retirement announcement withhis own The inevitable comparisons to that dictator aside Barry probablypicked the right moment to bow out Hes on top againbriefly A TuesdayWashington Post poll found that Barry is the frontrunner for theDemocratic primary attracting  percent of voters nearly twice as many ashis closest competitor            For thosewho still cant believe the excrackhead was reelected once this survey wasunfathomable How could he be ahead I wont begin to justify all the badreasons for Barrys popularityrace resentment patronage etcbut will tryto explain one good one  Even for Washingtonians who had forgiven Barry hiscrimes the prospect of another campaign appalled The postcomeback Barryhasnt much changed his ways He still favors racial rhetoric andCongressbashing And he may not have shaken his worst old habits The Lastof the Black Emperors The Hollow Comeback of Marion Barry in a New Age ofBlack Leaders  a new biography by longtime DC journalist Jonetta RoseBarras alleges Barry may have bought drugs during his current term It alsoalleges he made sexual advances toward male staffers Barry has called the bookgarbage The same Post poll that found Barry would win the Democratic primary also found that the vast majority ofWashingtonianstwothirdspreferred he not run            But Barry is a political creature Why would heskip a race he thought he could win The answer is that the Mayor Barry of is not the Mayor Barry of  There is no good professional reason for him tohold office Hes scarcely mayor of anything Since Barry returned to theoffice in January  the District power structure has devoted itself toemasculating him Within a few months of his inauguration the BarryloathingRepublican Congress installed a Control Board to oversee the citys shakyfinances Congress and the Control Board soon stripped the mayor of authorityto issue contracts or manage budgets Last year they usurped his control ofthe city bureaucracy removing departments of public safety welfare healthcare public works and basically everything else that matters from hissupervision Barry was left with the dregs recreation libraries the Officeof Aging The transfer of power has been good news for the city which haserased a huge deficit and begun to stem the exodus of middleclassresidents            Barry does still get torevel in the trappings of mayorhood He continues to flounce around Washingtonlike the emperor he once was He has a limo at his beck and call His personalsecurity force included an incredible  officers until Congress forcedhim to halve it last year A crowd of flunkies and yeswomen surrounds himBarry still issues selfaggrandizing statements in which he takes credit forthings he didnt do and announces initiatives that will never be initiatedAnd he still takes grand foreign tours on which he behaves as if he is visitingroyalty This week Taiwan            Losingthe actual power bothers him but I dont think its as big a deal as the auraof power says a longtime friend Its not just the limo because anyone canhave a limo He is the Mayor  He really enjoys being The Man            But Barry recognized that the trappings of power weretenuous too If he had been reelected Congress would have probably punishedhim by cutting his salary eliminating the security guards who remain andstripping him of the few pathetic agencies he does control            Not havinglost his sharpness Barry understood the emptiness of his position Ifreelected he would be a nonentity and Marion Barry cannot stand to be anonentity So why not hand the job off Congress will be more likely to returnhome rule and rearm the mayor if Barry is gone Besides he has nothing left toprove He already has made the greatest political comeback in US history ThePost poll predicting a Barry primary win allows him to quit with a bangnot a whimper He can go out saying See they still love me I told you Iwould win Bye yall  says Barras            Barrys friends and local business leaders havebeen trying for months to find a way to let him exit with honorto give him agracious payoff in exchange for his decision to step down Its a good ideaBarry has been a public servantof a sortand America traditionally findsrespectable retirements for its former leaders Pols spend their dotage asthink tank scholars or consultants or parttime lobbyists see Bob Dole andare trotted out periodically for sage commentary Even if Barry doesnt quitedeserve the same Washington deserves not to have its exmayor disgracedBarrys retirement team has talked to local universities and historically blackcolleges about a position for him He is also planning lecture tours andshopping a memoir            And thereis even talk that Barry will be hired as a top executive by a local businessGiven his track record as the Districts mayor you might want to sell yourstock in that company                           If youmissed the sidebar about the one good reason to support Barry
