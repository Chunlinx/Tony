                                 Mahir and the DiaperClad ChatRoom Denizens                        Dear Todd            Yesterday in the letter you filed at about noon you said I see that Mahirhas finally made Time magazine My first impulse was to write backWhos Mahir but I felt incredibly stupid for not knowing who Mahir waswhich lead me to assume that he had to be either a famous sports guy pick asport any sport or someone connected to the opera or the ballet Then for asecond I thought there was a typo involved and you were actually speaking ofMaher as in Bill from Politically Incorrect  But I couldnt imagineout why he mattered to you so much that you were gleefully remarking on hisinclusion in Time  Not wanting to own up to being either ignorant orunhip I never said a word even though I still wanted to in my first letterthis morning Instead I quietly typed his name into a search engine and foundout everything I needed to know And I only mention this because I now realizethat no way was I the only person who had no idea to whom you were referringyesterday Which of course was kind of a relief            Moving on to weightier matters Did you read that Michael Jackson is set tostar as Edgar Allen Poe in a new movie The racial discrepancy of this castingchoice doesnt bother me nearly as much as the fact that portraying Edgar AllenPoe as a guy with a highpitched breathless voice who has had a ton of plasticsurgery would put such a completely different spin on what might have been thepsychological issues behind the writing of those scary twisted stories that itjust might be impossible to ever really enjoy them again Its almost likehiring Richard Simmons to play Ernest Hemingway in A Moveable Feast Although now that I think about it more I would do almost anything for achance to see that movie made            Apparently a new study of childrens media habits just released by theKaiser Family Foundation reveals that children between  and  spend aboutfive and a half hours a day consuming media  mostly TV But as I wasanalyzing the figures I noticed that the  percent of the kids between  and who have a TV right in their very own bedrooms watch an average of only threehours nine minutes daily In other words as I see it the more central the TVis to their world the less they want anything to do with it This is somethingI have long suspected as I have found there is no more effective way to getsomeone to cut back on their TV viewing than to put them front and center on aTV show And if you give them a job in the writing department they may justdecide to never even own TV again period            I dont know how the statistics fall as far as the homeless and TV viewingbut according to the front page of the LA Times  they are spending alot more time online The article reports that hundreds of homeless sheltersacross the country have installed computer labs that would be the envy of mosthigh schools I guess just because a person doesnt have a permanent addressis no reason they shouldnt be allowed to give themselves a wacky pseudonym andlog on to a chat room full of adult men in diapers like everyone else But Ihave friends who keep telling me that online dating is the answer And as faras I am concerned this is the final nail in the coffin of online dating for mebecause I am not meeting anyone for coffee at a homeless shelter Period Idont care how single and sensitive they otherwise appear to be            You know yesterday when I was snooping around at Monica Lewinskys newcyberhandbag emporium I found myself wondering how she had turned into ahandbag designer simply by sitting around eating fists full of clairs at theWatergate and then making crosstown limo rides to the courthouse for grand juryappearances But today I noticed that Bloomingdales is running a quarterpagead in the front section of the New York Times that says Meet DesignerShoshanna at Bloomingdales Nov   It features a photo of onetimeteenage girlfriendofJerrySeinfelds Shoshanna Lonstein posing in herown holiday creationa garnet self striped strapless silk taffetadress What I conclude from this is that apparently surviving acontroversial and highly publicized affair with a famous male public figureconfers upon a woman not just symptoms of posttraumaticstress disorder butalso a functioning set of designer skills and abilities equivalent to afouryear bachelor of arts degree Which means I think we can all look forwardto at least a line of whimsical scarves or belts from Marla Maples or PatriciaDuff by the end of the year            Did you read that Italian scientists discovered a gene that exerts majorcontrol over the life span of mice This is considered a milestone in researchconcerning antiaging And I suppose even if they never find the correspondinggene in humans it will still make us all feel younger at heart to be around somany younger looking mice
