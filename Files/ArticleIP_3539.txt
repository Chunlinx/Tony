justhad lunch at a local Internet cafe I brought my own laptop and wireless modemthe better to read Slate in its full framed glory I was slowlydownloading full images while everyone else was using Lynx I did order acheese sandwich and nobody gave me any dirty looks but even so I felt alittle guilty about not spending any money for my online experience Is it rudeto bring your own digital device to an Internet cafe What about bringing foodbut paying for a terminal                                       SincerelySomewherein Seattle                                       PS To be specificIm at wwwspeakeasyorg and I just finished my tasty sandwich                        DearSomewhere in Seattle            Prudence had never heard ofan Internet cafe until she received your letter Apparently such things do notexist east of the Rockies or north of  years of age I have howeverconsulted the Web site to which you refer and now have a clue as to thesubject of your query            As I understand it the cafeprovides computers and modems for the use of its patrons for a fee and alsosells food Your question is whether it is improper for you to bring your ownlaptop and wireless modem thus bypassing the fee and to buy only a cheesesandwich            The management of the cafehas established the rules for the use of their facility Since they have letyou in and have not kicked you out it appears that you have not violated anyof those rules You are not being rude But if there are many people like youand especially if you are occupying space that might be occupied by a payingcustomer the management will change the rules They will establish a covercharge or require a minimum food purchase for the use of a table The situationwill be like that in a cabaret where you cannot sit down at a table and watchthe show without paying something            In themeantime until the rules are changed it would be wise of you to leave a tipor spend more on food Otherwise you will not get a good table or will havecrumbs brushed into your laptop even though strictly speaking you areabiding by the rules            Prudence easterly                                             DearPrudence                                                      This question is about theetiquette of having a love affair with a macroeconomist Hes  years olderthan me and a former colleague I have an ironclad rule about colleagues andsex ie dont do it but now that Ive changed jobs hes made his personalinterest in me pretty clear and I like him a lot In view of this quiterelevant factand the global scarcity of men who like him are tall funnyand smarter than methe age thing doesnt bother me BUT The problem is Idont know if hes still married to the mother of his two collegeage kids andI dont know how to ask I know this sounds dumb But our earlier professionalfriendliness did not extend to swapping details of our private lives althoughhe does mention the kids Is this some kind of guy code for wife                                       So canyou suggest a polite way to raise this preferably using some kind of SoutheastAsia currencycrisis metaphor to get the point across Hes up to his neck inall that stuff out there right now                                       Hesitating inParis                        DearHesitating in Paris            Prudence is pleased that youare not put off by the fact that this man is a macroeconomist and  yearsolder than you There can be lots of life left in an old macroeconomist            Now how to find out if he ismarried            You might say to him Iunderstand that the IMF is committed to standing by Thailand to the end nomatter what happens Do you think such a commitment is wise How about suchcommitments between individuals even between husbands and wives            You might try I suppose youare hoping that Congress will do something about the marriage penalty in theincome tax this year Would it make much difference to you            How about The OECD taxfreestore is having a sale on Chanel No  Should I buy some for your wife            Of courseyou could just ask him            Prudencedelightedly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Is itproper etiquette to email thankyou notes It seems OK to send invitations byemail for dinners or parties and I announced my engagement this way to manypeople easier than calling them all on the phone But whenever I email athankyou note for dinner parties or gifts I always end up sending asnailmail note as wellout of guilt I doubt that I will send thankyou notesfor wedding gifts this way but I am curious to know what others thinkespecially Emily Post                                       Pamela L inSeattle                        DearPamela            I dont know what Emily Postthinks She doesnt have an email address I believe thankyou notes topersons you know and care about should be individually handwritten and sent bysnail mail That is a way to show the depth of your gratitude and affectionEven on occasions where use of a printed acknowledgment is appropriate as inacknowledging the receipt of letters of condolence upon bereavement theprinted card should be signed by hand with a personal word added            If youwant to send Bill Clinton a letter thanking him for the fine state of the USeconomy you can send that by email For more information see the White House Web site            Prudencetraditionally                                             DearPrudence

asit ignores any potential need for needlepoint items you might have but all Ican offer is the assurance that it is an honest sentiment Having been born acentury too late this admirer of yours is pleased to see that not everyone hasadopted the social graces of Beavis and ButtHead or for that matter of theaverage politician                                       Mayyour needlepoint suffer from

While hehas been and done so many things to end the relationship forever she is soloving and forgiving Now the big one has happened He took her car  andhas not been seen for four days now He moved here from another state and hissurroundings are new but we as family have tried to bring him into the foldNow hes gone My friends heart is broken and I cant help I think he wasusing her all the time What can I do Im VERY worried about my friendsmentation                                       Help                        DearHelp            You ask what you can do Youcan play only a secondary role Only she can salvage her life If she isdetermined to do that you can help her otherwise you cant            She has to recognize thatthe man is goneas gone as if a truck had hit him Even if he returns he isgone from her and can no longer be a part of her life She also has torecognize that she has behaved very unwisely As you say she was too inloveshe had invested too much of herself in an asset that has turned out tobe a bad risk and eventually a major loss            Now she has to find newinterests Not knowing her I cannot tell what they might bereading musicappreciation of nature volunteer activity church or whatever is closest toher She has to want these as a new life not as stopgaps while she waits forhim to return These new interests will be more valuable to her if she canshare them with someone That is where you may come in It would be betterstill if she could share those interests with someone she loves That cannot beordered up But love is more likely to come if she is an interested andinteresting person            Istrongly recommend that she read a little book by Viktor E Frankl MansSearch for Meaning  It shows what the will to appreciate and restore
