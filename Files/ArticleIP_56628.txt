                                 Three Cheers for Negative Campaigning             Lastweek the Republican Leadership Council began running an ad that accused SteveForbes of tearing down his opponents Wednesday Forbes fired back at the RLCwith his own ad George W Bush says he wants a positive campaign Then whyare Bushs liberal supporters running this negative ad attacking Steve ForbesA Forbes press release added Forbes Calls on Bush To Cease Politics ofPersonal Destruction Against Senator John McCain Meanwhile in theDemocratic race Bill Bradley and Al Gore denounced each others personalattacks and scare tactics Everyone is accusing everyone else of negativecampaigning but nobodys answering the question that ought to come firstWhats wrong with negative campaigning Politicians and journalists pretend toexplain this through a series of platitudes none of which are convincing                            Be nice The RLC says its trying to keep the GOP civilby pressuring Forbes to maintain a high tenor Its ad says Forbes needs to betaught If he doesnt have anything nice to say dont say anything at allBradley gets a similar lecture from the Washington Post  which accuseshim of forsaking his pledge of chivalry by criticizing Gores modestproposals for health care and gun control But whats so great about being niceor chivalrous Bradley thinks Gore is running on a timid platform designed toavoid political heat rather than to solve problems Forbes thinks the same ofBush If theyre right the worst thing they can do for the country is torefrain from pointing out these failings McCain is accused of gettingangry Bradley is much nicer When Gore claimed that Bradleys healthcareplan would bust the budget Bradleys spokeswoman answered Bill Bradleyreserves his anger for the Americans without health insurance Bradley mighthave served those Americans better by directing his anger at Goresmisrepresentations But that would have been impolite                            Stay clean The Post asks whether Bradleyscriticisms of Gores policies belie Bradleys professed rectitude hisdesire to be superclean and his image as an abovethefray politicianBut wheres the virtue in such aloofness Why should Bush get credit forkeeping his hands clean and preserving his abovethefray image if as Forbesalleges he has achieved this by letting the RLC do his dirty work Andshouldnt Bradley get credit by comparison for striding into the fray andleveling his charges squarely at Gore                            Be positive Bradley accuses Gore of offering attacksinstead of a positive vision based on the calculation that its easier tocampaign against your opponent than for yourself Last week former LaborSecretary Robert Reich illustrated Bradleys more positive style Whileendorsing Bradley Reich insisted I wont say anything negative about thevice president What nonsense Anyone who endorses Bradley is saying somethingnegative about Gore Since elections are comparative the difference betweencampaigning against your opponent and campaigning for yourself is semanticWhen Bradley says hes the candidate of big ideas and pollfree principleshes being just as negative as Gore                            Dont hurt others Journalists and wounded politicians loveto equate criticism with assault Bradley says Gores strategy is attackattack attack attack Forbes and the RLC decry each others attack adsThe New York Times says Forbes became known as a slashandburnpolitician for his commercials that lacerated Bob Dole in  Bushmimicking Bill Clinton calls questions about whether he used cocaine thepolitics of personal destruction The Los Angeles Times accuses Bushsrivals of Bush bashing at this weeks GOP debate in Arizona A McCain adviserfears Bush will get out the blowtorch and go after McCain All this soundsawful until you remember that nobody has been attacked bashed slashedburned blowtorched lacerated or destroyed Forbes leveled charges aboutDoles record that could beand wererebutted The bashing Bush endured inthe Arizona debate consisted largely of the observation that he had failed toshow up Clinton turned out to be guilty of the central allegation in theLewinsky scandal and Bush still hasnt answered the cocaine questions Thetruth often hurts It ought to be told anyway                            Dont get personal Bradley has alluded several times tothe  ClintonGore fundraising scandal Monday he cited published reportsthat Clinton administration Cabinet officers are being asked to arrange theirtravel schedules and public announcements so the vice president can finance hispolitical campaign with taxpayer dollars when his funds run out Rather thanrebut Bradleys allegation Gore huffed Personal attacks have no place in acampaign But isnt a campaign exactly the place where Gore should beconfronted if he has indeed abused his position and violated the spirit of thecampaign finance laws How can one person point out anothers misdeeds withoutgetting personal                            Dont throw the first punch The New York Timesthinks Bradley crossed a moral line this week when he began to criticize Goreon his own initiative rather than in response to attacks by Gore Bradleyagrees that a candidate who has been criticized is uniquely entitled to respondin kind Running a positive campaign he argues doesnt mean Im going tostand like this forever and let someone slap my face But why does it matterwhether Gore criticized Bradley first This is a debate not a fistfight IfBradley can explain why Gore would be an inferior president why should he haveto wait to say so                            Dont be insensitive Last week Bradley began airing an adin which a woman says When I was pregnant with my second child Bill Bradleyproposed a law that women be allowed to stay in the hospital for  hoursThanks to Sen Bradley my daughter is alive today When critics pointed outthat Bradleys bill hadnt passed until after the womans daughter was bornBradley accused the Gore campaign of displaying a real insensitivity bychallenging the ad I am appalled that people would attack a woman whoobviously lived through tremendous trauma has her views and expressed themsaid Bradley Never mind whether the ad is true To raise that question is toattack a woman                            Dont scare people Gore has been telling blacks andHispanics that Bradleys healthcare plan would kill Medicaid and provide nosufficient alternative Bradley calls this a scare tactic and says itswrong that Gore is using race or ethnicity to try to scare people But ifGores assertion is true whats wrong with conveying it to the ethnic groupsmost broadly affected Gore isnt calling Bradley a racist Hes making aneconomic argument which Bradley can rebut and has rebutted The scare tacticcharge which implies that Gore is using fear and rhetoric to bypass rationalscrutiny is itself a scare tactic                            Dont be divisive Bradley accuses Gore of poisoning theatmosphere with divisiveness I believe the public wants solutions thatwork not attacks that divide says Bradley Similarly Bush boasts that hesa uniter not a divider while the RLC complains that Forbes by criticizingDole in  caused fighting within the Republican Party that was divisiveand not inclusive Imagine thatfighting and divisiveness in an electionWhats wrong with informing certain segments of the electorate that youropponent is using the feelgood rhetoric of solutions to pull a fast one attheir expense If youre lying shame on you But if youre telling the truthwhy does it matter that your message is divisive                            Dont hurt your party The RLC ad says Forbes hurt theRepublican Party in  and will help the Democrats in  by criticizinghis GOP rivals Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson vows toblow the whistle on candidates who tear down other Republicans MeanwhileBradley is taking heat for questioning Gores campaignfinance practices Inthe good old days says the Post  Bradley was more restraineddeclining to comment on the Clinton administrations fundraising behaviorBut why should Bradley shut up about the ClintonGore fundraising scandal Andwhy should Forbes shut up about what he regards as a Republican betrayal ofconservatism Does loyalty to party supersede loyalty to country                            Dont alienate voters Bradley frets that Gores attackson his healthcare plan will alienate the public and foster skepticism towardbig programs NOW President Patricia Ireland warns the candidates thatnegative campaigning depresses the womens vote On the bright side Forbescampaign manager says this year Forbes is much less likely to run the samekind of negative spots that he did against Dole because four years ago hewas a message candidate Now he believes he can be president But whats wrongwith alienating voters from bad programs and bad candidates And isnt itnobler to deliver a depressingly true message than to shade the truth so youcan get elected                            Dont practicepolitics as usual Just as Forbes accused Dole of playing sneakyWashington politics in  Bradley now castigates Gore for resorting to thetypical Washington politics of slash and burn Gore is delighted toreciprocate There goes Sen Bradley again acting like a typical politicianlaunching negative attacks on Al Gore a Gore spokesman crowed last week Howdoes the fact that such attacks are typical clarify whether Gore is rightabout Bradley or vice versa Never mind All you need to know is that negativecampaigning is the oldest trick in the book And the next oldest trick if youcant answer the charge is to whine about negative campaigning
