              okay so   well what kind of uh programs do yall have up there for recycling   um around here we can recycle almost anything um we have paper and cans and uh newspaper i guess   umhum   um and then i guess plastic and glass its a little harder to do but you we can recycle those as well   is there a curbside service or do you have to take it to a distribution or a collection center   theres curbside but um for items like glass and and plastic its only like once every three weeks or something crazy like that   oh okay   so you have to know what night theyre doing it and youre not allowed to put anything out any other night so   right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of  plastics um but its not real convenient like you said for lots of other things um and it it is kind of nice though because you can put everything in together and you dont have to sort it out which is nice   right oh yeah so you dont have to split anything up   no   oh okay   uh you just they gave us a little bin and you put everything in it theres a little separate top basket thing for the newspaper which is convenient but if you want to recycle anything other than their list you know good luck   well uhhuh   um we have a couple of collection places around but theyre pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people dont have room you know in their house for ten or twenty different bins for all the different sorting things you have to do   right well i uh the last place i lived was really it was in New Jersey as well but it was um it was really a lot hard harder to do it because um its different depending on what town youre in basically every town is different which i think that thats crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but   right well whats kind of interesting is here when the program started they   yeah   made a big deal about it but they only gave it to like five thousand houses which in Atlanta is nothing you know and it was interesting because it was the only reason we got it is because were sort of on the outskirts of this   uhhuh right   rather plush area so  you can tell where they put the recycling uh program in place so Atlanta really hasnt spread it out very much at all yet i dont think um i guess   are you are you   budgetary restraints   oh yeah are you living at school or are you outside of school   um no i live off campus   oh okay so its not just the school thats doing it or   yeah pretty far off right no its its the city the school Georgia Tech has its own well has been trying to get its own recycling program uh uh operated through the student government   okay   but there theyve tried and tried to get an area allotted to them for a collection center and the school keeps saying no because uh theres a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans   right right   for a living and theyre afraid that thats going to attract crime onto campus having a ready supply of cans   oh okay i thought they were afraid of putting them out of work or something   no well i dont know what what you know what their their philosophy was on that   okay   but uh that so they its kind of a crime that we have all these students wanting to do this and no no cooperation to to get that program going   right   but a a friend of mine and i had also thought a while back about doing some recycling on our own to make some money and i think it was interesting i found out that glass is only worth like a penny a pound   umhum   and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make you know if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred pounds well thats great but thats a dollar       so its not a real profitable thing for for people to do   yeah well not for individuals but like my company uh started doing recycling because it became mandatory in the state i i think it was mandatory in the state but they did it and they started a recycling program   uhhuh   just of paper i guess   right   and in two years they saved like four million dollars   wow   um they thats how much money they got paid for their paper   yeah well now i know that i know that the same thing applies for aluminum its much more profitable than glass   and uhhuh   um but i just thought you know we had thought wow this would be a nice little sideline because theres every wed been going out to the bars around here and wed asked at three different places and nobody recycles     uhhuh   so we thought well you got this ready market you know   right   these bars with all this glass and beer bottles and yet theres theres almost no way you could make money at it   right   because the labor and the cost of gas would eat up any profit youd make because glass is you know but im sure that as far as aluminum   uhhuh
