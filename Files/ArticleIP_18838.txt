                                                            STARTING MONDAY IN                                  Slate                              Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter chew over the news in The Breakfast TableAnd save your Sunday Skip the talk shows and let Pundit Central brief you onthem its posted late Sunday evening                                       LengthMatters                        Several readers complained about the length of lastweeks                   Slate on Paper                This is the document available byemail or download around midday each Friday containing a weeks worthof                   Slate                goodies nicely formatted for printout on standard sizepaper Last weeks was especially long  pages because it included ourannual                   Slate                 list of rich people ranked by theircontributions to charity But even in a normal week                   Slate onPaper                has been running around  pages            Meanwhile some AmericaOnline readers have complained about not getting their                   Slate               email at all This was an AOL screw up but weve straightened it out Wehope            As for the length problem We used to limit                   Slate onPaper                to  pages Readers complained that we were leaving out theirfavorite stuff So a few weeks ago we asked readers whether they would prefera file containing everything in                   Slate                each week The overwhelminganswer was yes Even though it will take longer to download Yes Even thoughit will require more pages to print out Yes Youre absolutely sure are youOh yes Because Mommy and Daddy dont want to send you a great big file ifyoure not going to want it Oh yes we want it            So for those who think                  Slate on Paper                is too long youre apparently in the minorityAnd like all minorities in our meltingpot society you should try to blend inand not be so conspicuous Keep quiet and work hard Consider marrying anincludeitall and raising the children that way Theyll grow up to playgolf and download the long version of                   Slate on Paper                and youllfeel like a real American            Many readers did raise a good question Why doesnt the                  Slate on Paper                file allow you to choose which articles you wishto print out instead of all or nothing at all The answer as to so much inlife is Were working on that Or as                   Slate               s crack softwaredevelopment team puts it in the strange argot of their tribe Yeah yeahyeah were working on that            Meanwhile the editor has wasted far too much timepoking around the many byways and culdesacs of Microsoft Word looking forsome quick and dirty solution to this dilemma Although we say so as a sisterdivision of the same company Word is an amazing and underappreciated piece ofsoftware Amazing for the things it can do and underappreciated because no oneknows about them No one knows about them primarily because softwareinstruction manuals get thinner and thinner Even Words online Help in recentversions an annoying talking paper clip that many people quite rightly refuseto interact with doesnt seem to know about some things the program can doWhat other industry besides software goes to the trouble of improving itsproduct and then keeps the improvements a secret            Nevertheless if you usethe Microsoft Word version of                   Slate on Paper                we also offer anAdobe Acrobat version a couple of Words features can help you to print outjust the articles you want Theyre a bit clumsy for this purpose but they dothe job                                             Outline View

    There has got to be a wayusing these and other Wordfeatures such as macros templates fields styles and so on to make a simpleselectiveprintout menu that either could be built into each weeks                   Slateon Paper                file or could be offered as a downloadable tool What aboutusing hidden text Hidden from screen view but printed Or visible on screenbut not printed Or the automatic table of contents generator Could thewhole text be turned into a table of contents What on earth for Strictly asan amateur the editor has tried them all and admits defeat            Is there
