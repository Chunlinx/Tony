                                  Madeleine Albright            The last few publishingseasons have produced a stream of books about the major figures of postwarAmerican foreign policy James Chace on Dean Acheson Kai Bird on McGeorge andWilliam Bundy William Bundy on Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger HenryKissinger on himself to name a few These books are all works of diplomatichistory thick with policy analysis institutional boilerplate and unabashedsecondguessing They focus as one might expect on the bigissuescontainment dtente China Vietnamand on the daytodaycontingencies of democratic politics and imperial diplomacy Personality is forthe most part an analytic construct of interest only to the extent that it canhelp in the understanding of historical events            The two new biographiesof Secretary of State Madeleine K Albright do the opposite using historicalevents to explain the personality of their subject Ann Blackman and MichaelDobbs the authors respectively of Seasons of Her Life A Biography ofMadeleine Korbel Albright and Madeleine Albright A TwentiethCenturyOdyssey  are both accomplished Washington journalists and experiencedforeign correspondents But for all the light they shed on the substance andconduct of US foreign policy they might as well be writing for the stylepages Madeleines story can be read as a personalized version of thetwentieth century announces Dobbs the Washington Post reporter whofirst broke the story of Albrights Jewish background            Blackman a writer for Time who has served as bothWashington bureau chief and Moscow correspondent sketches a virtuallyidentical biography but her view of Albright is more personalized Albrightsgreatest appeal she declares is that she is just like us only wealthierShe has had bad hair days and skirts with spots runs in her stockings a dogthat was skunked  Americans see her as vulnerable a wife rejected asingle mother who went back to work prevailed and raised good kids            Continuing in this veinBlackman titles her last chapterabout the first year or so of Albrightstenure as the most visible diplomat in the worldCelebrity UndoubtedlyMadeleine Albright is a celebrity a word one would hesitate to apply toWarren Christopher Cyrus Vance or Dean Rusk Of her predecessors onlyKissinger exercised a comparable hold over the public imagination but heachieved it by exploiting the drama and mystique of his diplomaticundertakings Albrights celebrity is less a matter of what she has done thanof who she is a candid funny and appealing woman with a life story rich inhuman interest and historical resonance She has also received the startreatment usually accorded pioneers of diversity As the first woman in chargeof a department that traditionally combines gentlemansclub exclusivity withmacho bluster she has figured out how to present herself to the public to themedia and to other world leaders without the benefit of role models            She has for the most part succeeded brilliantly becomingthe most popular and visible member of Clintons secondterm Cabinet Accordingto an anonymous State Department official quoted in the Washington Post Madeleine Albright more than anyone else in this administration is driven byher own biography And she has used her life storyeven those aspects of itthat apparently took her by surprisein the service both of her public imageand of the policies she advocates Her status as an American who fled bothHitler and Stalin gives Albright a certain moral authority just as hersuccess against long odds as a woman in a mans world makes her an appealingfigure But the foreign policy of the worlds superpower cannot be explainedbyand should not be based uponthe life experience of a single person nomatter how tough charming or admirable they might be Albrights biographersoffer an inspiring narrative of how she succeeded in becoming secretary ofstate but they offer scant grounds for evaluating what has happened since Andneither so far has she            Albright was born MarieJana Korbelova Madeleine is the anglicized form of Madlenka her childhoodnickname in Prague in  the eldest child of Josef Korbel a diplomat andMandula Spiegel Though Josefs birth certificate declared him Jewish andlegitimate he habitually wrote no confession on official forms that askedhim his religion His assimilation like that of many Czechoslovakian Jewsbetween the wars seems to have been motivated by a combination of fearambition and patriotism Before the Nazis erased his country from the mapKorbel served as an attach to its Belgrade embassy During the war theKorbels fled to England Many of their relatives including Madeleinesgrandparents on both sides died in the concentration camps Korbel returned toPrague and then to Belgrade to serve his government in the brief periodbetween liberation from the Germans and the Communist coup of  The familyended up in Denver where Josef was a revered professor of internationalrelations until his retirement in  Madeleine and her sister and brotherwere raised as Roman Catholics no mention was ever made of the Korbels Jewishorigins Until Dobbs confronted her with evidence of her ancestry and of thedeaths of her relatives in the Holocaust Albright seems to have lived in astate of willed ignorance declining to challenge her parents account of thepast            If Albrights childhood is marked by the catastrophes of th century European history her early adulthood unfolded amid thecomplacencies of the American s She attended Wellesley on a partialscholarship and soon after graduation she married Joseph Medill PattersonAlbright scion of two prominent newspaper families As she raised their threedaughters and moved from Washington to Long Island and back in the service ofher husbands rather lackluster career in journalism Albright inched her waytoward a PhD under Columbia University Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski In themeantime she worked on the staff of Sen Edmund Muskie DMaine and thenwhen Brzezinski became President Jimmy Carters National Security Adviser ashis liaison to Congress            After her husband lefther for a younger woman Albrights professional ambition accelerated In she was foreign policy adviser to vice presidential candidate GeraldineFerraro By  she was advising presidential candidate Michael Dukakis Inthe course of that doomed crusade she met Bill Clinton and wrote him a letterof recommendation to the Council on Foreign Relations A few years later henamed her ambassador to the United Nations            Albrights UN tenure is best remembered for two thingsher sandbagging of SecretaryGeneral Boutros BoutrosGhali and her proclamationthat Cubas shooting down of planes flown by antiCastro exiles took notcojones  but cowardice Both of these statements were calculated toplay well at home and to outrage the rest of the world Since becomingsecretary of state in early  Albright has similarly done better on thedomestic front than in the international sphere enjoying a long mediahoneymoon holding hands with Sen Jesse Helms RNC persuading arecalcitrant Congress to ratify the chemical weapons conventions and pushingfor NATO expansion But halfway through her term in office the Middle Eastpeace process is moribund US China policy is mired in incoherence and theIndian subcontinent is locked in a nuclear arms race And this is not tomention East Timor Southern Sudan or Saddam Hussein It can be argued inAlbrights defense that international affairs is no longer the grand chessmatch of the Cold War yearsits more like a floating crap game But thecomplexity and instability of the world are hardly excuses for the muddle andindirection of the worlds only great power            It was Albright afterall who titled a  memo to Clinton Why America Must Take the Lead Thesubject of that memo was Bosnia and while Ambassador Albright emerged as theadministrations leading hawk on a number of fronts arguing for interventionin Haiti and in Rwanda she made the case for how the United States should takethe leadby threatening and if necessary using forcewith special passionabout the American role in the Balkans            The Bush administrations approach to the unfoldingdisaster in Yugoslavia might be characterized as inaction backed up byindifference Until last month the Clinton administration preferred calls foraction backed up by indecision Writing in the New York Review of Books Mark Danner has argued that the administrations predilection for tough talkcoupled with its political timidity did much to make matters worse in BosniaIn  Clinton urged on by Albright rejected out of hand the VanceOwenplan for partition of the country saying that it rewarded Serb aggression Twoyears later after the massacres at Srebrenica and Vukovar the slaughter anddisplacement of tens of thousands more Croats and Muslims the decimation ofSarajevo and the Serb conquest of more territory the administration pushedthrough the Dayton Accords This agreement which gave the Serbs a great dealmore than VanceOwen would have was puffed as a Nobelworthy diplomaticaccomplishment In the meantime Albright had promoted the United Nationsdisastrous Safe Havens policy which placed masses of unarmed Bosniancivilians under the protection of minuscule numbers of UN but no UStroopsthat is left them at the mercy of Serb paramilitaries whosystematically set about driving them from their homes and killing them            The administrations failure to act effectively inBosnia or in Rwanda cant be blamed entirely or even primarily on Albrightwhose job at the time was peripheral to the making and implementing of policyNor can the Kosovo campaign be called Albrights war even though it was theutter failure of her attempted diplomacy at Rambouillet along with the failureof her onetime rival Richard Holbrooke in Belgrade that helped to precipitatethe current conflict But the NATO campaign against Milosevic is often andrightly viewed as the victory of Albrights interventionist position over themore cautious views of colleagues such as National Security Adviser SamuelBerger and his predecessor Anthony Lake The genesis of that position Albrighthas insisted lies in her own life story Her view of the world she repeats asthough it were a mantra was formed not by Vietnam but by Munich by thefailure of the great powers to check totalitarian aggression in Central EuropeBut as the war over Kosovo escalates such analogies prove to be of limited andrapidly diminishing use It is likely that future secretaries of state will saythat the formative experience of their lives was Kosovo What they mean whenthey say that rather than how she got to be where she is will determineAlbrights place in history
