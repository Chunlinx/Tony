                    Background        The replicative polymerase of herpes simplex virus HSV        is comprised of catalytic Pol and processivity subunits        UL      HSV Pol is responsible in concert with        other viral proteins for regulating the fidelity of DNA        replication by selecting the correct nucleotides for        incorporation and by proofreading or editing mispaired        nucleotides     The Pol subunit contains intrinsic         exonuclease activity      and the Nterminal        region of the polypeptide encoding this function is highly        conserved in other polymerases containing three segments        referred to as Exo motifs             Thymidine kinase polypeptide TK is required for the        activation of some antiviral nucleoside analogs eg        acyclovir ACV and penciclovir PCV in order to inhibit        viral DNA replication HSV with TK mutations may impair        activation of these drugs and confer a drugresistant        phenotype The natural phenomenon of spontaneous mutation        which occurs in the absence of drug selection results in        the accumulation of approximately six to eight TKdeficient        variants per  plaqueforming viruses in virus        populations that have never been exposed to selective        pressure       Furthermore HSV clinical isolates        were shown to have a higher frequency of spontaneous        mutations resistant to ACV and PCV approximately fold        compared to HSV isolates and the majority of these        mutations are in         tk  Consistent with this        observation HSV strains also exhibited approximately a         to fold higher spontaneous mutation rate to        cidofovir HPMPC an inhibitor of HSV Pol resistance        compared with HSV     Therefore these        naturallyoccuring mutations are not unique to         tk and TK substrates as detected with        antiviral agents ACV and PCV but were extended with the        direct Pol inhibitor HPMPC to other loci most likely         pol         Since mutations within the viral         pol gene have been previously shown        to affect spontaneous viral mutation rates     the        higher frequency of errors associated with type  viruses        may be an inherent property of the type  Pol To assess        the direct contribution of polymerases from virus types         and  to mutation frequency recombinant HSV expressing a        type  Pol within a type  viral genome were generated by        marker transfer and examined along with a panel of other        HSV isolates in

and           described in     or HSV           pol SC and PAA r coding          regions were cotransfected with replication defective          HP viral DNA containing a LacZ insertion within           pol    into Vero cells to          generate recombinant viruses Recombinant viruses were          successfully obtained for all pols except wild type HSV          SC and the low error rate or antimutator HSV PAA r              The           pol recombinant viruses were          plaquepurified and the           pol genes completely sequenced          along with those of their parental viruses to confirm the          recombination event Three of the HSV viruses HSV          SB HSV  and HSV D had           pol sequences consistent with wild          type isolates found in GeneBank and were recently          characterized              The           pol from HSV  a virus which          showed a  to fold higher error rate than HSV          SC by the           tk mutagenesis assay previously              was found to contain three mutations compared to          the other HSV           pols  with one change residing in          region VII which is shared among diverse DNA polymerases          Fig  No amino acid changes were identified within          the proofreading Exo domains The high frequency of          errors generated by HSV  did not appear to preclude          its ability to replicate efficiently in culture In fact          no significant differences in the growth curve of          parental and recombinant viruses in Vero cells compared          to wild type HSV SB were apparent data not          shown                          tkmutagenesis assay          The proportions of virus resistant to ACV or PCV          which arise during amplification of virus stocks in the          absence of drug selection were measured by the method          described by Hall et al     Plating efficiency          assays were performed in MRC cells at  gml ACV          which is times higher than the average IC            for HSV SVC and at  gml          ACV which is times higher than the average IC            for the panel of HSV viruses          Notably whereas the four HSV parental viruses had          spontaneous mutation frequencies significantly higher          than HSV isolates Table  the frequency of errors          from           pol recombinant viruses expressing          an HSV Pol in an HSV background were          indistinguishable from HSV SC when tested in MRC          cells In fact three of the type            pol recombinant viruses SBPR          PR and DPR had error rates equal to or slightly          lower than HSV SC  Results were similar for          plating efficiency with PCV data not shown In this          assay the HSV Pol does not appear to be solely          responsible for the difference in drugresistant          spontaneous           tk mutations observed between HSV          and HSV strains          Interestingly unlike the other           pol recombinant viruses PR          containing the           pol coding region from the          supermutator clinical isolate HSV  retained a high          spontaneous mutation frequency This recombinant virus          showed a sixtyfold increase in mutation frequency          compared to HSV SC Table  This increase in errors          is most likely the direct result of the mutations          identified within the           pol coding region and suggests that          this virus may indeed possess a Pol defect in replication          fidelity The fact that the PR mutation frequency was           whilst parental HSV  was  implicates          the targettemplate or other viral proteins in modulating          spontaneous mutations                          Drugindependent mutation frequency using nonHSV          DNA          To eliminate any contribution of drug selection or           tk gene template on the spontaneous          mutation frequency in the           tk mutagenesis assay non          drugselected HSV replicationdependent mutations within          an unrelated prokaryotic gene were measured using a LacZ          shuttle plasmid assay This assay employed transfection          of a plasmid containing the  bp SmaI fragment of ori           s  the HSV origin of replication and          a LacZ reporter gene into Vero cells This plasmid was          confirmed to generate DpnIresistant progeny in Vero          cells upon superinfection with the wild type HSV and          HSV data not shown After superinfection           DpnI resistant nonmethylated          replicated plasmid DNA was rescued in           E coli  In the presence of XGal          bacterial colonies which turn blue do not contain          mutations in the LacZ promoter or LacZ coding region          However colonies remaining white contain mutations to          impair LacZ expression          Mutations can be introduced during replication by the          viral proteins or also by the mutagenic processes of          transfection and viral infection Since the process of          transfection is often mutagenic pSV was transfected          into Vero cells mockinfected and rescued into bacteria          to determine background frequency of mutation from the          experimental process Transfection was found to confer a          mutation frequency less than   white colonies in          over  total colonies after analyzing nonDpnI          treated samples No colonies were recovered when treating          the rescued DNA with DpnI Moreover to ensure that viral          replication and not simply the process of viral          infection is responsible for the mutations in a rescued          plasmid a control transfectionsuperinfection was          performed using the           pol mutant HP which is unable          to replicate The mutation frequency contributed directly          from the process of viral infection was   in          over  colonies after analyzing nonDpnI treated          samples Less than  colonies were recovered when          treating the rescued DNA with DpnI The data presented in          Table was normalized by subtracting the mutation          frequency for HP infection            The relative mutation frequency for the panel of          viruses tested in the nonHSV DNA mutagenesis assay are          presented in Table  Consistent with recent data from          Hwang et al     PAA r showed a minor increase in          mutation frequency compared with wild type HSV and          HSV Table  The presence of an antimutator phenotype          with this viral polymerase in the           tk mutagenesis assay was not          apparent when using the nonHSV DNA mutagenesis assay          and therefore phenotypelabelling may be dependent upon          both the assay method andor the target gene Moreover          the panel of wild type HSV viruses and the PR viruses          in this LacZ phenotypic assay had mutation frequencies          similar or below that of wild type HSV SC Thus the          high proportion of errors associated with HSV viruses          appears specific to the           tk mutagenesis assay          HSV  although not PR conferred a slightly          higher proportion of mutations in nonHSV DNA in the          plasmid assay than wild type HSV and HSV consistent          with a mutator phenotype Sequencing of the Pol encoded          from HSV  confirmed several residue changes which          may contribute to the higher error rate although the          direct relationship of these individual mutations within          the           pol coding region to decreased Pol          fidelity has not been confirmed Figure  It remains          unclear whether a conserved residue change Lys to Arg at           in region VII a motif purported to participate in          the recognition of the PPi and nucleotide substrates              or whether one or more of the other three residue          changes identified in HSV            pol cooperate to affect mutation          frequency                          Anisomorphic DNA conformations          Reiterated sequence elements are often observed to          form an unwound S nucleasesensitive DNA conformation          termed anisomorphic or lefthanded DNA when present in          negatively supercoiled plasmids               Nucleasesensitive secondary structures within the HSV          origin of replication are believed to be recognized by          the viral origin binding protein and mutations that          reduce this complex formation in vitro also reduce viral          replication thereby indicating that localized torsional          strain may occur during viral DNA replication     The                    tk mutagenesis assay measures          replicationdependent mutation frequency within the           tk gene whereas the nonHSV DNA          mutagenesis assay measures errors within a bacterial LacZ          gene Three pUCbased plasmids were examined for the          potential to form S nuclease sensitive structures pTK          which contains a  Kb HSV DNA fragment including the           tk coding region pTK containing a           Kb HSV DNA fragment including the           tk coding region and pLacZ which          contains the  Kb LacZ coding region These negatively          supercoiled plasmids were treated with S nuclease or          mocktreated for  min After removal of the nuclease          the plasmids were linearized with HindIII Figure shows          that treatment of pTK and pLacZ with S nuclease did not          alter the restriction enzyme profile suggesting that in          this assay the formation of S nucleasesensitive          structures was below the level of detection Fig           lanes  However pTK was readily digested with S          nuclease which resulted in the appearance of four novel          bands suggesting two potential nucleasehypersensitive          sites Fig  lane  Additional restriction mapping          studies suggest that the hypersensitive regions are          within the viral DNA fragment and not in pUC DNA data          not shown                            Discussion        The         tk mutagenesis assay has been        utilized by ourselves and others     to determine        both frequency and spectrum of mutations in the HSV         tk gene following selection for drug        resistance In this study we have extended the findings of        previous work    by using         pol recombinant viruses to examine        mutation frequency in HSV Specifically this study        evaluated the contribution of type  polymerase to mutation        frequency when measured by the         tk mutagenesis and nonHSV DNA        mutagenesis assays        The control viruses HSV  and HSV PAA r        demonstrated mutator or antimutator phenotypes        respectively in the         tk mutagenesis assay but not in the        nonHSV DNA mutagenesis assay Thus classification of a         pol gene as mutator HSV  or        antimutator PAA r is not a general characteristic but        is likely dependent upon the assay method and target gene        This observation is consistent with the recent report of        high mutation frequency within the         SupF gene upon replication by PAA r                   Since the control viruses described above functioned as        expected in the tk mutagenesis assay recombinant viruses        expressing the HSV polymerase within an HSV genome were        also examined Interestingly three wild type HSV        polymerases  D and SB showed mutation frequencies        similar to HSV SC rather than their parental virus        when placed within an HSV genome Only HSV         maintained a high error rate fold over that of HSV        SC when placed within an HSV genome However the        mutation frequency of this recombinant virus HSV PR        was not completely penetrant when compared to the parental        HSV  virus which showed a fold higher percent of        resistant mutants compared to HSV SC        An important distinguishing factor between the         tk mutagenesis and LacZ test systems        is the use of antiviral selectors to measure mutation        frequency Silent mutations within the         tk gene that do not impair        susceptibility to antiviral agents or mutations resulting        in lethality of the virus would escape detection as a        mutation in the         tk mutagenesis assay Futhermore the        DNA sequence being replicated is unique between these        systems and this could contribute to the differences in        mutation frequency between assay systems The demonstration        of S nucleasesensitive sites within the type  viral        genome overlapping the tk coding region and the absence of        such sites in the type  viral genome suggest that local        topology may be different between these HSV and HSV        Although the potential contribution of this        supercoilinginduced phenomenon to modulate mutation        frequency during viral replication is unclear it could        partially explain why the type  polymerases confer a high        mutation frequency to HSV genomes and a low mutation        frequency when placed within an HSV genome Changes in        local topology could contribute to polymerase slippage and        the incorporation of errors        The inability of type  viruses to confer a higher        mutation rate than type  viruses in the nonHSV DNA        mutagenesis assay is consistent with the absence of S        nuclease hypersensitive sites in the LacZ gene fragment        Furthermore the HSV         tk sequence used herein contained        almost  GC content compared to the HSV         tk which has  of bases as G or C        Melting temperature alone may not contribute to the        difference in S nuclease sensitivity However alignment        of the         tk sequences showed that the type         gene had at least eight distinct stretches containing        between  and  GC bases whereas the overlapping region        in the type          tk had four or less GC bases This        differential in more extensive GC rich regions supports        the observations reported herein        The data presented herein clearly demonstrate that        polymerase alone may not account for the high mutation        frequency associated with type  viruses in the tk        mutagenesis assay In addition to the potential impact of        target sequence and secondary structure topology on        mutation frequency other viral replicative proteins        including Pol accessory protein TK dUTPase and        uracilDNA glycosylase may cooperate with Pol to modulate        polymerase repair and nucleotide selection                                  Competing interests        None declared
