                                 Is  Everybody Happy            Heres the least controversial principle in allstatecraft Never pass up an opportunity to make everyone happier at the sametime Admittedly opportunities like that are vanishingly rarealmost anythingyou propose is likely to make someone unhappyso the principle is asuseless in practice as it is compelling in theory But if you want to talkabout the difference between good and bad policy it helps to have anuncontroversial starting point            This particular startingpoint has proved useful enough to earn a proper name Economists call it thePareto Principle in honor of the  th century economist VilfredoPareto The party line among economists is that although we disagree about amyriad of issues at least were all good Paretians If you can think of a wayto make everyone happier were behind you all the way            How disturbing then to realize that the Pareto Principleconflicts with another value that some of us hold at least equally deartheright of individuals to make free choices Heres a stylized example Supposesome people call them the prudes cherish their freedom of religion but nothalf so much as they would cherish a general ban on pornography Others callthem the lewds cherish their right to read Lady Chatterleys Loverbut not half so much as they would cherish a general ban on religion Then ifyou outlawed both pornography and religion youd make everyone happierwhile simultaneously making everyone less free            The Pareto Principledemands that we embrace such a law while the fundamental precepts of liberalismdemand that we recoil from it As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen pointed out years ago theres no such thing as a Paretian liberal When some people getpleasure from controlling other people the Paretians and the liberals mustpart ways            Thats no problem in practice because in practice therewill always be liberals who are offended by bookbanningand the veryexistence of those liberals leads the Paretian to withdraw his endorsement ofthe ban Remember the Pareto Principle endorses only changes that makeeveryone happier including the liberals But in practice nobody isguided solely by the Pareto Principle anyway Instead were guided by moreflexible criteria such as the costbenefit principle A policy is good when itsbenefits exceed its costs with benefits or costs measured by what theproponents or opponents would be willing to pay to see the policy enacted ordefeated            Under quite general circumstances it can be provedthough not in the space of a single magazine column that free markets yieldexactly those outcomes the costbenefit principle recommends That makes iteasy to reconcile a taste for economic welfare with a taste for individualliberty Usually markets deliver both at once            Usually but not always With just a slightmodification the paradox of the Paretian liberal reasserts itself in thecostbenefit context Suppose Im willing to pay  to read the subversiveworks of Paul Krugman and youre willing to pay  to stop me A strictcostbenefit analysis suggests that Krugmans writing should be banned            Theres no need for aban if you can locate me and offer me say  to change my readinghabitsand if you can be assured that I wont just take the money and run Butlets suppose the impracticality of such arrangements leaves bookbanning asthe only realistic alternative            Thats a conclusion we liberals find repugnant and itwould be nice to avoid it One way out is simply to declare that psychic costsdont count If you dont like getting your nose punched your aversion goesinto the costbenefit calculus and inspires us to write laws that discouragenosepunching But if you dont like knowing I read Krugman thats your ownproblem            Appealing as thatposition might sound its also suspiciously incoherent If my habit of readingKrugman and my habit of punching your nose are equally painful to you whyshould public policy discourage one and not the other            One answer is that psychic costs shouldnt count becausetheyre too easy to exaggerate Anyone can claim to have suffered  millionworth of emotional distress but we have no way of knowing which claims aresimply fabricated Amazingly though this seemingly insurmountable problem canbe surmounted A sufficiently clever system of taxes and subsidies can inducepeople to make accurate reports of their own emotional distress I lookforward to explaining how such systems work in a forthcoming column            The second argument against counting psychic harmis that once you start counting it people train themselves to start feelingit That one I suspect is harder to refute            The mirror image of apsychic cost is a psychic benefit The New York Times reports thateconomists with the Army Corps of Engineers charged with executing acostbenefit analysis of undamming the Snake River in eastern Washington planto factor in something they call existence valuethe value of the psychicbenefit people get from knowing the river is running wild            In principle existence value makes perfect sense If yourAunt Agnes just cant stand the idea of people damming the Snake River heranguish is a real cost of maintaining the dam Of course its also true thatif your Aunt Agnes just cant stand the idea of people reading the New YorkTimes  her anguish is a real cost of allowing freedom of the press Ifwere intellectually consistent well cater either to both those preferencesor to neither            Not that everyone values intellectual consistencyProfessor Tom Stevens of the University of Massachusetts is identified in theTimes as an environmentalist who is skeptical of the concept ofexistence value The source of his skepticism What if you add up all thesenumbers and they dont come out in our favor So much for statecraft as adispassionate attempt to balance competing interests If the goal is simply tomake the numbers come out the way you want them to youre not a policyanalyst youre just a bully
