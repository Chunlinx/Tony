                                 Alphabet Soup            As regular readers of suchpublications as Greek Roman and Byzantine Studies  the ClassicalJournal  and the Journal of Biblical Literature are by now wellaware a dispute has long simmered about whether people in ancient times readto themselves silently as we moderns do or mostly read aloud The unequivocalreferences in ancient sources to silent reading are few and the context oftensuggests that the practice is unusual St Augustine describes with amazementhow the great Ambrose bishop of Milan could follow the written text with hiseyes even as his voice and tongue stayed still            The majority view today isthat reading aloud was the rule in antiquitya view that has now receivedpowerful new support from Paul Saenger a medievalist and curator at theNewberry Library in Chicago Saenger observes in Space Between Words TheOrigins of Silent Reading that most ancient texts virtually demanded to beread aloud because the words were written in what is known as scripturacontinua that is they were all run togetherforcingthereadertosoundeverythingout Then in the sixth and seventh centuriesIrishspeaking monks for whom the Latin of literature and Scripture was aforeign language began inserting spaces just to help tell all thoseunfamiliar words apart Irish manuscript traditions went on to influence thewhole Western world and the separation of words became a universalconventionthereby making silent reading practical Silent readingnow sovast and entrenched that we take it for grantedseems to have come about moreor less by happy accident            Specialists will no doubt be arguing over Saengers thesis for years tocomedont let your subscription to Greek Roman and Byzantine Studieslapse But I was drawn to the argument of Space Between Words for tworeasons First it treats words as physical objects produced by physical meansand designed to be understood by physical beings and second it reminds us ofthe breathtaking role serendipity can play in matters of language            The physicality of words is something we tend to lose sightofliterallyalthough the consequences of physicality are inescapable andoften startling Some years ago I shouldered the rewarding and not veryexacting task of editing some articles by Bernard Lewis distinguished scholarof the Arab world At one point in our conversations the subject drifted and Ifound myself asking Lewisthinking he was bound to knowabout the kind ofancient Greek writing that was written from left to right on one line thenfrom right to left on the next then from left to right again and so onYoure thinking of boustrophedon  he replied at once The term comesfrom Greek words that describe the way an oxdrawn plough turns in afield            I pursuedthe matter a little further asking how such a writing system came to beLewis answer emerged after a pleasant subterranean rumbling that I took to belaughter though his answer was entirely serious It probably arose hesaid from the practice of writing long inscriptions on cliff faces Imaginehe went on lowering a chap with his chisel from the top of a monument andmoving him along as he does his work What do you do when he finishes the firstline Do you haul him all the way back to where he started Or do you just drophim down a few feet to the next line and then let him continue his work in theopposite direction The subterranean rumbling resumed for a moment making itclear the answer should be obvious            In his  memoir Running in the Family thenovelist and poet Michael Ondaatje wrote evocatively about the alphabet helearned in Sri Lanka as a boy making note of the aesthetic consequences of yetanother technological imperative            I still believe the mostbeautiful alphabet was created by the Sinhalese The insect of ink curves intoa shape that is almost sickle spoon eyelid The letters are washed bluntglass which betray no jaggedness Sanskrit was governed by verticals but itssharp grid features were not possible in Ceylon Here the Ola leaves whichpeople wrote on were too brittle A straight line would cut apart the leaf andso a curling alphabet was derived from its Indian cousin            There hasbeen no lack of commentary about the consequences that the latest version ofOla leavescomputers and electronic textwill have on the future of readingwriting and the Word and I have no wish to revisit all the speculative BigQuestions here Sven Birkerts Michael Joyce Steven Johnson and the rest ofthe gang can agonize or exult over these without any outside help Many issueswill simply remain up in the air for years to come no matter what anyonesays            Still computers and electronic text have already wroughtchanges in the way the worlds words are constructed In Japan individualshave long been accustomed to elaborating upon the way their basic names arewritten in kanji characterspersonalizing names with a flourish of extracharacters or with added or subtracted strokes Those flourishes now must cometo an end for official purposes in the interest of computer standardizationLikewise the Association of Spanish Language Academies has voted to eliminatech as in chorizo  and ll as in llama  as distinct lettersin what had been a letter Spanish alphabet An extra Spanish letter nthe one with the tilde remains in place for now The Germans for their parthave begun this year to phase out their distinctive letter for a double sthe letter that looks somewhat like an English capital B            The forcesthat are

counterintuitive predictionElectronic media will usher in a resurgence in the quality and value inhandwriting Signs of a renaissance of the handwritten word are here and therediscernible Most obviously there is the proliferation of specialty shops forfountain pens and handmade paper But it can also be seen hauntingly in thealmost sacral reception given to Ronald Reagans handwritten letter
