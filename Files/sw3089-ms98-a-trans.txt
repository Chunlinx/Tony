                okay um Sunday i went to see Robin Hood along with fifty million other people   hi bet you stood in a long line didnt you   no we got really lucky the first theater that we went to was sold out so we ran down the road to another one and it wasnt too bad it was pretty crowded once we got in there     well youve seen the more recent one than i have then i have we dont usually go out to movies we usually wait until we can watch them at home   yeah thats really a lot of fun too   right uh we have been trying to get out to go but it just seems like with working and   well and its so expensive unless you go yeah i mean   and it is getting that way isnt it well did you like Robin Hood   yeah i did um i hadnt seen any of the earlier ones so i really didnt know what to expect but they had injected a lot of humor into it which i really liked   yes the previews look like that thats the way it was   yeah and so and there was a lot of action lot of swashbuckling type of things         but um i really liked the humor of course i love Kevin Costner so that helped   oh yeah well thats needless to say really did you see Dances With Wolves Dancing   it doesnt hurt to sit and watch him for two hours   no i never went to see that one   i havent either we want too uh because everyone tells us that wed better go see it on a wide screen so   yeah thats definitely what i want to do but i think by then that might even be at the dollar movies   so well uh maybe so ill have to check that out  but uh i think that some of the most recent ones weve gotten and rented have been Ghost and   yeah oh really did you like that   yes did you   yes very much   uhhuh in fact uh you know its one of those things that i want to see more than once   yeah yeah definitely   yes and uh oh we got Memphis Belle and all the things that are out at the current time   now is that the one is that the one with uh whos in Memphis Belle   thats about the airplane the old airplane   the airplane yeah was that good   yes its good   huh i didnt realize that was already on video   it is its been out about the same time Ghost came out   oh   yeah so we we uh well i watch and grab the first one that comes out       and of course we have some grandchildren so were taping or or watching as many of the  cartoon types as we can get and get them and uh   oh yeah well my cable had a Disney preview on this weekend and so i taped a bunch of shows off of that   yeah right yes well weve gotten our children are still small so uh we just they like the little Peter Pans and all that sort of thing   uhhuh oh yeah i have a niece that is just in love with The Littlest Mermaid she just thinks thats the best show in the world   yes well they have a a movie out now and i saw it at Blockbusters and its called Baby Talk Baby Songs   huh   and our little two year old granddaughter just loves it and its real  down to her level its songs about getting up and getting dressed and getting dressed on your own by yourself and   oh really thatd be neat   it tells you that youre a miracle and theres nobody like you and  its very uh   huh ill have to go get that my little two year old niece is coming to see me for her vacation so i guess ill go see if i can get that   you would she would really love it and were even thinking about uh buying a copy of it of the tape to put in our church library because i think its a its a real excellent movie to sort of build kids little kids egos up and tell them that they can   oh yeah yeah   theyre individuals and they can do what they want to on their own and and its its a real real nice little movie   huh well that would be neat yeah i was a when i was growing up i was the victim of that of the Cinderella movie because they say that now girls my age have the Cinderella syndrome where they think that their prince is going to come and solve all their problems     oh  that doesnt happen doesnt not in real life yeah so   no   well i think that uh i think that it sounds like that our lives run along the same path  as far as movies go we kind of like the same thing   yeah yeah i really enjoy comedies and then   i do too and and love stories im not for much into Silence of the Lamb or anything like that   yeah no i wouldnt go see that if i had to i dont think id id have nightmares     i would too i just im not interested at all     no therere have been a few theyre not really spy movies i guess theyre suspenseful movies that yeah that dont have a lot of the blood and gore because i just cant deal with that but i do kind of like the suspense   well now thats thats not bad no who wants to yes exactly   i mean you know i i love old old Hitchclock Hitchcock classics things like that but some of the rest yeah i wouldnt go see Silence of The Lambs if i had to   uhhuh yeah i like those too yeah right no no thatd be the last one on our list   yeah   oh shoot   but um Backdraft is supposed to be really good   yes oh i want to see that one too   yeah my sisterinlaw said she just really enjoyed that that had been one of the better ones she had seen all summer   well good   so i guess ill have to eventually get to that one   yeah exactly   huh well do you tape movies off the TV   well yes yes in fact a lot of times ill scan through the program to see if i can find something that wed like to tape to watch during our during the week   yeah yeah  well especially right now because therere all reruns just on regular TV   but i dont find many yeah exactly and i dont find too many   yeah its kind of difficult well like i said this weekend Disney had Singing in the Rain on and so i taped it     yes yeah weve weve got that on tape too from once before channel thirteen uh put that on because oh somehow or other they had interrupted it   oh really   so they put it on straight through without any commercials in it and so we got it that night and ive got all the old musicals like Oklahoma and um Hello Dolly   oh wow yeah oh yeah thats like watching that Disney preview theyre going to have South Pacific on and i mean just all these great old classic musicals and i thought boy i think im going to have to trade in my HBO and get Disney   oh my gosh oh thats wonderful yeah  you know well i was just thinking about  maybe we ought to have Disney   well oh i would love to have it but you know its kind of hard to justify when you dont have children   yeah well thats true but you know looking through the program as i do i see a lot of things on there that are not just for children yeah so   oh yeah well especially with all those old musicals because i just love them   i do too i love all the old musicals and all the like you said the old Alfred Hitchcock and uh just old movies   yeah yeah i taped uh Funny Girl was on a couple of weeks ago so i taped that one   oh really yeah um i guess i missed that   yeah theres a lot of fun ones that was like on channel twenty one so it it had the commercials in between it but you can fast forward through those   oh uhhuh well thats okay yes exactly  oh well uh you sound like that you like are like us you dont go out too much to the movies but   no we really dont i mean we we both work and so were exhausted when we get home and then the weekends theres always so much to do to catch up from what you didnt do all week   we do too isnt that the truth  thats exactly the truth   so really i think Sunday going to see Robin Hood was the first time i had gone with my husband to the show in a year probably   well i have uh one son still at home and they went to see that the other day too liked it real well   yeah yeah   and uh he goes to movies but and hell come home and hell say well youll like this and youll like that so or he he and i pretty well like the same thing so   umhum well it really has gotten outrageous though with the prices because i mean if you are a young kid trying to go on a date itd cost you a fortune   yeah well they pretty well have to go Dutch  they really do   yeah or go to the Saturday afternoon cheap show   yeah exactly oh shoot well i say it was nice talking to you about it   well you too and maybe ill get you
