talk Well my wife is theone who refuses to talk Instead of leaving normal notes such as Please takeout the garbage or Dont forget to pick up milk on the way home she leavesme long four page handwritten letters about concern for each othersfeelings sharing chores etc When I ask her if it wouldnt be easier to sitdown and talk things out she says Why Ive already put it inwriting

their car horns rather than park get out and ring the bell ofthe person theyve come to pick up This happens as late as midnight                                       When I politely ask thedrivers to stop this they use profanity ignore me or threaten violence Myneighbors say theyll speak to their friends about this behavior but if theyhave done so it hasnt worked Getting the police to respond has been uselessand seems petty anyway                                       Manytimes these horns have awakened me from sleep I have used up my patience Whatcan I do                                       Horny in LA                        DearHorn            Have you tried earplugsPrudie is not being facetious Having done a turn in Los Angeles herself sheknows the men in blue are not going to come for people blowing horns sincethey ignored her calls regarding people blowing leaves            And sinceyou are getting nowhere with the drivers or the neighbors mental healthwould seem to dictate that you handle the situation with the bestselfprotection available Think like a stepper Accept that which youcannot change and have the wisdom to know what those things are Or think likea Zen master There is no solution Seek it lovingly            Prudiephilosophically                                             DearPrudence                                                      My friend is  and is nowcarrying the child of the man she has been with for about a year They dontlive together they rarely go out on dates and when they see each other itnormally means one spending the night at the others place There are timeswhen they dont hear from each other for several days There is nothing herethat resembles commitment The father still has not decided what his role isgoing to be if any                                       Inshort hes being a real jerk and it makes me damned angry to see my friendsuffering and stressing out because of this caveman given her delicatecondition What should
