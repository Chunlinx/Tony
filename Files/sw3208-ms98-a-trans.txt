        okay well basically  i  am a mother of a three year old so i can kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because its uh     uhhuh   extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that and uh ive been pretty selective and what im finding is with um   right   day cares that are like day care centers like  for instance uh Learning Tree or KinderCare and all of that what i find is that theyre highly structured highly organized   umhum   almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time   uhhuh   uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of parents hours they are differ and when i bring my daughter into a such a system like that uh they only have one thing going on thats nap time everybodys napping whether they came there an hour before or they came at right during that time and with that kind of a system my daughter   umhum   just isnt likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot so um home day care has been an option and ive looked into that the only thing is you raise the question of   umhum   is it safe uh can you trust the people you know um   thats right  and you never know i have um an exsisterinlaw that um currently has a child abuse case on a home babysitter   sure oh sure sure thats really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially home day care i mean i think center day cares theres so many people coming in and out   uhhuh right   that youre better off if youre going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours its fine it depends on the age of the child now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while but home teaching  home day care works well if its an infant if its   right   if its if you wanna have kind of like a family structuring where theres a home that they can  be provided because ive seen things at the day care where they cant keep up with all the kids the kids have   umhum right   colds and theyre sick all the time and the
