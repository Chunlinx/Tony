        some of the TV shows that uh i i like are usually something that shows me something about a profession that i dont necessarily know how it operates and one of the earliest shows that uh taught me something was the old Bewitched shows when i was growing up i remember thinking so thats how the advertising game is played thats how they developed these things thats where commercials come from and i really didnt uh before that i think that was the very first show that i ever realized that on and then   right   oh a little bit later i dont particularly like LA Law as a series but i do like some of the insights not so much into the legal profession but into the the fact that some of the well for instance some of the deals that are made by the DA you know you read about some of these things and it sounds really bad well you dont know whats gone on before   right   um they had one case where uh the DA had been injured she had been hurt and you know was a little bit fearful of of making friends uh any enemies at the moment   right   so uh just little things like that makes well theres a human behind this little story you know that that was was written up in the paper that DA cuts a bad deal   yeah   as well as some of the the arguments on you know a guy gets arrested for DWI well depending upon what the guy says hes going to say in court regardless of the truth what the guy says hes going to say is you know is fifteen minutes later before they gave me the test and all these kinds of things and you could probably get away you know get off on it so they just plea bargained it out and is just done with it   sure   oh i i those little things i guess i have to be reminded that therere therere so many details that just dont get out that you cant uh cant take the reported word for some of these things so i guess i like shows that that show me something some insights into other parts of of living that i dont always get exposed to how about yourself   right i i dont know ive i like tend to like a lot of the old uh older TV shows like uh for instance there theres i love watching old Twilight Zones and uh theyve theyve been theres a station station here that runs mostly syndicated things and thats one thing i like to catch on late at night is the old Twilight Zones but uh for TV thats out right now i i the shows i like to see for one reason or another that ive been catching um Matlock and Tuesday nights for some some are i guess are my TV night and i like to see uh Matlock and then In the Heat of the Night uh   uhhum   are two shows that that i like to see after seeing the the television show In the Heat of the Night i wanted i havent never seen the movie but uh i think id like to check out that movie sometime its uh   right   i dont know its just kind of interesting they have great characters in that uh TV show and its interesting from i just saw the pilot to it oh a week or two ago and it was a special two hour thing but it was the first like like i said a pilot and uh   right   the characters in it were the white police officers when the black the black guy from Philadelphia went down there were much more bigoted and more the villains in that episode and now over the time in the television show theyre all very much uh uh not not bigoted or very more more you know more in the twentieth century now lets say or or very  unbigoted and they even have added uh this uh other   right right   black police officer to the cast so its interesting how they kind of got away from the original i guess the premise of the movie as well was the problems that that uh he had with the police officers and now its more concentrated on the problems they have in the small town in the south and it its kind of interesting because its supposed to be this little tiny town in down in   hum   uh down south but uh i live in this little teeny town up here in upstate New York and its not too much different so people got a lot to learn everywhere     huh thats interesting yeah yeah i ive seen Heat of the Night through off and on through out its uh television career as it were and i i wonder if uh if they did that intentionally or if they just had uh   right   whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um   right i i dont know either i dont   quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems that it is today as opposed to the the hitting over the head type problems that it was then   right right   and uh they they have uh uh pretty good bunch of actors and well acted parts i mean you can take a good actor and put him in a bad part and it doesnt do any good but uh they they found a good combination of roles and and actors and actresses on that show and its a pretty good one   sure its a lot different seeing Carroll OConnor in that role than uh Archie Bunker its like   yeah thats true thats true     and maybe a little more versatile than anybody ever gave him credit for   didnt get the right   but uh uh   yeah therere therere just starting to rerun those uh All in the Family down here on a particular on a major station and its uh i never did like it particularly and ive watched a couple of them off and on uh just to get a feel for what what was being said then but it uh the i i dont know its its its a pretty simplistic deal and i mean they they pound whatever message theyre going to say over and over and thats about the end of it so   right   i dont know if i would have liked it when it was current and and being discussed maybe it would have been a little better but uh   course the this is The Heat of the Night isnt it   no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are showing showing now   oh oh the All in the Ha Family right right right   they they really take whatever point theyre wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know its as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of   right   of uh topics but uh the uh i dont know maybe it would have been better the first time through when it was more   sure   uh when the public was talking about it you know sit around the table and talk about the this that and the other but some of the issues seemed a little out dated but of course thats what reruns are for and   right when is relevant or yeah well youve got old Meathead there and the rest of the gang at the where Meathead and and Sally Sally Struthers there with the um the the liberals the the supposedly correct view at the time and then uh the Archie Bunker with his uh antiquated uh the rednecked uh   right   ideas i dont know it the old meets new head on and  whatever but now its all old so   right   you could have another one you could have a new TV show with uh Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers in with their kids moving in and uh   right going another generations problems   yeah and have them be uh oh i dont even know yuppies are passe now im not even sure what uh   what to latch on to   yeah     i dont know well i hear one of my kiddos coming in the door so ill wind this one up and go see what they need   okay well it was nice talking to you   maybe well cross paths again later      all right byebye   um bye
