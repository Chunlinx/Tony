        gun control seems to be a rather um timely topic with all thats going on legislation wise   yes   and uh the the interesting scale that they assigned it uh  the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free id have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess i i dont mind regulating all of the the guns and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types now the the wisdom as to which types thats gonna be a debate forever i would assume uh the method of of controlling it well thats all into how much money you wanna put into the the controls um one point that was made in the house hearings or the the representative who stood up and said that uh you know we can check a guys credit card instantly but uh we dont wanna check his background and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes uh but theres still the the technology exists to to check it if they want   hm right   so its its its kind of a uh i guess you got to put a dollar figure on it if you really wanna make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that and then youve got the group the people that decide that theres theres no particular reason to have them at all and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it but i i could give it up without too much trouble its not the worlds most pleasurable thing and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like that um i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years but its just its not   yes right   like golf or whatever i mean there are other things that you could go do  so uh i i dont see the the joy of shooting is is that much of a driving factor i think uh society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety so the number of kids that tend to get hurt i dont even keep the gun in our house so uh we dont have that problem but uh  its its a hard hard topic i guess for a lot of people have a lot of hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it   yes right they do and you boy you can get them  on either side  and just like you say uh well i think i i guess id have to  place myself uh uh probably seven or eight  because or not wait wait onto no control im sorry uh excuse me that uh uh two or three   umhum   uh i was going the wrong direction  um because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child   umhum   because they had a gun in the house and the the father kept the bullets in a separate place but the little boy was five years old and was so intelligent enough to  uh he knew where booth both places were loaded the gun and they were playing cowboys and Indians and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes   boy   so uh i mean it it destroyed two families uh in just that instant and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh having   right   worked at one time in Baltimore or i dont know if youre in a big city are you Dallas yeah thats a big city  um then you know that uh uh   Dallas umhum yeah   if you live anywhere real close that uh the safety is uh some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they arent going to get shot because of the incidences of breakins and you know but uh uh we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up uh i um uh once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber hes going to assume that you know how to use it well and hes going to you know try to shoot first uh so you know if hes got one um and if not um   right   then usually they uh if hes got a knife or whatever they could throw it at you  i mean you know they he he said that it its better not to have especially myself now im a widow and uh i so im   right   uh when my handicapped son is is not at home im by myself but uh theres i still wont have a gun in the house because he said its its really  um playing Russian Roulette if you do  uh   yeah about the only circumstances that theyd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the person was coming your way if once youre surprised its too late and and the rare circumstances you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming and had time to do anything about it   thats right thats right right thats right   and i dont have that problem is i dont use that argument as saying its worth keeping one and the uh NRAs um claim that the uh the constitutional and the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh its hard to know the original intent but i i dont see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that uh yeah its the right to to arm a militia and as opposed to just the general public and you have a   right   you have a earn a right not just a privilege as it were if you were gonna serve in the militia then you have a right to have that arm but uh or you know theres all sorts of arguments there but i dont even worry about   thats right i know   the what the original intent was they didnt have this problem back then  so we we change our rights with our social status theyre man given rights and they can be taken away by a man so   no no thats true that thats thats right thats right right   uh the people that hide behind that i dont worry about they can go live in another country if they want   well the yeah thats how i feel too i know well even even here where i work uh we have uh a gun club and of course those people are very avid they you know they say there should be no ban that its not but i cant see why any uh on on the street citizen should be able allowed to be allowed to have a machine gun   umhum right   uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns it would be hard to decide but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport or i mean i dont know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either  so um uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things um when and when you were speaking about  they can check up   right   you know on credit cards well i i understand about the privacy act and everything  but why cant they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not that to me would not be an unreasonable thing and if they do course   right   the argument with the people in the gun club um is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones who are going to steal them anyway   right   and so its not gonna be that theyre buying them course some of them do   yeah   so it it it is a hard question   tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people most regulation does most its very difficult to uh legislate uh   right oh yeah   crooks or whatever you wanna however you wanna word it so its well this may be a never ending topic i got a couple of calls  waiting on me so i better let you go   thats right okay well thanks for talking  byebye now   okay bye
