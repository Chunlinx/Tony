                                 Lessons From Las Vegas            Longstanding oraltraditions and Caribbean Stud videopoker machines apparently dont mix thatwell Or so Id like to deduce from the recent decision of the Navajo Nation toreject casino gambling on its reservation land in Arizona and New Mexico Afterall Navajo culture is replete with stories cautioning against the dangers ofgambling and this is the second time in three years that the Navajo have saidno to casinos            At a timewhen Las Vegas has become Americas model of economic development the Navajovote may seem a grand selfdefeating gesture But while Las Vegas is certainlya tremendous economic success story its not clear that the story can beeasily duplicated elsewhere            Thats not because playing the houses role in a gamblingoperation requires Feynmanian genius The economics of casino gambling arepretty straightforward Every day people walk through the doors mill aroundfor a while and eventually leave and when they leave they haveas agroupsomewhere between  percent and  percent as much money as they hadwhen they came in Thats it Some of the people of course lose more than percent of their money and in doing so effectively transfer their cash tothose who lose less or whorarity of raritiesactually win But the casinoscut of the dropthe total cash thats converted into chips or tokensisremarkably unvarying As a character in Mario Puzos Fools Die puts itPercentages never lie We built all these hotels on percentages  Thepercentage will always stand fast            There isonly one real exception to this rulethe high roller and it is only ashortterm exception Click for some examples            What this means is that running a casino is notreally about gambling at all You do have to keep people from cheating and youdo have to keep deadbeats like Adnan Khashoggiwho bankrupted the Sands in by not paying his markersfrom skipping out on their debts But the realbusiness of casinos is not about what happens once a player sits down at ablackjack table or in front of a slot machine The real business is aboutgetting that player to sit down at your table and not the table at thecasino across the street            In thatsense a casino is like a restaurant or a movie theater except that theresone crucial difference Every casino is selling the exact same product Thereare minor variations in the kinds of slot machines youll find and casinos arealways coming up with mindless variants on the classic table games but inessence what every gambler is buying is simply opportunity Or as a casino CEOhas said theyre buying time Time to win and of course time to loseWhether youre in Circus Circus or Luxor or the MGM Grand or the GoldenHorseshoe though the time is the same McDonalds can sell a Big Mac todistinguish itself from Burger King but the Mirage cant advertiseBlackjack to distinguish itself from Harrahs            What the Mirage can and does advertise instead is itselfLas Vegas is often described as the future of America because its entireexistence depends on a service economy In another way though the city hasalready defined Americas present From the start since casinos couldntcompete on price or essential product they competed on the basis of theirbrand names Nike vs Reebok is a global version of Caesars vs theTropicana            Brandingin fact has driven the curious evolution of Las Vegas from gamblers paradiseto neoOrlando The casino industry has certainly supported endeavors like MGMGrands theme park and Excaliburs medieval jousts and its restaurant calledLanceaLotta Pasta as a way of attracting visitors who might otherwise gambleat their local riverboats But a more important factor behind Las Vegasevermoreelaborate themed casinos is the competitive pressure to set oneselfapart Im not convinced that knowing that theres a foot replica of theStatue of Liberty in front of the New York New York casino makes theexperience of playing blackjack inside any different but the statue is not theproduct The statue is just the advertising            And its advertising that has worked very wellMuch as we Rat Pack nostalgists might mourn the loss of the Flamingo and theSands theres no quarreling with Las Vegas economic performance The city hasled the nation in job growth for each of the past  years Casino revenue fromgambling has risen every year since  and casinos are now deriving agreater percentage of their revenue from their hotel and restaurant businessSomething like  billion in new construction projects are currently underwayin the city including Paris which will feature a story replica of theEiffel Tower Unlike Atlantic City where casinos have struggled forprofitability since the mids Las Vegas has proven itself almostimpervious to recession            In partthis is because Las Vegas has itself become one of the worlds most powerfulbrand names And in part its because Nevadas business climate is asupplysiders dream no corporate income tax no personal income tax no localearnings tax no inventory tax no capitalstock tax no franchise tax noadmissions tax no inheritance tax low property tax and a righttoworkstate Difficult not to make money when youre the only game in town in a ThirdWorld citystate            Its a flippant comparison to be sure but its one thatilluminates the reasons why gambling has not been an economic panacea for otherparts of the country parts where the New Deal actually had an impact forexample More than that the comparison also gets at what may be the mostinteresting thing about Las Vegas namely that its the economic equivalent ofan exporting powerhouse In this particular case the buyers come to Las Vegasto purchase the goods rather than having them shipped out of the city but theeconomics are the same Casinos thrive not because of the business they do withlocal customers but because of the business they do with people from aroundthe country and around the world Call Las Vegas a Far West Tiger and youwouldnt be too far off the mark            Branded servicedrivenglobalized and unhindered by the state the Las Vegas casinos do sounduncannily like models for the economy into which we appear to be moving HunterS Thompson once said of Circus Circus the casino where craps players andflying trapeze artists mingle beneath a billowing canopy that it was whathepcats all over the world would be doing on Saturday night if the Germans hadwon World War II But it might be that Circus Circus is already a version ofwhat we all do not just on Saturday nights but rather every day of the weekAll of us but the Navajo that is
