                                 The Legend of Arthur            In away Bill Gatess current troubles with the Justice Department grew out of aneconomics seminar that took place thirteen years ago at Harvards John FKennedy School of Government So begins an article by John Cassidy in the Jan issue of The New Yorker  titled The Force of an Idea The idea thatCassidy refers to is that of increasing returnswhich says that goods becomecheaper the more of them you produce and the closely related idea of networkexternalities which says that some products like fax machines become moreuseful the more people use them Cassidys article tells the story of howStanford Professor Brian Arthur came up with the idea of increasing returnsheld fast to that idea despite the obstinate opposition of mainstreameconomists and after many years as an academic pariah finally managed tochange the way people think about the economy That story has been told beforemost notably in M Mitchell Waldrops popular  book Complexity TheEmerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos  and a good story itcertainly is            It is also pure fiction Increasing returns wasnt a newidea it wasnt obstinately opposedand if increasing returns play a largerrole in mainstream economic theory now than they did  years ago Arthurdidnt have much to do with that change Indeed the spread of the Arthurianlegend is a better story than the legend itself an object lesson injournalistic gullibility            So whatyou may ask What could be less interesting than squabbling among professorsover who deserves the credit for some theory Well I could say that this bogusversion of intellectual history has metastasized to the point where it maybegin to do real harmto discredit good economics and to promote dubiouspolicies But the real truth is that Im just pissed off            Lets start with the legend Heres how it allbegan according to Waldrop On Nov   Brian Arthur wrote in hisnotebook a manifesto describing his project to develop a New Economics based onincreasing returns In a park in Vienna he tried to explain it to adistinguished international trade theorist from Norway who was baffled Sowere other establishment economists Thus began Arthurs years in thewilderness In  he completed his seminal paper but not until  after rewrites was he able to publish it Gradually writes Cassidy a numberof economistssuch as Georgetown Universitys Steve Salopbegan to takeArthurs conclusions seriously            Greatstory Now lets do a reality check starting with that walk in the park Itis indeed truly astonishing that the Norwegian Victor Norman did notunderstand what Arthur was driving at After all there is a long tradition ofincreasing returns in international trade theory If nothing else Normanshould have been familiar with his own coauthored book Theory ofInternational Trade  which was in galleys at the time It contained a wholechapter devoted to increasing returns based largely on a paper Norman himselfhad written three years before Is it possible that Arthur misinterpretedNormans bafflementthat what Norman really couldnt understand was why Arthurthought he was saying anything new            When I first saw Arthurs work probably sometime in themidtolate s I thought it didnt tell me anything  His mathematicalmodels were basically similar to those developed in the s by the gametheorist Thomas Schelling Moreover Arthur seemed unaware of the conceptualdifficulties that had led economists not to ignore but to  His paper simplyignored them During the course of the s those conceptual difficulties werepartly resolved leading to a burst of theorizing about increasing returns ButArthurs work played no role in that resolution            I wasntat that  Harvard seminar that Cassidy describes I was down the road atMIT finishing with a coauthor a book titled Market Structure and ForeignTrade Increasing Returns Imperfect Competition and the InternationalEconomy  But it would surprise me if the Harvard audience were unwilling toaccept the notion of increasing returns as Cassidy says After all at thetime the Harvard economics department included A Michael Spence who had wonthe Clark Medal the highest award of the American Economic Associationlargely for his work onyou guessed itincreasing returns            EconLit the database of professionalliterature since  reveals that by the moment Waldrops book claimsthat Arthurs theories about increasing returns began to beacceptedmainstream journals had published about  papers on the subjectSalop the Georgetown professor Cassidy presents as an early convert toArthurs ideas was early indeed He wrote one of his own bestknown papers onincreasing returns in a year before Arthur by his own account evenbegan to think about the subject            BrianArthur is a nice guy who I think sincerely believes that it happened the wayhe tells it But how can an experienced journalist like Cassidy be socredulous Perhaps a journalist cannot be expected to be an expert on the insand outs of an academic disciplinealthough Cassidy is The New Yorker seconomics correspondent But even if we accept that Cassidy doesnt know muchabout the discipline he currently covers what happened to basic journalisticinstincts            Suppose that someone tells you that years ago he made afundamental discovery that an entire profession out of sheernarrowmindedness refused to listen to and prevented him from publishingWouldnt you have at least a slight suspicion that this version of events mightbe a bit well selfservinga suspicion strong enough to send you to acollege library to see whether the facts check out            And whatabout what we might call the RauchReich test so named for Jonathan Rauchs                  Slate                article exposing fabricated quotes in the memoirs offormer Labor Secretary Robert Reich Throughout the story of Brian Arthurstravails people make the kind of dramatic pithy remarks that almost never getuttered in real life To admit that increasing returns exist would destroyeconomic theory  We know increasing returns cant exist Besides if theydid wed have to outlaw them Your theory may be theoretically valid buttheres no evidence of it in the real world These sound like the kind ofthing that The New Yorker might put at the bottom of a page under theheadline Pronouncements We Doubt Really Got Pronounced And as Jonathan Rauchtaught us when someone tells us that his world is populated by remarkablyeloquent people who always happen to say exactly what makes the storytellerlook good we are well advised to ask whether that world exists only in hiser perceptions            What could have caused Cassidy to suspend hiscritical faculties Perhaps he has an ideological ax to grindafter all a fewmonths back he proclaimed Marx the thinker of the future He argues that thetheory of increasing returns is crucial to the case against Microsoftwhich istrue although even so it is unclear why he couldnt just present the theorywithout the dubious intellectual history Anyway increasing returns areequally crucial to the case for Microsoftas a reason why trying tobreak it up would be a bad thing Perhaps more to the point Cassidy has madeit clear in earlier writing that he does not like mainstream economists and hemay have been overly eager to accept a story that puts them in a bad light            But this may be looking toohard for a motive When Waldrops book came out I wrote him as politely as Icould asking exactly how he had managed to come up with his version of eventsHe did to his credit write back He explained that while he had become awareof some other people working on increasing returns trying to put them in wouldhave pulled his story line out of shape My guess is that Cassidy reached thesame conclusion So what we really learn from the legend of Arthur is that somejournalists like a good story too much to find out whether it is reallytrue
