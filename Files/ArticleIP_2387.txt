                                 A GooseStep Guide to Dating            Weve just been sent a memotelling us were not supposed to talk to the media said the young male clerkat Barnes  Noble when I asked if he was selling a lot of copies of TheRules Time Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right  theslender muchpublicized manual of retro dating strategy for women Butyeseyeball roll sigh grimaceits flying out of here There went mytheory that the books sales advertised as  reflected warehousesizeorders from the same cabal that inflated the numbers for AncientEvenings  The Closing of the American Mind  A Brief History ofTime  and many other supposed huge sellers that youve never actually seenoutside a bookstore Choosing my copy from a miniwall of identical pinkpaperbacks I figured I should probably abandon my fallback theory too whichis that the only people who take the Rules seriously are journalists assignedto write about them Certainly the B  N clerk a dating man if I ever sawone took them seriously Its all about mind games he volunteeredscornfully I hate that book            Mindgames is right The thesis of Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneiders book is thatfor women who want to marry lunacy is the best policy Women who take theinitiativea broad category of behavior that includes most signs of life notto mention common politenessdestroy male ambition and animal drive Men areborn to respond to challenge Take away challenge and their interest wanesSo become a Rules Girl Having first transformed yourself Rule  intoa creature unlike any otherradiant confident fashionable mysteriouselusive quiet and if necessary nosejobbeddont talk to a man first or too much  dont go Dutch  or sleep with him on the first date dont call him and rarely return his calls  always end phone calls  anddates  first and never accept a Saturday night date after Wednesday As you might expect from a book that mingles pop Darwinism with theWeltanschauung of Cosmopolitan  the Rules can be a bit mysteriousand elusive themselvesyou cant introduce yourself to your neighbor buttaking out a personal ad is OK and hows a girl to square the whole project ofconditioning the marriageaverse man with Rules  Let Him Take the Leadand  Dont Expect a Man to Change or Try to Change Him            You could see The Rules as a weird fantasia on thetheme of Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free But what sets itapart from say Dear Abby is the demented quasimilitary precision of theRules Buy a timer and set it for  minutes when he calls Practice the ruleson the doorman and the butcherlet them say hello first toyou  If your beau fails to come across with a romantic gift for yourbirthday and Valentines Day he obviously doesnt love you so show him thedoor Dont just read the Rulesmemorize them By the end of the book whenyoure being advised to join a support group to help you resist the urge tohave a normal conversation with your boyfriend the whole enterprise has adistinctly cultish flavor Rule  Dont Discuss The Rules with YourTherapist                           TheRules isnt just about manipulating men its about manipulating the readertoo The eerie assurance with which the authors insist that the Rules alwayswork and that any deviation brings disaster is strangely nervousmaking likeone of those chain letters that alludes darkly to people who dropped dead afterfailing to pass it on Could it possibly be that my yearlong marriage wasjinxed from Day One because I called my future husband first and suggestedcoffeein his neighborhood yet instead of my own Actually no Lifes muchmore complicated Sure men like a challengebut so do women And nobody likesto be challenged all the time I know plenty of longstanding happy couples whoslept together right away spent hours yakking on the phone split checks downthe middle and lived together for years before the wedding The notion thatfemale initiative is useless because men know what they want is particularlyoddmost people dont even know what they want for dinner Even odder is thenotion that what men want is a woman whos always on her way out the door            Since The Rules do not reflect reality what istheir appealand to whom Undoubtedly the book owes much of its visibility tothe general mood of antifeminism and familyvalues conservatism But to seeits popularity as evidence of rejection of feminism by women is much toovague In the pages of The                Rules  men are a barely individualizedcollection of amiable dolts but the Rules Girl is a particular socialtypeand it isnt the choosy free spirit lectured in such antifeministselfhelp books as Smart Women Foolish Choices  The woman depicted asin need of the Rules is a voracious doormat the sort of woman who sends menHallmark greeting cards or long letters after a single date who rummages inmens drawers and pockets suggests couples therapy when brief relationshipsstart to crumble throws away a new boyfriends old clothes cleans andredecorates his apartment without asking and refuses to see the most obvioussigns of disengagement Her problem isnt too much liberation its incrediblylow selfesteem For women like this The Rules might seem like a way ofsetting boundaries on a personality that has none of giving a sense of purposeand structure to a life that seems empty a recurrent word of offeringwomen who fear they are worthless a way of acting as if they were preciousacreature unlike any otherin the hope that the pose may become reality Ofcourse this is unlikelya motormouth cannot be quiet and mysteriousforever timer or no timer and The                Rules  blithe assurance thatMr Right reeled in by your friendly light and breezy persona will acceptyour edgy insecure and engulfing true self is perhaps the cruelest fantasyin the book            Although the Rules Girl is anything but Everywomanthe world depicted in the book is unfortunately the one in which millions ofsingle men and women live a corporatized and highly competitive world ofoffice jobs and aerobics classes personal ads nose jobs and diets singlesdances selfhelp seminars and spiritual fads Its not a very warm or kindworld or one with much room for originality or playfulness or waywardness oreven what I would call romance Friends matter because you need someone torent a beach house or go to a singles dance with Politics and volunteer workand books are just ways to keep busy between dates            The Darwinian theme prominentin much of the discussion about dating just now reflects this world well menand women different by nature and with innately opposed interests each tryingto exploit the other first You dont have to like the other sexyou donteven have to like your lover You just have to need him or herfor sexbabies romantic gifts attention money acceptability in a societyorganized around the couple Indeed the subtext of The                Rules isresentment toward men As the authors put it in their inimitable fashionThe man is the adversary if hes someone you really like Why He hasthe power to hurt you  he runs the show            When feminists suggest thatmen run the showany showthey get labeled manhaters and whiners But thenfeminists want to change the rules not memorize them
