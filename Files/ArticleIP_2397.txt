                                 The Norplant Option            Now that Congress andPresident Clinton have opted to use the threat of utter destitution to dissuadepoor teenagers and women from having children on the public dole its time torevive a more humane and perhaps more effective proposal with the sameobjective            This idea surfaced brieflyand spectacularly in  when the Philadelphia Inquirer suggested inan editorial that perhaps some welfare mothers should be offered an increasedbenefit if they would agree to practice effective birth controlspecificallyto use the thennew Norplant contraceptive which prevents pregnancy for fiveyears after being implanted under the skin of the upper arm            An uproarfollowed The editorial writerswho had insensitively suggested a desire toreduce births of poor black babies in particularwere savaged by manyInquirer staffers and others as racist advocates of eugenics even ofgenocide They also caught it from some abortionrights zealots who aresuspicious of any government efforts to influence reproductive choices andfrom conservatives who think the only proper way to discourage teen pregnancyis to preach abstinence The newspaper abjectly apologized for a misguided andwrongheaded editorial opinion And ever since the whole subject has beentaboo            But its still a good idea for poor girls andwomen themselves and for the rest of us Millions of babies are being born topoor teenagers so lacking in elementary skills work habits andselfdiscipline that they are unlikely to be either responsible parents orselfsupporting providers Many of these babies grow up in squalor andthemselves become dependent denizens of the welfare culture            The onlyrealistic hope for breaking the bleak cycle of teen pregnancy and welfaredependency is to find ways to persuade poor teenagers not to have babiesatleast not until they are old enough and capable enough and selfsupportingenough to provide a decent home life But nobodynobodyhas any great ideasfor realizing this hope short of reverting to the cruelest letemstarvebrand of social Darwinism            Thoughtful progressives like Sen DanielPatrick Moynihan DNY have properly stressed the need to push welfaremothers into jobs and jobtraining programs This makes sense because some ofthese women will rise to the occasion learn the work ethic and becomeselfsupporting And others may be dissuaded from having children by theprospect of being required to work But as Moynihan acknowledges many welfaremothers are so crippled by their own early childhood environments as to beessentially unemployable no matter how wellfinanced and wellrun the jobsprograms and related counseling training and childcare programs            And under the harsh newwelfare reform the jobs programs will not be well financed It appears thatmillions of welfare mothers and children will simply be cut offunable to getor hold jobs and left to beg from relatives and strangers to steal what theycan even to sleep on the streets depending on how much Calcuttastyle miserythe taxpayers are willing to tolerate            Given thestark ugliness of trying to end the welfare culture by spreading homelessnessand hunger its especially striking that one pretty good pretty humane ideahas been virtually ignored in the welfare debate of the past year            In a small effort to reopen discussion of thisoption heres a specific proposal States should experiment with programs inwhich all qualifying teenagers and women would be offered lumpsum  cashpaymentson top of any other benefits they receiveto have Norplant oranother longterm contraceptive implanted at government expense They would befree to have it removed whenever they chose but would be rewarded withadditional payments of say  for each month in which they kept it            Thecategory of qualifying teenagers and women could include all recipients ofwelfare or other public assistance including daughters of recipients who arecompetent to give informed consent to the implant procedure Or the programcould be restricted in various ways in order to blunt possible objections Forexample you could require parental consent Or eligibility could berestricted to those who have already been pregnant or at least sexuallyactive to those over age  or under age  or some combination thereof            Why Norplant Because it requires no ongoingeffort or supervision to be effective and it can be discontinued only aftersome rather small effort As such Norplant is the only contraceptive thegovernment could pay people to use with any hope of affecting those who arentstrongly motivated to either become pregnant or avoid pregnancy            How muchgood the Norplant option would do is debatable But the arguments that it woulddo harm seem unpersuasive Heres a quick review of possible objections leftand right            B ribing poor women and girls to implantNorplant would coerce them into not having children thus violating theirrights to reproductive choice like the onechildperfamily policy and coercedabortions in China                        To the contrary a governmentoffer of money is not coercionand not even remotely comparable to what goeson in China Existing benefits would not be reduced for anyone decliningNorplant This means that nobody who really wanted a child would be preventedfrom having one To be sure the government would be trying to influencereproductive choices But the same is true of existing policies promoting freecontraception and of laws like the Hyde Amendment which denies Medicaidfunding for abortionsnot to mention the still extant statutes making it acrime to commit statutory rape sex with a consenting minor fornicationpremarital sex and adultery            In its groveling editorial apology the Inquirer said Our critics countered that todangle cash or some other benefit in front of a desperately poor woman istantamount to coercion Theyre right No they were wrong and theInquirer was right in its initial Norplant editorial when it noted thatwomen would be free to change their minds at any point and become fertileagain            Manypeople David Boldt theneditor of the Inquirers editorial page noted in asubsequent commentary saw the editorial as part of an ongoing whiteconspiracy to carry out genocide of blacks in America            This ispernicious nonsense no matter how many people say it The originalInquirer editorial unwittingly invited such smears by linking itsNorplant proposal to racespecifically to a report that nearly half thenations black children are living in poverty But nobody is proposing thatrace be a factor in any program promoting Norplant to welfare recipients mostof whom are white Nobody is proposing to sterilize women or forbid them fromhaving children And while a disproportionate percentage of welfare mothers andchildren are black black America like white America can only benefit fromany program that rewards people for avoiding pregnancy unless and until theyare old enough and selfsupporting enough to provide decently for children            G irls and women on Norplant may be atgreater risk of contracting and spreading AIDS because they will be lesslikely to demand that their sex partners use condoms                        A study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine found thatNorplant had no effect on recipients decisions whether to use condoms or visitdoctorsand was  times as effective as the pill in preventing pregnancy AnyNorplant incentive program should include vigorous counseling about the need touse condoms against disease But even now how many women and girls are so muchmore afraid of pregnancy than of death that they use condoms solely to avoidthe former and would stop once on Norplant Not many I suspect            N orplant itself may be unhealthy                        Thepossibility of serious longterm health damage from any relatively newcontraceptive like Norplant must be taken seriously and the risks should ofcourse be fully disclosed to women considering using it But no contraceptiveis riskfree And the available evidence indicates that the risks inherent inpregnancy and childbirthand in abortionare at least as great as the risksinherent in Norplant            Plaintiffs tort lawyershave nearly killed off Norplant scaring away many women and doctors by atorrent of personalinjury suits against its manufacturer The lawyers includemany of the same folks who created a tidal wave of litigation based on theapparently bogus claim about the dangers of silicone breast implants But theFood and Drug Administration has repeatedly found Norplant to be safe andeffective More than a million women have used it with only minor side effectssuch as changing menstrual bleeding patterns reported            Therehave been complaints by a small percentage of Norplant users of severe pain orscarring from having it removed But the apparent reason was inadequatetraining of physicians in the usually quick and painless removalprocedurean easily remedied problemand not any inherent defect in theproduct            I t is sexist to seek to thrust contraceptiononly upon women                        Sexism has nothing to do withit First almost all welfare checks are written to womennot to men whodont get pregnant Second the only forms of contraception now available formen are condoms and vasectomies It would hardly make sense to hand out payments to men for taking home a bunch of condoms or to try to police theiruse And a vasectomyunlike a Norplant implant cannot always bereversed                           Giving teenagerscontraceptives encourages promiscuity and bribing them to use Norplant willencourage it even more                        The weightof the evidence suggests that teenagers decisions whether or not to engage insexual activity dont have much to do with whether the government gives themcontraceptives Many have unprotected sex and almost all can getcontraceptives if they want them As I have suggested one possible restrictionalthough not one I would favor on any Norplant incentive program would be tolimit eligibility to teenagers who have already been pregnant or at leastsexually active Norplant counselors could also stress the benefits ofabstinence while presenting the contraceptive as a backup safeguard            T eenagers should learn about sex andcontraception from their parents not the government                        A parentalconsentrequirement would answer this objection I would not advocate such arequirement however because of the overwhelming evidence that many parentshave little or no constructive communication with their children about suchmatters I hope that my own two daughters now  and nine years old wouldconsult with me and my wife before getting Norplant or becoming sexuallyactive But if they end up deciding to go their own ways Id rather that theyhave unrestricted access to Norplant than that they risk pregnancy            Would aNorplant program be thwarted by the fact that many poor teenagers actuallywant to get pregnant and have a child I dont think so First there are about million unwanted pregnancies in the United States every year half of whichend in abortion Many of these involve teenagers and women who are or willbe on welfare Norplant could stop almost all these Second the allure ofpregnancy for many other poor teenagers may be so slight or so fleeting orso fraught with ambivalence that a  Norplant incentive would have plentyof takers            And even if such a program only delayedpregnancies a few years that would be a very good thing Most yearoldswould be better mothers and have a better chance of making something of theirown lives if they waited five or seven years before having babies            Norplant is no panacea forpoverty nothing is The question is whether a Norplant incentive program mightdo some good Theres only one way to find out Give it a try If it fails thecostin terms of numbers of teenagers and women taking the  offerwillbe tiny And it just might help
