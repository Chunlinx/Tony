           hi Phil   how you doing   pretty good how many children did you say you had   i have three i didnt say i i have three of them yeah two uh i have the girl is the oldest and then two boys   wow you have three children boys girls i have uh three as well uh mine are uh uh twenty five twenty four and twenty one the numbers keep changing so its hard for me to remember   yeah well youre doing a lot better than i can i cant rattle them off like that i know my youngest is eighteen hes uh as i said in a senior in high school but i have a       uh my oldest son hes uh out seeing the world right now hes in Australia at the present time   wow so you dont get a chance to to spend much time with him then until when he comes home   well hes yeah hes been gone for about seven months now were expecting him to be getting home here before too much longer hopefully   wow  i uh unfortunately didnt spend enough enough time with my children uh where i i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger uh i was attending school   ouch yeah   and then i found myself short of cash so i uh also went in for a parttime job so by the time that i got home after my second job   um   children either in bed or just getting ready to go to bed and the only time that i got to see them was on weekends and on weekends i had to do my homework so  it uh it   yeah   you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that   right   that i i didnt really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder   ill bet that storys all too common i uh   its its unbelievable how fast you know you when when you get to the point where even your kids age they dont want to spend time with you anymore and you know i   yeah they sure develop their own interests   i can i can remember when my children used to beg me to go with you know even to take them to the store or take them someplace and and it just gradually goes away until you have to ask them do you want to come with me and then they start saying no so   it can be pretty sudden too   well it its not sudden its just that it probably doesnt hit the average person uh until it hits them over the head   yeah maybe so uh   uh because you  because even even my oldest uh child when he comes uh comes to the house hes still hes still my my my child and and i dont think of him as an adult yet and uh that thats one of his complaints   yeah i dont think i uh i would have to say i probably didnt get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either uh however i did you know uh early on i was in the retail business and i worked late hours so i saw less of them then but then when i changed over and got into electronics industry i uh   uhhuh   i did have more time and i tried to spend some more time with them and uh you know we did things as a family we went camping quite a bit and we uh you know took trips went to see my folks in Florida and and some of those kind of things   so you had a bunch a bunch of kids in the car  that must have that must have that must have been fun   yeah we did we did quite a bit of that  just traveling and we had several Volkswagen buses there for a period of time in our later years then we did when we were camping and stuff and that made it a little easier or a station wagon   well camping is one thing that i i could never get used to uh i i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went uh never went camping   uhhuh that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in its a lot easier to get out outside all year round uh well pretty near all year round out here   yeah yeah up in uh New England its uh uh you know three or four or five months tops after that youre in the house       because it becomes so cold out here that uh and sometimes the weather gets to you so you dont want to go outside and drive around   yeah       i guess uh i can think of a uh uh things i would like to have done differently on uh on the kids though   well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh uh the White Mountains area and and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that   umhum   but i wouldnt sleep on the ground i went into a hotel  but i used to take the kids to uh you know the things like uh the places where there are animals and you go in and and feed the animals and things like that and uh   yeah uhhuh oh yeah petting zoos and things   yeah hey you know and the and the kids used to enjoy that as well and i like children in fact uh one of the things that i notice a dramatic change was that that uh like if id be in a supermarket and id see a cute little kid  i wouldnt think twice about patting the kid on the head   umhum   well as time grew by and i think i had my daughter with me one time and she went strolling away and i saw this kid and i patted her on the head and the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away  you know pulled the kid and i       and i turned around and i realized my daughter wasnt there anymore so all she saw was a an adult standing there patting her kid on the head so i i  i didnt realize it until after uh you know after it all happened what what the uh the   oh yeah  oh oh   the sort of person  uh it was uh really something   our kids played uh ball it wasnt it was like you know Little League and uh it was Dads Oaks Dads Club which was a like a Little League   uhhuh you attend a lot of their games   yeah we used to go to the games and we had uh i never did actually coach id go do some of the sideline stuff and like that but i never did actually coach but they tried to get me to do that i  but wed go you know and watch them practice and   uhhuh   and uh pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing   did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons   uh i personally dont believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger   uhhuh   and then you know she being a girl i guess she probably uh spent a lot of time with her mother more so than with me   yeah i i uh i felt that myself myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didnt spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because uh id want to do the things that i thought that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like uh you know fishing and and doing outside things outside and my daughter didnt like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than uh   umhum oh yeah uh   than with myself and i think uh shes closer to her mother today than than she is to me because of that   yeah thats probably the same case in our family too   yeah its unfortunate because yeah you know even even though you you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it   yeah a lot of cases daughters getting get real close to their dads too you know and uh   yeah well she was close but yet whenever i wanted to do something  it was always something something different than what she wanted to do   yeah yeah   um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh shed always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh uh playing someplace but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out  for the kids and uh shed always say well i want to go to my girlfriends house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that so i i kind of missed that um i my daughter especially uh being with her   is your daughter the uh oldest   no shes the the second oldest shes uh twenty twenty three now   oh middle child you uh you have you ever heard much about that theory about the uh you know how their different their their position in the family relates to their uh character you know some of their   personality traits and things like that uh no i cant say that i have   mannerisms and personality yeah yeah i believe its true its my experiences uh what i know about it and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other peoples children too its uh you know its uh you know the older kid is uh is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing   uhhuh yeah i think you force it on them  and and the youngest one tends to be the one thats spoiled   yeah it is a natural development i think it yeah and uh in our case he hes real sensitive and real uh thoughtful and uh   the youngest one is more sensitive thats same with my family and its its strange   yes i dont know if yeah i dont know if that relates to that or not but   well it just so happens that my youngest is uh extremely sensitive uh where my oldest one uh you know i can scream at him and yell at him and hell look at me with with   my oldest yeah my oldest daughter is hard headed as can be   but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he he will he wont cry anymore because hes too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and and i can feel that   yeah right thats thats Matthew hes its boy uh he was always he just hed keep it to himself a lot of times but hed really kind of well up and   yeah   and be ready to cry or whatever       hes gotten now to where he can take it better hell dish it back a little bit but   i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasnt old enough or i didnt think he was old enough to take out and uh uh we caught this fish it was uh it was a fairly large size fish and he was very very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we we came home and he uh he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and he wanted to put it in the bathtub so she told him no he couldnt do it but he did it anyway fill the water filled the bathtub full of water and uh     huh   uh put the fish in it now after the fish died from being handled so much uh we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool  so after he realized the fish wasnt going to come back uh to life again we went out there and they buried it   uh       and uh you know we did did it together and i i come in the house and i wash my hands and i turn around and i did something and i saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and i went out there said what are you doing he said i wanted to show my friend the fish that i caught   yeah     so hes so hes out there digging it up   yeah that was im sure it was a powerful experience for him its something hell remember   yeah well it was his first fish he didnt he didnt want to hide it he wanted everybody
