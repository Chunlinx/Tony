        okay have you had to return anything lately that youve bought         um  no not really i uh i may have had to have a a few minor repairs but i havent bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future im gonna be buying a big computer and   yeah   um  one of these eight millimeter camcorders   oh yeah thatll be nice   so i been i been studying these things but uh i havent had to return too many things i   i havent either really   i i i try to be very careful when i pick up something and and look it over to make sure that it looks like its going to to work   right right well i think its gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most most places are willing to you know go with the customer   and i think it really turns down to picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the field electronics devices that i buy the the ones in Japan in generally   umhum   are much higher quality from working   on uh yeah i know that i know   i mean i hate to admit it but its true they they they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public   thats true thats true i havent had to return anything that i can think of but uh you know with like radios and things theyve become so cheap that even if they do break its better just to go get another one than have it fixed   you thats right you you were speaking of that about a week ago i bought myself a new digital watch   you know uhhuh   that was made in China   uhhuh   works just fine and it cost me four dollars   yeah uh the stuff like that you know      yes its amazing isnt it   yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things theyre a lot cheaper if theyre Japanese made   yes   you know ive ive gotten to the point where i think so but um ive had to return um i think a television one time and um uh the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didnt have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but   uhhuh   you know years ago you didnt never have to return anything everything worked for so long   thats right and and and thats been really um way its been for me for the last five or six years that i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and   oh yeah   the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasnt the sets fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances   umhum well thats not bad at all well this is the first time ive ever gotten anybody outside of Texas   no well i tell you most of my talks are in Texas thats true i but ive been ive been uh talked into um  California twice in the last uh week or two   really wow   so its uh its nice but but i know how it is if youre gonna take care of Texas you have to live in Texas i suppose           oh my heavens but lets see um i cant think of any other products ive taken back       um clothes is about mainly what ive you know gotten lately and i think theyve gone downhill   yeah   as as far as unless you its you get what you pay for   well were being filled up with a lot of of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know weve got WalMarts and Gee Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and   right umhum umhum   i dont know how we can support all of those things and the and and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them on the market cheaper for the public   thats true right   and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and thats when you have to start returning them   yeah yeah i agree with you its kind of hard for the small man   so yeah   to make it you know with the the homemade thing   thats right and i i i have a friend who does make uh beautiful furniture but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store   you know umhum right   if it looks beautiful and its well made but people cant afford it      wow thats pretty interesting   yep   hum let me think of something else here   huh   um i cant thats the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and and theyre going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more its the old adage you get get what you pay for   yes   but um you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didnt last very long you know   do you   i think the frame of it wasnt really good because it was probably mass produced   hum   you know   actually i had some uh i bought a water softener for my home   uhhuh   and i didnt have to return it but it didnt work well and i finally i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem   uhhuh hum   and it was a matter i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself   do you have a problem with your water heater        if you
