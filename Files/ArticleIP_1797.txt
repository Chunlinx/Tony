                                 Give It Away Ken            Soulsearching is always agreat story as long as its someone elses soul So those in the media whoassume he did itthat is all of usagree that between now and Aug Clinton had better do some He must as the phrase goes test his owncharacter Am I going to be a sleazy liar forever Or will I finally tellthe truth even if it hurts                        But I ambeginning to think the real character test in the next few weeks is not forClinton but for Kenneth Starr What kind of prosecutor am I Thisquestion can be asked in a more direct more pragmatic way Will Starr tellClinton the results of the DNA tests before he testifies            You can get a headache trying to game all Starrs possibleDNAtest tactics Consider a few            Initial test shows DNA Starrasks Clinton for blood sample doesnt reveal results            Initial test shows DNA Starrdoesnt ask for blood sample hopes to trick Clinton into thinking hes in theclear            Initial test shows no DNAStarr doesnt say anything hopes Clinton will assume hes pursuing Option Betc            But forthe sake of argument lets assume FBI tests show there is DNA on the dressShould Starr tell the president this before Aug             Prosecutorial wisdom shouts Of course notStarr has been working this case for years and he has the chance to hook thebiggest fish in the biggest pond Why on earth would he give away preciousinformation that might help Clinton wriggle free Starr needless to say hasno obligation to show the evidence to Clinton Prosecutors may revealsensitive evidence to a witness they are trying to protect ie if a witnesswho is helping you might perjure himself in front of a grand jury you tell himinformation so he wont lie Prosecutors do not reveal sensitive evidence tothose they are trying to prosecute Why treat Clinton differently            Thepresident of course is not a regular target of investigation because aregular target would never testify in front of a grand jury if he had somethingto hide The president because its politically impossible cant take theFifth It seems unfair to trap him in a lie that he would never have had totell if he were a regular citizen            Starrs setup may be a perjury trap but that does notnecessarily mean its unfair Imagine Starr doesnt tell Clinton about apositive test result The president of course ought to tell the truth butClinton being Clinton he might not The White House so far is adamant thatClinton is sticking to his denial He might brazen it out by lying to thegrand jury The dress and Monicas story would nail him an openandshutperjury case By the prosecutors code Clinton has hanged himself            But whatStarr can do as a prosecutor and what he ought to do as a publicservant differ            What will happen if Starr reveals a positiveresult to Clinton He probably destroys his own case No matter how muchClinton might want to brazen it out advance warning from Starr would compelthe president to admit and apologize So Clinton wouldnt perjure himself andas I argued Sunday an apology is likely to kill the appetite for anyimpeachment hearings over obstruction Whitewater Filegate etc Starrscriminal case goes up in smoke            Whether Starr gives it awaydepends on what kind of prosecutor he is If he wants to expose criminalbehavior by the president and punish it no matter whatif in short he is thevindictive avenger Clintons defenders say he isStarr will sacrifice noadvantage He will blindside the president with test results if that will builda stronger case But if hes a prosecutor who wants to turn up the truth asmuch as to get his target then Starr will give it away            The decent and sensitivething to do is tell the president There is no advantage whatsoever to gettingthe president to lie before the grand jury says former Deputy AttorneyGeneral Philip Heymann Starr should not put himself in the position ofhaving called the president and inviting him to lie unnecessarily            Or asWashington DC criminal lawyer Robert Luskin puts it You just dont play agame of chicken like that with the president of the United States            There are strong public policy reasons for Starr to givethe results away Do we really want the presidents career to rise or fallbased on prosecutorial cleverness in a secret grand jury proceeding TellingClinton the results makes it more likely hell go public and that makes itmore likely Flytrap will be played out in the open rather than in private legalproceedings And the public political realm is where Flytrap belongs            One of Starrs obligations asa prosecutor is to protect the honorable institutions of government and one ofthose institutions is believe it or not the dignity of the presidency Thatdignity has been much squandered by Clinton but this is a chance for Starr toprotect what remains Starr protects the presidency by exposing criminalbehavior by the president But he can also protect the presidency by preventingmore criminal behavior Not telling the president of a positive DNA result mayinduce Clintonadmittedly because of his own hubristo lie to trap himselfto damage the office of the presidency even more Telling the president letsClinton avoid committing a new crime            The person who would benefitmost of all by telling is Starr himself He has been demonized as theprosecutor who is destroying the president over sex He can become theprosecutor who let the president save himself
