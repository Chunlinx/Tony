                                 Good Writing Gone Bad                        Dear Dinesh            I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss thisbook with you although as we both know the book has already been so widelydiscussed that we are already part of a much larger conversation And while Isuspect we may disagree in some ways in our evaluation of Reagan as presidentand of his legacy it seems we agree in many ways on Morris book            It is almost impossible to start readingDutch which because of the Random House embargoI was able to begin doing only on Friday without focusingat least atfirston Morris unusual biographical techniques There has already been astorm of criticism of his innovations and Im sure there will be many readerswho will begin with some hostility toward him on the basis of the mostlyuninformed reports they have read I have to say that the prospect of reading abiography that tried to break with the fairly rigid forms of the genre wasappealing to me as strange as Morris approach sounded and I approached thisbook eagerly            The test of an innovation in any kind of writing butparticularly in nonfiction writing is what contribution the innovation makesto our understanding of the subject the author is trying to illuminate Andthere are times in which Morris quasifictional narrator his film scriptshis invented encounters his blurring of the line between fantasy and realityand his many other tricks of the trade do offer some interesting points ofentry into Ronald Reagans elusive inner life But I have to say that on thewhole and like you I found these devices intrusive omnipresent and highlydistracting from what should have been the central task of the book Its notjust that these techniques make it hard to know what is real and what is madeup although they do Its also that they make it very difficult to concentrateon Reagan and much too easy to concentrate on the madeup cast of charactersflitting around him improbably preoccupied by him even in the years before hewas important writing back and forth to each other about their fictionalencounters with him and with each other telling the story of their ownfamilies in almost as much detail as they talk about Reagans I wasparticularly disturbed as a scholar by the presence of invented footnotes forthe fictional parts of the book But even without them there is a surrealquality to this biography that makes it hard to focus on Morris real views ofReagans personality and place in historywhich are also somewhat bizarrealthough more about that later            Morris is not of course the first person to try toblend fiction and fact Some very distinguished historians have experimentedwith doing so in recent years some with great success John Demos an eminenthistorian of early America at Yale wrote a fascinating book several years agocalled The Unredeemed Captive  about a white womanin colonial New England who was abducted by Indians and lived much of her lifeamong them Demos augmented the known story of this woman with an imaginedstory of how she might have viewed her life with the tribesomething for whichno evidence exists It stirred some controversy certainly but it was aserious inventive and in the end I believe successful experiment My Columbiacolleague Simon Schamas Dead Certainties  also nowseveral years old was a deliberate effort to play with the elusive boundarybetween fiction and history and to suggest how the two might be fruitfullyjoined That book too seemed to me very provocative and interesting            But Morris potentially interesting effort to expandthe boundaries of biography seems to have gone out of control Partly Isuspect because Morris is such a good writeronce he started experimenting atthe edges he couldnt help himself from going all the way Partly perhapsbecause he was genuinely puzzled by Reagans apparent opaquenessalthough as abiographer of Theodore Roosevelt it seems strange that he would be surprisedby a politician giving others little access to his own inner life Ive spentmuch of my scholarly life working on and around Franklin Roosevelt who issimilarly opaque but has nevertheless been the subject of excellent andpenetrating biographies In the end though I think Morris real problem isthat he doesnt understand American politics well enough and doesnt knowenough American history to be able to make sense of Reagan in anything butpersonal termsand that in the absence of an accessible personal story he wasleft in effect with nothing The result is this hodgepodge of distractingliterary techniques that are only intermittently effective and mostly deeplydistracting from even destructive to his principal goal            After today Ill try not to talk about this alreadyoveranalyzed aspect of the book and comment as you have already begun to doon what it says about Reagan himself            Alan Brinkley
