                                 Gone With the Wind                           Cold Mountain issincerely plausible It is a solemn fake You will not hear this from thereaders and judges who have helped make Charles Fraziers Civil War taleprobably the most popular novel about that period since Gone With theWind  Since its publication in June Cold Mountain has sold morethan a million copies in November it won the National Book Award The bookis so professionally archaeological so competently dug that one can mistakeits surfaces for depth But its like a cemetery with no bodies in it All therecords of life are there the facts and figures and pocket histories pointingup out of the ground but whats buried there was never alive            Mostpeople dont want novels to be in the deepest sense unreal They want them toobey the conventions of current realism Thus John Berendt author ofMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil  has said of Cold Mountainthat it is utterly convincing down to the last detail And hes right ButCold Mountain is utterly convincing in an unreal way            Frazier has written a stirring story of bloody simplicityand epic power As a storyteller he hardly ever errs This is a remarkablytremorless first novel It is the story of Inman a Confederate soldier who iswounded in  and briefly hospitalized and who then deserts to find his wayhome He travels raggedly from Tennessee to the mountains of North Carolinawhere he had grown up There near Cold Mountain waits his sweetheart a womancalled Ada Monroe The daughter of an upperclass Charleston SC ministerwho has died just before the book begins she is struggling to make her oldfarm profitable The novel alternates Inmans story and Adas story She waitshe travels            Inman issilent good and strongone must imagine a Confederate Clint Eastwood He ismetaphysically alone as the conventions of adventure dictate He wished notto be smirched with the mess of other people But messes just keep onsmirching him He goes through a shower of picaresque trials Three men set onhim he singlehandedly beats them off he saves a pregnant woman from deathand another woman from a band of renegade federal soldiers various men try torecapture him he is seduced by a woman whose husband discovering the coupletries to shoot him Inmans conversation in late th centurywritingschool style is intelligently starved It is still a cloudy matter tome if I did the right thing letting you live and his inner life iscarefully rationed He is a Homeric foot soldierFrazier has said he hadOdysseus in mindand quite unreal The novels unreality flows from Inmansunreality            Cold Mountain rolls the brougham of itself fromepisode to episode until Inman reaches home A puff of sentimentality isexhaled at the end of the book Inman is reunited with Ada only to be shotdown at the last minute But the tragic couple was permitted a night ofpassion and a moist epilogue shows a happy little girl the product of thisunion frolicking with her mother some years later the happy end of a happyending            Frazieris a good writer calm for the most part unsentimental often rich But thenovel is a refined exercise It is worth bearing in mind that Frazier wasuntil recently a professor of English although the jacket copy omits thisfact preferring us to believe that he and his family merely raise horses inRaleigh NC Cold Mountain is in fact a willed pastiche of StephenCranethat is modern prose with occasional attacks of nostalgia There wasnot moonlight nor the prick of lantern light from some welcoming home The townof Cold Mountain was ahead but they knew not how far Or this as Inmanbattles the three thieves He eventually smote the three down to their kneesin the dirt of the street so they looked like those of the Romish faith atprayer            Such prose if not quite antiquarians dust is the carbonof something once fiery It is not a living  th century prose or aliving contemporary prose but rather a  th century reductionliving off the alms of the  th century Frazier does the oppositeof writers such as Melville or Woolf who historicize the language by shakingits roots Linguistically he is not in search of the historically rejuvenatingbut the historically plausible But most great historical fictionGeorgeEliot Stendhal Tolstoyis not written in historical prose Crane inThe Red Badge of Courage  wrote in  about the Civil War but itwould not have occurred to him to write in anything but the living language ofhis own age which admittedly was closer to the earlier periods thanFraziers is            To compareCrane and Frazier is to compare a genuine fibrous style with academic tissueFrazier controls all his similes so that they stay ruly His similesthere isat least one per pageare either trimmed for historical plausibility like thethieves Romishly at prayer or more frequently made to involve an animal theidea perhaps being that in simpler times a homely rustic simile would havecome to mind So we have a mans tongue grey as the foot of a goose acatfish the size of a boar hog a man who gets ready to take a blow like acowed dog a night as dark as the inside of a cow an old man whose dugshung down like those on a sow hogan entire farmyard of likenesses Craneby contrast lets his similes go everywhere In battle one man has a shoefulof blood He hopped like a schoolboy in a game A corpse is seen and Cranedescribes the dead mans beard moving in the wind as if a hand were strokingit            In short Frazier sacrifices aesthetic life tohistorical life The result is that while one continues to believe ColdMountain on the surface one stops believing it at any deeper level Thereis a false consciousness to a late  th century writers efforts toevoke a  th century man in a language that belongs to neither WhenInman is seduced for instance he places his hand on the womans leg high upFrazier writes of the womans genitals that to Inman they seemedextraordinarily fascinating though it was but a mere slot in flesh The readerrealizes instantly that a deserting soldier would never think like thisthathe would never use these upholstered words The private language of a man likethat would be both simpler and more strange more original than Fraziersecclesiastical English Instead we have Fraziers fancy plausible idea of howa vagina might have been described in  had this been written down But Inman is not writing anything downhe is being seduced he is speaking tohimself One sees that Cold Mountain is condemned to be a literaryapproximation of an already literary idea of reality            Henry James complained toSarah Orne Jewett in a letter of  that the historical novel had a fatalcheapness Although the novelist might be able to render well all sorts offacts and dates and general furniture she could never truthfully render theold consciousness The great historical novels are always about contemporaryconsciousness This inability to convey the old consciousness was not amatter of inaccuracy but of bad faith It would always be the new consciousnessimagining what the old consciousness was likeforcing it to be old Andeven then James added its all humbug Cold Mountain is advancedhumbug
