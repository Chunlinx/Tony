                            Epidemiological studies suggest that statins a class of cholesterollowering drugs may        lower the risk for Alzheimer disease The mechanism for this effect is unclear Alzheimer        disease is characterized by accumulation of amyloid deposits in the brain These deposits        are composed of amyloidbeta A peptide a protein fragment that is cleaved off from the        amyloid precursor protein APP APP can be cleaved in two different ways Amyloidogenic        amyloid generating cleavage by an enzyme called betasecretase yields sticky A        peptides that aggregate to form deposits whereas nonamyloidogenic cleavage by        alphasecretases generates soluble peptides that do not form deposits Studies in animal        models and cell culture suggest that statins might modulate APP processing and shift the        balance toward healthy nonamyloidogenic cleavage        In their quest to understand how statins affect APP processing Sam Gandy and colleagues        focused on a molecule called ROCK a kinase enzyme that had recently been implicated in        APP processing The theoretical link between statins and ROCK goes as follows statins        inhibit the isoprenoid pathway isoprenoids are regulators of the enzyme Rho and Rho in        turn activates ROCK And while such potential connections could be drawn for any number of        molecules Gandy and colleagues went on to test whether statins exert their effect on APP        cleavage by interfering with the isoprenoidRhoROCK pathway        Working in mouse neuroblastoma cells they confirmed that two different statins        increased healthy cleavage of APP When they directly interfered with the        isoprenoidRhoROCK pathway by adding a drug that inhibits Rho activation they saw        effects similar to those of the statins ie an increase in healthy cleavage The same        effects were seen when they transfected the cells with a dominant negative form of ROCK        which inactivates the normal ROCK molecules in the cell this outcome shows that the        pathway can influence APP cleavage Most conclusively when they added a version of ROCK        that was constitutively always active they reduced basal levels and abolished        statinstimulated levels of healthy cleavage        Taken together these results suggest that statins influence APP processing at least in        part by modulating the isoprenoid pathway and inactivating the ROCK kinase Future        studies are necessary to determine whether this mechanism is actually responsible for the        apparent clinical benefits of statins Another question worth exploring further is whether        ROCK might be a suitable target for therapeutic interventions that aim to decrease        harmful and promote healthy cleavage of APP
