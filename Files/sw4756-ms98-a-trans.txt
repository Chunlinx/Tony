        think is wrong with the public school system is that i think weve lately in the last twenty years or so kind of lost focus with the basics       uh in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where uh were teaching kids not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career uh about and the problem comes about if these people arent well rounded students or graduates that that sort of traps them in the field that theyve spent all this time being educated in   i think theres something to that yeah yeah i tend to agree uh well i remember now its been quite a few years since my kids were in high school im getting that old but uh i remember uh being a little surprised at the uh the catalog of courses like instead of taking a survey course on American Literature you had you chose from uh it almost looked like a college catalog   uhhuh   and uh the courses were too specialized as you said and you just read you know they they take a whole semester long course on uh on one writer or something uh thats fine for college  but it seems kind of silly for high school   yeah thats its im only twenty four years old so ive was through a lot of that uh although     youd be about the same age as my sons yeah   well in my luckily up here the school system up here was intelligent enough that they didnt want to get that focused and they drilled into our heads and the same thing with the college that i went to to get as broad of an education as possible so that youre down with the basics and then once you know what you want to do then try and uh get some specific courses but i remember one of the things that they were always drilling into us was the need to learn how to communicate effectively through writing   um uhhuh   and i i constantly come up against some of the writings being involved in uh computers and the like where i see other people writing and its embarrassing       you know its some of these things that and ive seen papers that in sixth grade i wouldnt have had returned uh to me which are getting As in college today the standards have really fallen   uhhuh yeah yeah i taught college for awhile not recently but uh       yeah i remember i i was quite surprised  at uh i mean you start rejecting things on that basis you end up handing uh everybodys papers back thats probably what we should have done     huh       yeah it it  the only way that i ever you know i i took Comp journalism as a major and uh the writing they what they would do is they would focus in on our particular problems well on the college level course and uh   uhhuh   uh would then work with us as far as fixing those things i had a problem with uh writing excessive verbiage   uhhuh   uh in my writing and i they taught me basically how to pair it down a little bit and i i dont see that in a broader you know even in a public school uh situation because a lot of the teachers have these large classes that they cant devote the individual attention to each student that they may have twenty or thirty years ago   uhhuh yeah i suppose i guess the class sizes are bigger now i guess they must be   i remember large group in certain uh courses mainly Political Science wed have lectures where thered be three hundred students   uhhuh   and if you had a question you know or or didnt understand it at all of course youre not going to raise your hand in a three hundred group   no   thing and say i dont know what youre talking about theyre going to just keep their mouth shut   right they need smaller discussion   and i think you know its those kinds of things that i im not sure how we go about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more uh uh resources into first of all getting uh the uh teachers reasonable salaries and uh expecting in return some sort of standard standard and uh you know some proof that what theyre doing is actually worth what we want to pay them   yeah   and then try and get maybe more involvement with the parents a lot of parents expect the schools to just take care of their kids and uh you know you you its your job not mine   uhhuh well ive been reading about some successful school systems and it does seem that parental involvement is the is the common uh factor and everybodys doing anything that works these days       so thats probably uh one of the big keys   well how are the schools down in your area these days   well actually theyre pretty good uh i i used to live in Wisconsin i only moved to Texas about four years ago but uh
