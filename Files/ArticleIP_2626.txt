                                 Monday the Market Went Mad            The headline appeared on theReuters wire late Tuesday night Stock plunge may dent Finnish growth            Great Just when we thoughtwe were out of the woods the damn Finns come along and throw everythinginto turmoil again And here we always thought they could take care ofthemselves            Ofcourse given the fact that US trade with Finlandindeed with all ofScandinaviaamounts to something less than  percent of our annual grossdomestic product one would hope that US fund managers will be able to handlethis news without panicking But then the events of the past week have not donemuch to inspire confidence in the rationality of the American stock marketTake Intel for instance When the market closed Monday US investors thoughtIntels shares were worth  billion When it closed Tuesday they thought thevery same shares were worth  billion God only knows what the news fromFinland will mean            Asia is of course a much bigger and much more importantpart of the world economy than is Finland Currency and equitymarket turmoilin Asia has had and will continue to have real effects on Americasreal economy In other words it would be a mistake to dismissall US investors worries about the impact of the Hong Kong selloffon US companies as the fearful bleatings of people who having read too manysilly headlines about globalization suddenly decidedsince everyone elseseemed to have decided toothat the sky was falling But it would not be amistake to dismiss most of their concerns as precisely that            There weresolid reasons for the sharp decline in the value of equities in Hong Kongitself most obviously the precipitous rise in interest rates and theprecipitous drop in liquidity as the central bank fights to keep the HK dollarpegged to the US dollar Still its hard to see the drop in the US stockmarket as much more than a classicif shortlivedcase of what economistscall herding In a strange way it seems clear that people were looking foran excuse to sell not simply to lock in profits for the quarter but alsobecause the bull market had lasted too long and had risen too high The oddthing about this panic after all is how unhysterical the actual trading wasExcept for the minutes immediately following the halfhour break Monday buyand sell orders were easily matched up and there were no stories as there werein  of market specialists simply refusing to pick up their phones andtrade Everyone was racing for the exits but they were doing so in an orderlyfashion            The fact that investors in some way wanted thebubble to burst if only for a little while can be seen also in the sense ofrelief with which many on the Street spoke of Mondays drop It was as if witha thousand points gone from the Dow investors could look at the market alittle more clearly and decide what they really thought Of course thatfeeling of clarity disappeared almost immediately Tuesday as everyone suddenlyturned around and started racing for the entrances but it must have been nicewhile it lasted            Is itcavalier to dismiss this past week as a simple illustration that humanssometimes act like sheep Not really But then I would say that wouldnt IIn the first place its hard to see how even a point drop in the Dow wouldseriously affect the US economy Except for IPOs firsttime public stockofferings most American companies raise capital internally The stock marketis in that sense almost purely a secondary market And while its never goodfor consumer confidence to have brokers jumping out of windows short and steepdrops in the valuation of equities have nothing to do with the production ofreal wealth In the second place and perhaps more importantly Asia isntimportant enough to the American economy to justify a selloff like we sawMonday            Now that may seem like a dubious assertion particularlygiven the constant rhetoric about the global economy with which we are delugedand CocaColas persistent evocation of the  billion Chinese who drink onlyone Coke each today but will drink two Cokes each tomorrow But consider thisUS GDP is now somewhere close to  trillion Last year US exports to allof Asia were  billion or around  percent of GDP Over a third of all USexports do go to Asia and that market has been growing rapidly inrecent years But its still only of minor importance to the US economy as awhole And in any case its not as if Asia has suddenly vanished from the mapWhile growth rates throughout Southeast Asia are going to slow those economiesare not in recession which means they will still be buying even if less thanbefore If anything the combination of currency devaluation and slower growthin Asia should help the US equity market by continuing to keep inflation lowand assuaging the Feds concerns about an overheating economy however dubiousthose concerns might be            Havingsaid all that the Asian market undoubtedly is more important in economicterms to large US corporations than it is to your local dry cleaner and inthat sense the GDPexport comparison is deceptive According to some analystsa third of corporate profit growth in the last fiscal year came from exportsSo the rhetoric of globalization is not simply rhetoric And thats especiallytrue for certain sectors of US industry As has been much too much remarkedupon US semiconductorparts companies do a lot of business with Asiansemiconductor firms If demand for computers dries up in Asia those partscompanies will find it difficult to replace the business The same may also betrue on a smaller scale of larger software and hardware companies likeMicrosoft and Intel On the other hand many of these companies have assemblyplants in the region And if you can pay your bills in devalued ringgit and getpaid in US dollars youre generally going to be pretty happy            US multinationals have been feeling the stingof the strong dollar for some time now and the continued weakening of Asiancurrencies will continue to hurt their profit margins But it seems tellingthat it was IBM which has seen currency problems erode earnings for two yearsnow that led Tuesdays rally by announcing it was going to buy back billion of its own shares after the companys stock dropped eight points onMonday Sharebuyback plans are sketchy as longterm business strategies butIBMs assurance that its shares were undervalued suggests that its notparticularly worried about the ultimate impact of Hong Kongs woes Of coursethere is always the chance that the companys management has simply gonemad            Inissuing what amounted to a public vote of confidence in the market IBM wasactually continuing a venerable tradition of Establishment attempts to quellselling panics by intervening loudly and decisively In October of  as thestock market was melting down JP Morgan went to New York banks and compelledthem to dip into their reserves to offer loans that would allow stockholders tocover their margins and begin buying again In the midst of the crisis he sentan emissary to the floor of the Exchange where the man raised his handquieting the crowd and said I am authorized to lend  million There willbe enough for everybody And that at least according to the story wasthat            Twenty years later it was JP Morgan and Co again Atthe start of the October  market slide when investors were dumping sharesas fast as possible Thomas Lamont of Morgan assembled a consortium ofinvestment bankers who committed themselves to putting  million into themarket The Morgan representative came onto the floor of the Exchange steppedinto the middle of the caterwauling mob trading in US Steel and bid  forthe companys shares at a time when the stock was already trailing well belowthat Like the first this was a rather cinematic moment but it didnt workquite as well Within three years US Steel like the market lost  percentof its  value            I suppose its a measure ofhow far weve come that IBM just issued a press release though it would havebeen stirring to see CEO Lou Gerstner storm into the Exchange Tuesday to startbuying up shares In any case IBMs decision was obviously not as momentous aseither Morgans or Lamonts because they were dealing with genuine disasterswhile Big Blue was responding to a blip Nor does Big Blue exercise the kind offinancial or cultural power that Morgan once did But the announcement wasstill a welcome slap in the face to a market that was hyperventilating for nogood reason at all Or rather to a market that was hyperventilating for asreal a reason as there is Markets are made up of people and people sometimesget afraid Even in Finland
