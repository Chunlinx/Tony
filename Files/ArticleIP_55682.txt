                                 Touched Angels            In his raucousvaudevillian allegory                   Dogma                Kevin Smith concocts a scenario inwhich the will of God comes apocalyptically into conflict with Catholicdoctrine To wholly relate how that happensthe plot involves a missionary NewJersey cardinal George Carlin the devil and two fallen somewhat insaneangels Matt Damon and Ben Affleckwould not only ruin the surprise it wouldruin this review since there are nearly as many convolutions in the narrativeas there are in Scripture I first wrote about Dogma and Smiths edgypress conference when the movie had its American premiere in October at theNew York Film Festival amid demonstrations by the Catholic League and othergroups Click to read that account Then Ill tell you a few things that I wishId said regret saying and might have said better            Some additional hosannasfirst The angels wings are cool They look like genuine flesh blood andcartilage especially when theyre clipped and they literally add texture toeffects that might have seemed well featherweight Dogma is the firsttime that Smithwhose clunky direction in Chasing Amy  did hisskillful script no favorsseems interested in moving the camera composing theframe editing etc The mixture of slacker smalltalk goofy slapstick andGrand Guignol horror works better than anyone could have imagined What holdsit all together is the writerdirectors fervid conviction A hint of cynicismwould have turned Dogma into camp but the moviein spite of its rubberpoop monsters and splattery gore and smutty jokeshas the resonance ofbelief            On reflection however I think that Smith was being a taddisingenuous when he said at his press conference that he wasnt expecting anangry reaction Yes hes a good Catholic boy but hes also schooled in theworks of that very bad Catholic boy John Waters Yes he wanted to affirm hisreverence for God and Jesus but he also wanted to give a hotfoot to theCatholic Church Like a lot of good comics he wanted to be outrageousbuthe didnt necessarily want to outrage  He was truly shocked whenhomicidally antiSemitic letters poured into the offices of Harvey and BobWeinstein of Miramax Its parent company Disney ultimately decided not todistribute the film And hes legitimately terrified of death threatswhowouldnt be He wanted people to talkand laugh and argueabout his moviebut he had no intention of courting martyrdom            Lets go further and admit that Smith is not merelykicking the tires of his faithhes slashing them Hes saying thatorganized religion needs a better tread Hes blaming the indifferent status ofa lot of Catholics on the church itself His churchgoing heroine Bethanyplayed by Linda Fiorentino has become so desensitized to Vatican teachingsthat she works in an abortion clinic Smith has written a characterthe th apostle played by Chris Rockwhose view of organized religionis akin to Gov Jesse Venturas He believes it has lost touch with thefundamental religious impulse In the film there is no counterweight to Rocksapostleno substantial or sane character who speaks on the rightness ofCatholic dogma There isnt even a Dostoevskian Grand Inquisitor to tell us whyhumans need so many rules and regulations to keep from following their animalnatures into despair and anarchy The tone of Dogma might be searchingbut Smith already has his answers Unlike Martin Scorsese whose solemn adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis The Last Temptation of                Christset off a similar firestorm Smith has earned the wrath He should just say Imeant to piss you off just dont start any pogroms or shoot me            Theres another aspect ofDogma that rattles peoples cages Most millennial apocalypse fantasieshave been promulgated by the religious right which wants to frighten peopleinto repenting their liberal attitudes toward the Scripture Outside of weirdfringe pictures such as Larry Cohens God Told Me To Dogma is the first truly countercultural apocalypse fantasy Smith isfighting the endoftheworld mavens on their own turf appropriating theirrhetoric and their symbols for his own decidedly less Moral Majoritarian endsYou can imagine the doomsayers storming out of theaters and fuming WhoseArmageddon is it anyway            The camera is at eye level for                   Rosetta                Inthe tumultuous opening it hurtles down a staircase behind the teenage titlecharacter Emilie Dequenne as she tries to elude the factory boss who has justfired her It swerves left then right as she pulls on locked doors in a vainattempt to evade the plants security Its sickeningly in the thick of thingsas she claws at her pursuers and shrieks that its unfair shes a good workershe doesnt deserve to be let go Throughout this terse entertaining parableit won the grand prize at this years Cannes Film Festival the Belgianbornwriterdirectors Luc and JeanPierre Dardenne  La Promesse  immerse you in the sensations of Rosettas life her daily roundabout slogthrough the woods to reach the trailer park where she lives with her alcoholicmother shes too ashamed to go through the front entrance her frustratingtreks to find employment however menial and most of all her countless ragesat a society that refuses to grant her a normal her word existence            By confining the moviesperspective to Rosetta and her rituals the Dardennes suggest the ways in whichpeople lose the big picture and so have no insight into their own corruptionAll they know is what they needand what will happen if someone else beatsthem out In Dequenne the filmmakers have found a somewhat lumpen girlwith just a trace of prettiness especially when she opens her eyes and letsthe world see in She mostly doesnt though which is the point She trompsaround dulleyed in a gray skirt and thick mustardcolored stockingsa sullenbottomfeeder When a generous friend Riquet Fabrizio Rongionethe only oneshe has ever had the film impliesfalls into quicksand and screams for helpyou can see Rosettas thought processes If he dies his job will open upshell get it and shell be normal            As in the La Promesse  the point is to show howcapitalism is fundamentally at odds with human decency People are good buttheyre driven to victimize others by the fear that what they have will betaken away At best they turn into machines at worst most of the bossesthey become casual exploiters You cant land a job without being raked by theangry gaze of the person youve unfairly replaced and once you have it thereare no guarantees that tomorrow you wont be raking someone else with your ownangry gaze Change the way things work and you will change mankind is theimplicit messagealthough its crucial to add that there are noexplicit messages no BrechtianMarxist exhortations BothRosetta and La Promesse end at the point when their protagonistsconsciousness begins The next step is anyones guess            I fear Ive madeRosetta sound programmatic Well it is but the thing you come awaywith isnt the program but the rhythm and texture of a young workingclasswomans life The Dardennes are peerless at staging and shooting rituals suchas Rosettas day selling waffles and beer from a truck taking an orderplucking a waffle from the iron grabbing a beer from the shelf countingmoney making change saying thank you taking another order  Its easy todismiss films that make grandiose statements about how people ought to live butnever convincingly portray how they do The utterly believable capitalistecosystems of the Dardennes are harder to shake off            Most of the good stuff in William Trevors novel                  Felicias Journey                takes place behind the eyes of its centralcharacters a young Irish girl Felicia who crosses the sea to England in ahopeful quest to find the father of her unborn child and the fat middleagedcatering manager Hiditch who takes a paternal interest in the lass when itbecomes clear that her young man has caddishly given her the slip The girl isa naive but her mixture of optimism and spooky prescience gives herperceptions weight and Hiditch has a subterranean existence thats constantlyat odds with his pleasantries He might well be a psychopath who has preyedonand dispatchedother young women Atom Egoyan the Canadian director Exotica   The Sweet Hereafter   who adapted anddirected the book does tender morbidly evocative work As Felicia thecoltish Elaine Cassidy manages to look both luminous and unformed and BobHoskins gives Hiditchs bland homilies so much subtext he made me think of theParis Opera House in the Phantom of the Opera  basement under basementunder basement down to the dungeons Handing Felicia a cup of tea he saysThe goodness is in the warmth they say and I half expected maggots to swarmout of his mouth            The movie doesnt come to much though Egoyansbest films have tricky textures They double and triple back on themselves inways that play against the characters bland visages and the often sterilesettings Here apart from a few choice flashbacks the action is crawlinglylinearand opaque Egoyan has invented a delicious characterHiditchscelebrity French chef momfor his wife the marvelous Arsine Khanjian andshe gives the movie a jolt of energy whenever she pops up on TV screens or inHiditchs memory But the rest is just a catandmouse game for a ratherslowwitted cat and an even slowerwitted mouse On Quaaludes Under water
