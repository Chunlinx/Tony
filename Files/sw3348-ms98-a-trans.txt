what do you use it for as far as your own work     um oh games mostly um data base like address lists and recipes and just   umhum   uh sort of the stuff that i like to keep track of mostly most of what i do is shareware games and and copies of stuff that ive gotten from other people i use Lotus a lot just because i like using Lotus   yeah yeah do your kids ever get to use it at work     uh no because theyre two and four so theyre not quite old enough to use those yet i tell them mommys playing on the computer so   two and four huh yeah not there yet yeah     they know what im doing   yeah well   but at work i use it mostly for i most of what i do is in Lotus ive weve got a couple of word processing but  id rather use Lotus  i know it better   yeah know it better than that yeah i think everyone knows it better than most the custom word processor   uh yeah uh well weve got WordStar  we just got WordPerfect and i  havent gotten around to learning WordPerfect yet so   yeah well i use WordPerfect at work exclusively pretty much exclusively   yeah its i like well i work for the RTC so we thats what everything they send us is in WordPerfect so we kind of had to get WordPerfect so   uh have to use it yeah well i have one at home that  my kids are twelve eight and three   oh   so they use it uh quite a bit for games and uh the twelve year old uses it you know for school uses the word word processing for school quite a bit really   ill bet uhhuh well good yeah thats thats one thing im hoping by the time mine get up there that we will be able to have one at home   and and uh yeah now we also uh course of i use it for uh i have a some check balancing and budgeting software that i use have for several years now every all my checkbooks been on the computer for a couple years   uhhuh uhhuh oh yeah thats since i work for the RTC we used to uh i used to be the loan teller for a failed savings and loan  and a couple of our customers would use the automated check writing   uhhuh huh would they really   programs yeah and it was i it was always interesting to see them it was like oh okay  i recognize these who would be i i guess that would be a pretty good feature to use on that   here they go yeah yeah well ive used it also for tax for about the past four years i guess and its makes it real nice   umhum that would be good   and um i guess thats mainly been it other than you know like like yeah we use it for games quite a bit   yeah im kind of hooked on Tetris   yeah  i dont have Tetris but boy im glad to probably a good thing i dont   well the shareware version i got has got like six different versions of Tetris   you got a shareware version huh whats it   umhum it was like three dollars ive i like that its its pretty cool   do you know what its called i mean does have a   um its called Nyet N Y E T which is what is it   in hm   oh something about its not not called Tetris you know its like uhhuh   right yeah   and the other versions called Aint   aint because it aint Tetris   yeah yeah well the the four letters i dont even remember what they stand for but its its a little   yeah   i mean what think of what that things called but its its a four
