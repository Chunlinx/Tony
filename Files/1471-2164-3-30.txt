                    Background        Schizophrenia and associated mental illness are complex        psychiatric disorders each affecting about  of the world        population Genetic evaluation of Schizophrenia and        associated mental illness have suggested an important role        for genetic factors        however no specific gene        or biological marker has yet been identified Genome scans        have mapped several loci in various ethnic groups        Replications of these scans were positive in some cases and        negative in others       These data as well as        reports of the specific candidate genes beginning to be        identified implicate genetic heterogeneity of        susceptibility genes     and also sex specific        differences    in the molecular basis of disease        phenotype Linkage analyses of all published genome scans        for Schizophrenia genes have identified chromosome q        as one of the regions with evidence of linkage to        Schizophrenia In independent genome scans Bipolar        disorder has also shown linkage to this region               The linkage region for both disorders spans        approximately  cM on chromosome qq     The        region between D S and DS showed linkage to        Bipolar disorder based on a whole genome scan with an        average marker spacing of  cM on q Fine mapping of        this region using nine additional markers with an average        spacing of  cM confirms the evidence of linkage to q        around markers DSDS     Association analyses        with GASSOC TDT and ASPEX Sibtdt showed linkage        disequilibrium signals with several markers including        DS which need follow up by typing more markers in the        region in a larger sample size     Meta analysis of        wholegenome linkage scans further strengthens the        susceptibility locus of BP on chromosome q     All        these studies clearly point towards further efforts in the        identification of susceptibility genes for this disorder        Based on evidence of linkage a comprehensive linkage map        was developed around this region     Complete        annotation of this region may include as many as  genes        One approach to identify susceptibility locus is to use the        candidate gene approach Studies are underway at our center        to identify susceptibility variants by mutation screening        of candidate genes in this region on a small series of        Bipolar families showing linkage to q For the present        study we have selected two candidate genes viz human        peptide transporter SLCA and human glypican GPC        for mutation screening from this region        SLCA is an intestinal oligopeptide transporter also        referred to as HPEPT that belongs to solute carrier        family It is expressed in intestine kidney liver and        brain     The function of SLCA is to absorb and        transport small peptides      The efficiency of        absorption and transportation of L DOPA and its metabolite        dopamine which are neurotransmitter candidates is        increased by SLCA     Therefore it is an important        potential gene for future drug design delivery and        targeting            GPC belongs to the cell surface heparan sulfate        proteoglycan family and is expressed in limb kidney        developing central nervous system and brain tissue             In vertebrates  glypican family members belonging to        the proteoglycan family have so far been characterized            Although there is a high degree of conservation of        polypeptide sequence among family members they are        localized to different chromosomes Glypican is        structurally correlated to glypican and localized to        chromosome q Deletion of the q region is associated        with human q syndrome a developmental disorder            Some of the proteoglycans play important functional roles        in neurogenesis axon guidance synapse development            and cellular growth and differentiation              Mutations in GPC cause SimpsonGolabiBehmel syndrome             however no mutations were detected in the GPC and        GPC genes     The glypican gene has been suggested        to be a good candidate for brachydactyly type E            Given that GPC is highly expressed in brain and mutations        in other genes of the glypican families are associated with        developmental disorder GPC could be a potential candidate        gene for Bipolar disorder        In order to identify a possible role for these        candidates SLCA  GPC as susceptibility genes we        performed mutation screening of the coding regions in         families n   affected with Bipolar disorder showing        linkage to q First the accurate gene structure of        SLCA  GPC was defined by analysis of the available        draft human genomic sequence Next PCR primers and        conditions for amplification and sequencing of each exon        were developed and sequencing was performed                    Results                  Genomic structure          We determined genomic structure of both the genes by          aligning cDNA sequences with available human draft          genomic sequences httpwwwncbinlmnihgov The          entire SLCA gene was represented in one BAC clone          sequence AL and GPC in  BAC clone sequences          Alignment of SLCA cDNA sequence accession number          U with the genomic sequence accession no          AL revealed that it is a large gene with a coding          sequence of  bp long having  exons spread over           kb of genomic sequence The splice junctions          follow the GTAG rule Table           Alignment of GPC cDNA accession number U with          the working draft sequence revealed a genomic          organization of  exons which was represented in  BAC          clone sequences The coding sequence of GPC gene is           bp long and encodes  amino acids The first two exons          of the GPC gene are present in BAC clone accession          number AL exons  in AC exon  in          AL exon  in AL and exon  in AL          Table  Most of the splice junctions follow the GTAG          rule                          Mutation analysis          No mutations were identified in the GPC gene in the           families affected with Bipolar disorder Two polymorphic          variants were discovered in SLCA gene one in exon           and another one in exon  Sequence analysis revealed a          T to C Figure A substitution in third position of          codon encoding alanine at  position of mRNA and A to          G Figure B substitution at position  of mRNA Of          these  individuals  affected and  normal were          homozygous CC exon    affected and  normal          were heterozygous TC exon  and three were          heterozygous AG exon                             Discussion        Gene mapping studies using microsatellite markers have        identified chromosome q as one of the putative loci for        Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder         To        begin identification of a susceptibility gene for Bipolar        disorder we have screened two candidate genes SLCA and        GPC on the basis of their genetic localization within the         cM region of chromosome q     The entire        SLCA gene was represented in one BAC clone sequence        AL and GPC in  BAC clone sequences Alignment of        SLCA cDNA sequence with genomic sequence accession no        AL revealed that it is a large gene with a coding        sequence of  bp long having  exons spread over         kb of genomic sequence The splice junctions follow        the GTAG rule Table  A wide variety of transporters        are found in the intestine and several genetic disorders        have been shown to result from deficient intestinal        transporters     SLCA consists of  amino acids        with putative  transmembrane domains and  putative        protein kinase C phosphorylation sites Exonintron        boundaries occur mostly in the loops connecting        transmembrane segments    suggesting a modular gene        structure reflecting the TMSloop repeat units in SLCA        Computer modeling and site directed mutagenesis studies        suggested a list of amino acids for the transport        functional activities Tyrosine Y and histidyl        residues H H and H are two of these amino acids        playing important roles in the function of transporters               In our mutation screening of families with        Bipolar disorder we did not find variants at these        positions However we did identify two variants in the        SLCA gene one in exon  and another one in exon         Sequence analysis revealed a T to C substitution in the        third position of codon encoding alanine at  position        exon  of mRNA Of these  individuals were homozygous        CC  and  were heterozygous TC  exon         However there was no amino acid change Substitution of T        to C in normal members as well suggests it is a        polymorphic variant and not a pathogenic mutation In exon         the variation observed was an A to G substitution in        the untranslated region at position  of mRNA Of these        eighteen were homozygous AA  and three were        heterozygous AG  The variant in exon  was also        found in the SNP database NCBI SNP cluster ID rs        although the population frequency was not reported An        association study of this variant in a large population        will aid in understanding the potential role of the SLCA        gene in Bipolar disorder        Alignment of the GPC cDNA with the working draft        sequence revealed a genomic organization of  exons which        was represented in  BAC clone sequences Table  The        whole GPC gene is  bp long and encodes  amino        acids The first two exons of the GPC gene are present in        BAC clone accession number AL exons  in        AC exon  in AL exon  in AL and exon         in AL Table  Most of the splice junctions follow        the GTAG rule The exon structure was confirmed by        comparing the cDNA with nucleotide contig NT While        we finished screening this gene for mutations its genomic        structure was published and confirms the presence of         exons with exonintron boundaries following the AGGT rule        with a size of approximately  Mb     No mutations or        polymorphisms were identified in the GPC gene in the         families affected with Bipolar disorder decreasing the        likelihood that this gene is involved in the etiology of        Bipolar disorder Several disorders have been reported due        to mutations in glypican gene families     and        interestingly due to deletion of region on chr q             It would be interesting to study the occurrence of        Schizophrenia or other associated mental illnesses in        individuals with these deletions Mutation screening of the        glypican genes in these patients might give clue to        Schizophrenia susceptibility locus        Absence of pathogenic mutations in the two genes GPC        and SLCA studied in seven families of Bipolar disorder        suggests that these genes are presumably not involved in        the susceptibility locus for Bipolar disorder in the        families screened However due to the complex nature of        these diseases no definite conclusions can be drawn We        cannot rule out genetic heterogeneity for these genes and        suggest studying more families For example the NOTCH         gene that is located on chromosome p confers        susceptibility to Schizophrenia in the British population        but not in the Japanese population     Genetic        heterogeneity is very common in hereditary deafness            also the prevalence of mutations in the connexin  gene        is a major cause of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive        deafness that varies in different populations            Considering the complex nature of the disease and the        supportive evidence of linkage to chromosome q            it would be worth while to continue further studies to        find out Schizophrenia susceptibility genes at this        critical region As the human genome reference sequence is        nearing completion the analysis of genetic variation is        becoming important Our plans are to annotate all the genes        for a mega base region on chromosome  and develop a        high density SNP map Aim is to identify variants in the        critical region to predict haplotypes from numerous        variants observed and perform mutation analysis by direct        sequencing with the ultimate objective of identifying        specific sequencehaplotype associated with the disease        phenotype                    Methods                  Study Subjects          A total of  nuclear families n affected with          Bipolar disorder were selected The seven families          consist of five normal parents
