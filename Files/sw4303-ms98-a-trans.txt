        well um as far as the as far as spending goes       the way um the way i see it in the in the last article i read was that i think US ought to spend the same amount of money that were spending but i think the states need to take advantage of it more than they are because i know the article i read stated that Texas had um what was it like eleven million not a million but like a hundred and ten thousand   umhum   offered to it or more than that and it didnt take advantage of all the money that it was offered   umhum   because the state that im in has is the fourth largest in AIDS cases and its just not taking advantage of the money thats being provided   i wasnt aware that there was a very large uh gay community in Texas   well theres well well we have we have our own you know that we have i guess a fair share um and its its spreading outside of of the homosexual community   interesting yeah and Atlanta is sort of the homosexual capital of the Southeast so we have quite a few cases here and of course we here a lot about it because the Centers for Disease Control is located here   uhhuh   uh my feeling on the funding issue is uh uh proportion in proportion to the number of people who are dying of AIDS uh compared to uh other diseases like cancer and heart disease   umhum umhum umhum   were spending many many times more on AIDS research than we are for these other diseases   umhum   and i think a lot of its just due to political clout and pressure   well also because its so new   yeah   and cancer and cancer and such doesnt spread as readily to other people as it does as AIDS does   that well yes thats true but also uh we havent learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways AIDS is completely preventable through uh behavioral changes   umhum umhum   i do think that uh part of the reason that we havent made as much progress in AIDS research and the reason were spending so much money on it is that its almost all of the research is in the hands of the government and we all know how efficient the government is uh the way i look at it is if uh       if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over whos going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside   umhum umhum   and if private industry just through the profit motive more than anything else were set loose to go off and find uh a cure with the promise that theyd be able to get the financial rewards from it uh i feel that wed find a cure really quick   umhum umhum   uh but as it is its just being the whole program is just being mismanaged by bureaucrats uh and its real disappointing uh you know so many of the other uh major advances that we have today are are done by private industry but for some reason in this case no ones really willing to give them a chance   thats true i hadnt i hadnt thought about that   uh course you know im a big advocate of the free market anyway and uh it seems to me that so much of what the government gets involved in just just goes to pot uh but uh i uh i do want there to be a cure   umhum   uh uh but like so many other things i think the way just the way that were going about it is not the best way   well um i i think a lot of a lot i mean this is a this is a a an a totally new experience we havent come really ever come across at least not in my like time that you know where weve come across a disease that has spread this rapidly um and that weve you know is is changing i know just in the last three months the CDC has come back and redefined AIDS   sure   you know and so i mean its its very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding and we keep you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be HIV positive for you know now what have they bumped it up to eleven years now   uh its a long time   yeah you know   and its interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are HIV positive but who never get the disease   umhum   and it seems to me that its its likely that theres some other uh its not just the virus that causes it but its something else in your body that the virus triggers uh that causes it and if they can find whatever that other that other trigger   umhum
