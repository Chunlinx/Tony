        do you have children     uh yes uh we have two sons uh ones a freshman in college and ones a sophomore in high school and you   ah i have one thats a freshman in high school a daughter and a son whos a sixth grader in a middle school   okay   and i spend most of my time carpooling  the story of my life   oh yes  yes uh   my kids are involved in sports my daughters played basketball for six years and my son plays football i my rule is that they cant play a sport the same time of the year   yeah   because theres just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere     uh well uh yeah we spend a lot spend a  did spend a lot of time uh it really helped when the uh older one was old enough to get his license and could uh   yes   drive around by himself although that brought in a whole another set of problems  but uh  for yeah for one thing uh   i know i know the insurance   but yeah we uh we do but our two had had uh totally different interests so that there there was not much uh overlap as such the the older one is not was not at all into uh sports for the most part  uh he participated band and and uh scouts were his two big things and uh   yes my son is in both band and scouts too   and the younger younger one is uh uh the sports one and the whatever season it is hes hes playing although footballs really his favorite yeah   oh gee   so uh yeah we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling and uh you know and then trying to be uh at as much as possible with anything that they that they do but then uh   right   we also did do spend uh  time with them trying to trying to uh you know just family time uh   uhhuh   we at a at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth and and uh uh although we didnt uh do it as much or as often as uh i would have liked to i would like to do that as a as a family and and some TV watching what about you   yeah we found this Oriental tile game called mahjongg     yeah ive ive ive heard of that ive never actually never actually played it but   have you well its really fun um one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and its more fun with four people   yeah yep   and its a game that none of their friends know how to play and they both enjoy it so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad so uh we play that a lot with them   yeah   and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies we have family that lives outside of the state so we   yeah   go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips so that and my husband and son go camping   yeah so do we okay   with scouts mostly my daughter and and i hate camping so we go shopping so that just kind of works out real well and um im a writer   yeah   yeah   by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too so a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together   oh now thats neat yeah no we never had anything like like that but that   yes yeah so that gives us special time together too and shes on the yearbook staff and things like that so i can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so   yeah umhum   yep   umhum oh well good well i you know in terms of in terms of any sorts of trends i you know obviously obviously things are different from for for me than and my children than when i was growing up i i i grew up on a farm uh in Iowa and uh   yes   you know the whole family was around the the whole time and and what my father did was was uh interseting you know obvious to me and i i helped out with it but       uh although i have brought my boys into  to see where i work its not that easy and its its certainly not at all common and they they just dont really have that same idea so that theres uh its its a whole different uh kind of thing there then then uh   right my husbands taken us to work with him and we still dont know what he does so we just say he travels a lot so that kind of covers it   yeah yeah yeah well that makes it hard though for in terms of you know family time with with him   yes yeah   yeah ive been lucky in that respect that i dont uh dont travel too much   hes been on temporary duties where hes been gone nine months   oh   yes so those are the real killers if hes just gone hes gone three weeks right now and thats thats mild compared to the big ones so we just you know   yeah yes yeah   i just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done and something major always needs to be done so   yeah yeah yeah   you just have to to handle it till he gets home and hopefully he wont have too many surprises when he gets home   yeah right
