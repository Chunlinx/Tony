            think of drug testing   well im one of those grey haired old guys that doesnt think that theres anything wrong with it how about you   i dont know i i see it as as a bit of a privacy issues why do you need to tell the company any information i can definitely see it in the case where theres a problem that you know the persons performance is bad or where they have uh you know they suspect something wrong with the person but in a case where theres no problem and nothing suspected what does the random testing do especially since theyre only testing for certain things theyre not testing for other things uh that could be impairing your ability to perform the job   well that thats an interesting question        from from the stand point of to me uh a general uh uh you know a a general question is all all substances the particular question in my mind is uh its very easy to go from from uh how should i say it uh   recreational use   well let me put it this way from very minor use to uh to very significant use in a short time   yes thats true of lots and lots of things   and uh yes alcohol is uh one of the most and   umhum   when i was growing up uh        i i was lucky enough to belong to a family that was where we didnt have to say well dad why how should i say this alcohol and and uh tobacco and all those substances were off limits and at the time i i kind of thought well this is a strict house and   umhum   then as i grew older uh in fact one of the guys told me said you were kind of lucky        the stuff that were all trying to quit right now uh smoking and and uh coffee and things like that are things that you never had to that you dont have to quit   yeah      uh but i im im not talking about you know about moral character here as much as i am just talking about   right      um most of the things that that parents in how should i say it the big issue was why cant i do this if you do that dad i mean you come home and have your martini right   umhum yes its definitely the do as i say not as i do question   yeah that was a definite opening for the for the you do your thing and ill do mine um in my particular case i think that all of those or like alcohol is a is a severe problem   umhum   its happens to be traditionally        uh and uh how should i say it it has to be traditionally accepted that the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user and if they have to spot the occasional user in the process and and when i say extreme i mean they can you can go from from little or nothing to to extreme very quickly in this game ive been told   yeah now i think thats more related to other stresses outside you know if you get into a period where youre very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then youre going to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and thats very true of alcoholism   uh well yes and also the others too i mean im      yeah   im not uh uh i guess the way im approaching this is its tough to defend half of the playing field if you dont defend the whole playing field you know   umhum   and uh the playing field in in this case is uh some people are trying to say well its just uh marijuana or cocaine or whatever      right   uh and i think thats a tough a tough proposition it always has been and and it gave a lot of my uh friends parents fits   yeah but you know it it i i think theres a broader issue there is does a company have a right to know something about a person that doesnt effect their job performance   uh and i you know that doesnt effect your job performance i think as a as a real tough uh issue and if i were if i were convinced i mean you know you and i are just talking here and   right   how how should i say it this is talk for pay so im not trying to attack you personally but but uh uh the problem is that i think it does effect performance and and you can go from a from a from no stress at all in your life to being significantly stressed uh in a day   yes   right and when the   uh i i i think thats to a large extent most people you know let lets take alcohol since that seems to be the more public knowledge and more studied of these type of things   yeah   um i think theres more of a predisposition to it that a lot of people when they get stressed out you and i
