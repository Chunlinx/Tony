            sure   okay Brian i going to press number one and well go   okay     hey um uh Ronnie i think my first introduction to the metric system was in physics in college and i think prior to that i didnt even realize that another system existed uh but it makes so darn much sense to me over the English system i i i have a hard time understanding why people dont take to it   is it well um yeah id i agree with the the ease in the use of it and uh the it certainly its so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here for the last hundred years is in the English system   yeah i understand   and tool and die equipment doesnt wear out too often   no no   so i think thats the the one place where uh they will have a hard time uh getting people to change   yeah and i noticed that too in uh in uh uh metal stamp metal parts that we buy we at one time went back through and dual dual dimensioned them all   uhhuh   and uh you know its uh its easy to put down point O O one inches or one mil uh its kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent   right   uh in in terms of the numbers that youve got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically ive got a uh a and it drives my wife crazy you know shell say how far is it from here to somewhere she wants to go and ill say oh about eight kilometers   uhhuh   and shell look at me and give me this crazy look but my uh my my uh hobby is distance running     uhhuh   and basically all of the races are five K ten K fifteen K nobody runs in terms of miles anymore   sure   uh and i guess thats got me thinking metrically also uh uh we have lived overseas From nineteen eighty one to eighty four we lived Quadalampor Malaysia   uhhuh   and for in eighty five six and seven we lived in Baggio City in the Philippines   uhhuh   and i guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked metrically   exactly   and ultimately at some point you know it doesnt happen overnight but at some point your frame of reference is metric at least in terms of distances   right right i uh lived in Brazil for four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so im more than uh familiar with the metric system   okay   and uh but i think that initial period you know from way made it familiar for me so i wasnt afraid of the metric system and and and i knew how much it made sense and how much easier it was to do things that way so i i its too bad that more Americans cant dont have the opportunity to to really use it to to get to a point where it its something other than something that causes them fear and confusion because if you just the initial in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing   oh yes yes   and its getting over that hurdle that will   yeah   finally get us into it if we ever get into it   yeah i i i dont think its going to happen in in in our lifetime at least not in mine uh i think uh theres a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English   right   uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school   right     and uh hang on a sec Brian i got to get rid of that caller   okay     are you there   yep   okay i think the uh uh the solution is to start it at the earliest uh stages of schooling and uh uh make that the system to which kindergartners and first graders are introduced   right   uh the drawback to that is i dont think we have any teachers in our other than physics teachers in our school system that are comfortable with it   right  right that may be true also i dont know chemists seem to     and chemists thats what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and you know we dont talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters   it okay no i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calculations i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those   oh yeah i i i dont think we could even think English and im just thinking now in our business you know we make we make chips and uh we assemble them though   uhhuh   and its interesting we are uh uh basically talking well we talk about a package size yeah we talk about it in terms of uh uh six hundred mils or six tenths of an inch i guess we do that but on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes uh to move a die out of a package in other words how much uh uh how how well do we have the die uh inhering to the to the base   uhhuh   and we talk about that in terms of kilograms       so we use it a lot we talk about uh gold ball bonds bond strength we talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the uh push the ball off its substrate so we we tend to have a mixed bag in new concepts uh that have come along with the electronic age i think just sort of get introduced metrically so thats the way we do it   right its interesting in the in though the work im doing im uh   uh   uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually um places where theyre producing a product and what ive noticed is that the places where theyre kind of doing fuzzy thinking and uh doing the initial uh development of an idea use the metric system and they talk in terms of metric uh uh units in turn around the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing a product do most of their carry conduct most of their discussion in terms of the English units which i i find   uhhuh   its interesting that its like the guys that are still doing the work that are actually making the stuff are using the English system but the ones that come up with the theyre doing these theoretical analysis and the number crunching um are doing it in terms of the metric system i i it kind of seems strange but   right you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts   and Sao Paulo   oh Sao Paulo our our plant there is in Cantinas   uhhuh   and im there several times a year   no kidding uh   and uh of course we fly into Sao Paulo and and drive on to uh uh Cantinas   and do you fly into Camgonias or the other one down there down so uth   uh i use the other one   yeah okay the international airport   i cant think the name of it yeah the international airport because i i generally fly in from uh well the last two times ive come in from Mexico City via Menaus   yeah uhhuh   and uh before that though its uh its uh Miami uh Rio De Janeiro Sao Paulo uh type flight   sure sure   and uh i just love it there i i absolutely uh uh uh love the i look forward to the times i go down there where did you get your from where did you get your physics degree   uh the Air Force Academy uh im one of those   oh okay okay yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military   yeah no no im im still in the im still a second lieutenant i just graduated in eighty nine   oh okay oh okay okay youre youre you youre a bit younger than i thought uh back to the the metric system     uhhuh   ive got a uh an automobile an eighty six Buick Skylark thats got an odometer thats a digital odometer in both units in other words i can push a button and its in metric and i can push a button and its in English   uhhuh uhhuh   and i i keep it in the metric uh all the all the time and we were taking another couple to a ball game last summer   uhhuh   and it was uh floating up there around a a a hundred a hundred which is about is about sixty two miles an hour and it was floating up there about a hundred and the wife of the couple looked at me she said my God slow down i didnt realize you were going this fast   right     and so we we you know we have a hard time getting people getting uh uh getting them to think metrically but   right   its going to be a big psychological barrier and i dont think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them   right   because if we if we keep doing that its its not going to work   oh yeah   but but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money   oh yeah   you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically   right well the whole   but why twelve inches make a feet a foot and three feet make a yard  i  you know   yeah i dont or the whole number system is digital so how can you have uh or its its base ten rather and so how can you have   yeah   how can you have these uh strange i i
