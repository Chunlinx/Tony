                                 Geraldine Ferraro            New Yorkers wont wait formuch but they apparently will wait for Geraldine Ferraro For the last months the exvicepresidential candidate has been mulling over the idea ofquitting her Crossfire job to run for office Shes about to make herdecision Ferraro will announce in the next two weeks whether shes enteringNew Yorks  Democratic senatorial primaryalso known as the race to decidewho gets to mud wrestle Sen Alfonse DAmato Ferraros Godot act hasovershadowed the campaigns of the two declared primary contenders Rep CharlesSchumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark Green New York political bossesand big donors are biding their time waiting for her announcement Thefundraising group EMILYs List which could steer  million to its chosencandidate has encouraged members to withhold contributions till Ferraro makesher decision            Thelatest Quinnipiac College Poll a respected independent survey shows Ferraromassacring Schumer and Green in the primary and routing DAmato by  points inthe general election This enthusiasm is a little mystifying After all theyearold has served a grand total of six years in public office all in theHouse of Representatives has not won an election since  was brutalizedin her last two campaigns  vicepresidential and  senatorial and hasbeen tangled in more ethics scandals than any politician except well AlDAmato A little ethnic arithmetic explains some of the Ferraro excitementShes Italian Schumer and Green are Jewish DAmato beats any Jew and heloses to any Italian says a longtime New York political operative            But Ferraro owes her popularity to something else theFerraro Aura try saying that three times quickly To this day Ferraro isdefined by  by the four months  years ago when she was the most famouswoman in the world Democrats especially middleaged women remember her atthe Democratic National Convention remember her white dress remember herintroduction which brought the house down My name is Geraldine Ferraro TheMondaleFerraro campaign degenerated into a wretched embarrassing spectaclebut Ferraro proved that a woman could be just as goodand just as badavicepresidential candidate as any man Ferraro Maureen Dowd wrote came toembody the Cinderella myth the American dream and the feminine mystiquerolled into one Her admirers stopped seeing her as a politician She became anicon an unreal idealized symbol of womens achievement            But thisimage distorts Ferraro As an individual rather than a symbol sheswonderfully engagingcharming tough smart funny thoughtful But she isalso very much a politician selfaggrandizing ambitious and acutelysensitive to political wind shifts Few New Yorkers let alone few Americansremember her six years in Congress and with good reason She was aporkbarreler and a moreorless willing cog in the Queens Democratic machineHer path to Washington was cleared by the fact that her cousin NicholasFerraro was the Queens district attorney and a political player Ferraro hadenough principles to stand on not enough to get in her way Despite herlionization by feminists for example Ferraro was not terribly progressive onwomens issues She was prochoice but not emphatically so She supported theEqual Rights Amendment but then maneuvered to keep it out of the Democratic platform Her skills as an operator served her own career When shearrived in Congress in  she quickly inserted herself under the wing ofHouse Speaker Tip ONeill His sponsorship was critical to hervicepresidential nomination            Ferraro seems to favor retail politics overideology like DAmato She has never attached herself to any particular setof ideas never had any consuming passion Its notable that none of the sevenNew York Democratic operatives I talked to could describe her ideology or nameher pet causes Shes sort of moderate I think said one When I askedFerraro about her key issues her answer was boilerplate Education thestruggling economy of upstate New York DAmatos horrendous record            Even herresponses to ethics charges reflect her political instincts Confronted withallegations about campaignfinance irregularities or with questions about herhusbands business dealings Ferraro has bobbed and weaved with Clintoniandeftness Hand out a few documents hedge cavil deny admit withexplanation            All of which is to say Of course shell run Shes anaturalborn politician and she cant stay away from the race She soundsthrilled when she considers the prospect If you look at the time of my lifethat was the happiest it was the time as a prosecutor and member of Congressshe says I am  points ahead in the primary And I am the only one who beatsAl DAmato Ferraro has always wanted to take on Sen Pothole She reluctantlyskipped the  campaign because of ethics problems Scandal dogged her againin  when she lost a vicious fourway primary This year is her last chanceat Al Its either do it now or dont do it at all            Its notlikely to be an easy primary Schumer has raised  million and is a relentlesscampaigner Green has a loyal following among the liberals who vote inDemocratic primaries Ferraro says she needs to raise  million to win theprimary It will be a fratricidal exhausting race            And if she wins DAmato will be no pushoverThe bars of New York are filled with politicians who led DAmato in the polls ayear before Election Day He always polls low he has  million to spend inthe general election and he solidified his base with lots of  And DAmatowill not underestimate Ferraro whom he fears most of all his potentialopponents He has already fired a shot across her bow In October he ran TVadsbetween segments of Crossfire  no lessslamming Ferraro as aprotaxandwelfare liberal The ads mimicked Crossfire s format Onthe left its Geraldine Ferraro And on our side its Al DAmato An iconwould have ignored the attack but Ferraro harpooned right back calling the ada sign of panic When Republicans asked CNN to drop Ferraro fromCrossfire  complaining that she was using the program to advance hercandidacy Ferraro countered that its almost unbecoming to see grown menwhine            If New Yorkers are luckythis sniping is a preview of a delightful fall campaign two leatherskinnedfasttalking oldtime pols whaling the bejesus out of each other Thats thekind of politics everyone enjoys not least Geraldine Ferraro
