                                 Styles of Polygamy            One of the greatapplausegetters in Bob Doles acceptance speech at the Republican Conventionwas It does not take a village to raise a child It takes a family to raise achild Pretty nervy line coming from a man who left his first wife and theirdaughter Then again some people found it nervy when Bill Clinton at aMemphis church in  delivered his famous sermon on family values All thatstands between Clinton and bushels of illegitimate children after all iscontraceptive technology            It seemsto me we have rough parity between Clinton and Dole in the personal failingsdepartment at least as far as family values go Yet Clintons escapades aregenerally perceived as constituting a character problem whereas Dolesdivorce gets only the occasional raised eyebrow Am I confused or is Americaconfused In an attempt to settle this question impartially I will now put onmy lab coat and take up the tools of modern science We will dissect thequestion of which if either is worseClintons infidelity or Dolesdivorce            But first let me stress that although I willeventually shift into moralindignation mode I have deep sympathy for bothmen They are after all Earthlings They were created by the process ofnatural selection and thus are inherently absurddriven by impulses thatexist today only because they helped our ancestors transmit their genes            Consider the extreme thirstfor status and power found in male homo sapiens in general and Clinton and Dolein particular According to evolutionary psychologists this thirst existsbecause during evolution it led to lots of offspring Those of our maleancestors who most doggedly climbed to the top of the local status hierarchywere often rewarded with sex partnerseither multiple wives the Doleapproach or multiple lovers the Clinton approach            Hence thecruel irony facing Clinton and to a lesser extent Dole From natures pointof view a central purpose of pursuing status is to convert it into sex Yetdemonstrated success in making this conversion is now deemed a disadvantage inthe quest for the higheststatus slot in the world The very point of beingalpha male is considered evidence in modern America of unfitness for the jobTalk about defeating the purpose            How did our culture get mired in thispuritanical paradox Well consider the limited menu of options            Polygamy  This is the natural state of our species Then again thenatural state of our species is also a small huntergatherer society withlittle wealth and thus only mild inequalities of status and power among menIn this ancestral environment large harems were rare competition for womenthough intense was seldom epically intense But then came agriculture andother sources of economic surplus Suddenly some males could be way morepowerful than others The commensurately massive sexual rewards made menillinclined to play by Marquess of Queensberry rules According to theGuinness Book of World Records  the most prolific genetic replicator inthe history of our species was the last Sharifian emperor of Morocco who had offspring He was known as Moulay Ismail the Bloodthirsty Get thepicture            And in polygamoussocieties lowstatus males werent exactly pacifists either With scads ofwomen monopolized by the welltodo less fortunate men could get mighty lonelyand become very unhappy campers This volatile discontent may be the reasonthat as anthropologist Laura Betzig has shown polygamy and authoritarianismhave gone hand in hand Back when the Zulu king was entitled to more than women coughing or spitting at his dinner table was punishable by death            In thissense monogamy meshes better than polygamy with the egalitarian values of ademocracy Onemanonevote onemanonewife Unfortunately monogamy is hardto sustain given our species naturally polygamous bent And thats especiallytrue in a place like America with great status inequality Rich or powerfulmarried men feel an extravagant sense of sexual entitlement and many womenfeel like gratifying it Hence option No             Serial monogamy This is what we have now Youcan acquire a second spouse so long as you discard the first one This isbasically a covert and mild form of polygamy Highstatus males get tomonopolize more than one fertile woman Thus Dole having risen from crippledwar veteran to US senator traded in his yearold first wifeas herfertility was expiringfor a yearold This isnt to say Dole waspondering his wives relative fertility            But serial monogamy has a bigdownside not shared by polygamy Lots of kids get reared either without fathersor with stepfathers who often lack the Darwinian devotion of a biologicalfatherand who may even be downright hostile As evolutionary psychologistsMartin Daly and Margo Wilson showed in their book Homicide  children notreared by both biological parents are at greatly elevated risk of physicalabuse even murder Thats one piece of the larger truth at the heart of thefamilyvalues crusade Divorce and unwed motherhood are bad for kids            Truemonogamy then would seem a very worthwhile institution But if monogamy is atodds with human nature how do you keep it from metamorphosing into serialmonogamy            Monogamy Victorian style When highstatusmales leave their wives for a younger model you can stigmatize them damagingtheir social and even professional standing In  th centuryBritain this tough love helped keep the divorce rate near zero even amid thestark status inequality of a modern nation Note its ingeniousness To repressthe powerful polygamous impulse in men you employ their equally powerfulthirst for social status The irony facing Dolethat converting your statusinto multiple wives can threaten the status itselfis thus a remnant thoughgreatly diluted of our Victorian heritage            The central theme of Dolescampaign is that he embodies the Victorian values that were still robust in theAmerica of his youth He says he stands for God family honor dutycountry Well one duty back then was to stay with your family In explaininghis divorce Dole says his marriage had become unhappy But if doing your dutywas easy they wouldnt call it duty would they            Its notenough to note that Doles daughter Robin was  when he divorced and nowseems well adjusted Children of her socioeconomic class obviously stand abetterthanaverage chance of recovery But the factually correct premise ofVictorian morality was that one persons transgression if unpunished invitesemulation Thats true in spades for societys biggest role modelssenatorspresidents etc Doles divorce in some incalculable but not trivial waymakes other divorces more likelyincluding divorces with more vivid casualtiesthan his including divorces that will push women and children into poverty Toelect a divorced president is to reject a central pillar of the moral orderDole says hell rebuild            And what about reelecting a worldclassphilanderer Obviously infidelity is a lessdirect contributor to the divorcerate than divorce Indeed in some cultures permissible infidelity is pairedwith stigmatized divorce as part of the familyvalues formula highstatusmales get a mistress as compensation for sticking with their aging wives Andeven in Victorian Englandand in the America of Doles youtha mansinfidelity was forgiven more readily than his desertion            But this doesnt add up to analibi for Clinton Clintons infidelity like Doles divorce has consequencesthat arent merely local The man is role model in chief So its not an excusethat he didnt get Gennifer Flowers pregnant Sometimes casual sex doesget single women pregnant And unwed motherhood is as big a part of thefamilyvalues problem as divorce Clintons defenders sometimes cite thetrysts of other presidentsKennedy FDR even Ike in his WW II days Wellthose men lived back when it was possible to keep such things a secret Whichmade them less culpable under the perfectly logical hypocrisy of Victorianstandards            In the end I would say thereis indeed rough moral parity between Clinton and Dole on the familyvaluesfront Dole is marginally more vulnerable because his moralizing is moredetailed and thus its irony is more glaring If I could by magic restore toevery child who lacks a father or a mother that father or that mother Iwould he said at the San Diego convention How about starting with yourdaughter Democrats historically have been more guarded in their familyvaluesrhetoric This probably represents a failure of vision but it may partlyrepresent a certain clarity of vision as well Its harder to be smug if youreaware of your own failings And its harder to yearn so unreservedly for thegolden age of Victorian America if you realize that morality is like economicsTheres no free lunch
