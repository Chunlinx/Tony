        that proposal     well actually ive i you know it kind of caught me by surprise i havent ever really thought about       uh you know mandatory public service i obviously believe in public service and you know think its a good idea i i i im not sure if they would get   umhum   the service they anticipate if they force it do you understand what im saying i mean you know youre gonna get a lot more commitment a lot more desire a lot more uh   thats a good yeah good point   maybe quality time effort energy from somebody who really truly wants to be there so although i believe in it im not sure requiring it would be the way to go   umhum you know what ive noticed at least in our in my field that that works is to require before a person can enter the school program that they do a number of volunteer hours in that field or in in an environment thats related to that field and   umhum   that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them   thats true if there were enough opportunities   i suppose uh that would really require a lot of participation on the part of employers to require a certain number of community uh community service hours in their area  thats   well that or have something available in that field you know and and when you go to employers then is it really a public service   um   thing or more of an internship you know i dont know   uhhuh uhhuh i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that thats difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to to manage but it would certainly i think contribute to a persons responsibility and and sense of maturity um to recognize what other cultures and other countries go through in terms of their day to day existence if youre working in Peace Corps for example youre really gonna be able to learn those things   i i definitely agree and i i had you know some family that did serve in the Peace Corps and i i always thought it was a wonderful thing um i i do think that if people have the opportunity to do it its something that you know they wont forget it enriches your life and gives you like you said a a good understanding of   uhhuh   oh well what do i wanna say we take so much we we take what we have for granted you know were very blessed in this country and and we take so much for granted because we really dont realize uh   yeah we really umhum     how other cultures and other other countries live so i i definitely agree that its its good i just you know it i i   umhum umhum     to to require it i think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you wanna get the type of service you know that youre anticipating that youre hoping for     yes its a little challenging today too to think about being in another country where theres uh potentially political or  military problems that are gonna effect Peace Corps workers if a person is volunteering   yeah   its one thing because they recognize theres a minimal danger where where they might be but if youre expecting that they have to do it then you you you perhaps the whoever the whoever the organization is requiring it does assume some responsibility too   thats true thats true and then i guess i can look around you know i i automatically when the uh switchboard suggested Peace Corps i kind of like you i thought international or going out of the country and i i look around though and theres an awful lot of public service that could be done within our own communities and our own   umhum   you know a lot of times people say i dont wanna go somewhere else i wanna help my own community you know United United Way i want my dollars to work here something like that so that might also be a motivating factor then   yes umhum umhum i i think its terrific to have criminals involved in community services and i really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are just um um paying if you wanna call it that for minor offenses having them do something in the in the community   minor offenses yeah i agree i think thats a very good idea what you said the field youre in what field are you in does it apply   i im an occupational therapist and so its hospital work that um i know this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy theres so many people who are applying to the schools right now        that they require that you do X number of volunteer hours i think its a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist   okay so you have to do it in that field actually like if you like you   i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if thats the the area youre pursuing im sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very good idea of what it is to be an OT or a PT and having been a volunteer theyll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this experience   yes thats true well and it might also make them realize jeez this isnt what i thought it was i dont wanna do this thats a good idea   exactly exactly which which is which is definitely the case in
