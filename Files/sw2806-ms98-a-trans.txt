                all right uh you have uh pets i understand a couple of them what are they   i i well i have uh these well i dont know if they consider themselves animals anymore they actually you know sort of take over the place and and were kind of their pets     pets get like that dont they they think they own you   they dont they really they own the place and naturally these are cats so     okay these are cats i remember one time uh i used to get a chuckle out of out of Pogo that dates me quite a bit you probably dont know Pogo   oh Pogo sure   yeah he when Beauregard was talking he was the dog remember and he used to say pets can be most as much trouble as kids   uhhuh   as kids if they work at it a little bit may and even more when they work at it a little bit  and i think thats true actually   i agree i dont know i i i think that um my husband and i are in such a situation that uh um im kind of um not able to do a lot im im kind of in a wheelchair and i mean i kind of am but um   oh uhhuh   yeah ive got these two cats that hang around with me all day and i dont what id do without them   they just good company huh thats neat   it is and   you know its funny how pets get to be so they really you you really do mourn them after when things happen now we dont actually have a pet right now   the okay   but uh but we have had some and and i cant its its always hard for me to believe how close ive gotten to them we had a little uh um oh dog it was a little uh i got it so it wouldnt wouldnt shed one of French poodle a little French poodle   oh my oh really   yeah and uh he used to i used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him you know and id let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping and he would just dance around the floor and i just got       and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car but i cannot believe the whole family just   oh oh   he just got in to to us so quickly i could not believe it   that yeah thats   i i have to tell you about our most interesting pet though   okay   uh we had an iguana living with us for about uh oh about two years   oh by choice   two and a half years i guess it was about uh oh three feet long about three feet long it was a beautiful animal name was Clyde     Clyde the Iguana   Clyde the Iguana and uh my son Dan went to uh       to uh Hawaii for the summer and when he came home uh he didnt bring the iguana with him but for some reason or other he had a thing for them i dont know whether hed i think there was one in the school uh zoology department you know   uhhuh   or biology department one or the other anyway uh and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in i guess in Texas in Mexico i dont know where but anyway he brought this home and i looked at him and i said youve got to be kidding im not going to live with a lizard  but you know i visualize that animal racing about         and you know like you think of lizards doing but they dont do that theyre very much like uh well the thing about them is that they hold so still you dont notice that theyre there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes   did you have him in a cage   no he had full run of the house  he just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the hair the heat came up out of the dryer you know it was he was really a neat pet and though i   oh no oh no oh no uhhuh   you know hed ride when wed have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning hed walk across my feet sometimes  and it it was a long time before i could really pet him and   oh   but i fed him and he he knew how to get me to feed him hed come out to the kitchen just kind of look at me till i went and got him something out of the refrigerator   uh oh no i mean you dont argue with an iguana do you   but he was really a neat animal he hed lay in Dans lap you know and just uh when hed pet him hed just stretch and you know you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does   oh no   it was kind of interesting but he did a lot of interesting things and uh Dan carried him around and he liked to ride on the back of his up on his head you know with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldnt fall off and and scare everybody to death and     oh my goodness goodness   kids loved him kids just loved him kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him and and he tolerated them you know hed even tolerate him petting though he didnt like them too well at first but he he got tame you know so that uh people could go in there and Dan was a drummer   uhhuh   and he didnt he the only thing he didnt like very well was the drumming when Dan would drum hed sit there and scrunch up you know like he was trying to hi protect himself and then hed leave the room   was the drumming and cover his ears isnt that funny the way we put you know um human characteristics on an animal like that and and   oh yeah they really are theyre interesting well they take on human characteristics like   as a its i guess they do   uh our other animal the next year our our son Ken went to Hawaii and well while Dan was in Hawaii Ken decided he wanted a dog and he and he looked around a long while and he found a Norwegian elkhound   oh   and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound and home and he was so funny uh for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know hed been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didnt like this run because there were no people that came by and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him and one night wed forgotten to put water out for him and and Hal and i were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and and hed pick up his dish and throw it in the air   huh he used a classic illusion     and then bark and march around you know and then hed pick up his dish again and throw it in the air  until we came out and gave him some water   oh       i forgot to ask you did the iguana catch flies for you   did what   did the iguana catch flies for you   no he didnt eat flies no they eat uh they greens uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know id get lettuce at the store and hed eat the outside leaves   he didnt eat flies oh oh   and then in the summertime you could put him out and hed eat outside oh except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up you know   yeah i bet   it was really  it was really a glamor and of things that were fresh sprigs you know he liked that   well can we ask you whatever happened to Clyde   but well yeah when uh when Dan went to college up at Ricksun Idaho he took him with him   oh   and uh everybody was used to him and they just loved him and what not and this his roommate put him out one day and Dan didnt know it and it got dark and he didnt get him in again and they searched and searched and searched for him but uh   oh   uh it got too cold up there and he he died in a tree that they found him the next day in a tree he was dead   oh my   so you cant you have to be pretty tender with them we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know that was another funny thing he had a hot pad and it it burned up one time and boy it was that was funny too watching him kind of burned up but anyway       and we got him a new one he had a blue one before and when we got him a new one it was brown and he wouldnt lay on it till we changed the covers   oh really   no he wouldnt lay on it   because that was like what he was used to   but so they really are they really pick up things he was he was a clean animal uh we had he went to the bathroom in the bathroom   how did he do that   put well we put some papers on the floor underneath the john and he went there to go to the bathroom   okay   you had to be sure you left the doors open you know he didnt like to go anywhere else hed hed scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something you know but     oh no   but even when he went when he had an accident or something uh if you just let it dry it dries kind of like uh especially when he was inside and eating just lettuce it dried up a little bit like ashes and you could just vacuum it up   oh my goodness   in the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know   oh yeah   but uh   but that thats incredible its a different little things to   yeah hes a he was a really interesting animal   oh thats   i i just uh we just really and you know to this day i still miss him and thats been years ago   well see i guess its because you lived with you know him an and overcame some fears to get used to him and   yeah he was just yeah yeah i think i guess so but it it it was interesting well   yeah definitely   what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them   oh my goodness these guys they well actually theyre my husbands pets     yeah oh and you just kind of took them over huh   well well actually its like hes the cat person you know and i have i was always kind of nondescript in that category because i always liked dogs   umhum uhhuh   and theyve kind of taken over and and uh you know they   a little bit easier to have cats in this kind of country though isnt it uh   maybe it is i theyre so independent well im glad we have two of them otherwise i think they get neurotic if there just one of them   well i think yeah that could be could be   they get real crazy but there brother brother and sister from the same litter they look totally different they are they well they are Siamese cats but one is   oh pretty ones   one is uh um theyre both registered you know ones a seal point shes the little girl and then uh Newhart Newhart is the uh the   Newhart   the he is something hes like a dog he really he just flops for you he just wants his belly scratched and thats it you know   yeah     and hes just the warmest thing in the wintertime he just sits on your lap sits on your lap but theyre like seven years   yeah
