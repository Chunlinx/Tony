                                 Tysons Choice            Who in their right mindwould bite off a chunk of another persons ear Vincent van Gogh is famous forslicing off his own But van Gogh was not in his right mind He suffered frommanicdepressive illness Its likely from past revelations that Mike Tysonmay be similarly afflicted This creates an interesting moral dilemma forTyson boxing officials and the public            Aconnection between mania and artistic achievement has been known since ancienttimes Psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison in Touched With FireManicDepressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament  maintains that maniais an essential driving force for many artists The fiery aspects of thoughtand feeling that initially compel the artistic voyagefierce energy highmood and quick intelligence a sense of the visionary and the grand arestless and feverish temperamentcommonly carry with them the capacity forvastly darker moods grimmer energies and occasionally bouts of madness Ernest Hemingway Virginia Woolf and Mark Rothko all suffered from manicdepression The disease fueled their artistic achievements even as it led totheir suicides            There may well be a similar relationship for similarreasons between manic depression and sporting achievement Golfer Bert Yanceywas the only wellknown athlete to publicly acknowledge this affliction ButNew York Mets pitcher Pete Harnisch made headlines this year when he becamedisabled because of unspecified depression And Dr Richard Wyatt apsychiatrist who has worked with athletes says there are many other cases            In  Tyson told an ABCtelevision audience that he had had a psychiatric illness all his life thathed discussed manic depression with his psychiatrist and that this illnesscaused him to do things he would normally never do Tysons former wifeactress Robin Givens said pointblank in the same joint interview Mike is amanicdepressive            Tysonswellpublicized actions over the years are consistent with a manicdepressiveillness Tyson confessed to David Remnick of The New Yorker  Theres nodoubt about it Im a wild man According to Remnick Tysons former trainerTeddy Atlas says Tysons like a double feature now like youre gettingHeidi and Godzilla at the same time            Manic depression is not rooted in a Freudianchildhood trauma Its a genetically determined chronic and incurable diseasethat affects about  percent of the adult populationstriking people hardestin their s The symptoms often can be contained by medication Withoutmedication people suffering from manic depression face poor outcomes Somestudies report that  percent of untreated sufferers commit suicide makinguntreated manic depression as lethal as many forms of cancer and heart diseaseThe disease also worsens over time with both mania and depression becomingmore pronounced and less responsive to medication Victims are especially proneto drug and alcohol abuse with all the attendant complications            Would itmake a difference if Tyson were not just a chump who chomped on the ear of achamp but were suffering from an often fatal disease that can be effectivelytreated It would            Tyson faces a Hobsons choice he could seek treatment thatcould diminish his boxing skills or avoid treatment and become sickerTreatment requires daily doses of lithium or other moodstabilizing drugsThe effect on his athletic performance might be severe The medicationbydesigndiminishes many of the qualities that helped Tyson to reach the top ofhis game including feelings of increased energy invulnerability elationexhilaration inflated selfesteem hostility and violence Tyson acknowledgedthe risk in  when he said Im not taking any medicine because I feelmedicines going to change me            For some patients lithiumalso has undesirable side effects Wyatt found that some athletes experiencedtremors and reacted more slowly physically and mentally while others improvedtheir performance under drug maintenance Going off lithium to prepare for about is not a way out of this dilemma since in many cases lithium is not aseffective the second time around            Allathletes are required to pass physicals to ensure that they do not placethemselves or other participants at risk A boxer cannot fight with a heartcondition or dementia So why should a boxer with manicdepressive illnessanda history of egregious conduct consistent with the diseasebe licensed tofight without medical clearance            Then theres the publics infatuation withtrain wrecks We anticipate accidents at stock car races We go to the fightsand a hockey game breaks out We egg on Dennis Rodman watching him parade likea peacock and break down in tears on national TV We goad baseball playerAlbert Belle so much that AllStargame manager Joe Torre must confine him tothe dugout NBA forward Dennis Scott makes headlines for uncharacteristicrants The press and public love it Meanwhile the adulation feeds a sense ofinvincibilityespecially if the athlete already happens to suffer from manicdepression After a crash the crowds silence feeds an athletes paranoiadepression and despair            Tysons choice is whether tosave his life or save his career The choice for others is whether to force himto make the right choice or to continue deriving profit and entertainment fromhis illness
