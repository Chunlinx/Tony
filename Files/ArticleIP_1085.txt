                                 Bill Clinton vs Clarence Thomas            WhenAnita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in  rightwingersdismissed her as a liar and an erotomaniac Now the same rightwingers haveembraced Paula Jones sexualharassment case against Bill Clinton MeanwhileHills feminist supporters who once claimed that women dont make thesethings up have rallied to the presidents defense or are silent about theaccusations involving Jones Monica Lewinsky and others Each side accuses theother of hypocrisy What are the similarities and the differences between thetwo cases             The evidence Similar evidence supports Jones andHills accusations Their credibility depends on corroboration by people whoclaim they were told of the harassment soon after it occurred Six affidavitssay that Paula Jones spoke of her encounter with Bill Clinton on the same dayit allegedly happened Four witnesses testified under oath that Hill told themabout Thomas harassment during the period it allegedly occurred Possiblybecause Hills corroborators didnt testify until eight years after she hadstopped working for Thomas their statements contain more contradictions thanthose made by Jones corroborators Evidence supporting the contention thatClinton groped Kathleen Willeyhis other alleged victim of harassmentis muchshakier A friend of Willeys disputes key facts about the claim and Willeyhas yet to make her case publicly                            Ulterior motives Critics argue that Hill and Joneshave allied with opportunistic ideological zealots And they are right Hilltestified only after liberal Senate aides had tracked her down and leaked herstory feminist groups such as the Womens Legal Defense Fund advised herProfessional Arkansas Clintonhater Cliff Jackson coaxed Jones into filingsuit Robert Bork has coached Jones lawyers and the religious rightsRutherford Institute now helps fund her case While rightwing and leftwinggroups have helped trumpet the two womens causes nobody has shownconvincingly that either side trumped up the accusations                            Lingering doubts Fundamental logical flaws in thestories of both Hill and Jones continue to create doubts If Thomas was such anintolerable boss why did Hill leave a secure job to follow him from theDepartment of Education to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Why didshe continue to telephone him after she no longer worked for him If Jones isinterested only in clearing her name why did she decide to make such a publiccase against the president                            What the men allegedly did The behavior at issueis very different in the two cases Which is worse Are Clintons alleged shortepisodes of physical assault more reprehensible than Thomas allegedtwoandahalfyear verbal assault Thomas may have talked about porn filmsasked Hill out on patently unwelcome dates bragged about his sexual prowessand referred to pubic hairs on Coke cans but Hill says that Thomas neverflashed his genitals touched her sexually or propositioned herexplicitly                            Just say no Some Clinton defenders note that healways flags his lascivious intentions before expressing them He flirted withWilley over the phone before putting the moves on her When State Trooper DannyFerguson invited Jones to Clintons hotel room he told her The governor saysyou make his knees knock Once Clinton realized these women wanted none ofhim he backed off He purportedly told Jones Well I dont want to make youdo anything that you dont want to do By contrast Thomas failed to pick upon Hills lack of interest her repeated assertions that she didnt want todate Thomas and her obvious discomfort with his wild talk Hills criticssay she should have emphatically told Thomas to stop                            The Jordan connection One unnoted similarity betweenthe two cases is the role of Vernon Jordan Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson reportin their book Strange Justice The Selling of Clarence Thomas  thatClinton buddy Jordan spent a day prepping Thomas for his confirmationhearings                            Did Thomas and Clinton violate thelaw If the law is the one against sexual harassment the answer in bothcases is Probably not            Accordingto the Supreme Courts interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ofthe basis for most harassment casesharassment is actionable when it issufficiently severe and pervasive to  create an abusive workingenvironment Because Jones failed to file her suit before Title VIIs daystatute of limitations her lawyers have used an obscure ReconstructioneraantiKu Klux Klan law to make her case Assuming she did qualify for Title VIIher legal case is still weak a There is no evidence that Jones suffered anyretaliation for refusing Clinton She received regular pay increases andpromotions after the alleged incident b Courts rarely consider a onetimeinstance of harassment severe and pervasive c Title VII doesnt prohibitpropositioning colleagues or exposing ones genitals to them            Willey might have a better case against Clintonif she wants to make itand if her story is true She was visiting the WhiteHouse in search of a job when he allegedly pawed her            Even if completely true theMonica Lewinsky tale is one of consensual sex not harassment The relationshipit describes may strike many as exploitative or ugly for other reasons but itis not illegal            Hillnever claimed that her unpleasant encounters with Thomas constituted actionablesexual harassment She would have had difficulty proving in court that Thomashad created an abusive working environment because she never complainedabout his harassment and maintained her friendship with him even after she leftthe EEOC                            Volume discount There is only one public accusationagainst Thomas Other women though were prepared to testify against him anddidnt get the chance There are at least three public accusations againstClinton                            Addiction Following the Lewinsky scandal much hasbeen made of Clintons alleged sexaholism his pathological inability tocontrol his sexual appetites Thomas is accused of having a problem keeping hishands off pornography According to Mayer and Abramson his viewing pleasuresincluded films such as The Adventures of Bad Mama Jama  about theinterracial sexcapades of an obese black woman They also say he papered thewalls of his apartment with nude centerfolds and meticulously maintained aPlayboy collection Rightwing investigative journalist David Brockargues that many of Mayer and Abramsons sources for these allegations haverecantedclaim they were misquoted                            Lying Defenders of both men haveargued that even if true the behavior they stand accused of is harmlessThomas defenders especially have said that making such a big deal over a fewcrass remarks reflects the excesses of political correctness But neither manhas attempted to defend the behavior he is accused of Rather both insist itnever happened Thomas specifically and emotionally declared that Hills taleif true was repugnant and would disqualify him to sit on the SupremeCourt            Thomasproponents contrast his categorical denials of Hills allegations withClintons evasive legalistic denials Even if Clinton had done Jones no wrongthey say his dissembling bespeaks a character unfit for his job Thomascritics say he cynically played the race card by accusing his opponents ofconspiring to bring down an uppity black man Even if he had done Hill nowrong they say his response bespeaks a character unfit for his job                            Coverup If the allegations are true both men liedunder oath about thema criminal offense Clinton also is accused of suborningperjury On the Linda Tripp tapes Lewinsky allegedly says Clinton coached herto deny a relationship The Los Angeles Times has reported that Clintonasked Ferguson not to testify about the encounter with Jones No one hasaccused Thomas of trying to silence Hill As the case arose he had neitherthe time nor the opportunity                            Special circumstances Thomas alleged harassment isdeemed especially damning because it occurred while he headed the EEOC and wassimultaneously approving regulations for workplace harassment Clintonscritics say he should be reprimanded as a CEO or university president facingsimilar accusations wouldby being removed from his job                            Ideological crossdressing Both conservatives andfeminists seek to explain away their JonesHill flipflop Feminists say thatHill came forward at a time when nobody believed victims of sexual harassmentBecause they advocated Hills cause they say victims of harassment now havemore credibility Case in point Jones has no shortage of supporters and needsno feminist help Other feminists such as Susan Estrich concede that theirattacks on Thomas were indeed politically motivated Conservatives explain thetableturning by continuing to attack Hills credibility and accusing thefeminists of class bias against the bighaired Jones                            Timing The accusations againstThomas came when he was up for a job Senators were about to vote on hisfitness for a lifetime appointment to the nations highest courtand theywould have had to vote even if Hill had not come forward with her taleClinton by contrast is in a job He is in his second term as president andcan be removed only by impeachment Some Clinton defenders argue that thevoters knew about the presidents alleged proclivities if they didnt know thedetails of any particular case and implicitly accepted them when they electedhim twice            Others argue that apresidential impeachment would be far more disruptive and costly to the nationthan a Senate committees rejection of a Supreme Court nominee they say itisnt worth it This isnt exactly a defense of Clintons alleged behavior butit has the same practical effect
