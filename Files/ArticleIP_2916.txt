                                 Game Theory            I dont have any statisticshandy for purposes of comparison but if this isnt the largest retrospectiveexhibition ever mounted it is certainly the biggest Ive ever seen The uptownGuggenheim is almost entirely filled by the first part with only one of thefive or six side galleries devoted to items from the permanent collection Part takes up two floors at the SoHo annex and the adjunct at the Ace Gallerywhile a single work consists of  parts and measures roughly  feet inlength If the task of viewing all this isnt a sufficient workout there arealso two concurrent Rauschenberg gallery shows a series of frescoes and anexhibit of photographs at the Pace Wildenstein MacGill complex on th Street            Rauschenberg is an amazinglyprolific and formally venturesome artist who over the past  years hasnearly always risked aesthetic trespass producing work deliberately just onedegree or two from being merely ugly banal kitschy gimmicky showy facileor of course excessive Those possibilities were what he was pitting himselfagainst while his contemporaries in the s for example were battling thepicture plane When he has won he has won spectacularly He hasnt howeveralways won He did have an astonishing  years or so though At least thefirst threequarters of the Frank Lloyd Wright spiral and its sidewaysannexestraveling updisplay one dazzling triumph of eye over reflex afteranother some of them iconic by now others seldom shown and vitally fresh            Although some very good workpredates it you might say that the show symbolically begins with his Erasedde Kooning                Drawing of  Click on each thumbnail to see anenlargement It is exactly that a few smudged traces of pencil on anelaborately matted and framed piece of paper This work has always been citedas a classic killingthefather act or a declaration of independence from thedogma of Abstract Expressionism It is both those things but it is also adeclaration of independence from drawing He did a bit of it early on but soonrealized that he had two stronger suits junk assemblage and photography            He is a virtuoso of both Hemight actually be considered a great neglected photographer although thisneglect is only a consequence of the fame of his combine paintings and printscombine paintings is Rauschenbergs own term for works that include both oiland objects on canvas The photographs in the museum show are primarily toughdirect foundobject stilllifes clearly descended from Walker Evans andrelated to Robert Frank His interest in both depicting and displaying foundobjects also links him to Evans who toward the end of his life was takinghome and hanging up the bulletriddled stop signs he found on the road ratherthan just taking their pictures Rauschenberg however was compelled to altersuch objects attaching them to canvas smearing them with paint and combiningthem with all manner of other substances The wall captions in this show aremuch more entertaining than those things usually are viz Odalisk a combine that includes oil watercolor pencil crayon paperfabric photographs printed reproductions miniature blueprint metalnewspaper glass dried grass and steel wool with pillow wood post electriclights and Plymouth Rock rooster on wood structure mounted on fourcasters            You can imagine the funRauschenberg must have had finding random detritus on the streets dragging itup to the loft and then figuring out the most perversely elegant ways to putit together There are a few studio pictures in the vast catalog but noneunfortunately shows the rats nest of tennis balls old newspapers stuffedbirds cheesy bedspreads and construction debris that must have filled theplace in the s Lately a great deal has been made of Rauschenbergsdiscretion regarding his sex life with critics zeroing in on Bed a combine that includes a paint and pencilenhanced pillow quilt andsheet as well as Canyon  which features among other things amirror a pillow in a noose and a stuffed bald eagle in full wingspread Thoseworks are presumably meant to be Realist and Symbolist respectively allusionsto his homosexual identity and Rauschenberg is chided for not publiclyaffirming the same And such allusions they may well be although you do wonderhow those critics would then interpret the iconic Monogram with its stuffed angora goat wearing a car tire around its midriff            The quest for meaning aprofessors game looks pretty pale amid the panache and humor ofRauschenbergs assemblages and combines They involve Dada nosethumbingExpressionist brio an American appreciation of pure funk a flneur seye for chance and juxtaposition in the streets a sensualists feeling for themost outr kinds of texture and a scopophiliacs unquenchable thirst forimages all kinds right now from industrial logos to comic strips to postagestamps to Velzquezs Rokeby Venus  He also incidentally has quite anear capable of doing more with a oneword title Rebus Currency  Interview  Barge  Express than mostwriters Meaning has actually tended to be a pitfall for him as is shown byhis topical posters only one of which is displayed here a dully literal itemfor Earth Day             The lower level of theGuggenheim SoHo displays the tinkering side of Rauschenbergs nature the workshe made in collaboration with engineersthe star item there is unquestionablyMud Muse  a vat of bentonite an artificial clay that bubblesand gurgles and spits like a pool of quicksand in a Tarzan movie triggered bya soundactivated compressedair system This kind of stuff is engaging andoccasionally more than that Upstairs and on the very highest tiers of theuptown branch is where the trouble starts Over the last  years or soRauschenberg has repeated himself a lot This may be par for the course ofmost artistic careers the distinction here is that he has repeated himself inever more exalted and expensive media reflective metals Japanese ceramicsfresco which just gild the funk sapping its life When employing hishabitual paper and canvas and burlap bags he has tended to go for discordantlysmooth finishes The Ace Gallery installation a work in progress that willeventually reach a quarter mile in length is a recapitulation of themes thatwinds up being reductive in its very gigantism Meanwhile the best of thelater work is the very simplest made from discarded gasstation signs Maybehe should just limit himself to materials that cost no more than five bucks apound
