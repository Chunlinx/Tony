                                 Guess Whos Coming to Dinner                                             DearPrudence                                                      About a month ago my father informed usbyemailthat he was planning to divorce my mother and had contacted a lawyerNow he tells us hes coming home for Christmas At the same time my motherinvited a friend of hers for Christmas dinner because the woman recentlydiscovered her husbands yearlong affair and has no one to share the holidaywith                                       The problem is my mother hasnt told her friendabout my father wanting a divorce Although we all plan to be civilized aboutit if my father makes some offhand comment about the situation it will beawkward to say the least My sister and I feel our mother should discreetlytell her friend whats going on but my mother is very proud and prefers topretend that everything is fine especially since shes the one who encouragedher friend to dump her husband Moms afraid that her friend will encourage herto go along with the divorcewhich she doesnt want to do Should my sisterand I quietly tell Moms friend whats up Or should we ask our dad to stayaway from the topic of the divorce during dinner We dont know what to do thatwont make the problem worse Christmas dinner is shaping up to be a nightmareHelp                                       Can it get any moreawkward than this                        Dear Can            Probably  but youhave a day or two to make your moves Since the woman guest is your mothersfriend and your mother wishes to keep her marital situation under wrapsstrangely Prudie thinks you should not be the one to spill the beans Andsince your father wants to come to Christmas dinner strangely Prudie thinksthe mechanistic thing to do to salvage the night is to quietly tell your dadthat your mom hasnt broken the news to her friend  so could he pleasepretend things are normal Take heart that yours will be just one ofcountless such dinners around the country where the family dynamics are shallwe say unusual            Prudie delicately                                             Prudence                                                      As a young womanwith serious curves on a trim frame I myself have had to deal with the issueof my gazongas and my pretty face in a professional manner I wear nonpushupbras with thin padding often marketed as Tshirt bras and I only weartightfitting sweaters if they are black longsleeved and matte Tailoredshirts work well too I find that having Katharine Hepburn as my style iconfor work clothes is an ideal solution even though Ive got a Marilyn Monroebody The difficult part for who wrote will be requesting in a tactfulfashion that his girlfriend dress modestly I recommend the Katharine Hepburnmetaphor as a gentle and flattering way to make this request                                       Best wishes                                       EC                        Dear E            You are nice to weigh inas a Prudie The young man will probably have to be a little more explicit thanjust mentioning the Great Kates name however because her style of dressingis most associated with slax and turtlenecks Also the wonderful Ms Hepburnwas never known for remarkable gazongas Prudie guesses its the Hepburn aurayoure going for since unlike you there was no Marilyn Monroe bodyunderneath all those tailored clothes Just as an aside Prudie cannot quiteunderstand your wearing the Tshirt bra with its thin padding Wouldntpaddingeven thinbe gilding the lilies            Prudie titularly                                             Prudence                                                      Three little addenda to your advice to JuniorExec                                        If he wishes to continue to advance hiscareer he might want to refer to his wellendowed partner as a woman not agirl If however she is under  then he has a completely differentproblem                                        He might want to establish the differencebetween plain and major pair of hooters The opposite of plain isactually beautiful and the opposite of major hooters is flat as apancake                                        What exactly isthe problem he wants advice for Is he actually suggesting that having abazoomba fetish might hamper his career Wake up and smell the coffee JuniorThis is America                                       Nitpicker Emmaus PA                        Dear Nit            Hmmm Bazoomba fetishPrudie thanks you for the new word  and for letting the young man have itwith both barrels Prudie for some reason only used one            Prudie mammiferously                                             DearPrudence                                                      Thanks for all thegreat advice Here is my problem My mom calls me every few days for a chatand she is in the habit of eating while talking on the phone She is invariablycrunching an apple or snacking on beef jerky every time I talk to her Itsdisgusting I actually try to avoid her calls so that I wont have to listen tothose noises I think this is so rude and inconsiderate of her but I dontknow what to do about it I have even tried doing it back to her but shedidnt get the hint Her grazing into the receiver is making me nuts Whatshould I do                                       SE                        Dear S            Instead of chomping on beef jerky yourself hopingthe mother of all grazers will get the hint why not opt for a more directapproach Simply say Mother you know I love you but the noise of youreating while talking on the phone distracts me from what youre saying Youmight suggest that she separate the activities of eating and phoning If youfeel she wouldnt respond well to your request then avoid her calls when youcan and when you cant hold the phone far away from your ear Of course youwont know what shes saying but life is choices my dear            Prudie has the reversesituation by the way When talking to her mother if shes in thekitchen it always seems like a good time to do whatever dishes are in the sinkThis invariably elicits from Prudies mother Are you running water Untilexplicitly asked to desist Prudie will continue This is all by way of sayingthat people do what theyre in the habit of doing unless specifically asked tocut it out            Prudie habitually                                             DearPrudence                                                      Do you know about the latest craze in parkingspots They are pregnant lady or families with children spots at malls andgrocery stores My contention is that these are no different in theory than awhites only parking spot though of course in practice racialdiscrimination beats reproductive discrimination hands down The contention ofthe pregnant member of the office staff is that Im a bastard                                       Should I take thegentlemanly way out and quit parking in the spaces reserved for the breeders orcontinue my lonesome fight                                       Sid                        Dear Sid            Prudie has not heard ofthese new preferential parking spots It would seem prudent to use theadjective named for your adviser to forgo your lonesome fight in the name ofpeace and quiet Hang on though The way reproductive developments are goingit shouldnt be too long before you can look a policeman in the eye and saySir I am entitled to this space Though I do not show yet I am due in thespring
