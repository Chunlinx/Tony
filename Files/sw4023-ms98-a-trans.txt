                so Martin how do you feel about crime in the city uh you said youre from Atlanta   right i i i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh   umhum   you know for my own safety   umhum i mean do you find do you find crime in Atlanta really bad i mean i live in Atlanta also   oh thats right um   uhhuh   uh i think it is bad in certain areas however i think uh the area that i live in its not uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that theres certain certain areas where uh the crime is focused um   umhum umhum well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city   well i think its whats been happening over the last several years it seems theyve been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility   umhum   and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i thinks the best way there is   id probably agree with that   yeah you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects   uh   uh you know thats that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and theyve got to do more than just having having cops there theyve got to kind of change the way people think about it   umhum yeah thats probably true um so do um well do you think Atlanta is as bad as most other cities   um well ive been to id say its its probably in the top top ten in terms of crime um its nowhere near as bad as New York City for example probably not not as bad as Detroit   umhum umhum i dont think its as bad as LA either   no   we i dont think we dont we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have   yeah that seems to be true um yeah if youve ever been to like New York City and   umhum   you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed its that obvious   umhum yeah i know ive ive come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where theres a lot of crime a lot of thats gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim you know   yeah thats true   you know walk with you know walk with you know with   with a big stick or   well  not silly just walk you know confidently and you know dont dont be looking around like youve never been there before and you have no idea where you are     right sure  right dont dont walk down a an alley or dont get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah there are times when you cant avoid all that um and and then youre kind of   yeah umhum umhum   on your own   yeah and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta   uh no the only thing ive ever had is ive had my wallet lifted   umhum   but that was in a more of a a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got  i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really   umhum umhum   and kind of passed it off so i didnt know who had it   umhum   ive had that happen but thats thats about it   yeah ive been pretty lucky about getting mugged i dont   oh yeah   yeah i think ive only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun   hum   and thats been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that ive seen in Atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed   really well ive had my umhum ive had my car stolen so maybe that counts   oh really   yeah   wow where was where where was that was that downtown or   oh no that was in the northern part um up near Cumberland Mall area its actually Cobb County but it is Atlanta   really umhum metropolitan yeah   and uh theres a lot of car thefts in that area   yeah ive ive actually ive known known some people that have had their cars stolen um and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to the APD seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair  up on blocks you know my friend who had a um   right yeah yeah     VW Rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat     yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didnt they didnt strip it   umhum   so i got it back   well youre probably luckier than   yeah than most   umhum um so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body   right it it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car   oh   yeah youve got to you crack the steering column then you pull the theres a pin in there that you can pull on these GM cars and you can start start it up basically pretty easily   umhum umhum so how do you know this much about um stealing cars     well after i found mine i had to i had this
