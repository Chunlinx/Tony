                                 Bombing the Ban            Everybody leads with the Senates rejection yesterday of the comprehensivenuclear test ban treaty which needed  votes but only got a nearlystraight DemocratsforRepublicansagainst party vote All the papers view thevote as more about partisanship than nuclear policy and all see it aspolitically devastating for President Clinton            The papers also see the vote as quite historical The New York Timesheadline says it evokes the Senates rejection of the Versailles Treaty whichmeant that the League of Nations went forward without US participationUSAToday says the vote was the first time in history that the Senate hasvoted down an arms control treaty But USAT is wrong about this becauseas the Washington Post points out the Versailles pact was an armscontrol accord The Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal also make the Versailles reference Butnobody quite connects the dots on what the comparison could mean for theplanet The Versailles vote is now considered to be one of the principal causesof World War II But this general level of gravity is apparent in theWSJ s quote from an arms control advocate describing the nuclear domino effect that could have just been unleashed Ifwe dont ratify Pakistan and India wont either And if they begin asubstantial testing program that would push China to do the same  Fromthere it is easy to foresee Russia following suit Even Japan might think itnecessary to jump into the nuclear arena The lead editorials at theWP  NYT  and LAT deplore the votedown            The LAT has the toughest reaction quote from President ClintonNever before has a serious treaty involving nuclear weapons been handled insuch a reckless and ultimately partisan way And both the NYT andUSAT go high up with his determination I assure you the fight is farfrom over But the WP points out that the treaty can only be brought upagain during this Congress if Trent Lott decides to do so            The NYT says The failure of the treaty to clear Washington raisedserious questions about its survival But the WP and LAT saythat to be implemented the treaty must be ratified by all  nukecapablecountries which implies that it is as of right now completely deadinternationally            The LAT says that Republicans wanted in return for deferring a treatyvote an ironclad promise from the Democrats not to bring the treaty up duringthe election but Clinton feared making such a pledge would tie his hands inthe event of a diplomatic emergency Without further explanation this leans abit too proDemocratic for a news storyafter all although Clinton might wellhave that fear he also surely wanted to have the treaty as an electionissue            In the JonBenet Ramsey case no news is news USAT  the WP and the LAT front the announcement that the Boulder County grand jurythat has been examining the case for  months has been dismissed withouthanding down any indictments in the case The NYT runs the storyinside            The LAT fronts the Associated Press followup to the story it broketwo weeks ago about possible US atrocities against civilians during theKorean War The new news There were at least two bridges ordered blown up byUS officers including an Army general even though Korean refugees werestreaming across them at the time USAT runs the APs story inside            The WP and WSJ report that todays New England Journal ofMedicine features a study revealing that a big reason lung cancer isdeadlier for blacks than for whites is that the former are lesslikely to have the cancer surgically removed while doing so would do them anygood The usual socioeconomic disparities between blacks and whites dont seemto explain this difference because in the study racial comparisons were madebetween patients with similar access to health care            The NYT has an inspiring obituary that of the yearold number onelox slicer at Zabars the Manhattan deli The man Sam Cohen worked at thestore for  years after barely escaping the Holocaust which claimed most ofhis family Despite arriving in the US in  with  in his pocket heeventually reports the Times  put his

insteadchairperson Todays Papers says go all the way furnitureperson            Both the NYT and WP report a major social change in FranceReporters just getting back to work after recovering from the grueling chefriots there today inform that France has given legal status to unmarriedcouples including homosexual couples making it says the Post thelargest country in Europe and the first Roman Catholic country to do so Theheadline over the NYT s online version doesnt mention the homosexualangle while the WP s headlineFRANCE LEGALIZES GAY UNIONSdoesntmention the heterosexual angle Whats more the latter reads more like itslugs a story about the Amalgamated Interior Decorators and Salon Stylists
