        okay youre probably uh more up on this subject than i am but       the roles that women have played the last couple couple of year in our are couple of generations   that right well theyve entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started   you bet   and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women   you bet you know where ive noticed it more i think is im a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling   right   you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and you know its a its a credit to them as far as how theyre doing things   yeah the you see more of that you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too   you bet   you know i i go to a i have a club that i belong to Altrusa that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not   you bet thats sort of neat   so that thats a i think thats a change and i think thats a change youre going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the fathers going to take more active role in child rearing   sure i think uh its the age age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or youll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men and theyre and theyre doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i thats a very true statement and it shouldnt uh it shouldnt be that way   right no that that i think should change will change in the near future also its been changing its been evolving but theres still a an   and i think so hope so and   an unequality in the work force in certain jobs its you know and you hear some people say you know well hes a man he he he needs that salary   absolutely you know ive right yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know       if if a a woman Congressman im sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever   right   so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way but i guess just the most significant thing change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going   and going yeah umhum   and i expect youre right in regards to having two parents now thats a good a good statement and i think if in the future its even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant   right yeah i i think it will be i think i well another another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much theyre out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind um because in the past the male bought the cars but now theyre showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases   wow   and that they are looking for um different things in the car the man is looking for the engine in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel   you bet   uh can her makeup come off the upholstery  and if theyre out there buying that many cars then theres that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working   good point right now im self employed and and my wifes always worked shes a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my bidness uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so   right   you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business she still works everyday so   yeah we all do   you bet   im just happen to be off today so  i work too   uhoh enjoying enjoying it  what kind of work do you do   im a nurse   well good   and i work at Medical Treatment Center um which is at Garland uh Jupiter and Arapaho   right married     no   yeah well well trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject   i dont know im kind of out of out of things   you see the old uh cigarette ads you know about youve come a long way   youve come a long way baby   baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that   right   its really true women have come a long way and you know
