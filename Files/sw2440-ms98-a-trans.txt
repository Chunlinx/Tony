        okay um im real happy with the car i have  i have a a Hyundai   oh really what kind of car do you have oh uhhuh   and i bought it in uh eighty no no no eighty eight or eighty seven eighty eight its an eighty eight and uh im ive taken real good care of it and im real   uhhuh   happy with it but if my financial situation was different theres probably other cars i would like to have   oh really yeah me too many many cars id like to have too um i bought a car around the same time in eighty eight and it was a um a Toyota Corolla   so uhhuh   and um i like it pretty well except its not real comfortable it doesnt give a comfortable ride you know its its a cheaper car and it gives a cheaper ride and its not the luxury car so if i bought one id probably want something like a a new Maxima   oh that a Nissan is that a Nissan i have a friend that has one thats just gorgeous yeah they not and then oh they do ride nice too in fact when   yes really right you dont hear wind noise and all that   yeah when i i was sitting i was sitting here waiting for for her to find somebody i was trying to think what kind would i and Nissan Maxima came into my mind   uhhuh yeah   she has a real pretty one its kind of a oh its not white and its not beige its kind of a cream color oh God its pretty its got a sun roof in it yeah its a nice car but boy she must have paid a fortune for it   yeah really yeah well im almost convinced that you pay for what you get because my car in eighty eight was like ten thousand five hundred dollars and it was okay when i bought it you know it was great running around town its a great little run around car town car because i get good gas mileage   yeah   but when youre out on the road on a trip like my parents live like five hundred miles away you are exhausted by the time you get there yeah because its just   uhhuh oh really   the seats arent real soft and comfortable and theres only so many positions you can get in and your body gets tired plus you hear the road road noise a lot so yeah   i probably do too i like the way my car rides though uh course i have a sun roof and i open it up so i hear i hear the wind   uhhuh oh yeah yeah yeah   and but its comfortable to drive i i really dont have much problem with that i think its comfortable im really sold on i you know i i dont remember what i paid pretty close to ten thousand i think with everything all together it came to eleven with tax and everything you know but im im real pleased with it   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh and it did you buy it here in Dallas   yeah i bought it at Eagle   uhhuh well   and i get great service there yeah   oh really well that means a lot   see i used to work at Lemmon Avenue so i thats right across the street from it   uhhuh   so i just walked across the street and bought a car so to speak yeah you know it was really convenient when i was there because id just pull it in during the day you know i worked second shift at that time and id just leave my car you know   yeah got to see them all the time uhhuh   and let them work on it id bring it in and go to work and then pick it up id go out on break at five thirty and pick up my car it was you know real convenient now its not so convenient   uhhuh yeah well um like how many have you had any major repairs or anything youve had to do to it   no not a thing   because you know my cars about same age as yours and ive been lucky i havent had any major anything happen   its been me neither and ive ive been really careful to take it when it needs service i do what the book says and i take it in i took you know for the valves   uhhuh   for the adjustments at fifteen thousand and thirty thousand and i change the oil every two to three thousand miles and i take real because i figured it was going to have to last me a while you know so i decided no matter what if i had to let a bill go i would take care of my car   right   yeah because you have to get back and forth   you know no matter what yeah and i get good gas mileage and its just been a great car its im im real pleased with it i have no no qualms about and i wouldnt mind buying another one if i had to you know the   yeah yeah well that sounds good because you know Hyundai is a fairly new car   uhhuh   compared to you know Ford and everybody so i i didnt know anyone that had one thats good to hear   theres a lot of people at Lemmon Avenue that have them i think a lot of people walked across the street but uh   yeah   uh theres a couple people that have gone a hundred thousand miles on theirs and its still in good shape so and yet i know someone that had to have a valve job on their valves and thats about six seven hundred dollars but they didnt take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to   umhum yeah oh umhum   and you know and i do that i think if you take good care of your car you know ive got thirty a little over thirty two thousand miles on mine how much how many miles do you have on yours   thats about what i have thirty two or thirty four i cant remember i just turned over one one or the other   do you have the oil changed a lot and everything   yeah luckily my husband is real good at that and he knows how and he changes it regularly and gives it tune ups you know replaces the spark plugs and and uh yeah i know that   no see i dont have a husband so i have to have it done you know when i did have a husband he didnt like to do stuff like that but i didnt have this car but uh i dont know   yeah i bet the sun roof is great   i love it i love it   that is something i would really want and you know if i bought a new car i would want a sun roof   yeah i made i you know i gave up the automatic transmission when i test drove the car i i didnt like the automatic transmission because it didnt have any get up and go and i   uhhuh   i like to shift so i i got a five speed and the automatic transmission was three hundred dollars and so was the sun roof so i was kind of a trade  well ill take the standard shift but i want the sun roof   umhum oh i see yeah well thats good   so oh and i love that sun roof i use it all the time i really do   oh yeah i think i would too because you know even i have to drive seventy five every day   ooh   so i  i do i drive seventy five every day so i would i would still you know   where do you live   up  in Plano   okay so you come down seventy five   right i come down seventy five and then i have to come up in five oclock traffic you know   ooh which where do you work which part   the Dallas site expressway there at seventy five and six thirty five   so youre in the which building   uh SC   oh youre in the SC building   uhhuh   im in im over in payroll so were were in Park Central   oh   yeah so you are you youre in Dallas   yeah Park Central Five  you know just across i come to the SC dock every afternoon deliver checks and to go out on the on the trucks so   umhum yeah   you know im just across the road but i live in Oak Cliff so i drive the toll road every day   oh oh yeah thatd be the only way   and its great you know theres never very much well theres traffic but its never stop and go unless theres a wreck you know i would never drive Central Expressway   uhhuh about how many miles is that   i go twenty miles one way   twenty miles one way yeah see i have about twenty five round trip is what it is   yeah thats not too thats not too bad   about twenty five miles a day yeah yeah id uh i still want that sun roof though       thatd be good   yeah id  i like i wouldnt mind having a convertible       well i saw a pretty little convertible the other day on the toll road a red one oh gosh it was so cute no it was i dont oh what was it i think it was a Mustang   Hyundai or was it um umhum   if im not mistaken i think i noticed it was a Mustang and it was new and it was pretty   oh yeah   so i also like the Rabbit uh convertibles i think theyre kind of cute   yeah oh i just had a friend buy one and he loves it   i bet he does   he does he and its convertible he puts that top down and its just a fun car oh yeah they are i couldnt believe what he paid for it it was like sixteen thousand dollars   theyre expensive uh oh my God   you know and hear i am thinking this car is smaller than my car   and i and i bet its not comfortable is it comfortable   no not really i mean its you know the seats are typical Volkswagen seats   thats right   the vinyl you know   thats all that is   i know but that car is so expensive but you know talking to my husband and he was real impressed with the car the motor and everything in it is just fabulous supposedly its one of the best built cars     yeah i i hear the Volkswagen engine you know is really good well isnt it made by um   uhhuh uhhuh   oh God Mercedes   yes and Kharman Ghia uh it was the little sports car   i used to have a Kharman Ghia red one at one time and i loved that car i i wish now i hadnt sold it   oh really those are the best supposedly the best built cars so this little Volkswagen that he has hes loving it yeah   id like to have a Mercedes i i cant see paying as much for a car as you could buy a house for           i know i know uh   sixty seventy thousand dollars for a car just a little bit out of my league   yeah i i can just see parking it at TI you know and then somebody   smashing it smashing it with their door makes me so angry or breaking into it we have such a rash of breakins   right right  itd be gone in a week so     they have we had we they have had to put security really heavy in our parking lot and people sitting up in the windows watching security because they were coming around smashing the windows and stealing stuff just in our parking lot you know and our parking lots not   um   so huge like what you all have over there you know and they we look right out my office looks right out onto the parking lot and i didnt see anything going on and im always looking out the window   uhhuh   and they were doing in broad daylight boy ill tell you what people just really have a lot of nerve you know break into cars just broad daylight   no and it just ruins you too you just makes you sick and then you have insurance you know goes up and its terrible  right   i know it and you all had a lot of problems over there too didnt you for a while   oh yeah yeah
