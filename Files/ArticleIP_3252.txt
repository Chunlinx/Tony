                                 He Got Balls            Basketball Its played amidthe cornfields of the Midwest by lanky boys with flaxen hair and twixt thehousing projects by the troubled shores of Coney Island where otherwisepowerless young AfricanAmericans bestride the courts like colossi BasketballThe young gods swivel unwind suspend themselves in air the orange orb thatspins from their fingers as splendid for an instant as the sun until itdropsswishthrough nets like filigree to the earth from whence it sprungBasketball So lyrically American you can almost hear the dissonant yearningsof Aaron Copland Wait a minute that is Aaron Coplanda gay white Jewon the soundtrack of a Spike Lee movie The opening montage of He GotGame leaves no doubt as to the mythopoetic intentions of its fiercelyenterprising director Basketball not baseball is the pastime of the nationLee inhabits And He Got Game is poised to be Lees GreatAfricanAmerican Myth a tale that encompasses the tragedies of the past theturbulence of the present the messianic longings of the future            So muchambition dynamism visual energy bullshit I confess I come to a Spike Leejoint with suspicion prepared to fight off the propaganda to sort throughthe messages and scrutinize the codes The hope is always there though thatLee will transcend his anger and egotism and paranoia and make a film thatfeels organicthat doesnt add up to another sterling specimen of the WatchThat Man Cook school of movie making in which razzledazzle outshinescontent and the auteur upstages his own work Its a testament to Lees talentthat hobbled as he is by a chip on his shoulder the size of a planet andaspirations often laughably outsized he has managed to make a film asentertaining as He Got Game  Uneven ludicrous butoh manfun towatch He got balls            The picture has one of the oldest pulp plots in thebusiness last used to rousing effect in John Carpenters Escape From NewYork  A convict is sprung from prison promised liberty by anuntrustworthy government in return for accomplishing a morally ambiguous taskthat no one else can do given a strict deadline and ruthlessly monitored byhis excaptors Here the convict is Jake Shuttlesworth Denzel Washington andhis mission is to go into the projects of Coney Island where his son Jesusplayed by the yearold Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen is a highschoolbasketball player of near divine abilities Jake must convince his son to signa letter of intent that hell enroll in Big State University the stategovernors alma mater The obstacles however are formidable Jesus iscurrently under siege by coaches agents and their unsavory minions all ofwhom proffer money cars sex and sundry other illegal inducements to signwith their colleges or professional teams More of an obstacle still is therelationship between father and son which has been poisoned by the death ofthe young mans mother under circumstances that Lee keeps cunningly under wrapsuntil the movies galvanic climax in which the two men go mano a manoon the basketball court            This issurefire material and Lee structures it deftly leaving us in the dark untilthe end as to why Jakea manifestly decent softspoken cagey fellowgorgeously underplayed by Washingtonended up in prison in the first placeMeanwhile He Got Game teems with  stuff Lees syntax can belegitimately labeled Brechtian The narrative is incessantly interrupted bycinematic placards exhortations lectures about staying in school in the formof letters from the boys dead mother played by Lonette McKee and insertsdepicting the evils of drugs and alcohol The characters are photographediconically as in an Eisenstein film the spiritually crippled black dad withhis modest Afro against the weatherbeaten relic of a Coney Island ride forexample Lee who has started his own advertising firm and is noted for hishyperbolic Nike commercials is always selling something I pat myself on theback for titling my Village Voice review of Lees  first featureShes Gotta Have It  Birth of a Salesman and his work is neversharper than when his characters are selling something toodelivering somekind of spiel as if their very existences depended on it Some of the spielershere include real NCAA and NBA coaches along with a hilarious mockreligiousturn by John Turturro as Coach Billy Sunday            Supersensitive to criticism these days Lee hasbuilt in all kinds of protections against charges of racism and misogyny Apreening ItalianAmerican sports agent Al Palagonia declares that he has nomob ties and that he resents being stereotyped shortly before delivering astereotypical and very funny Scorseseesque recitation of the luxuriesFerraris Rolexes mansions that await Jesus if he signs on the dotted lineLala Bonilla Rosario Dawson the amusingly named Delilah dispatched to seducethe young star gets a monologue near the end in which she justifies heractions on socioeconomic grounds And as a counterpoint to all the lusciousbarebreasted white girls used to tempt the hero into playing for the Mantheres a hooker the model Milla Jovovich the films most unlikely bit ofcasting made to look like a near albino whos exploited and knocked around bya jittery black pimp Thomas Jefferson Byrd so sadistic that if this film hadbeen made by a white director hed have been cited most likely by Lee as aflagrant racist outrage As on a basketball the seams of the movie show            StanleyCrouch who gleefully refers to Lee as the diminutive director has pointedout that Lee resembles the hero of Preston Sturges Sullivans Travels a lightweight who strives to make an unwieldy epic called O Brother WhereArt Thou Actually this joke was first made by E Max Frye in hisunderrated  farce Amos                 Andrew  in which a Spikelikeplaywright has a Broadway hit called Yo Brother Where                Art Thou Lees use of Copland pieces such as Lincoln Portrait Rodeo AppalachianSpring and Fanfare for the Common Man too transparently pump up thepictures already pumpedup visuals and his bball variation on thereligioso finale of Lars von Triers Breaking the Waves  isas daft as it was in the original            What transforms He Got Game is Lees love for thesport and his intimacy with its nuances Spike knows basketball He filmed inand around Brooklyns Lincoln High which is also the setting of Darcy Freyssuperb book The Last Shot City Streets Basketball Dreams  an equallypanoramic but more grounded portrait of the games meaning to the denizens ofthe Coney Island projects Lee might view the sport as a metaphoras both away out and a trap for young AfricanAmericansbut he never lets the metaphorgum up the realities of the game On the contrary the metaphor intensifies theaction on the court which can seem kinetic to the point of spontaneouscombustion as pressure to perform tears families up and turns black managainst black man If on occasion Lees serpentine camera seems more activethan the players hes shooting he knows just when to speed the play up whento slow it down and when to let it unfold in real time And he gets a charmingperformance from Allen who in his acting debut occupies his pedestal withgrace and diffidence The diminutive director never evinces more stature thanwhen hes looking up in awe
