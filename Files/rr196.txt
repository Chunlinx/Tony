                    Introduction        Elastaseinduced emphysema in rodents is the most widely        studied animal model for human emphysema Several        alterations in diaphragmatic structure and function have        been demonstrated in this model Among these are diaphragm        fiber shortening with a corresponding shift in the        lengthtension curve        and variable changes in        the contractile properties of diaphragm strips         in vitro        Increased        fatigue resistance of the muscle is the single alteration        in contractile properties that has been most consistently              though not always     identified This        fatigue resistance has been accompanied by an increased        oxidative capacity in the diaphragmatic muscle fibers as        demonstrated by increased activities of citrate synthase            and succinate dehydrogenase SDH             In contrast fiber type has generally not been found to        be significantly altered in the diaphragms of emphysematous        animals        although in all reports addressing        this issue the fibers were typed histochemically rather        than by myosin heavy chain MHC composition Furthermore        the kinetics of diaphragmatic muscle contraction that one        would expect to result from shifts in fiber type        distribution such as time to peak tension have also        generally        but not always     been found        to be unaltered in emphysema A change in fiber type        distribution in the diaphragm of emphysematous hamsters was        shown for the first time recently     but again        histochemical classification was employed and no        corresponding change in twitch kinetics was demonstrated        In the scalene muscle an accessory muscle of inspiration        of emphysematous hamsters an increase in IIa fibers and a        decrease in IIx fibers has been demonstrated with the use        of antiMHC monoclonal antibodies There was no difference        however in contractile properties between emphysema and        control muscle in that study            In humans our group and one other have demonstrated        marked alterations in MHC expression in the diaphragm in        severe emphysema      This shift toward slow MHC        isoforms has been proposed to subserve an adaptive        resistance to fatigue in the human diaphragm in emphysema        which is similar to that seen in the animal model        Although most of the experimental work on adaptation of        the diaphragm to emphysema has been performed in hamsters        rats also develop significant and often marked increases in        lung volumes and compliance and reductions in expiratory        flows after intratracheal administration of elastase                MHC adaptation in emphysematous rat        diaphragm has not been studied systematically Because        monoclonal MHC antibodies are better characterized in rat        than hamster and with the availability of a        semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain        reaction RTPCR assay for rat MHC mRNA     we set        out to study changes in MHCdetermined fiber types and MHC        mRNA expression in emphysematous rat diaphragm To evaluate        whether shifts toward more energyefficient isoforms of the        second most important ATPase in muscle might also occur in        emphysematous diaphragm we also studied changes in        sarcoplasmicendoplasmicreticulum Ca ATPase SERCA        expression        Further we sought to correlate changes in MHC and SERCA        expression with the physiologic function of diaphragm        strips         in vitro  We hypothesized that we        would identify significant alterations in MHC and perhaps        SERCA expression in the emphysematous rat diaphragm        similar to those identified in humans with severe        emphysema and that these changes would be accompanied by        corresponding changes in contractile properties It was        expected that such findings might identify the rat model of        elastaseinduced emphysema as a model in which the        diaphragmatic MHC changes that have been shown to result        from emphysema in humans might be explored further                    Materials and methods                  Induction of emphysema          Eleven monthold SpragueDawley rats underwent          emphysema induction by a single intratracheal          instillation of porcine pancreatic elastase ICN          Biochemicals Cleveland Ohio at  units per  g body          weight diluted in  ml of normal saline as described          previously     Two animals died on the night after          instillation with evidence at autopsy the following day          of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage          Eleven control animals were instilled with an equal          volume of saline without a mortality          Animals were maintained two per cage with feeding           ad libitum for  months The          protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committees of          the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the          University of Pennsylvania                          Diaphragm strip physiology in vitro          An apparatus for the study           in vitro of muscle contractile          characteristics similar to that described previously             was assembled Thirteenmonthold rats  months after          the induction of emphysema were killed by CO            inhalation and the diaphragm was          quickly harvested en bloc with the ribcage intact and          immersed in oxygenated Ringers solution buffered to pH           with  mM hydroxyethylpiperazine          ethanesulphonic acid A muscle strip approximately  mm          in width including central tendon and rib attachments          was dissected out under magnification care was taken to          cut parallel to the muscle fibers          Each strip was mounted horizontally in a bath of          continuously circulating oxygenated solution at            C One end of the strip was tied to a fixed post with          sutures taken through the attached ribs The central          tendon at the other end was fixed to the arm of a          servomotor system motor model  electronics model          B Cambridge Technology Watertown Massachusetts on          a movable platform with a single tie Platinum electrodes          each  mm   mm were placed within  mm of the muscle          strip on either

ms pulses A          series of twitches generated every  seconds at          incrementally different muscle lengths was used to          identify the point of maximal force generation            L           o  Mean muscle length at           L           o was    cm in control          animals and    cm in animals with emphysema            P            A lengthtension curve was generated from the mean of          five twitches at each muscle length between  and           of the previously determined           L           o  Fatiguing characteristics were          then determined by repeated stimulation at  Hz for           ms bursts and  trainsmin Muscle length servomotor          position stimulator pulse timing and data collection          were under computer control with custom software          developed in our laboratory A Pentium computer with a          data acquisition board DTEZ Data Translation          Marlboro Massachusetts controlled the experiment and          recorded all data to disk for later analysis          After study the strip was removed from the apparatus          trimmed of nonmuscle tissue blotted dry and weighed          Total muscle strip crosssectional area was calculated as          wet muscle mass divided by muscle length times density          taken to be  gcm      Tension was calculated          by dividing developed force by the calculated          crosssectional area Study of two of the control rat          strips suffered technical failure leaving nine          emphysematous and nine control animals fully studied          Mean strip wet weight was    g in the control          rats and    g in the emphysematous rats            P                            Lung volume determination          After we had dissected out the diaphragm strips for          the physiologic studies described above the animals          lungs were excised with trachea intact The trachea was          cannulated with a  g intravenous catheter Angiocath          Becton Dickinson Sandy Utah an airtight seal was          established and the lung was inflated to a distending          pressure of  cmH            O This volume at the total lung          capacity was then measured by water displacement                          MHC RTPCR          MHC mRNA expression was analyzed by an MHC RTPCR          assay as described initially    and later adapted by          its originators     The assay is semiquantitative          permitting accurate determination of relative amounts of          mRNA of the embryonic neonatal I IIa IIx and IIb MHC          isoforms in muscle The assays accuracy has been          confirmed against Northern blot analysis              In brief mRNA was extracted from an approximately           mg fragment of frozen diaphragm taken from the central          portion of the strip used in the physiologic experiments          described above This was done with the Microfast Track           Kit Invitrogen Carlsbad California in accordance          with the manufacturers protocol The mRNA was then          suspended in  l of elution buffer and the          concentration was determined by measuring the attenuance          at a wavelength of  nm mRNA  ng was reverse          transcribed for each muscle sample with the Firststrand          cDNA Synthesis Kit Amersham Pharmacia Piscataway New          Jersey and the cDNA product was then used in the          PCR          The PCR Fig  involved six reaction tubes for each          muscle sample one tube for each isoform studied A          single  oligonucleotide common primer designed from a          highly conserved region in all known rat MHC genes          approximately  base pairs upstream of the stop codon          was used in every reaction tube sequence          AGAAGGAGCAGGACACCAGC A different           oligonucleotide primer designed from a divergent portion          of the untranslated region of each of the different          MHC genes was used in each reaction tube to provide          isoform specificity sequences in      Template          in addition to  g of reverse transcribed cDNA included           pg of an internal control fragment    to be          coamplified with each PCR by using the same primers and          target sequences However this control template yields a          fragment of different size from that resulting from          amplification of the MHC genes in each tube    Fig           and permits controlling for the efficiency of each          PCR amplification          The PCR was performed in a  l total reaction          volume This mixture contained the two templates          described above  l of   PCR buffer Promega  l          of  mM MgCl              l dNTP  M of each of the two          appropriate primers and  units of DNA           Taq polymerase Promega with          water to bring it to final volume Amplifications were          performed in a thermal cycler with an initial denaturing          step of  minutes at C followed by  cycles with          each cycle consisting of  minute at C  seconds at          C  seconds at C and a final step of  minutes          at C The number of cycles was optimized so that the          amplified signal was on the linear portion of a          semilogarithmic plot of the yield expressed as a function          of the number of cycles The PCR products were separated          on  agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide          Fig           Negative images of the gels were produced under          ultraviolet light with Polaroid film type  ISO           positivenegative black and white Polaroid Bedford          Massachusetts Densitometry of the bands was performed          on the negatives Personal Densitometer Molecular          Dynamics Sunnyvale California with Image Quant          softwares area quantitation paradigm To correct for          any differences in the efficiency of the reactions for          each isoform the intensity of the MHC band was divided          by the intensity of the control fragment in that          reaction A correction factor was calculated for each          band on the basis of its size to normalize the intensity          of the staining for the different sizes of the fragments          The final percentage content of each MHC gene in the          total sample was then calculated from the fraction of a          specific corrected value relative to the sum of expressed          MHC mRNA isoforms in a given sample     We performed          the reverse transcription and the PCR in triplicate for          each piece of muscle starting with the same mRNA sample          The final value represents the mean of these three          runs                          MHC immunocytochemistry          Fiber types were determined by indirect          immunofluorescence on serial frozen cross sections of rat          diaphragm with monoclonal antibodies specific for the          following MHCs NOQD for type I     SC for          type IIa     and BFF for type IIb     The          antibody useful for the identification of type IIx          fibers BF     stains all fibers except pure IIx          fibers To aid in the visualization of the periphery of          the fibers we simultaneously coincubated each section          with a rabbit antirat laminin primary antibody Sigma          St Louis Missouri at a dilution of  followed by          a fluoresceinconjugated sheep antirabbit IgG secondary          antibody Our tissue preparation and staining protocols          for the type I and IIa antibodies have been described          previously      with the modification that          NOQD was used at  dilution the section was          incubated with each of these primary antibodies for           hours at C and rhodamineconjugated secondary          antibodies were used For BFF we used a primary          antibody dilution of  an  hour incubation and a          donkey antimouse IgM rhodamineconjugated secondary          antibody For BF we used a primary antibody dilution          of  a  hour incubation and a goat antimouse IgG          rhodamineconjugated secondary antibody          Fibers were classified on the basis of the antibody          that yielded the strongest fluorescent staining or the          absence of staining with BF for pure IIx fibers          Thus we did not assess the proportions of fibers that          might have coexpressed more than one MHC Subjectively          we saw no evidence of coexpression of fiber types I and          IIa but owing to the nature of antibody BF which          stains all except pure IIx fibers we are unable to rule          out the coexpression of IIx with any other isoform There          were very rare fibers less than  that stained only          lightly with BFF and did not stain with BF We          interpreted these as probably representing intermediate          fibers expressing both IIb and IIx We did not count          these fibers toward the totals reported in the results          section          At least  fibers were evaluated for each specimen          in determining the percentage of each MHCdetermined          fiber type Using software that had been customdesigned          in our laboratory we also determined the percentage of          the total surface area of each cross section of muscle          occupied by each MHCdetermined fiber type                          SERCA immunocytochemistry          Mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies directed against the          slow and fast isoforms of SERCA respectively were also          used on serial sections of rat diaphragm catalogue          numbers MA and MA Affinity BioReagents Inc          Golden Colorado Each section was preincubated with           bovine serum albumin for  hour then incubated overnight          at C with the appropriate primary antibody at           dilution A goat antimouse IgG secondary antibody          conjugated to Cy was used at  dilution for  hour          regardless of which primary antibody was used                          Statistical analysis          Data are reported as means  SE We used a          repeatedmeasures analysis of variance with a HuynhFeldt          correction to compare emphysematous and control groups          with respect to MHC transcript levels by PCR and          MHCdetermined fibertype number by immunocytochemistry          We noted a groupbytype interaction and then performed           t tests to compare the two groups          with respect to each of the MHC isoforms Fatigue data          were analyzed by           t test comparing mean values of          measured to initial force ratio A           P value of  or less was          considered to represent statistical significance                            Results                  Lung volume          We determined H            O displacement lung volumes at total          lung capacity  cmH            O airway pressure as the simplest          measure to document the hyperexpansion characteristic of          emphysema in the elastasetreated animals Because there          was very little difference in body mass between control          and emphysematous animals    g control           n      g emphysema           n             P   the differences in lung          volume were highly significant whether or not they were          normalized to body mass Crude lung volumes were             ml in emphysematous animals            n   and    ml in          controls animals            n              P   Thus H            O displacement lung volumes were          increased by  in emphysematous animals over          controls                          Measurement of MHC isoform expression by          RTPCR          The mean percentage compositions of mRNA representing          each MHC isoform in the diaphragms of emphysematous and          control animals are listed in Table  Note that there          was a significant decrease in the expression of MHC IIb          in emphysematous versus control Although the increase in          the expression of the three slower adult isoforms did not          reach statistical significance for any individual          isoform all demonstrated a trend to greater expression          in emphysema This trend was most marked in the IIx          isoform for which the           P value for increased expression in          emphysematous versus control diaphragm reached           Thus there was modest shift toward expression of slower          isoforms at the mRNA level and this shift occurred          predominantly at the faster end of the MHC spectrum                          Measurement of MHC isoform expression by          immunocytochemistry          Immunocytochemical results measuring MHC          proteindetermined fiber type closely mirrorred the PCR          results at the mRNA level Table demonstrates that as          determined by immunocytochemistry emphysematous animals          had a significantly lower percentage of fibers classified          as IIb and a trend toward increased numbers of IIx and          slow fibers When calculated on the basis of area          occupied by each fiber type the difference between          emphysema and control did not reach significance even for          the IIb antibody            P   Note that although the          results with RTPCR and immunocytochemistry are          qualitatively similar they are quantitatively different          Figure shows a typical panel from serial sections of one          of the emphysematous diaphragm specimens stained with          each of the monoclonal antibodies                          SERCA expression by immunocytochemistry          There was no significant difference in the numbers of          fibers expressing either SERCA  or SERCA  between the          emphysematous and control groups For SERCA   of          fibers were positive in controls and  in the          emphysematous animals            P   For SERCA   of          fibers were positive in each group            P

that have previously been most          strongly correlated with a shift to slower MHC isoforms          time to peak tension and fatiguing characteristics          were significantly altered in the expected direction in          the emphysematous versus control diaphragm strips Time          to peak tension was longer in the emphysematous group          with a           P value of  and the          emphysematous diaphragm was less fatiguable with a           P value of  There was no          significant difference in specific force generated or in          the half relaxation time                            Discussion        To our knowledge these data are the first report of        significant changes in MHC expression with corresponding        physiologic alterations in any respiratory muscle of an        animal model of emphysema These changes are qualitatively        similar to those reported in severe human emphysema             that is they too are manifested as a shift toward        slower MHC isoforms Quantitatively however the changes        are far less marked than the shift demonstrated in        humans        The most studied animal model for the adaptation of        respiratory muscle to emphysema has been the hamster with        elastaseinduced emphysema The hamster model has probably        been chosen for these studies in large part because of the        impressive increases in lung volumes that can be created in        hamsters with total lung capacity sometimes reaching         of control values Despite the demonstration of length        adaptation        and fatigue resistance             in the diaphragms of emphysematous hamsters not until very        recently could a change in fiber type distribution be        demonstrated     and in that study histochemical        classification was employed that could not separate out IIx        from IIb fibers Furthermore no study in emphysematous        hamster diaphragm has demonstrated a change in twitch        kinetics        Intratracheal instillation of elastase in rats creates a        form of panacinar emphysema that in some ways more closely        parallels the human disease than that created by        instillation of elastase in hamsters Changes in lung        volumes and compliance in the rat are more similar to those        seen in humans         An electron microscopic        comparison of human emphysema with elastaseinduced        emphysema in rats revealed remarkably similar pictures of        elastin disintegration accompanied by increased collagen        deposition and reorganization            Our results for MHC expression in rat diaphragm from        normal and emphysematous rats must be viewed first in the        light of previous quantitative studies of MHC expression in        normal rat diaphragm that used techniques able to separate        out all known isoforms In weekold SpragueDawley        rats Kanbara         et al    found by         in situ hybridization that  of        fibers expressed only IIb and  coexpressed the IIx and        IIb isoforms This is in contrast with our RTPCR result of         IIb in normals but immunocytochemical results much        more in line with Kanbaras findings In that study the        values for MHCs I IIa and IIx were not markedly different        from those reported here for normal rat diaphragm by        RTPCR By electrophoretic separation Sugiura         et al    found IIb MHC to        represent  of all MHC protein in young rat diaphragm        and their IIdIIx result of  is also quite different        from our PCR result while their I and IIa findings are        very similar to our PCR results and their IIdIIx result        closely parallels our IIx area percentage        immunocytochemistry result Okumoto         et al reported even less IIb and        more IId protein by electrophoresis in monthold rats                   The differences between the findings of these reports        and ours might at first glance result from the age of the        animals studied as our rats were significantly older at         months However it has been reported that there is an        agerelated transition from fast to slow MHC in rat limb        muscles     and diaphragm     which would render        this explanation unlikely A potential explanation of our        results in relation to Kanbaras would be that there was a        systematically greater concentration of IIb mRNA in IIb and        IIbIIx fibers than of other isoforms mRNAs in their        respective fibers Sugiura         et al and Okumoto         et al used Wistar rats although        this would be unlikely to explain the difference between        their findings and ours In the final analysis it is        difficult to draw any firm conclusions from comparisons        between studies addressing mRNA levels and those addressing        protein levels and similarly between techniques measuring        protein by gel and those measuring protein by        immunocytochemistry        Although increased activities of citrate synthase           and SDH     have usually been demonstrated in the        diaphragm in animal models of emphysema fiber type has        generally not been found to be significantly altered               Only in one recent paper was a shift in MHC in        emphysematous diaphragm demonstrated but the histochemical        technique used precluded the separation of IIb and IIx        fibers     Another study has shown increased        expression of IIa at the expense of IIx MHC in        emphysematous hamster scalene muscle with the use of MHC        monoclonal antibodies but there were none of the expected        physiologic changes accompanying the shift            We demonstrate here a shift from IIb toward IIx in        emphysematous rat diaphragm at both the protein and mRNA        levels Although this shift toward a slower isoform is not        as marked as that reported in humans      in which        MHC type I is upregulated and both IIa and IIx are        downregulated there is precedent for restricted MHC        adaptation in rats Termin         et al    for example have noted        that whereas chronically stimulated rabbit fasttwitch        muscle results in appreciable increases in slow myosin        isoforms chronic stimulation of rat muscle tends to bring        about shifts toward the slower types among the type II        isoforms Other factors that might lead to less impressive        MHC shifts in rodent models of emphysema than in humans        include the much shorter time course over which the        adaptations have a chance to occur the greater compliance        of the rodent thorax to pulmonary hyperexpansion and        differences in the diaphragmatic load created in the human        disease in comparison with the animal models that have yet        to be fully worked out        Our finding in the diaphragms of rats with emphysema is        very similar to that demonstrated by Sugiura         et al in the diaphragms of        chronically swimming rats     We found IIb mRNA        expression to decrease by  and IIb MHCdetermined fiber        type to decrease by  in emphysema Sugiura         et al found that after  weeks of        endurance swimming IIb protein from costal diaphragm of        rats fell by  also without statistically significant        changes in the amounts of other MHC isoforms This suggests        that the effects of emphysema on the diaphragm are as has        been suggested by others at least in part a function of        increased workload        Other studies of MHC adaptation in animal models of        increased diaphragmatic work have had conflicting results        Although various treadmillrunning protocols have shown        increases in the aerobic capacity of the rat diaphragm                running has generally not been demonstrated        to cause consistent changes in the relative expression of        MHC isoforms      Although one paper has shown a        decrease in type IIb fibers and an increase in type I        fibers     and another has shown only a significant        decrease in type IIb fibers     a third paper reported        a surprising increase in type IIb fibers            In contrast inspiratory resistive loading by tracheal        narrowing has consistently shown increases in the        percentage of type I fibers and the corresponding MHC        isoform in the diaphragm       closely resembling        the changes seen in severe human emphysema Respiratory        loading by chronic hypercapnea has also demonstrated        similar changes            Given these findings one can postulate that shifts        toward slower MHC isoforms in diaphragmatic muscle fibers        result primarily from some combination of the degree and        chronicity of the work performed by the muscle If this is        so then one could arrange the experimental methods that        have been explored that impose increased diaphragmatic        work from least imposed load to greatest imposed load as        follows running swimming emphysema hypercapnea        tracheal banding It is possible that in emphysema the        additional impact on diaphragmatic physiology of fiber        shortening resulting from pulmonary hyperexpansion                affects MHC isoform shifts beyond the influence of        a pure increase in the workload on the muscle        In addition to being the first demonstration of a        decrease in the expression of the IIb MHC isoform in an        animal model of emphysema this study is the first to        demonstrate that such a shift toward slower isoforms in        emphysema has a significant physiologic impact on        diaphragmatic function         in vitro  We show that both twitch        speed and fatiguing properties move toward slowertwitch        characteristics with this decrease in IIb expression Given        previous work in this area it is not unexpected that even        a shift only between the fast isoforms but away from IIb        would result in measurable physiological changes It has        been noted for example that IIx fibers have significantly        higher SDH activity than IIb fibers     and further        that IIb motor units are significantly more fatigue        sensitive than IIx motor units     Schiaffino         et al have also demonstrated in rat        whole muscles a slower maximum velocity of shortening in        muscles made up of predominantly IIx versus IIb fibers            Further SantAna Pereira         et al    have shown a major        difference in actomyosin ATPase activity in rat single IIb        and IIx fibers and Sieck         et al    have shown this in        single fibers from rat diaphragm        Finally we examined the expression of the SERCA        proteins in these animals because these proteins are        responsible for a significant fraction of energy        consumption in skeletal muscle second only to the energy        consumed by the ATPase responsible for movement of the        myosin head Further diaphragmatic fatigue might be        related to SERCA function    and as discussed above        our emphysematous animals showed decreased diaphragm strip        fatigability Previous work has suggested that although        SERCA expression in limb muscles seems to respond to        increases in functional load by upregulating SERCA  the        slow SERCA isoform and downregulating SERCA  the fast        isoform     similar responses might not occur in        diaphragm     Our data showing no difference in the        expression of SERCA  and SERCA  between emphysematous and        control animals are consistent with this finding We did        not measure SERCA activity or phospholamban        phosphorylation It is certainly possible that the overall        activities of one or both of the SERCA isoforms are in        fact different between emphysematous and control        diaphragm although the numbers of fibers expressing each        isoform are not different        Because mechanical indices of relaxation reflect the        function of SERCA in sequestering calcium in the        sarcoplasmic reticulum     we measured half relaxation        times on our diaphragmatic strips It is not surprising        that with no change in SERCA  and SERCA  expression        detected by immunocytochemistry we found no difference in        the relaxation times between control and emphysematous        diaphragm strips                    Conclusion        In sum we have demonstrated a significant decrease in        IIb MHC expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in        the diaphragmatic muscle of rats with elastaseinduced        emphysema In concert with this shift away from the fastest        MHC isoform we have demonstrated slower physiological        characteristics         in vitro  including a longer time to        peak tension and a greater resistance to fatigue in        diaphragm strips These findings suggest that earlier        reports of physiological adaptation within the diaphragm in        animal models of emphysema without the demonstration of        concomitant shifts in MHC expression toward slower isoforms        were limited by the technologies then available which did        not allow the evaluation of the expression of each of the        type II MHC isoforms with specific probes        A physiologically significant shift toward slower MHC        isoforms does occur in elastaseinduced emphysema in        rodents as it does in severe human emphysema but in the        animal model the shift occurs at the faster end of the        isoform spectrum primarily between the type II        isoforms                    Abbreviations        MHC  myosin heavy chain RTPCR  reverse transcriptase
