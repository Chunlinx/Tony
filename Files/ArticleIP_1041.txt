                                 Kwanzaa            Im still having troublewith Hanukkah a Texaco executive says on that controversial tape recordingNow we have Kwanzaa Although his expression of concern may have beenextreme that executive is not the only American confused about Kwanzaa Eachyear we hear more and more about this holiday What is it and where did itcome from            Kwanzaa is a holidayhonoring AfricanAmerican heritage and culture Celebrated from Dec through Jan  the holiday was created after the  Watts riot by MaulanaRon Karenga  a graduate student and black nationalist who observed thatblack Americans had no holiday of their own In the s Karenga feudedopenly with other black leaders and some of his followers were convicted in aplot to assassinate members of the Black Panthers In the s Karengahimself was imprisoned for ordering and directing the torture of a young womanNow  years old he is chair of Black Studies at California State Universityin Long Beach Last year apparently rehabilitated in the eyes of manyAfricanAmerican leaders Karenga served on the national executive committeefor the Million Man March            Karengasearly attempts to popularize the holiday were directed at a relatively smallgroup of activists Beginning in the late s however Kwanzaa began toattract coverage in the mainstream press  The attention grew as Karengamodified his rhetoric to appeal to a broader audience and as interest inmulticulturalism burgeoned in the late s Kwanzaa was taken up bymany in the expanding black middle class  whose buying power hassupported such marketing ventures as the Kwanzaa Expos conventioncentergatherings at which Afrocentric goods and art are sold            Karenga took the holidays name from the Swahiliphrase matunda yakwanza  meaning first fruit Swahili words werechosen because the language a hybrid of Arabic and Bantu tongues is tied tono particular African tribe Although there are no directly analogous Africanholidays Karenga drew his inspiration from various African harvest festivalsFrom these he extracted seven principles unity selfdeterminationcollective work cooperative economics purpose creativity and faith Each ofthe holidays seven days is meant to symbolize one of these principles            Thecentral Kwanzaa ritual is candle lighting  First the mkekastraw mat is placed on the table along with the kinara candleholderand the mishumaa saba seven candles The three candles on the right inthe kinara are red symbolizing the blood of the African people thethree on the left are

mainstream Some enthusiasts such as writer Linn Washington Jr claim that Kwanzaa has as many as  millioncelebrants and the Detroit News reports that researchers estimate theKwanzaarelated market at  million annually Despite Karengas originalintention Kwanzaa takes on a more commercial flavor every year Hallmark makesKwanzaa cards and there are Kwanzaa posters books CDs and massproducedkinaras  But Kwanzaa was not intended to replace Christmas and manyAfricanAmerican families celebrate both holidays            And Hanukkah  It too if not invented in the UnitedStates has taken on a different shape and gained importance here AlthoughHanukkah has been on the Jewish calendar for more than two millennia it wasuntil recently a relatively minor holiday The pressures of Christmashowever have elevated Hanukkah for many Jewish families to eight days ofcelebration and giftgiving A new book maintains that even Christmas is atrumpedup holiday See Summary Judgment            Hanukkahcommemorates the victory in  BC of a small band of Jews led by JudasMaccabaeus over the Greeks who ruled Palestine at the time The Jews reclaimedthe Temple from the Greeks and rededicated it as their place of worship Butthey had only one days supply of oil to light the flame which was supposed toburn constantly Miraculously the flame burned for eight days and nightsuntil the oil supply was replenished Following the rebellion the kingdom ofIsrael was restored for  years            Some Kwanzaa rituals most notably the focus oncandles seem to have been borrowed from Hanukkah The center of the eightdayHanukkah celebration is the nightly family gathering to light candles in acandelabra known as the menorah Oily foods particularly latkes potatopancakes are served during dinner to symbolize the Temple miracle Bytradition family members play with the dreidel  a foursided spinningtop and children receive Hanukkah gelt chocolate coins covered with goldfoil and other presents            UnlikeKwanzaa Hanukkah enjoys no agreedupon spelling in English The mostcommon variant is Chanukah reflecting the proper pronunciation of theopening consonant which is like the ch in Bach The spelling employed inthis article is from The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual Slates guide in such matters                           References                        If youdlike to know
