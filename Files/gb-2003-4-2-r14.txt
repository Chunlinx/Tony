                    Background                  Lateral gene transfer          Lateral gene transfer LGT has been generally          accepted for some time as exemplified by the          endosymbiotic hypothesis of organelle origin             Nevertheless a longstanding background of general          conviction has held that LGT is rare especially between          distant organisms However the modern era of genomics          has been accompanied by increasingly numerous claims that          LGT is frequent      and there now seems little          doubt that LGT exerts a significant influence upon          evolutionary histories Indeed it has even been asserted          that vertical evolutionary patterns of descent might be          impossibly masked by rampant events of LGT and that in          fact instead of bifurcating phylogenetic trees a          reticulate netlike pattern exists     On the          other hand others urge a more balanced perspective          pointing out that alternative explanations for apparent          cases of LGT have not always been considered                The rationale for explanations other than          LGT for genealogical incongruities such as hidden          paralogies and reconstruction artifacts have been          presented in comprehensive detail by Glansdorff                     Woese   contends that the rRNA tree is a valid          representation of organismal genealogy that LGT was          rampant only before the initial bifurcation of the          universal phylogenetic tree and that LGT has become          progressively more restricted as a function of elapsed          evolutionary time Using the aminoacyltRNA synthases as          an example of the modulartype entities asserted to be          most amenable to LGT Woese concludes that the          genealogical trace of vertical gene flow is readable          despite a significant jumbling influence of LGT If          correct this allows the optimistic viewpoint that the          complex interplay of vertical gene descent and LGT can be          deciphered to yield correct evolutionary histories          provided that sufficiently detailed studies are done          Approaches for detection of LGT events are either          phylogenetic or parametric Phylogenetic approaches          depend on congruence of phylogenetic trees Aside from          technical difficulties of inferring highquality trees          conflicts between trees under comparison are not          necessarily due to LGT but can arise from coincidental          loss of divergent paralogs in different widely spaced          lineages or from convergent evolution Parametric          approaches for detection of LGT include but are not          limited to the analysis of nucleotide composition          dinucleotide frequencies and codon usage biases Lawrence          and Ochman   used such parametric analysis to          identify a set of           Escherichia coli genes  of          the genome having putative origin by LGT and this has          stimulated much discussion High rates of both false          positives and false negatives have been asserted by          others    but this is tempered by presentation of          a rationale for why phylogenetic and different parametric          methods detect different gene subsets     A          consensus seems to be emerging that the most proficient          attempts to reconstruct evolutionary events will employ a          multifaceted approach that combines tree inference with          parametric analysis in a biological context             Lawrence and Ochman   provide a number of examples of          how the context of biological information can assist the          analysis and this approach is implemented herein          If each member of a linked group of genes is already          represented elsewhere in a genome their origin by LGT is          a distinct possibility as their transfer           en bloc as an operon unit would          have required only a single evolutionary event During an          ongoing analysis of the genomic distribution of          tryptophanpathway genes we observed two such cases          that is where one set of genes was phylogenetically          congruent in contrast to the incongruence of redundant          gene copies that were linked to one another We have          evaluated the evidence for the alternative possibilities          of LGT or ancient paralogy as reported here                          A block of Trppathway genes in Xylella          The phylogenetic incongruence of           trpR  a regulatory gene in           Xylella fastidiosa  led to          recognition of a lowGC gene block in           X fastidiosa The tryptophan          repressor TrpR is quite limited in its phylogenetic          distribution being consistently present only within the          enteric lineage as shown in the protein tree of Figure           Here TrpR of           Shewanella putrefaciens marks the          outlying sequence of the enteric lineage shown in gray          Outside the boundaries of the enteric lineage only           Coxiella burnetii X          fastidiosa and two chlamydial species are thus far          known to possess           trpR  The distribution of           trpR in the later three lineages is          phylogenetically incongruent because they are widely          spaced from one another on the S rRNA tree          In           Chlamydia trachomatis and           Chlamydophila psittaci trpR is          positioned near structural genes of tryptophan          biosynthesis but no indication of recent origin by LGT          of genes in this region was obtained             X fastidiosa trpR is separated by          three genes from two structural genes of tryptophan          biosynthesis These latter genes do not appear to be          essential for the primary task of tryptophan biosynthesis          as all seven genes of tryptophan biosynthesis are          represented elsewhere in the genome within one of two          operons Thus in           X fastidiosa the incongruous          phylogenetic position of           trpR  the redundancy of the           trp linked genes encoding           trpAa and           trpAb  and the distinct          phylogenetic incongruence of the latter gene pair all          supported a reasonable possibility of origin by LGT                          The tryptophan supraoperon of          AnabaenaNostoc          All cyanobacteria possess each of the seven          Trppathway genes at dispersed loci and individual trees          of proteins corresponding to these dispersed genes are          phylogenetically congruent Although this generalization          also applies to           AnabaenaNostoc  this latter          lineage is unique among cyanobacteria in its possession          of an additional set of Trppathway genes lacking only           trpC  that coexist within an          apparent operon As shown in Figure  both           Anabaena and           Nostoc exhibit the same relative          order of operonic           trp genes           trp Aa           trp Ab            trp D            trpEa            trpEb            trpB            trpAa and           trpAb are fused as indicated in          Figure with a filled bar and in the text by the bullet          in the notation           trpAa            trpAb  In           Anabaena qor encoding NADPH          quinone reductase has been inserted between           trpD and           trpEa  Another           qor paralog is present elsewhere in          the genome of           Anabaena            Nostoc also has two           qor paralogs but neither resides          within the tryptophan operon Other cyanobacteria lack           qor homologs altogether In           Nostoc tyrP encoding tyrosinase          has been inserted between           trpEa and           trpEb  All other cyanobacteria          including           Anabaena  lack           tyrP  The two           trp operons are less compact than          frequently observed elsewhere and relatively large          intergenic spacing exists especially in           N punctiforme  The only instance          of translational coupling is between           trpAa            trpAb and           trpD in           N punctiforme           The tryptophan operons appear to be nested within what          could be a larger unit of transcription that is          reminiscent of what has been called a supraoperon in           Bacillus subtilis   The genes          comprising the supraoperon of           B subtilis are           aroG            aroB            aroH            trpAaBDCEbEa            hisH           b            tyrA           p            aroF  A hierarchy of internal          promoters and terminators exists for differential control          of the           B subtilis supraoperon The           AnabaenaNostoc linkage group is          additionally reminiscent of the           B subtilis supraoperon in the          presence of           aroB and           tyrA  Although           B subtilis does not have           aroA           I represented in its supraoperon as          do           Anabaena and           Nostoc            aroA           I is the homology class of three          possible DAHP synthase homologs distributed in nature              that is utilized by           B subtilis  A number of          supraoperon gene insertions have occurred outside of the           trp operon as well These differ          for           Anabaena and           Nostoc as depicted in Figure            Anabaena has genes encoding           aph and a hypothetical gene open          reading frame ORF inserted between           aroB and the           trpAa            trpAb fusion The           aph gene encodes an uncharacterized          protein of the defined alkaline phosphatases          metalloenzyme superfamily group COG in the COGS          database Among cyanobacteria only           Nostoc has homologs of these two           Anabaena genes although they are          not inserted in the           Nostoc supraoperon           Nostoc has           frnE encoding a thioldisulfide          isomerase inserted between           tyrA           p and           aroB  Four subclasses of           tyrA are defined according to the          substrate specificities of the TyrA gene product           tyrA           p  specific for prephenate           tyrA           a  specific for arogenate           tyrA           c  accepts either prephenate or          arogenate and           tyrA           p  has broad specificity but          exhibits a distinct preference for prephenate Among all          cyanobacteria only           Nostoc possesses           frnE           In their genomes outside the supraoperon boundaries           Nostoc and           Anabaena possess a full complement          of genes for biosynthesis of tryptophan tyrosine and          phenylalanine Even these extrasupraoperonic genes of          the           AnabaenaNostoc lineage are          represented by multiple paralogs in many cases Figure           If one considers the singlecopy assemblage of          aromaticpathway genes present in the                     SynechocystisSynechococcusProchlorococcus lineage          as a fundamental complement of genes common to all          cyanobacteria the           AnabaenaNostoc genomic repertoire          contains substantial redundancy Thus           Anabaena has two additional          extraoperonic paralogs of           aroA           I and           trpD  In addition to          extraoperonic freestanding copies of           trpAa and           trpAb  a second fused gene            trpAa            trpAb  encoding the two domains          of anthranilate synthase is present in           Anabaena            Nostoc has two extraoperonic          copies of           aroA           I            aroB and           trpD  All cyanobacteria possess          AroA of the I class            aroA           I  While this is also true of the           AnabaenaNostoc lineage in fact          having multiple copies both           Anabaena and           Nostoc possess an additional gene          encoding AroA of the I class            aroA           I  All cyanobacteria possess a           tyrA gene of the          arogenatespecificity class            tyrA           a  but the           AnabaenaNostoc supraoperons also          possess a           tyrA gene deemed to be a          cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase   with a favored          specificity for prephenate            tyrA           p  CAB RAJ NK and          McNally A unpublished observation          Figure shows an evolutionary scenario using a Fitch          diagram   that depicts the suggested origin of           trpD paralogs via two gene          duplication events Dp and Dp that preceded the node          of speciation divergence Sp to           Nostoc Npu and           Anabaena Asp Consistent with the          latter conclusion Npu TrpD exhibits greater identity          with its ortholog Asp TrpD than with its paralogs Npu          TrpD and Npu TrpD Likewise Npu TrpD and Npu          TrpD exhibit greater identity with their Asp orthologs          than with their Npu paralogs          Since the basic singlecopy repertoire of dispersed          aromaticpathway genes shown in Figure for           Synechocystis Ssp is          representative of other cyanobacteria such as           Synechococcus Syn and           Prochlorococcus Pmu and is also          present at dispersed extraoperonic loci of           Anabaena and           Nostoc  an obvious possibility          would seem to be that the genes of the supraoperon          originated by LGT in a common ancestor of           Anabaena and           Nostoc  If so speciation was          followed by different speciesspecific geneinsertion          events Because the divergence of           Anabaena and           Nostoc was relatively recent          evidence for LGT by analysis of GC content codon usage          or dinucleotide frequency might be forthcoming A number          of distinctive properties of the supraoperon gene block          represent items of biological context as discussed by          Lawrence and Ochman   that potentially could provide          excellent tracking clues about the identity of the          putative donor in LGT These include the overall gene          organization of the           trp operon for which many          microbial patterns are known the extremely rare gene          order of           trpEa trpEb instead of the typical          order           trpEb trpEa the fusion of genes          encoding the alpha            trpAa  and beta            trpAb  subunits of anthranilate          synthase a fusion that exists in only a limited number          of other taxa and the presence of operonic genes          exhibiting distinctive homology subtypes            aroA           I and           tyrA           p                             Results and discussion                  Lateral gene transfer of a block of genes in          Xylella          The           trpR gene in           X fastidiosa was previously noted            to have anomalously low GC content relative to          that of the genome LowGC blocks of genes have been          attributed to LGT before for example           argF present in           E coli K but not in other          strains is bracketed with unidentified highGC           genes that together comprise a distinctive block of LGT          genes   The flanking genes of           trpR were accordingly analyzed for          GC content Figure shows that           trpR in           X fastidiosa is at one end of a          block of seven genes all of which have a distinctively          low GC content highlighted in green compared to the          flanking genes highlighted in yellow          If the block of lowGC genes in           Xylella really reflects an alien          origin differences in dinucleotide frequencies might be          expected as such context biases differ from organism to          organism A  dinucleotide bias third nucleotide          position in a codon analysis algorithm followed by the          first nucleotide position in the succeeding codon was          utilized as it is the dinucleotide that is least          restricted by aminoacid preference and codon usage in          individual genes   The  dinucleotide frequencies          were calculated for the entire block of lowGC genes as          well as for the immediately flanking genes These results          presented in Figure with a set of four selected          dinucleotides shows that dinucleotides frequencies of the          flanking genes were within a variance of about  from          genomic frequencies whereas the lowGC block of genes          exhibited recognizably greater variances from the genomic          dinucleotides frequencies of           X fastidiosa           The covariation of  dinucleotide frequencies of          genes in the lowGC gene block of           Xylella with the corresponding          genomic frequencies was also evaluated using the Spearman          rank correlation coefficient Table illustrates the data          used to compare the           Xylella trpR gene and the           Xylella genome A pvalue of           indicated that the  dinucleotide frequencies of           trpR from           Xylella did not exhibit significant          covariation with the frequencies of the           Xylella genome In contrast the           dinucleotide frequencies of           trpR from           Chlamydia trachomatis did exhibit          significant covariation with the frequencies          characteristic of the           C trachomatis genome            p value   These analyses          are consistent with occurrence of recent LGT in           X fastidiosa                           What is the origin of the LGT gene block          Gene organization is subject to constant change For          precisely this reason the overall gene organization          within the lowGC gene block might implicate a donor          organism because the LGT event is inferred to be recent          Because the enteric lineage is a reasonable source of the          LGT gene block it is pertinent that the gene          organization around           trpR is highly conserved in the          enteric lineage Without exception           trpR in the enteric lineage is          preceded upstream by a gene encoding soluble lytic murein          transglycosylase            slt            hemK is usually positioned directly          downstream except for the           Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitansH          influenzaePasteurella multocida grouping where the          downstream gene encodes a monofunctional biosynthetic          peptidoglycan transglycosylase            mtgA  No genomes of the enteric          lineage were found to possess           trpR in a context of flanking genes          that resembled the           X fastidiosa gene          organization          The LGTblock of           Xylella genes conceivably could          have originated from a donor similar to a common ancestor          of the chlamydiae before the massive gene reduction          associated with the chlamydial lifestyle This would be          consistent with the low GC content of both the chlamydial          genome and the LGTblock of genes as well as with the          observation that chlamydiae and           Xylella are the only two known taxa          where           trpR is positioned near structural          genes of the tryptophan pathway Direct comparison of          chlamydial           trpAa and           trpAb genes with those of the           Xylella operon is not possible          because all chlamydial genomes thus far mapped lack           trpAa and           trpAb   In this context          sequencing of genomes from closely related freeliving          relatives of the chlamydiae could be informative The          currently available chlamydial genomes also lack other          genes of the lowGC block                    C burnetii was also considered as          a possible source of the lowGC gene block in           X fastidiosa because it possesses           trpR  This potential LGT event          seems ruled out because           trpR is not near any structural          genes encoding TrpAa and TrpAb in           C burnetti C burnetii TrpAa and          TrpAb are not close to the corresponding           X fastidiosa enzymes on          phylogenetic trees and           C burnetii lacks the remaining          genes in the lowGC gene block of           Xfastidiosa           If LGT accounts for the lowGC gene block in           X fastidiosa  how recent was this          event Presumably it was sufficiently recent that          significant amelioration to the genomic GC content has          not yet occurred The closest sequenced genome to           Xylella is           Xanthomonas  Genomes representing          two species of the latter genus have been sequenced and          both lack the lowGC gene block Therefore the putative          LGT event occurred some time after lineage divergence of           Xylella and           Xanthomonas  On the other hand          LGT presumably has predated speciation in the           Xylella genus as all three strains          of           Xylella in the National Center for          Biotechnology Information NCBI database possess the          lowGC gene block The T score of Hooper and Berg            measures the covariance of  dinucleotide signatures          and is designed to recognize very recent imports of alien          genes by LGT T scores calculated for the lowGC gene          block of           X fastidiosa were not above the          required threshold for very recent gene imports                          What is the function of the lowGC block of genes          in Xyella          Within the lowGC block           trpR is separated by four ORFs from          genes encoding the two subunits of anthranilate synthase                     trpAa and           trpAb  These probably do not          function for general tryptophan biosynthesis since          paralogs of these genes which exhibit a phylogenetically          congruent context of gene organization exist elsewhere          in the genome Figure  The latter genes are located          within either of two separate operon clusters Figure           with the GC content characteristic of           X fastidiosa  The GCcontent          values for the latter genes           trpAa trpAb trpB trpC trpD          trpEa  and           trpEb are                and  respectively Furthermore Figure shows          that the organization of the full complement of           trp pathway genes into two operons          in           X fastidiosa is similar or          identical to that of some of its nearest neighbors on the          S rRNA tree although the           Xylella operons exhibit atypically          large intergenic spacings None of these neighbors          possesses the lowGC block of           Xylella genes illustrated in Figure           Hence the two operons shown in Figure can be          inferred to be responsible for primary tryptophan          biosynthesis throughout this clade          Genes encoding the two anthranilate synthase subunits                     trpAa and           trpAb  and arylCoA ligase            acl  surely belong to an operon          as translational coupling is evident from the overlap of          start and stop codons Figure  Acl exhibits strong          similarity to coenzyme F synthetase of methanogenic          archaea as well as to phenylacetateCoA ligase of           E coli  As           Xylella does not appear to make the          F cofactor that is the substrate of F synthetase          the function of Acl is likely to be closer to          phenylacetateCoA ligase The aromatic ring is highly          stable and CoA thioesterification can provide chemical          activation allowing cleavage of the aromatic ring as          exemplified by catabolism of benzoate hydroxybenzoate          and anthranilate   Because           acl is tightly organized with           trpAa and           trpAb  it seems feasible that          anthranilate might be the substrate of           acl  An anthranilateCoA ligase          has been described recently in           Azoarcus evansii by Schuhle           et al    The           Xylella Acl exhibited greater          identity with phenylacetateCoA ligase of           E coli than with anthranilateCoA          ligase of           A evansii  but a given substrate          specificity within homology groups often can be          associated with different subgroupings             If anthranilate is indeed the substrate of Acl in           Xylella  it would be a futile          cycle if anthranilate were formed biosynthetically only          to be subsequently catabolized Therefore it seems more          likely that the activation of anthranilate could be a          step in the formation of a siderophore or antibiotic          compound that is assembled by a nonribosomal peptide          synthetase mechanism see Quadri           et al    and references          therein for numerous examples Pyochelin from           Pseudomonas aeruginosa exemplifies          an iron siderophore whose peptidebased synthesis depends          on CoAactivated salicylate closely related to          anthranilate as a starter unit            While it appears likely that           trpR  arylCoA ligase           trpAa and           trpAb belong to a common functional          unit the possible roles of the remaining three genes          downstream of           acl are problematic at the present          time                          The AnabaenaNostocgene blocks          The large gene blocks in           Anabaena and           Nostoc that begin with           aroA           I and end with           tyrAr           p exhibited GC ratios that were          similar to that of the host genome Table  This is not          necessarily inconsistent with their possible origin by          LGT because the GC ratio of a putative donor genome could          have been coincidentally similar to that of           Anabaena and           Nostoc           Accordingly the  dinucleotide frequencies of the           aroA           I            tyrA           c gene block and the immediately          flanking genes were analyzed but these dinucleotide          frequencies also did not suggest LGT Figure shows that          dinucleotide frequencies did not deviate more than           from the genomic frequencies across the           aroA           I            tyrA           c gene block This contrasts with the          distinctly greater deviation of  dinucleotide          frequencies within the lowGC gene block of           Xylella  which is shown on the          same scale as the           Anabaena data          Codon usage was analyzed throughout the gene block and          also failed to implicate LGT Figure exemplifies this          with a comparison of the pair of TrpAa domains in           Anabaena  one encoded from within          the gene block and the other outside As           Xylella also possesses a TrpAa          pair one encoded from within the lowGC gene block and          the other outside the analyses of these are also          included in Figure as a kind of positive control In           Anabaena two bars on the right of          each panel the codon usage for leucine serine          arginine glycine valine and proline was very similar          for the TrpAa domain of TrpAaTrpAb in the           aroA           I            tyrA           p gene block and for the standalone          TrpAa protein This contrasts with the results obtained          for the two           Xylella TrpAa proteins one in the          lowGC gene block on the far left and the other second          bar in each panel encoded by the gene in the           trpAaAbBD operon Figure  Thus          in contrast to the           Anabaena TrpAa pair the           Xylella TrpAaAb pair exhibited          distinctly different codon usage Although this result is          certainly consistent with an explanation of LGT in           Xylella  one cannot be certain          that the different functional roles of TrpAa domains          might be associated with differing intragenomic patterns          of codon usage that are not yet well characterized                                     Analysis of protein trees          We evaluated whether the closest BLAST hits using as          queries the aminoacid sequences corresponding to the          operonic genes of           Anabaena or           Nostoc  would be with other          cyanobacteria and therefore consistent with origin by          gene duplication or with another taxon grouping          consistent with LGT In either case one would expect          that the sequences encoded by the operonic genes of           Anabaena would be the best matches          for the operonic genes of           Nostoc  as was indeed the case          For all of the operonic           AnabaenaNostoc Trppathway          proteins used as queries homolog sequences from other          cyanobacteria            Synechocystis Synechococcus          Prochlorococcus  were the remaining top hits          returned in the BLAST queue As BLAST hits must be          considered imperfect indicators of nearestneighbor          homologs   the conclusion that the operonic           trp pathway genes are of          cyanobacterial lineage origin was confirmed more          rigorously by examination of extensive trees available          upon request constructed for each           trp protein of           Anabaena and           Nostoc  For the Trppathway          proteins all the cyanobacterial proteins clustered          together regardless of whether they were           Anabaena or           Nostoc paralogs or whether they          were the singly represented proteins of           Synechocystis Synechococcus  or           Prochlorococcus  The same result          was obtained for AroA           I protein trees All the redundant          genes exhibited identity relationships that suggested          their origin by one or more geneduplication events in          the common ancestor of           Anabaena and           Nostoc  that is exactly as          diagrammed in Figure           A different result was obtained for genes encoding          AroB and TyrA AroB sequences in nature are rather          divergent All of the cyanobacterial AroB proteins form a          compact cluster in the AroB tree including the          nonoperonic           AnabaenaNostoc aroB genes except          for those encoded by the           Anabaena Nostoc supraoperons The          supraoperonic AroB proteins occupy a tree position that          is not particularly close to other AroB proteins the          closest matches being on the order of  identity          with some enteric bacteria A similar situation applies          to TyrA           p  All cyanobacteria possess the          arogenate dehydrogenase specificity class denoted TyrA           a  of the TyrA superfamily The          additional TyrA           p present only in           Anabaena and           Nostoc and located as the          carboxyterminal gene of the supraoperon exhibits          identities of  with the TyrA           p proteins of some enteric bacteria          These results for supraoperonic           aroB and           tyrA           p could be consistent with LGT but          with no clear donor candidates available On the other          hand origin as ancient paralogs is also a          possibility                          The trpAa trpAbfusion          A particularly fortuitous gene that could favor or          disfavor the hypothesis of LGT of the           aroA           I            tyrA           p gene block in           AnabaenaNostoc is           trpAa            trpAb  a fusion corresponding to          two genes that are usually separate freestanding As          only a limited number of           trpAa            trpAb fusions are known possible          LGT donors can be evaluated Organisms known to possess          the           trpAa            trpAb fusion are listed at the top          of Table  Another small group of           trpAa            trpAb fusions are known which are          dedicated to phenazine biosynthesis and which form a          distinct cluster These are denoted           trpAa            trpAbphz in Table  Thus far the                    trpAa            trpAbphz  fusions are limited to          species of           Pseudomonas and           Streptomyces pabAa and           pabAb are homologs of           trpAa and           trpAb  and the distribution of          fusions involving these domains are also listed in Table          to give a general sense of the frequencies of such gene          fusions A variety of data GX and RAJ unpublished          observation indicates that equivalent fusions often          arise independently of one another in widely spaced          lineages          Figure shows a segment of the S rRNA tree that          contains all of the           trpAa            trpAb fusions which are known so          far Cyanobacteria other than           AnabaenaNostoc lack the fusion as          do all nearby lineages The fusion is present in the          cluster that includes           Rhodopseudomonas palustris Rhizobium          loti Brucella melitensis Agrobacterium          tumefaciens and           Sinorhizobium meliloti            A tumefaciens  which is not shown          in Figure  is virtually identical to           S meliloti  Additional          phylogenetically spaced fusions are present in           Thermomonospora fusca Azospirillum          brasilense  and           Legionella pneumophila  Other          fusions that involve           trpAa or           trpAb homologs also occur in          nature as shown in Table  and a degree of care is          needed to avoid confusion between them          A phylogenetic tree consisting of all freestanding          TrpAa and TrpAb proteins was constructed together with          the corresponding two domains of the TrpAaTrpAb fusions          available upon request Surprisingly each of the           fusion domains clustered tightly on the TrpAa and TrpAb          trees to the exclusion of the freestanding TrpAa and          TrpAb domains This is consistent with a single ancestral          fusion event but requires the assumption of multiple LGT          events However it is surprising that no freestanding          domains that is close homologs of the original fusion          partners cluster with either of the two sets of           fusion domains This might suggest an alternative to LGT          namely that there has been extreme sequence convergence          because of strong selection for appropriate residues          mediating domaindomain interactions If so it is          possible that           trpAa            trpAb fusions occurred as a number          of independent events followed by strong          convergence          Figure shows the individual genomic organization of          trppathway genes in the S rRNA tree sector that is          relevant to the           trpAa            trpAb fusion The           AnabaenaNostoc lineage is unique          in having           trpAa            trpAb linked to other           trp pathway genes and is further          unique in having an additional set of freestanding genes          encoding TrpAa and TrpAb Although generally uncommon          complete dispersal of Trppathway genes is characteristic          of the nonfilamentous cyanobacteria           Aquifex aeolicus and           Chlorobium tepidum  The ancestral          state of           trp gene organization has been          asserted GX CB NK and RJ unpublished work to          be           trpAaAbBDCEbEa  an operon          organization seen in contemporary           Cytophaga hutchinsonii Desulfovibrio          vulgaris and           Coxiella burnetii Figure           Dynamic gene reorganization events that involve gene          insertions gene scrambling gene duplications and gene          dispersal are apparent from inspection of Figure           It is expected that LGT would most easily be          recognized if it occurred relatively recently before          passage of sufficient time for amelioration of alien          characteristics to those of the host genome for example          GC content In the case of each of the known           trpAa            trpAb gene fusions the absence of          the gene fusion in a closely related genome implies that          the genefusion event or the LGT event occurred          recently that is in the one lineage following the time          of its separation from the other by speciation Thus the          acquisition of           trpAa            trpAb by           Thermomonospora fusca must have          occurred by fusion or by LGT relatively recently that          is after the speciation event that generated the           Streptomyces lineage see Figure           In each of the remaining cases of           trpAa            trpAb fusion a relatively near          time of fusion shown in Figure origin can be identified          These are defined by points of speciation divergence          between           AnabaenaNostoc and other          cyanobacteria between the                     RhodopseudomonasSinorhizobium cluster fusion and           Caulobacter no fusion between           Azospirillum brasilense fusion          and           Magnetospirillum          magnetotacticum no fusion and between           Legionella pneumophila fusion and                    Coxiella burnetii no fusion          If any of the           trpAa            trpAb fusions other than the           NostocAnabaena pair have a common          origin similar flanking regions of gene organization          might be expected since all of the fusions are of          relatively recent origin On this criterion only           R loti B melitensis A          tumefaciens and           S meliloti exhibited similarities          of flankinggene organization and this is          phylogenetically congruent These observations imply that          within the span of phylogeny shown in Figure  the           trpAa            trpAb fusion may have occurred          independently as many as seven times                          Interdomain linker regions          In fusion proteins an interdomain linker region of          critical length and mobility is important to facilitate          specific domaindomain interactions Fusions of          independent origin might be expected to exhibit a variety          of linker regions Particular constraints undoubtedly          limit this variety and such constraints might be more          stringent for some domain combinations than others In          the case of particularly stringent constraints similar          linker regions would not necessarily demonstrate a common          origin Figure shows an alignment of the          carboxyterminal region of the TrpAa domain the linker          region and the aminoterminal region of the TrpAb domain          for all of the fusion proteins depicted in Figure as          well as that from           A tumefaciens           Only the two operonic fusion proteins from           Anabaena and           Nostoc and the four rhizobial          fusion proteins Mlo Bme Rme and Atu exhibit linker          regions of identical length and obvious similarity The          paralog TrpAaTrpAb protein of           Anabaena sp Asp seems to have a          distinctly different linker and it maybe that the two          fusions in           Anabaena arose as two independent          events The partial sequences shown in Figure are          spaced to indicate the seven independent events of gene          fusion that are suggested                          Function of the AnabaenaNostocgene blocks          The gene blocks shown in Figure encode the entire          tryptophan pathway except for           trpC  as well as the first two          enzymes of the common aromatic pathway and the key          enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis Multiple enzymes          catalyzing the same reaction have been described in          developmental systems where differential regulation of          isoenzymes are deployed in different temporal and spatial          contexts Filamentous cyanobacteria such as           Anabaena and           Nostoc  subscribe to a          developmental program of heterocyst formation that is          widely considered the primitive state and that correlates          with their exceedingly large genomes Unicellular          cyanobacteria such as           Synechocystis Synechococcus and           Prochlorococcus have far smaller          genomes and lack the ability to fix nitrogen heterocyst          formation It therefore seems to be a distinct          possibility that the gene blocks diagrammed in Figure          as well as additional gene duplicates are specifically          involved in specialized capabilities of           NostocAnabaena that do not exist          in other cyanobacteria In terms of the evolutionary          scenario the           AnabaenaNostoc lineage may reflect          the ancestral state and modern unicellular cyanobacteria          may be derived genomes that are smaller and more          streamlined reductive evolution                            Conclusions                  Operon displacement          Alien genes that may be subject to possible LGT can          generally expect a hostile reception in that they lack a          history of functional integration with the resident          genome Genes that offer immediate selective advantages          for example antibiotic resistance are likely to          persist The acquisition of a completely new functional          capability will often require an entire suite of novel          genes and such recruitment is certainly easier to          envision if all of the genes arrive           en bloc that is as an operon          Once a primary biosynthetic pathway such as that          responsible for tryptophan formation has been          established and integrated with the individualistic          metabolic circuitry of a given organism one does not          expect facile displacement of resident genes This should          apply even if the incoming genes all coexist as an          operon We have found only two examples of LGT of          wholeTrp operons that of           trpAaAbBD            CEbEa from the enteric lineage to          coryneform bacteria and to           Helicobacter  as discussed          earlier                          Has there been separate lateral gene transfer of          individual genes          According to the foregoing rationale isolated genes          that participate in multistep processes would not          generally be expected to have much success in LGT In          some cases analog genes encode enzymes that catalyze the          same reaction in a multistep pathway and one analog          gene might conceivably displace another Lack of enough          information about genomic representation of such analog          genes can lead to incorrect inferences of LGT For          example the initial discovery of planttype AroA           II in bacteria led to the assumption          of LGT from plant to bacterium Elucidation of the fuller          genomic representation of           aroA                       II              and refs therein demonstrated the origin of           aroA                       II            in Bacteria and plants probably have received           aroA                       II            from the Bacteria via endosymbiosis A similar          outcome seems quite possible with respect to the          eukaryotic fructosebisphosphate aldolase in           Xylella species Phylogenetic          incongruities that involve such analogs can pose great          difficulties in distinguishing LGT from vertical          progressions of differential analog losses in different          lineages                          Specialized Trpgenes not required for primary          biosynthesis          In this article we focus on a number of cases where at          least several           trp genes are linked thus          providing analytical advantages offered by the analysis          of more than one gene These genes are also redundant and          phylogenetically incongruent in contrast to coexisting          homolog genes that are part of a full phylogenetically          congruent set Both of the latter are consistent with          origin by LGT but unrecognized ancient paralogy is also          possible In the first case the homologs coexisting in          one organism are xenologs whereas in the latter case          they are paralogs A relatively simple example is the           trpAatrpAb pair originally denoted                    phnAphnB in           Pseudomonas aeruginosa   This          comprises an anthranilate synthase that is not strictly          required for primary tryptophan biosynthesis and that is          uniquely expressed during stationaryphase physiology            Why the generation of anthranilate under these          conditions would be of value is unknown but phylogenetic          trees clearly show           phnAphnB to be xenologs          originating from the enteric lineage via LGT GX and          RAJ unpublished data In this case genes that          function for primary biosynthesis in the donor genome did          not displace the corresponding genes in the recipient          genome but have instead been recruited to a specialized          function In           Streptomyces coelicolor          trpAatrpAbtrpBtrpDaroA           II are contained within a large          cluster dedicated to antibiotic synthesis            Calciumdependent antibiotic CDC contains tryptophan          and presumably the feedbackresistant variety of enzyme          encoded by           aroA           II ensures enhanced precursor flow to          tryptophan during antibiotic production Detailed studies          have not yet been done to see whether the CDC gene          cluster originated via LGT or reflects ancient          paralogy          In this article we have discussed at length the           Xylella and cyanobacterial gene          blocks that seem likely to have specialized functional          roles other than primary biosynthesis The           Xylella genes are associated with          other genes that presumably dictate a fate for          anthranilate other than as a primary precursor of          tryptophan We suspect that selective advantages          conferred by this specialized operon accommodated          successful LGT to           Xylella  The           AnabaenaNostoc supraoperon is          reminiscent of the           S coelicolor system in the          inclusion of AroA           I  which might enhance precursor          flow to chorismate Although the           AnabaenaNostoc operon only lacks           trpC  its features of gene fusion          and gene organization are novel It might perhaps have an          unknown physiological function related to the complex          developmental programs unique to heterocystous          cyanobacteria We conclude that in this case the operonic                    trp genes are ancient paralogs of a          dispersed set of           trp genes engaged in primary          biosynthesis          Against a backdrop where organisms generally possess          highly efficient and integrated pathways of tryptophan          biosynthesis displacement of resident genes by LGT of          the corresponding genes is relatively infrequent Aside          from the broadly distributed primary pathway highly          specialized pathways are known that utilize some or all          tryptophanpathway enzymes and these pathways can          originate by recruitment of paralog genes derived from          the primarypathway genes   The genes of such          specialized operons may diverge considerably to meet the          demands of a novel functional role In a contemporary          organism this might have the status of unrecognized or          recognized paralogy as we suggest for the           AnabaenaNostoc gene block          However such an operon module also has strong potential          for xenologous transfer because of its specialized          functional potential          The tryptophan pathway exemplifies the situation where          paralogs can be engaged in primary aminoacid          biosynthesis widespread or in a variety of specialized          pathways narrowly distributed Aside from the extent to          which the specialized pathways may be individually          intriguing and important this study illustrates that          casebycase analysis can distinguish paralogs or          xenologs from their homologs engaged in primary          biosynthesis This conclusion is encouraging as it shows          that both vertical and horizontal events of gene transfer          can be deduced to track evolutionary history                            Materials and methods                  Dinucleotide frequencies          The CODONW program   was used to calculate           dinucleotide frequencies third base of a given codon          followed by the first base of the next codon For          wholegenome calculations genome nucleotide sequences          ffn file were obtained from GenBank   Perl          scripts were used to eliminate the defline and assemble          all genomic ORFs together for CODONW calculation The          length from UNIX wc command divided by  was used to          validate the absence of frameshift errors Pairwise          covariation of  dinucleotide frequencies was assessed          by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient   a          nonparametric rank statistic for testing monotonic          relationships T values were kindly provided by Hooper                                     Codon usage          Codon usage for individual genes was computed with the          CDONTREE program   Codonusage values for whole          genomes were obtained from the Codon Usage Database                                      Phylogenetic trees          S rRNA subtrees were derived from the Ribosomal          Database site    Unrooted phylogenetic protein          trees were derived by input of the indicated homolog          aminoacid sequences into the ClustalW program Version             Manual alignment adjustments were made as          needed with the assistance of the BioEdit multiple          alignment tool of Hall   The refined multiple          alignment was used as input for generation of a          phylogenetic tree using the program package PHYLIP            The neighborjoining and Fitch programs   were used          to obtain distancebased trees The distance matrix was          obtained using Protdist with a Dayhoff Pam matrix The          Seqboot and Consense programs were then used to assess          the statistical strength of the tree using bootstrap          resampling Neighborjoining and Fitch trees yielded          similar clusters and arrangement of taxa within them          Bootstrap values indicate the number of times a node was          supported in  resampling replications                          Identification of linker regions          Fusion proteins were aligned ClustalW with one          another and with the assemblage of freestanding proteins          corresponding to the aminoterminal and the          carboxyterminal domains of the fusion proteins The          boundaries of each domain were defined by the last highly          conserved residues of the aminoterminal domain and the          early highly conserved residues of the carboxyterminal          domain The Conserved Domain Database was useful as a          reference guide                             Comparative genome
