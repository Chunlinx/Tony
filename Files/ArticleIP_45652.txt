                                  Naomi Wolf                           For more on NaomiWolf see the Nov                          Naomi Wolf begins The Beauty Myth  her treatise on how the beauty industry thwarts female progress with a bittersalvo against image consultants As proof that womens employers value looksover capabilities she cites the thengrowing ranks of consultants hired bywomen to polish their professional appeal Wolf ends the book with a call toreject the insistence that a womans appearance is her speech and politicalmanipulation based on looks            Eight years later Wolf has become an imageconsultant herself As Time reported earlier this week Vice PresidentAl Gore paid Wolf thousands of dollars a month for advice on presentation fromthe tones of his speeches to the color tones of his wardrobe The WashingtonPost relayed that Wolf has long contended that earth tones are morereassuring to audiences  and that she is the person behind Gores recentwardrobe change            Wolfs nonsartorialadvice to Goreand to President Clinton before him as an unpaid adviseriseven stranger She coached each to emphasize his manly strengths relying onhoary tired gender stereotypes She reportedly told Gore that he is the betamale who must fight Clintons alpha male for dominance And as an adviser tothe Clinton White House she informed the president that the nation wassearching for a goodfather role model to build a house for the country Iwill not let anyone or anything touch the bedrock Wolf wrote in one memo forhim I will DEFENDPROTECT the foundation This came only three years afterthe publication of her book Fire With Fire  in which she savagedRepublican spin doctors for positioning George Bush as the reassuringarchpatriarch            Bill Clinton and Al Gore are not her only charges Wolf isnow a fulltime coach earlier this year she and five other remarkable womenfounded the Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership devoted to trainingtwentysomething women to assume positions of power and influence But theinstitutes programs dont cover political economic or legal issues Insteadthe short retreats teach participants how to be financially literate how tospeak and present how to write a business plan fundraise and run forelective office how to write a book or magazine article proposal how tomentor and be mentored how to start a community organization and how to be aphilanthropist            How did Wolf start out asBetty Friedan and end up as Dick Morris The road wasnt as long or twisted asit might seem In fact the advice she dispensed to Al Goresafe polltestedideas mixed in with a few fancifully nutty onesis remarkably similar to theinstructions shes been giving to women for years For Wolf has never been awonk or an ideologue While shes dabbled in journalism and teaching she isntreally a reporter or an academic either She began her career by being asuccessa Rhodes scholar with a splashy bookand has been tutoring others inhow to succeed ever since Wolf is a master cheerleader and she acts like oneupbeat entertaining sweetly sexy sharply aware of image and endlesslytrilling about victory            Wolfs three books are breathless hyperbolic tracts onWhat Holds Women Back The Beauty Myth  written while Wolf was atOxford is an angry protest at how the cosmetics plastic surgery and magazineindustries have sabotaged feminism Wolf holds the beauty biz accountableatleast in partfor the pay gap female poverty censorship in the free pressfear of aging sexual unhappiness rape and eating disorders But she doesntsuggest abandoning the visuals she wants them to be more attainable anduplifting Our movement forward as individual women as women together depend now on what we decide to see when we look in the mirror she writes Nowonder she has spent so much time thinking about what color Al Gores suitsshould be            In Fire WithFire  as Wolf settles into her persona as peptalker she tells womenessentially the same thing she told Gore Drop the victimloser image stopplaying second fiddle and use romantic archetypes to visualize the path toglory To imagine and enjoy winning  had long been alien to femaleconsciousness she writes Because history moves in response to narrativesdream images heroes heroines and myths women need to think of themselvesas latterday incarnations of Diana avenger of insult Sheba a responsiblepolitically influential sovereign and Nike the feminine spirit of victoryIn other words as alpha females            Even before Wolf joined Clintons team she was coachingfeminists on how to save the womens movement through Morrisliketriangulation In Fire With Fire  she argues for editing the stridencyout of feminism and emerging with a vaguely uplifting centrist message IfClinton is a New Democrat she is a New Feminist Many US women dont thinkfeminism addresses their concerns or dont like images of it that they seeshe announces In order to accommodate them the womens movement shoulddeemphasize specific political causesabortion rape homosexualrightsbecause theyre issues that may or may not include some womenrather than a theory of selfworth that applies to every womans life Wolfwants to expand the size of the feminist tent and she wants to do so byredefining its ideology as the simple pursuit of success for women            Wolf first began advisingClinton when her husband David Shipley worked as a White House speechwriterWhen the presidents woman troubles started Wolf hit the spin circuit TheLewinsky affair was a tricky issue for most liberal feminists who were caughtbetween protesting sexual harassment and supporting the president they hadelected Wolf did both by turning the issue into an object lesson on womensprofessional success The people who should be looking into these allegationsis not a partisan prosecutor but the EEOC she opined on the talkshowcircuit What is clear is that when there is a situation where a worker isadvanced as allegedly Lewinsky was with special help getting jobs it goes toa sex discrimination situation in the workplacewere the other interns and theother women the women at Revlon the women at UN who may have been at thecopy machine nights and weekends trying to raise their kids and move up tothat job that was allegedly offered to Ms Lewinsky            Wolf sees the telling of her own personal experiences as atriumph for all women Her third book Promiscuities  is a memoir inwhich she singlehandedly retrieves the secret struggle for womanhood bynarrating her own sexual coming of age By telling my story and asking otherwomen to tell theirs I wanted to elucidate the emotional truths that emergefrom a particular generations erotic memory she explains She bills herstories as tough to tell In a Tikkun magazine piece on her coming outas a spiritual person she testifies that its taken me nine years to build upenough credibility in the analyticlinear world that I can now speak and havesome expectation of being heard to a certain degree Its been a long haul andvery much a gendered haul This from a woman whose first book was a bestseller published in  countries            Indeed Wolf often expounds on the traumaand thenecessityof expressing herself in public In all three of her books Wolfdemands the need for positive role models in the mediaof which naturallyshe is one Its a brilliantly selfjustifying line of reasoning I am ontelevision because I am a role model and I am a role model because I am ontelevision And a great marketing strategy Buy my books because theyre goodfor your daughter            Its no wonder that Wolf has become a wellpaidpolitical consultant Who better to help a candidate extract weighty lessonsfrom his personal history to teach him to tell voters that their own successesdepend on his own At last it seems Wolf has found a forum where the personalreally is as political as she thinks it is
