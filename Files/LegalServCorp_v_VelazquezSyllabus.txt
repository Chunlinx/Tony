SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESSyllabusLEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ ET ALCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECONDCIRCUITNo  Argued October   Decided February The Legal Services Corporation Act authorizes petitioner LegalServices Corporation LSC to distribute funds appropriated byCongress to local grantee organizations providing free legalassistance to indigent clients in inter alia welfare benefitsclaims In every annual appropriations Act since  Congress hasprohibited LSC funding of any organization that represented clientsin an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare lawGrantees cannot continue representation in a welfare matter evenwhere a constitutional or statutory validity challenge becomesapparent after representation is well under way Respondentslawyers employed by LSC grantees together with others filed suitto declare inter alia the restriction invalid The District Courtdenied them a preliminary injunction but the Second Circuitinvalidated the restriction finding it impermissible viewpointdiscrimination that violated the First AmendmentHeld The funding restriction violates the First Amendment Ppa LSC and the Government also a petitioner claim that Rustv Sullivan  U S  in which this Court upheld arestriction prohibiting doctors employed by federally funded familyplanning clinics from discussing abortion with their patientssupports the restriction here However the Court has sinceexplained that the Rust counseling activities amounted togovernmental speech sustaining view Together with No  United States v Velazquez et alalso on certiorari to the same courtLEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZSyllabuspointbased funding decisions in instances in which thegovernment is itself the speaker see Board of Regents of Univ ofWis System v Southworth  U S    or instanceslike Rust in which the government uses private speakers totransmit information pertaining to its own program Rosenberger vRector and Visitors of Univ of Va  U S   Althoughthe government has the latitude to ensure that its own message isbeing delivered neither that latitude nor its rationale applies tosubsidies for private speech in every instance Like theRosenberger program the LSC program was designed to facilitateprivate speech not to promote a governmental message An LSCattorney speaks on behalf of a private indigent client in awelfare benefits claim while the Governments message is deliveredby the attorney defending the benefits decision The attorneysadvice to the client and advocacy to the courts cannot beclassified as governmental speech even under a generousunderstanding of that concept In this vital respect this suit isdistinguishable from Rust Pp b The private nature of the instant speech and the extent ofLSCs regulation of private expression are indicated further bythe circumstance that the Government seeks to control an existingmedium of expression in ways which distort its usual functioningCases involving a limited forum though not controlling provideinstruction for evaluating restrictions in governmental subsidiesHere the program presumes that private nongovernmental speech isnecessary and a substantial restriction is placed upon thatspeech By providing subsidies to LSC the Government seeks tofacilitate suits for benefits by using the State and FederalJudiciaries and the independent bar on which they depend for theproper performance of their duties and responsibilitiesRestricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and inpresenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legalsystem by altering the attorneys traditional role in much the sameway broadcast systems or student publication networks were changedin the limited forum cases of Arkansas Ed Television Commn vForbes  U S  and Rosenberger v Rector and Visitors ofUniv of Va supra The Government may not design a subsidy toeffect such a serious and fundamental restriction on the advocacyof attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary An informedindependent judiciary presumes an informed independent barHowever the instant restriction prevents LSC attorneys fromadvising the courts of serious statutory validity questions Italso threatens severe impairment of the judicial function bysifting out cases presenting constitutional challenges in order toinsulate the Governments laws from judicial inquiry The result ofthis restriction would be two tiers of cases There would belingering doubtCite as  U S  Syllabuswhether an LSC attorneys truncated representation had resultedin complete analysis of the case full advice to the client andproper presentation to the court and the courts and the publicwould come to question the adequacy and fairness of professionalrepresentations when the attorney avoided all reference tostatutory validity and constitutional authority questions A schemeso inconsistent with accepted separationofpowers principles is aninsufficient basis to sustain or uphold the restriction on speechPp cThat LSC attorneys can withdraw does not make therestrictionharmless for the statute is an attempt to draw linesaround the LSC program to exclude from litigation arguments andtheories Congress finds unacceptable but which by their nature arewithin the courts province to consider The restriction is evenmore problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws theindigent client is unlikely to find other counsel There may be noalternative source of vital information on the clientsconstitutional or statutory rights in stark contrast to Rustwhere a patient could receive both governmentally subsidizedcounseling and consultation with independent or affiliateorganizations Finally notwithstanding Congress purpose toconfine and limit its program the restriction insulates currentwelfare laws from constitutional scrutiny and certain other legalchallenges a condition implicating central First Amendmentconcerns There can be little doubt that the LSC Act fundsconstitutionally protected expression and there is no programmaticmessage of the kind recognized in Rust and which sufficed there toallow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for itslegitimate objectives Pp dThe Court of Appeals concluded that the fundingrestriction could be severed from the statute leaving theremaining portions operative Because that determination was notcontested here the Court in the exercise of its discretion andprudential judgment declines to address it Pp  F d  affirmedKENNEDY J delivered the opinion of the Court in whichSTEVENS SOUTER
