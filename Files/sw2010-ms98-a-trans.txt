        this is Archie   hi Archie im Sharon   have you seen Dancing with Wolf   yeah ive seen that thats uh that was a really good movie probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and uh i thought the story was pretty good too i think i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it   have you ever lived in that part of the country   no i havent   have you ever visited it   um ive visited the Wyoming area im not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed   i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota   could be i  i havent been to South Dakota have have you been up to that   well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh   oh okay terrain   yeah is is fairly familiar the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics apparently its gonna win everything   really   uh and i had been told you know you wouldnt notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of   thats true i agree with that um i i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think its been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldnt go anywhere that it was just gonna be a dud so it it has surprised everybody   well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i i i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me its that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story   uhhuh right   and and and i guess thats what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour yeah   did you have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy   no ive heard ive heard thats really great though   you you have to go see that one and how about Silence of the Lambs go   no you must really keep up   i do i go every weekend i i uh those are two definite must see movies i think   well isnt isnt Sleeping with the Enemy isnt that a is is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful     its suspenseful i dont think its very terror i mean theres not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that its its more suspense um  the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebodys not into that kind of stuff its its pretty graphic at points but uh i think theyre both excellent movies   do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohill is uh you know who he is   no huhuh yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him   hes a the movie critic um oh youve oh okay hes a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas   yeah   and he does uh he has a talk show on the KLIF anyway its on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and its if you keep up with movies its kind of interesting theres a certain amount of drivel that they do theyve got uh theyve got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but its uh   oh   he anyway he its interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch the movie fact they had people had just seen i was listening Sunday night a little bit when i was going to   uhhuh   pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh it the it its interesting though the the the difficulty with with Dancing with Wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it   i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i dont i dont think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do he wanted to direct it he wanted to act to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really wanted he really wanted it whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because i think that i think he did a good job and and the selfsatisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him   do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver   um   a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post   yeah who no i dont know who that guy is   he he plays on Murphy Brown   oh he does   yes hes   as a recurring character every week   hes Eldon her housepainter   oh no now see id a id a never put those two together   do you believe that thats  thats one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no its really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a   huhuh yeah   you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean its uh   yeah real scruffy looking   yeah real scruffy looking and it was it was really funny its uh that that he winds up playing in the movie but i thought its good that you know it was a lot of fun   yeah   i dont know how long this conversation is supposed to go but were at about five minutes i should think weve done enough   you think so i mean i havent been watching my watch um     well i dont know what how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up why dont we do that goodbye Sharon
