        so Julie how do you feel about AIDS research     i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely   id agree too but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know um you know it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research done a longer longer longer ago   oh yeah yeah for certain   you know because you know because um the countrys gonna wind up paying for the treatment of patients   exactly exactly does does like do do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover   umhum   diseases like that   i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy theyll um check to see if youre HIV positive   uhhuh   and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but theyll um they have like theres like you know a database of people that have tested positive so youll never be able to get insurance ever again   um well thats but thats why they should have started started doing stuff before i mean still you know since its dormant for such a long time theres still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know   yeah i think a lot of it was was just that you know because because of of the audience you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in people that no one really cared about   right right   that   right and all these God fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera   umhum umhum yeah um yeah one one one humorous one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know Gods punishment was that then lesbians must be Gods chosen people   uhhuh   yeah   but um   boy thats a good one           so um   yes   um do you think were do you mean do you think were actually doing enough right now to   no i really dont i did i did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff and uh really were not doing much at all i mean most of what gets raised i mean its not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by um uh uh you know uh conscious yeah communities and things like that you know like uh San Francisco has uh   private organizations umhum   a real um strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff and and uh get they get donations from the community you know theyre real and from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing   umhum umhum umhum   and uh i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where its you know where its predominated so far because its you know its bound to spread   umhum i mean it seems that you know its just you know of its just gonna reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know wed nip it in the bud just to quote quote Barney Fife   right yeah i dont know i dont know i I i dont know what the likelihood of that is there you know people really waking up especially with the ultra conservative   umhum   move our our political system sort of seems seems to be taking   uhhuh umhum i would probably agree with that   yeah yeah   um so do do you think its more important to spend money on research or for support of um people   God thats a good question Fish i dont know um i think i think one of the main things thats really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know and its really its its really not necessary   umhum umhum   uh until until the uh disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious   umhum   and uh uh uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what theyre going through and everything and try to understand that theyre not you know they dont they dont have to be just completely   umhum   cut off from from a community and that and uh   umhum   i guess i think that that um research is i guess the most important just because i you know it it really needs to come to an end   umhum   yeah i dont know i dont know Fish what do you think about that subject   uh i think its i think it stands a really interesting question of um
