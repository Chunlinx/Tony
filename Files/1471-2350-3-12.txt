                    Background        Rett syndrome OMIM          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovOmim is an Xlinked dominant        disorder that occurs with a prevalance of  in  to         births    and almost exclusively in females        Named after Andreas Rett who first recognized the disorder        in      the syndrome is characterized by a        constellation of clinical findings that have resulted in        the establishment of clinical criteria for the diagnosis            Common clinical features include early normal        development until approximately  months of age followed        by a period of developmental stagnation and subsequent        regression usually by  years of life Characteristic        findings include loss of speech and motor skills        deceleration of head growth stereotypic hand movements        seizures respiratory abnormalities scoliosis and growth        delay Although the disorder is usually sporadic due to        new mutations a few familial cases permitted exclusion        mapping on the X chromosome with assignment of the        responsible gene to band Xq              Mutations in MECP the gene that encodes the DNA        binding protein MeCP methylCpG binding protein  have        been found in approximately  of Rett syndrome        patients        The functional consequence of MECP        mutations resulting in Rett syndrome is loss of function        Three of the four MECP exons encode a  amino acid        protein that is believed to be a transcriptional repressor        based on in vitro studies MeCPs functional structure        consists of an  amino acid methylbinding domain MBD           and a  amino acid transcriptional repression domain        TRD     The MBD is able to bind to methyl cytosine        residues of a single CpG dinucleotide     Under the        current model MeCP binds to DNA then complexes with        SinA through the TRD and recruits histone deacetylases        HDAC Deacetylation of core histones then alters        chromatin structure and results in transcriptional        repression             While MeCP is a ubiquitously expressed protein its        expression is highest in the brain lung and spleen and        less abundant in the kidney and heart      Its        cellular localization is also specific with expression in        neurons but not in glia Expression levels in brain        increase postnatally     These findings explain why        the most prominent clinical features of Rett syndrome are        related to central nervous system CNS dysfunction The        presence of growth retardation     osteopenia            and gastrointestinal abnormalities however suggest a        potentially important role for MeCPs function in the        peripheral and autonomous nervous system and in other        tissues Alternatively while MeCPs expression is        ubiquitous other methylCpG binding proteins that exist        within complexes MBD and MBD    or Kaiso            may reduce the effect of mutations in MECP in peripheral        organ systems while the lack of such redundancy may lead to        a more pronounced phenotype in the brain This theory        remains speculative however since the tissue specificity        and definitive identification of functional redundancy of        methylCpG binding proteins have not been established        Regardless the targets of MeCP modulation remain unknown        in the brain or elsewhere        To identify potential downstream targets of MeCP        modulation we have compared global gene expression        patterns in four matched pairs of clonally derived mutant        or wildtype MECPexpressing fibroblast cell strains from        girls with Rett syndrome and in five wildtype and four        mutant MeCPexpressing lymphoblastoid cell lines by        hybridizing Affymetrix U AE oligonucleotide        microarrays The use of clonally derived fibroblasts        eliminated the mosaic X inactivation seen in tissues from        most females with Rett syndrome Furthermore expression        patterns in clones with the mutant MECP allele active were        compared with those in clones with the wildtype allele on        the active X chromosome Because both types of clones are        derived from the same individual variability introduced by        differences in autosomal genetic background is eliminated        by our experimental strategy The use of lymphoblastoid        cell lines while not all clonally derived expanded the        scope of genes to be assayed beyond those expressed in skin        fibroblasts Our interrogations identified a statistically        significant number of genes with differential expression        patterns between wildtype and mutant cell strains        however the results across multiple clones from the same        individual showed substantial variability questioning the        significance of some of the genes identified The        lymphoblasts while not analysed in a matched comparison        yielded a relatively short list of genes with differential        expression that includes some potentially interesting        candidate genes                    Methods                  Cell culture single cell cloning and nucleic acid          extraction for fibroblasts          Four fibroblast strains from females with clinically          diagnosed Rett syndrome were obtained from Coriell Cell          Repositories MECP mutations were identified in our          laboratory as previously reported    GM          delG GM CT RC GM del          and GM CT RW From each of the four          cultures singlecell derived clonal cell strains were          established To do so fibroblasts were trypsinized           GibcoBRL Life Technologies and diluted to           cellsml By using a  m Stripper Tip MidAtlantic          Diagnostics Marlton NJ under direct microscopic          visualization individual cells were transferred to           well

    the well the cells were trypsinized and expanded Growth          rates and cellular morphology were closely monitored          Only clonal cell strains in the exponential growth phase          with similar cell and clonal morphology were selected for          further study RNA was extracted using RNA STAT          TelTest Inc Friendswood TX from eight  mm plates          of exponentially growing subconfluent cells that were at          similar passage numbers DNA was extracted from two          additional  mm plates using a standard extraction          protocol to determine X

lines with the mutant MECP allele on the          active X chromosome were derived from lymphoblastoid cell          lines LCLs from four females with clinically diagnosed          Rett syndrome and known mutations TM delG RX             and del unpublished using the technique          described above Individual cells were cultured in          conditioned RPMI  medium with  fetal calf serum

inactivation          with the wildtype MECP allele on the active X          chromosome were also cultured In addition one clonal          cell line with the wildtype MECP allele on the active X          chromosome was established using the cloning technique          described above RNA was extracted using RNA STAT          TelTest Inc Friendswood TX DNA was extracted using          a standard extraction protocol to determine X chromosome          inactivation status and verify monoclonality                          X chromosome inactivation studies          Clonality was further confirmed and X chromosome          inactivation status was determined by the length of the          polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat on the inactive          androgen receptor allele      Restriction          digestion of four restriction sites between the flanking          primers and adjacent to the trinucleotide repeat were          carried out with the methylation sensitive enzymes HpaII          and HhaI Amplification of the undigested allele that          included the trinucleotide repeat region was performed          using the fluorescentlabeled primer FAM          CTGTGAAGGTTGCTGTTCCTCAT and the unlabeled primer          TCCAGAATCTGTTCCAGAGCGTGC The lengths of the          amplification products were identified using the ABI           sequencer with the GeneScan fragment analysis software          Applied Biosystems Foster City CA Undigested DNA          samples from each of the original cell cultures were          amplified to determine the lengths of each allele                          Allelespecific MECP transcript analysis          Reverse transcription of  g of total RNA was          performed after Dnase I digestion Roche Diagnostics          Indianapolis IN with the Superscript II RNase          HReverse Transcriptase GibcoBRL Life Technologies          protocol for cDNA synthesis using  ng of random          hexamers Absence of DNA contamination was verified by          amplification of the intron containing region of the          MECP gene between exons  and  using exon  based          primer AGCCCGTGCAGCCATCAGCC and exon  based primer          CTTCCCAGGACTTTTCTCCA The regions containing the          mutations were amplified by PCR using primers and          conditions previously described    and later modified              PCR products were treated with  U exonuclease          and  U shrimp alkaline phosphatase for  min at C          The enzymes were heat inactivated at C for  minutes          Both strands of the treated PCR product were sequenced          with fluorescent labelled terminator nucleotides on the          ABI PRISM  DNA sequencer Cell clones expressing only          the mutant MECP allele are called mutant clones and

factors between samples for a given          chip ranging from  to  All quality control          measures were consistent with the manufacturers          recommended procedures and conformed to the recommended          cutoff values                          Microarray data analysis for fibroblast          clones          All GeneChips were analyzed using MicroArray Suite           MAS  with target intensities normalized to           Baseline genetic expression profiles of one clonal          wildtype MeCPexpressing fibroblast strain were          compared to the expression profile of the matched clonal          mutant MeCPexpressing cell strain for each of four          different MECP mutations Analyzed data were imported to          MicroDB and queried using Affymetrixs Data Mining Tool          DMT All four matched pair comparisons were queried for          directional changes For genesESTs with increased levels          of expression defined by MAS  as marginally increased          or increased wildtype baseline expression levels could          be present or absent For genes with decreased levels of          expression defined by MAS  as marginally decreased or          decreased wildtype baseline expression levels were          required to be present We identified genes that          demonstrated the same directional change in at least          three of four comparisons We computed p values for genes          identified by this criterion We assumed that if a gene          was not subject to a systematic change in expression          level an observed directional change in a given mutant          strain would occur randomly and independently with          probability equal to the overall proportion of          directional changes observed in that mutant strain We          used onesample twosided ttests on the reported          GeneChip fold changes to assess whether the log fold          changes of mutant cell strains differ from zero on          average We report the corresponding  confidence          intervals CI after conversion back from the log scale          Although the assumptions of the ttest cannot be          verified there was insufficient data to carry out          alternative tests                          Microarray data analysis for lymphoblastoid cell          lines          All GeneChips were analyzed using MAS  with

genes that demonstrated similar          directional changes in at least  of  unmatched pair          comparisons four mutant samples compared individually to          each of five wildtype samples For genes with increased          levels of expression defined by MAS  as marginally          increased or increased wildtype baseline expression          levels could be present or absent For genes with          decreased levels of expression defined by MAS  as          marginally decreased or decreased wildtype baseline          expression levels were required to be present We used          twosided Wilcoxon ranksum tests on the reported          uncompared values for the two groups to test whether the          expression profiles of mutant cell lines differ from          those of wildtype cell lines                          Realtime comparative quantitative PCR          Total RNA from the four matched pairs of clonal          fibroblast cell strains and ten lymphoblast cell lines          used on the GeneChips was used as template for RTPCR to          independently assess the validity of Affymetrix GeneChip          data Each RT reaction was performed with RNA from the          same preparation used for the GeneChip hybridization          Total RNA from eight additional clonal cell strains four          mutant and four wildtype with the RW mutation and          fourteen additional clonal cell strains seven mutant and          seven wildtype with the del mutation were also          used as template for RTPCR to assess consistency of          results across different clonal fibroblast cell strains          Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed after          Dnase I digestion Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN          with the Superscript II

TATA IID and          transferrin was used to normalize the amount of template          for each wildtype and mutant pair Each reaction was run          in triplicate with the results averaged on the log base           scale Standard curves for each amplification product          were generated from fold dilutions of pooled cDNA to          determine primer efficiency Data was analyzed with          Microsoft Excel  to generate raw expression          values          We performed paired ttests on the RTPCR values for          the original set of fibroblast clones to test whether the          average log change across cell strains differs from zero          We used unpaired t tests for the second set of fibroblast          clones from each of two cell strains to determine whether          multiple clones from individuals undergo a systematic          fold change We used unpaired Wilcoxon ranksum tests for          the lymphoblast cell lines to test whether there is a          systematic fold change across lines All reported           confidence intervals are reported in terms of fold          changes but derived from ttests computed on the log          scale

from four Rett females with different mutations one          missense in the MBD one missense in the TRD and two          frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons          Clonality was

RTPCR analysis less          than  cycle thresholds difference across all eight          clones one wildtype and one mutant from each          individual that were used for oligonucleotide array          hybridization data not shown This result is not          surprising Given the fact that the premature termination          codons resulting from the frameshift mutations are all          located in the  final exon of the MECP gene          preferential degradation of nonsense codoncontaining          transcripts would not be expected              To assess MeCP expression at the protein level          immunoblot analysis with an antibody against the          Cterminal region of MeCP was carried out on total cell          lysates from all eight fibroblast clones and from some          of the LCLs that were used for array hybridization Fig           A reacting protein band at the molecular weight of           kD as indicated by the company          httpwwwupstatecom was seen in wildtype

truncating mutation FB delG FB del LCL          RX do not produce a normal sized MECP protein Due          to the location of the epitope the antibody would not          react with putative truncated proteins The bands seen at          approximately  and  kD are unidentified proteins          that crossreact with the MeCP antibody The absence of          a normal sized MeCP protein in mutant clones with          truncating mutations confirms their purity and together          with the presence of MeCP in the wildtype clones          validates these matched pairs of cell cultures as a

 Fortysix genes showed increased levels of expression          in mutant cells in three out of four comparisons Three          genes were increased in all four comparisons Of the           genes  had been annotated as known genes and  as          unknown transcripts Of those  were found to encode          known genes by searching recent database releases and the          Celera database Table  Expression levels of two genes          VSHK and CA represented twice on the chips with          different accession numbers were increased in both          cases Of the  unique genes with increased transcript          levels in MeCP deficient cells  are known to be          expressed in brain Table           Twentyone genes demonstrated decreased levels of          expression in three out of four matched comparisons Of          the  genes  had been annotated as known genes and           as unknown transcripts of which one was found to encode          a known gene by searching recent

as showing          differential expression Of the  unique genes with          decreased expression in MeCP deficient cells  are          known to be expressed in brain Table                           Quantitative realtime RTPCR analyses of          fibroblast clones          To assess the reliability of the array hybridization          results transcript levels of  differentially expressed          genes  with increased and  with decreased expression          were quantified using realtime quantitative RTPCR          analysis with Sybr Green  The same RNA samples used for          making array hybridization probes were used as templates          for RTPCR The Pearson correlation coefficient was           for the RTPCR values from triplicate assays The fold          change data from the GeneChips and RTPCR analyses          Table  were converted to log scale for analysis and          comparison The correlation of the combined RTPCR fold          change data based on average of log of the three          measurements from each wildtype and each mutant sample          with the GeneChip log fold change data was   CI             Fig           To assess the consistency of differential gene          expression among a larger number of independently derived          cell clones from the same individual we selected five          genes with large fold change values that had been          identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by          RTPCR Three genes with increased expression in mutant          clones MTAP MMP and NTN and two with decreased          expression CRIP and COMP were quantitatively tested in          multiple clonal cell strains from two Rett females with          MECP mutations del and RW using RTPCR          Expression levels varied significantly from clone to          clone and between cell strains Fig  Fold change          values for the multiple clone comparisons were mostly          inconsistent with the original GeneChipRTPCR data          Furthermore the  confidence interval for fold change          included  no change in six of the ten comparisons          Fig  Expression of CRIP was significantly different          between wildtype and mutant clones for both Rett          individuals tested p   and p   however          the direction of change was different Increased          expression of only one gene MTAP encoding the          interferoninducible microtubular aggregate protein           remained significant in comparison of the mutant and          wildtype clones for both individuals tested p            and p   Fig                           Oligonucleotide array hybridization data of          lymphoblasts          The global gene expression pattern in fibroblasts is          limited and single cell cloning may amplify stochastic          events in culture that may be responsible for the wide          range of transcript levels in fibroblast clones We          therefore extended the microarray analyses to          lymphoblastoid cell lines LCLs and studied four clonal          mutant MeCP TM delG RX and del          expressing and one clonal del and four completely          skewed RW RX delG delG wildtype MeCP          expressing LCLs The percent present calls ranged from           chip D to  chip A and as for the fibroblast          data standard deviations for the percent present calls          for a given chip were  and differences in percent          present calls between wild type samples compared to          mutant samples were not significant When the expression          profile of each mutant was compared to that of each          wildtype LCL  genes were found to be differentially          expressed in at least  of  comparisons Table           Eleven genes showed increased levels of expression and           showed decreased expression Of those  genes  are          annotated as known genes and  are expressed in brain          Quantitative RTPCR was performed on four genes three          with increased and one with decreased expression to          assess the accuracy of GeneChip results In a plot          similar to that shown in Figure  the correlation of the          combined RTPCR fold change data with the GeneChip log          fold change data was  data not shown                            Discussion        Random X inactivation patterns are characteristic for        Rett syndrome that is caused by heterozygosity for        mutations in the Xlinked locus MECP Our study design was        intended to take advantage of the mosaic X chromosome        inactivation in cell strains of Rett syndrome females From        four original fibroblast samples we generated clonally        derived cell strains that expressed only the mutant MeCP        or only the wildtype MECP allele but not both We        hypothesized that the effects of MeCP dysfunction in the        mutant clonal cell strain would be more pronounced than in        the original cell strain with mosaic X chromosome        inactivation Moreover we were able to establish the ideal        matched control for each clonal mutant cell strain a        clonal cell strain with the wildtype MECP allele on the        active X chromosome from the same individual Comparative        transcription profiling of matched pairs of fibroblast        clones should eliminate any noise contributed by        polymorphisms or mutations of autosomal genes        Although MeCP expression is higher in other tissues        such as brain spleen and lung     the value gained by        the matched pair comparisons of clonal skin fibroblast        strains cultured under identical environmental conditions        should overcome the drawbacks of evaluating a tissue with a        lower level of expression Previously reported microarray        studies of female Rett and unrelated control brain samples        revealed expression changes that were interpreted as        secondary to the disease process such as increased        expression of glialspecific genes and decreased expression        of neuronal genes     Therefore when searching for        the primary targets of MeCP modulation it might be        advantageous to study a tissue that is less obviously        involved in the pathologic processes of the disease        To identify potential target genes of MeCP regulation        we looked for genes with increased transcript levels in at        least three out of four mutantwildtype MECP expressing        fibroblast comparisons Similarly genes with decreased        expression in at least three out of four matched pair        comparisons were also considered potential targets of MeCP        regulation If the calls made did not reflect real        increases or decreases we would expect expression level        increases and decreases to be scattered randomly throughout        the  transcripts interrogated By random chance        alone we would expect to see fewer than four genes        increased in three of four comparisons and fewer than one         genes increased in four of four comparisons The        number of differentially regulated genes identified by        these criteria  with increased and  with decreased        expression is significantly higher than expected by random        chance but it is much lower than one would expect if MeCP        had a crucial role as transcriptional repressor of all        genes with methylated promoters        To validate the microarray expression data with an        independent method we carried out realtime quantitative        RTPCR analyses for a subset of  genes on all  samples        that were used on the GeneChips  The results were        amazingly consistent for fold change and direction of        change in almost all instances We therefore chose to use        quantitative RTPCR alone to assess whether the increased        or decreased expression patterns observed in the initial        four matched pairs of clones were consistent in other        clones and therefore might be biologically meaningful        Much to our surprise expression levels of  genes in         additional MeCPdeficient and  additional MeCPpositive        clones from two Rett individuals one with a missense and        one with a truncating mutation showed tremendous        variation In the multiple clone comparisons the fold        change values trended away from the significant fold        changes seen on the GeneChips and RTPCR of the original        matched pair comparisons toward  no change CRIP        expression generated significant p values but the        direction of change differed in the two individuals tested        In the truncating mutation del expression was        decreased and in the missense mutation RW it was        increased Although individual background genetic        differences between the two Rett females might be        responsible for these results the possibility that the        opposite type changes are mutationtype specific needs to        be evaluated by studies of clones from additional        patients        Only MTAP encoding the interferoninducible        microtubular aggregate protein  remained significant in        comparison of the mutant and wildtype clones with average        increases of  and  fold for the two individuals        tested The product of this gene was first identified by a        monoclonal antibody against microtubular aggregates in        hepatocytes of chimpanzees infected with hepatitis C virus            The production of p mRNA is markedly induced in        the liver of chimpanzees infected with hepatitis C or        hepatitis D virus     Inducibility by        interferonalphabeta but not by interferongamma is        mediated by an interferonstimulated response element in        the promoter region     The gene was independently        identified in a search for novel interferoninducible genes        in the mouse Dron M Meritet JF and Tovey MG        unpublished GenBank  AJ Also known as IFI for        Interferoninducible protein  the human gene is located        on chromosome p Although predominantly expressed in        uterus and other internal organs transcripts have been        isolated from brain and hypothalamus cDNA libraries see        dbEST The putative function of this protein in the brain        is still a mystery        A different design was used for the microarray study of        Rett syndrome LCLs We initiated the LCL study because        MeCP protein expression was higher in lymphoblasts than in        fibroblasts and LCLs have an overlapping expression        pattern that includes genes not expressed in fibroblasts        Because of skewed X inactivation in the available LCLs        however we were only able to obtain one matched pair of        mutant versus wildtype expressing clones for del        For the  different comparisons we included three        mutantallele expressing clones TM delG RX and        four completely skewed wildtype MeCP expressing LCLs        RW RX delG delG from different donors        Nevertheless only  differentially expressed genes were        identified with a subset confirmed by quantitative        RTPCR None of these genes were identical to any        candidates found in the fibroblast study Gene expression        patterns in primary fibroblasts and transformed        lymphoblasts are different andor may respond differently        to MeCP deficiency Several of the candidate targets        identified in lymphoblasts that are also expressed in brain        Table  may warrant further evaluation        While our initial matched fibroblast clonal comparisons        identified numerous genes with consistent results that        could be targets of MeCP modulation verification of a        small subset of these data by comparing additional clones        not used on the GeneChip analysis revealed amazing        inconsistency The variability of gene expression across        clonal cell strains with the same genotype and the same X        chromosome active was similar among clones expressing the        mutant or the wildtype MECP allele Therefore it is not        likely to result from MeCP dysfunction and we can exclude        the possibility that MECP mutations lead to transcript        instability More likely fibroblasts in culture undergo        random modification of gene expression by somatic        mutations or epigenetic regulation and such rare events        may be amplified in singlecell derived clones In uncloned        fibroblast populations RNA samples from replicate cultures        revealed consistent results in comparative largescale gene        expression studies     Cell lines ie transformed        immortalized or tumorderived cell lines are well known to        be heteroploid ie chromosomally unstable and any        singlecell derived clones of such lines are genetically        heterogeneous Therefore some differences in transcript        levels among such clones would not be surprising There are        almost no reports in the literature however on        comparative gene expression studies in clones of primary        fibroblasts One of the reasons may be that it is difficult        to generate such clones In  Griffin et al           reported variation in the activity of steroid alpha        reductase the enzyme that converts testosterone to        dihydrotestosterone in cloned human skin fibroblasts        Activity of this enzyme is low in nongenital skin but high        in genital skin cells that grow in response to androgen        Foreskinderived fibroblast clones varied greatly up to         fold in enzyme activity The range of activity for        other microsomal enzymes was much lower in the same        fibroblast clones These authors did not study mRNA levels        but reductase activity therefore variation at the level        of protein stability could also play a role        Our data could be interpreted to suggest that microarray        experiments should be performed on greater numbers of        samples andor samples from mutant and wildtype brain to        generate meaningful data It is instructive however that        Tudor and colleagues compared global gene expression in a        large number of wildtype and         Mecp null male mice and failed to        identify striking changes in gene expression in the brain                               Conclusions        Both fibroblast and lymphoblast data together agree in        the most important positive result of our studies MeCP        deficiency does not result in global deregulation of gene        expression This result is novel and unexpected in light of        the purported function of MeCP as a global transcriptional        regulator that was based on in vitro biochemical studies        There are several possibilities that might explain our        findings First redundancy in methylCpG binding proteins        that recruit transcriptional silencing complexes may mask        the effects of MeCP deficiency for example MBD MBD or        Kaiso may complement the defect in the cell types we        studied Second if the interclonal variation we detected        by the quantitative RTPCR study of  genes in  clones        from two different Rett individuals were representative of        a general feature of diploid fibroblast clones it could        have masked any consistent biologically meaningful        expression changes If our limited findings were confirmed        by largerscale studies we would need to conclude that        clonal fibroblast strains are not a suitable resource for        genomewide expression profiling studies Third        deregulation of very few genes expressed only in parts of        the brain or only under certain conditions may be        responsible for the neuronal abnormalities in Rett brains        and this would not be detected by microarray studies        Fourth MeCP action on chromatin as suggested by observed        changes in histone acetylation      may not involve        protein coding genes that are represented on microarrays        but instead may affect centromeric heterochromatin or the        expression of small noncoding RNAs that are abundant in        normal brain     The results presented in this paper        contradict the established model of MeCP function and        necessitate a rethinking of strategies to unravel the        pathologic process that leads to neuronal dysfunction in        Rett syndrome
