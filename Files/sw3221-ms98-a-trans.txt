              so the question the question had something to do with usage of personal computers um   yes we are we are talking about computers this morning   um im a firm believer in in having lots of them im sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me   you have you have four machines around you boy well youve uh youve got me beat i have a a Zenith here   umhum   and at home i have a Commodore   umhum   and a Zenith and my wife has an ATT  i believe it is   good grief what do you do with all those   well actually on my Commodore i mainly study lottery numbers would you believe i have written some uh programs in basic   umhum   whereby i can select any number of uh drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most   umhum right   i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical uh appearance of these numbers   umhum   to see if theres anything thats consistent on that i have another number that allows me another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered   umhum   so this is what i do most of the time uh   thats what you do on your  at least one of your machines on your Commodore   on my Commodore on my Commodore umhum  and of course i have uh word processors and i write all my letters is is wonderful uh my uh thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time and i get them all down and   yeah umhum yes   naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares you can go back and uh correct it very easily   yes yes   so that makes it very very nice i get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very very readily so how about you Charles   well i um i do an awful lot of preparation of documents um uh and i i use word processors and and fancier programs i mean you know graphics programs and simply make all of our slides um some of them i do on a Sun some i do on an XT   umhum uhhuh   um now maybe we dont call these personal computers um i started out with you know an IBM PC back in the you know about a year after they came out   yeah   and you know   so where where may i ask where you work sir   i i work for the government in Washington   i know you work for the government i just wondering are you a NAVC or what what what section of it roughly   of in in in an obscure part of the defense department   oh uhhuh because see thats my type of work too i work at the Applied Research Lab here here on campus and   umhum   my my field is underwater acoustics and theres a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying   uhhuh     how uh things vary in the water you know and uh taking advantage of them and so forth so its a very nice very nice field and i i am retiring at the end of this month end of December excuse me   umhum are are are you are you also a professor or or do you just research   yes im a professor im an associate professor but my i my im a full time researcher   umhum yes   and its uh been a very very interesting career believe me   i can believe what are you gonna what are you gonna do when you stop i mean  take all your machines with you or     well well uh the ones here in the laboratory obviously im theyre gonna stay but i have similar machines at home i would consider uh uh doing some more consulting when i get home   umhum   umhum   but i have a very very busy extra life anyway im also a musician and i play in several symphony orchestras and uh i run a concert band and     yes umhum   so i have a lot of external uh interests   yes   but i do want to get very deeply much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is gonna be controlled run and operated by computers in the future theres no doubt about it because it is really taking over     yes umhum   and the amount of work that were doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh its so much involved   umhum   and it sounds as though youre probably more aware of that than i am because uh i dont get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to here again lets say im starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement and uh so basically what im doing is   yeah yeah   slowly getting rid of my things for many many years i had a full size acoustics uh study laboratory where where i could take recordings and and uh perform experiments with them and so forth and so thats gone now and so im sort of out of business   umhum umhum um   uh as i say i worked with NAVC fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow i worked with for many many years and he is now retired   umhum umhum   so its been an interesting life and computers have come in towards the latter end of that i wish wed had computers in the very beginning it would have been
