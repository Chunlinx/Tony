                                 Forgetting the Present            George Santayana predictedan unfortunate fate for those who cannot remember the past What would he sayabout political leaders who cannot even remember the present            Take for example PresidentClintons promise in his Democratic Convention speechrepeated more than oncein Sunday nights debatethat he would offset the harsh effects of therecently passed welfare rollback by giving businesses a tax credit for everyperson hired off welfare and kept employed What a cantmiss idea The verywords fairly glow tax credit businesses off welfare employed            Troubleis we already have such a tax creditit just got renewed as part of theminimumwage bill and its a proven failure The Targeted Jobs Tax Credit a ka the Work Opportunity Tax Credit has been a ghastly disappointment ever sinceit was enacted in  Early analysis showed that most employers using itdidnt hire more or different people Instead they simply got theiraccountants to review personnel records at years end to see who among recenthires might qualify for the tax credit            Tighter rules have presumably curbed that abuse but farmore damaging findings emerged from a couple of controlled experiments inDayton Ohio and two cities in Wisconsin To their surprise and dismayresearchers found that when eligible job seekers welfare recipients and othercategories of disadvantaged workers were sent off to potential employersbearing in hand the tax credits or vouchers that labeled them as highriskcases they were less likelyfar less likelyto find jobs than if they justapplied on their own And that was back when the tax credit was considerablymore generous than it is now From these and other studies says Brookingseconomist Gary Burtless who participated in many of them we can safelyconclude that sending someone out in the market saying Hire me Im forsale is a bad idea            For thatmatter so are all the efforts to engineer social and economic behavior throughthe tax code of which Clinton is so enamoredthe embellished tax preferencesfor buying and selling homes having a child or putting one in day caresending the kids to college or going back yourself saving up for a nursinghome and so on Theres so much evidence on this point that in  bothparties in Congress agreed that tax subsidies are at best an inefficient wayto promote desired behavior since most of the money goes to pay for thingsthat are going to happen anyway At worst they are a complete ripoff sincethey are almost impossible for the IRS to monitor Congress gave the tax code amuchneeded cleanup job with lower rates as the reward and everyone promisedthey wouldnt junk it up again            But that was  long years ago and no onewould expect a politician to remember that far back Lets return to theforgotten present            Attentiondeficit disorder is also afflicting the Dole team On the campaigntrail Dole was still calling for the misbegotten Homemaker IRA aweek after it had passed into law Dole has apparently not forgotten his ownpast record on taxeshe correctly if ineffectually pointed out duringSundays debate that his  tax bill was not a true tax hike as normallyunderstood but primarily a canceling of corporate tax breaks not yet in placeand crackdowns on cheaters to collect taxes already owed He did fail to notethat the Social Security bailout of the early s about which he also braggedrepeatedly included a large tax increase But Doles grasp of specificsseemed a lot less secure when it came to defending his current plan tocut taxes by some  billion over the next six years while still balancingthe budget Clinton also managed to forget the incredible elements in his ownsevenyear budgetbalancing plan as he touted it repeatedly during thedebate            The architects of Doles tax plan argue that critics havepaid far too much attention to the relatively modest supplyside feedbackeffects counted on to pump up tax collections by promoting growth and reducingtax avoidance The real guts they contend lie in the promised budget cutswhich since they amount to a mere nickel out of every dollar of cutableprograms over the sixyear period are surely an easily achievable target            A mere nickel Piece o cakeOr at least you might think so if last weeks action in Washington escaped yourattention Congress and the president indulged in a round of mutualselfcongratulation over their agreement on an appropriations package for thenew fiscal year You guys did such a great job President Clinton toldcongressional leaders as they finished up on their work You should really beproud            Gee andthey didnt have to close down the government even once Just one small detailthat might have given Dole and his illustrious advisers a moments pause Theappropriations measures while restrained by recent standards nonethelessweigh in at probably  billion over the target the GOP Congress set fordomestic discretionary spending only a year ago The Republicans will argue theshortfall isnt that big because they are going to cover some of it by onetimesavings dipping into the bank insurance fundsnever mind the SLcollapse that was eons agoand of course selling off part of the broadcastspectrum the most oversold commodity since the Brooklyn Bridge Didnt anyoneremind them that Dole had already reserved the spectrum sale to help pay forhis taxcut plan            A  billion discrepancy may not seem muchwhen measured against the total budget with all its sacrosanct or unavoidableobligations But its a significant shortfall if you are sufficientlypresentminded to recall that Congress and the president have separatelycommitted themselves to mammothand almost entirely unspecifiedcuts in themagical year of  when the budget is to alight if only for a moment onbalance And it is on top of these cutsbefore the first small step of whichthe Congress and the president just blinkedthat the additional Dole cuts areto be made an amount totaling close to  percent of the vulnerable part ofthe budget Assuming the barebones basic functions of government are to bemaintained where then will be the room for any bordercontrol guards orantiterrorism measures or Head Start or education grants or peanut subsidiesor national parks or disaster relieflet alone the enhancements that Congressdeemed so necessary this October            Nodoubtas former Congressional Budget Office Director Bob Reischauer pointsoutwith all the electionyear pressure on Republicans to show they reallyarent so bad and the temptation for Clinton to show his newfound muscle thefinal appropriations package isnt bad That is as Reischauer quickly addsif budget balance is your prime desire and you believe that cuts indiscretionary spending are the way to go            But that of course is the real and present issue thatneither congressional party addressed transfixed as they and the media are bythe fantasy budgets offered on the campaign trail by their respectivestandardbearers A budget is not a mere political prop Whether by design orinadvertence its the end product of politics the actual blueprint forgovernments role in society            This budget makes somebigif dubiouschoices if only implicitly The Pentagon gets an extra billion this year with more to come for weapons systems and other sundries itdoesnt want only a few weeks after another set of committees decided to cut billion from programs for the needy over this and the next two years Butmost important choices were not made Social Securitys problems wont bemanifest until the next century but it would be both easier and kinder tostart making modest reforms now Medicare on the other hand is explodingright now So for that matter is the worlds population But overseasfamilyplanning programs despite minor restoration were left at a fundinglevel more than a third below that of a few years ago            Political leaders are oftenfaulted for living in the past or ignoring the future            Wed be lucky if ours simplygot a firm hold on the here and now
