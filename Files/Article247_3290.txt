                                 The State of the Glass Ceiling                        Last weeks hiring of Carly Fiorina as CEO of HewlettPackard is one of thefew unequivocally good things to happen anywhere in the worldokay how aboutin the upper reaches of corporate Americain recent months For HPFiorinas arrival will bring some muchneeded new blood into a somewhat tiredand overly bureaucratic organization as well as a welcome emphasis on Internetcommerce For Fiorina who had had a stellar career at Lucent the hiring meansthat shell get a shot at running a major corporation years before she couldhave expected to get the top job at her old company And for the rest of us atleast the rest of us who worry about whos running American business itsexcellent finally to have a woman CEO of a Dow corporation            Unfortunately though not surprisingly Fiorina has taken pains to downplaythe last fact Its understandable that she doesnt want it to look as if shewas hired because she was a woman although the fact that shed be worriedabout anyone thinking that in a world in which only three of the Fortune corporations are run by women is somewhat astonishing So well stipulate thatshe was not hired because she was a woman She was hired because shes amanagerial whiz who helped transform Lucent from a staid spinoff of ATTinto a prototypical bleedingedge company But that doesnt mean that the factthat she is a woman is therefore irrelevant            The irony is that when Fiorina says things like there really is not a glassceiling anymore shes simultaneously making too much and too little of herown accomplishment Shes making too much of it because of her implicitargument that her ascension has smashed the ceiling But the reality is thatmost doors into the executive suite are still not open to women and those thatare have been opened only through struggle Something like  percent of alltop executive positions are still held by men There are lots of reasons forthat of course and most of them have to do with broader social realities andnot with corporate prejudice But the oldboys network is not a myth and itstill takes a conscious effort on the part of boards of directors and hiringcommittees to promote women It may be telling in fact that New Economycompanies have done a much better job in this regard Its hardly acoincidence that HewlettPackard which has a number of women executives inpositions of real authority was the first Dow company ever to hire a femaleCEO Under outgoing head Lew Platt HP has emphasized diversity Which againdoesnt mean that Fiorina wasnt the right choice It just means that theresan institutional environment that allowed that choice to be made            On the other hand Fiorina is making too little of her accomplishmentbecause shes downplaying just how talented she had to be to rise as fast asshe has and to overcome all the lingering prejudices against women executivesespecially in the oldline technology industry Needless to say any time aCEO downplays her own talent its nice but still  Its like JackieRobinson The first black majorleaguer had to be exceptional because a merelygood player wouldnt have been able to convince people of what they didnt wantto be convinced of namely that black players could play In some ways infact you could say that major league baseball wasnt really integrated untilthe Boston Red Soxthe last team to integratesigned Pumpsie Green amediocrehitting utility infielder When companies start being run by thefemale equivalents of Pumpsieas most companies currently are by the maleequivalentsthen well know that the glass ceiling is really gone            Of course in theory the market should already have taken care of thisDiscrimination is economically irrational which means that companies whichdiscriminate against women should feel the pain in reduced competitiveness Butwe know that companies do discriminate even when it costs them As my friendRachel Devlin a historian at Tulane University points out after World War IImost industrial companies fired the women workers in their plants even thoughthey would work for less than men in order to restore the status quo that hadprevailed before the war            In any case when it comes to the CEO market in particular its difficultto decide what constitutes rationality because the selection process is sopersonalized and because the criteria for what constitutes a great CEO are soilldefined As the skyhigh pay for todays CEOs compared with theircounterparts of twenty years ago demonstrates the insular nature of boards ofdirectors means that purely economic considerations do not always prevail Andin that sense worrying too much about why Fiorina was hired is fruitlessWhats important is that she was hired and that if shes successful shell makeit easier for those after her Even or rather especially those who are morePumpsie Green than Jackie Robinson
