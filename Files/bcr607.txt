                    Introduction        A characteristic feature of many cancer types is their        ability to metastasise to the skeleton At the skeletal        site of metastatic invasion the bone metabolism is        dysregulated and bone resorption or bone formation or        both is upregulated Bone is the most common target site        of metastatic invasion in breast cancer     This is of        clinical importance as metastatic bone disease is        associated with increased morbidity and excess mortality            To initiate successful preventive therapy it is thus        imperative that the bone metastases are detected early                   The diagnosis of bone metastases is usually performed        through bone scintigraphy However this technique is        invasive and is not sensitive enough for detection of the        very early stages of metastasis     Biochemical markers        of bone turnover are noninvasive and may potentially        provide a more sensitive measure of metastatic skeletal        invasion but clinical applications of the bone turnover        markers have not been thoroughly evaluated for such a        clinical role        Degradation products derived from the   chain of type        I collagen CTX have been shown to provide a sensitive and        specific index of bone resorption      Preliminary        studies have suggested that the CTX marker may be        applicable for monitoring skeletal metastases in breast and        prostate cancer patients      The epitope recognised        in the CTX assays comprises the six residues AHDGGR        of the collagen type I Cterminal telopeptide The        aspartylglycine site DG within this epitope is        susceptible to spontaneous nonenzymatic rearrangement as        outlined in Fig         CTX fragments derived from newly synthesised collagen        are of the native peptide form  Laspartyl peptide  L        where the aspartic acid residue D  is on the        Lenantiomeric form and is linked to the glycine residue G         through a peptide bond Collagen and CTX fragments        will rearrange with age to three agemodified forms the        isomerised form  Lisoaspartyl peptide  L where the        bond between the aspartic acid and glycine residue goes        through the carboxyl group of the aspartyl residue the        racemised form  Daspartyl peptide  D where the        aspartic acid D  is on a Denantiomeric form and the        isomerised and racemised form  Disoaspartyl peptide         D     The relative accumulation of the three        agemodified forms is dependent on the balance between        anabolic and catabolic processes in bone and pathologic        situations affecting these processes may thus also affect        the relative amounts of the four CTX forms                     It has been shown that in Pagets disease of bone a        condition characterised by a localised upregulation of bone        turnover there is a significant increase in the ratio        between the native peptide form of CTX  L and the        agemodified forms  L Disoaspartyl peptide and  D            The use of CTX ratios may thus be indicative of the        significant decrease in the residence time and therefore        the average age of the resorbed bone collagen type I        fragments in Pagetic patients     This indicates that        perturbations in the normally wellregulated process of        bone turnover can result in changes in the halflife of        collagen type I within the bone matrix This in turn will        result in increased amounts of the newly synthesised  LCTX        form in the circulating pool of CTX fragments that is        reflected in the elevated ratios              Metastatic bone cancer will also affect the balance        between the anabolic and catabolic processes at the local        site of invasion The measurement of CTX isoforms and the        ratios between the native  Lform and the agemodified        forms of CTX indicative of the age of the resorbed        collagen fragments may thus provide clinical useful        information for diagnosing and monitoring bone metastasis        occurrence in cancer patients     Such an application        of the CTX bone resorption markers may be especially        relevant for breast cancer patients who have a high risk        of developing bone metastases        In the present study our aim was to assess the clinical        utility of the different CTX isoforms as well as the        ratios between the isoforms to detect breast        cancerinduced bone metastases For this purpose the        urinary CTX isoforms  L  L and  Dwere quantified by        immunoassay in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal        women and in women affected with breast cancer either with        or without bone metastases                    Patients and methods                  Study population          Urine samples were collected as the morning void from           healthy premenopausal women age mean  standard          deviation SD    years and  healthy          postmenopausal women age    years In addition           female patients with histologically confirmed breast          cancer participated in the study Eight patients were          hypercalcemic serum calcium   mmoll albumin          corrected had radiologically confirmed bone metastases          and were    years of age HC patients One          hundred patients were normocalcemic serum calcium          between  and  mmoll albumin corrected had          radiologically confirmed bone metastases and were             years of age NC patients Finally  breast          cancer patients    years of age were          normocalcemic had early stage nonmetastatic cancer but          were without radiological signs of bone metastases          NCpatients          Fifty per cent  and  of subjects were          premenopausal in the HC NC and NC patient groups          respectively There was no statistical difference between          the proportions of premenopausal women in the three          groups          The presence or absence of bone metastasis in patients          was determined by bone scintigraphy and was confirmed by          conventional radiography Xray as necessary All study          subjects had serum creatinine   moll and          received endocrine therapy andor an          anthracyclinecontaining regimen Some patients had          additional radiotherapy in the event of clinical symptoms          eg bone pain instability The use of antineoplastic          hormonal treatment  mg tamoxifen  mg          aminoglutethimide  mg provera was allowed but none          of the patients were receiving bisphosphonate therapy          prior to entry into the study Informed written consent          was obtained from all participants according to the          Helsinki Declaration of  as revised in  The          study was approved by the local human investigations          committee                          Measurement of CTX isoforms by immunoassay          analysis          The CrossLaps radioimmunoassay    and the          CrossLaps ELISA    are commercially available          immunoassays specific for the native  L and isomerised           L forms of CTX respectively The assays were          performed as recommended by the manufacturer Nordic          Bioscience Diagnostics Herlev Denmark          The  DCTX ELISA is a competitive assay based on          polyclonal rabbit antibodies for the  Dform of CTX The          assay has been described elsewhere     All          determinations of urinary CTX were corrected for          creatinine The three CTX assays were calibrated using          synthetic CTX standards the concentration of which had          been determined by analysis of the total amino acid          composition as described previously                              Statistical analysis          Biochemical data were compared between groups using          the MannWhitney U test twotailed For all tests           P   was considered          significant The discriminatory power of the different          CTX isoforms or CTX ratios in distinguishing groups from          controls was assessed using           T or           Z scores ie number of SDs from          the mean of the controls                            Results        The urinary excretion of all CTX forms was significantly        higher          P   in the postmenopausal        group when compared with the premenopausal women with        approximately fold higher levels Table  When ratios        between the newly synthesised  Lform and the agemodified        forms  Land  D were calculated only minor and        nonsignificant differences were observed between        premenopausal and postmenopausal women In patients with        breast cancerinduced bone metastases the urinary        excretion of the newly synthesised  LCTX form was more        increased than the agemodified forms  Land  D Compared        with NC patients the HC patients had a fold        elevation in  LCTX and the NC patients had fold        higher levels of  LCTX          P   The levels of  DCTX        representing the oldest form of CTX were increased        fold and fold in HC patients and in NC patients        compared with NC patients Fig  The ratio between the        nonisomerised  Lform and the racemised  Dform of CTX was        consequently increased in NC patients and in HC patients         and  times respectively when compared with NC        patients and increased  and  times respectively        compared with postmenopausal patients However these        increases in the  L Dratio did not reach statistical        significance as evaluated by nonparametric statistics        The ability of the various CTX forms and CTX ratios to        discriminate between patients with bone metastases HC        patients and NC patients and patients without bone        metastases NC patients was assessed by         Z score analysis using the mean and        SD of the NC patient group Fig  This analysis        revealed that the  LCTX levels provided the best        differentiation between patients with metastases HC        patients and NC patients and nonmetastasised controls        Fig         Although the  L Dratio displayed the highest mean         Z score the urinary excretion of the         LCTX form still appeared to have the best ability to        identify patients affected by bone metastases Thus  of        patients affected by bone metastases had significantly        increased  LCTX values          Z score   compared with breast        cancer patients without bone metastases NC patients        Fig  In comparison  of patients affected by bone        metastases had  L Dratios more than  SDs above the        normal postmenopausal mean Fig  In addition whereas        only  of patients affected by bone metastases had  LCTX        values below the mean of nonmetastasised controls        NCpatients  of these patients had  L Dratios        below this value Fig                     Discussion        In the present study the clinical utility of assays for        the various CTX forms in the assessment of breast        cancerinduced bone metastases was investigated        The urinary concentration of all four CTX isoforms was        initially measured in reference populations of healthy        premenopausal and postmenopausal women The levels of the        three CTX isoforms  L  Land  Dwere fold to fold        higher in the postmenopausal women Table  in accordance        with previous reports of CTX levels during the menopause            As all forms were elevated to the same magnitude in        postmenopause the ratios between the newly synthesised         LCTX form and the older  Land  DCTX forms was not        significantly different in premenopausal and postmenopausal        women This indicates that the average age and thus the        halflife of bone collagen is similar in premenopausal and        postmenopausal women In a study comprising larger cohorts        a small but significant elevation in the  L Lratio was        found indicating that the net halflife of collagen is        slightly decreased after the menopause            In breast cancer patients affected by bone metastases        HC patients and NC patients the levels of all CTX        isoforms were elevated compared with healthy postmenopausal        controls or with NC patients The  Lform representing the        degradation of newly formed bone was however more        elevated than the corresponding agerelated isoforms Table         HC patients had a fold elevation in  LCTX levels        and a fold elevation was seen in NC patients        indicating that the more severe condition in the HC        patients is reflected by the  LCTX marker The least        prominent elevation was seen for the  DCTX levels        The  L DCTX ratio reflecting the relative contents of        agemodified CTX forms was highly increased in HC patients        fold and fold compared with NCpatients and with        postmenopausal patients respectively and in NC patients        fold and fold compared with NC patients and with        postmenopausal patients This suggests that the age and        thus the halflife of collagen type I fragments generated        by resorption is decreased in the group of patients with        bone metastases Such a decrease in collagen type I        halflife is likely to reflect a significant imbalance        between anabolic and catabolic processes at the focal area        of metastatic invasion            A similar imbalance is seen in some highturnover        conditions including Pagets disease      In        situations of high bone turnover the aged bone matrix        will rapidly be replaced with a new matrix leading to a        lower residence time ie halflife of bone collagen        More young bone as reflected by the  LCTX levels will        be resorbed and the relative content of agemodified forms        will decrease The relative content of  LCTX is reflected        in the CTX ratios providing an index of bone collagen        halflife     Among the CTX ratios the  L Dratio        showed the most pronounced elevation in the metastatic        breast cancer patients This is in good agreement with        kinetic studies of the isomerisation and racemisation        reactions where it was shown that the  DCTX form        accumulates with the lowest kinetic rate     The  L        DCTX ratio will thus be most affected by changes of bone        turnover processes influencing the halflife of collagen        type I in the bone matrix The agerelated  Lform        accumulates with a slightly higher kinetic rate than  DCTX            This is also apparent from the less pronounced        increase in the  L Lratio compared with the  L Dratio        in metastatic patients        When individual         Z scores of CTX were calculated for        the metastatic breast cancer patients compared with the        nonmetastatic patients the  LCTX form and the  L DCTX        ratio showed the highest average increases in accordance        with the ability of the  LCTX levels and the  L DCTX        ratio to most sensitively reflect alterations in the        balance between the anabolic and catabolic processes of        bone turnover Fig   LCTX levels alone showed a        significant elevation in  of the metastatic patients        which probably reflects an increased bone turnover        increased resorption  increased formation as an        important feature in the majority of bone metastatic        patients For the  Land  DCTX markers respectively         and  of the metastatic patients had levels  SDs above        the reference level of nonmetastasised controls Fig                The present data suggest that the levels of  LCTX are        most affected by the altered bone turnover associated with        metastatic invasion of bone The fact that only  of        patients affected by bone metastases as determined by        radiology have increased levels of  LCTX indicates a        rather low sensitivity of bone resorption markers to        identify bone metastases Several issues are relevant for        the interpretation of this result It may be speculated        that different stages of the bone metastases process show        varying release of  LCTX Furthermore the difference may        be related to differences between sclerotic and lytic bone        metastases In this context it is noteworthy that some        patients who have not been classified as having bone        metastases by radiological methods have  LCTX values        increased more than  SDs above the normal mean        High levels of  LCTX are indicative of an increased        bone resorption In the clinical management of individual        patients affected with breast cancer an increased  LCTX        value may indicate the presence of bone metastases and will        call for a closer clinical evaluation of the patient andor        initiation of preventive therapy eg        bisphosphonates        The study has some limitations Most patients received        antineoplastic hormonal treatment  mg tamoxifen  mg        aminoglutethimide  mg provera This treatment may        potentially reduce bone resorption thereby influencing CTX        levels It may thus be a confounding factor in the        analysis In spite of this treatment however patients        affected by bone metastases had highly increased marker        values compared with healthy controls This indicates that        the increase in markers is related to metastatic invasion        of bone and is reflected in systemic marker levels        regardless of the potential antiresorptive effects of        antineoplastic therapy                    Conclusion        Assays for the various agerelated isoforms of CTX have        different sensitivities to identify patients affected by        bone metastases The  LCTX isoform reflecting resorption        of young bone appeared to provide the best differentiation        of patients affected by breast cancerinduced bone        metastases Further studies are needed to investigate the        utility of this marker in the early detection of bone        metastases and for assessing treatment efficacy Such        studies should correlate marker values with metastasis type        lytic sclerotic mixed and with the volume of bone        affected by metastases                    Competing interests        Paul Cloos Stephan Christgau and Per Qvist are        employees of Nordic
