                    Background        The potential adaptive significance of transposable        elements TEs to the host genomes in which they reside is        a topic that has been hotly debated by molecular        evolutionists for more than two decades While the        biological importance of TEs seemed selfevident to those        scientists involved in their initial discovery eg             the subsequent realization that TEs could be        maintained in populations even while imparting slight        selective disadvantage to their hosts eg              drew into question the presumption of adaptive        significance However even if TEs can be maintained in        populations on a daytoday basis without providing        selective advantage it does not preclude the possibility        that the insertion of TEs in or near genes may in some        instances be of adaptive advantage        If TE insertion variants have contributed to adaptive        gene evolution such variants might be expected to be in        high frequency or fixed in populations and species Initial        surveys of natural populations of         Drosophila melanogaster showing that        TE insertion alleles are in uniformly low frequency seemed        to negate the adaptive hypothesis     However the        sporadic discovery of degenerate TEs or TE fragments as        critical components of functional genes in both plants and        animals was sufficient to keep the adaptive hypothesis        alive throughout the pregenomic era                The current availability of the complete or nearly        complete sequence of select genomes representing a variety        of species is providing an unprecedented opportunity to        examine the frequency and distribution of TEs in eukaryotic        genomes The results have been dramatic TEs not only        comprise a significant fraction of nearly all eukaryotic        genomes thus far sequenced they have been found to be        components of the regulatory andor coding regions of a        surprisingly large number of genes eg     For        example a recent genomic analysis of  human genes        revealed that approximately  harbored retrotransposon        sequences within proteincoding regions     Similar        results have been recently reported for the nematode         Caenorhabditis elegans     Here        we analyze the polymorphism of two LTR retrotransposon         host gene associations across geographically widespread         D melanogaster populations and a        representative population of the         D melanogaster sibling species         Drosophila mauritiana                     Results        We have initiated a genomic analysis of LTR        retrotransposons present in the         Drosophila melanogaster genome eg            Of particular interest is identification of genes        harboring TEs and determining if these insertion alleles        are in high frequency or fixed among natural populations as        would be expected from the adaptive hypothesis We report        here the results of an analysis of two LTR        retrotransposoncontaining genes located on the second        chromosome of the sequenced         D melanogaster y cn bw sp strain        These two genes present an interesting contrast in that one        of them         Chitinase  Cht  is located        within constitutive heterochromatin Genbank accession        AE while the other         cathD  is located in a euchromatic        region of the chromosome Genbank accession AE Our        findings demonstrate that while the euchromatic         cathD insertion variant was not        detected in any of the natural populations examined the        insertion variant present in the heterochromatic         Cht gene was found to be apparently        fixed throughout the species These results are consistent        with the view that the presence of TEs in constitutive        heterochromatin may have relevance to the expression of        heterochromatic genes eg             Genomic analysis of the sequenced y         cn bw sp strain of         Drosophila melanogaster identified a        fulllength         Burdock LTR retrotransposon located        just  to the         cathD gene and a bp LTR fragment        complete LTR is  bp of an         Antonia LTR retrotransposon           located within an intron of the         Cht gene Figure  A set of PCR        primers were designed to amplify regions of both genes and        retrotransposon sequences Appropriate pairs of gene and        element primers were used to detect the presence or absence        of the respective retrotransposon inserts associated with        each gene in strains representing  geographically        dispersed populations of         D melanogaster  The results        presented in Figure and Table demonstrate that while the         Burdock insertion located just  to         cathD gene is not present in any of         strains representing a geographically diverse sampling        of natural populations the         Antonia LTR fragment located in the        intron of the heterochromatic         Cht gene is fixed in all  strains        tested        It is formally possible that the presence of the         Antonia LTR within the         Cht intron was the result of a        chance fixation event prior to the expansion of         D melanogaster around the world        Thus to further test the adaptive hypothesis we compared        the level of sequence divergence within the LTR and its        flanking intronic sequence between the two sibling species         Drosophila melanogaster and         Drosophila mauritiana  If the        LTRcontaining intron is under stabilizing selection a        lower than neutral rate of substitution would be expected        A total of  bp of the         Cht intron was sequenced This        region spans  bp of the  bp         Antonia LTR fragment The sequence of        this region in a         D melanogaster Dimonika Africa        and         D mauritiana Mauritius Africa        strain was aligned with the homologous region in the        sequenced         D melanogaster y cn bw sp strain        Figure  The two         melanogaster strains were         identical The         melanogaster sequences were found to        be only   substitutions nucleotide sites        diverged from that of         D mauritiana  This value is        significantly less than half of the expected            divergence based on the         Drosophila neutral substitution rate        of    substitutionssitemillion year           over the estimated  million years separating the two        species            To directly compare the substitution rate for the         Cht intron with that of another         Drosophila gene intron we randomly        selected intron  of the         Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase          Adh  gene         Adh is a widely studied         Drosophila gene and it has been        sequenced in several         Drosophila species including         D melanogaster  accession X           and         D mauritiana  accession M            The sequence divergence between         D melanogaster and         D mauritiana in the         Adh intron   Figure  is        higher than that for the LTR containing         Cht intron  These results        strongly suggest that conservative selection has been        operating on the LTR containing intron associated with the         Drosophila Cht gene over the past         million years                    Discussion        For many years constitutive heterochromatin was        considered to be of little or no functional significance            This view seemed to be supported by early molecular        studies showing that heterochromatin consists almost        exclusively of highly repeated and middle repetitive DNA        eg      The middle repetitive fraction was        viewed as the descendent of once active TEs that had the        misfortune of inserting into transcriptionally inert        heterochromatin at some point in their evolutionary history        eg      The view of heterochromatin as a genetic        wasteland gradually changed with the mapping of a number of        functionally important         Drosophila genes to constitutive        heterochromatin eg                   Reexamination of         Drosophila constitutive        heterochromatin revealed that long stretches of highly        repetitive DNA are interrupted by islands of        retrotransposon sequences eg              Drosophila genes in heterochromatin        are typically associated with these islands of        retrotransposons         It has been suggested        that transposable elements inserted into heterochromatin        may locally alter chromatin structure eg     Our        results suggest that in at least some instances the        association of heterochromatic genes with transposable        element sequences may be of adaptive significance                    Conclusions        The results presented here are consistent with the        hypothesis that a  bp fragment of the         Antonia retrotransposon located        within the intron of the heterochromatic         Drosophila melanogaster Cht gene may        be of adaptive evolutionary significance Further genomic        and molecular analyses will be required to assess the        general importance of LTR retrotransposon sequences to the        evolution of heterochromatic gene structure and        function                    Materials and Methods                  Gene Region Annotation          BLASTS of sequenced
