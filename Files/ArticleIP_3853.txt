WildAbout Harry Part                         I would just like to say howmuch I have enjoyed reading Harry Shearers Dispatches from the OJ civil trial Brilliantly well writtenand with the right mix of sarcasm and serious analysis they have beenvirtually unmissable throughout the trial The same can be said for his earlierDiary entries on the Republican and Democratic party conventions during the summer            Now thatthe civil trial has come to a conclusion does Slate have any more projects upits sleeve for him to have a crack at                           James McBride                                       WildAbout Harry Part                         You reallyshould issue Harry Shearers incredible OJ Dispatches in book form His coverage has been far moreinsightful than anything else for either the criminal or the civil trialincluding the acclaimed book by that sly revisionist Jeffrey Toobin He alsoadded something this whole escapade has needed from the starta little humorThe material ought to have much broader exposure                           PatrickHudson                                       TheEditors Reply                        Funny youshould ask Weve collected

The Week The Spin Feb  contained a terrible error Welfare reform was the hot topic at theNational Governors Association winter meeting Several Republican governorssupported restoration of aid to illegal immigrants which was cut in the newwelfare law            Unfortunately the substitution of illegal immigrants for legal immigrantsin this blurb rendered this passage not only factually inaccurate butpolitically unintelligible The cuts the governors complained about were theelimination of benefits to legal immigrants who heretofore have beentreated pretty much the same as citizens with regard to welfare benefits Thebig cuts were in SSI benefits to current legal immigrants and thesecuts accounted for most of the welfare reform savings In California cuttinglegal immigrants off federal aid simply dumps them onto local taxpayers eventhough millions of poor continue to arrive Your coverage made a complicatedsubject even more obscure and made light of a sea change in the treatment ofimmigrants which carries grave human consequences Was it a simple error ormuddled arrogance                           Freya Schultz                                       DwarvesThrough the
