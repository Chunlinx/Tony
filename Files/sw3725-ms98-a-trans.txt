              okay have you ever   your family have reunions on any regular basis   probably once every five years   once every five years   umhum   yeah um you have a pretty big family   yeah and the hardest part about getting the family the stuff together is everyones spread out all over Timbuktu   oh yeah   and you   yeah weve got a pretty big family but most of us live well im well im originally from West Virginia   umhum   most of the family is right in the West Virginia area uh what they call the Tristate area uh northern West Virginia Eastern Ohio and Southwestern Southwestern Pennsylvania   yeah   most everybody is right in that area   that makes it a lot easier a lot more convenient thats why we only do it once every five or ten years because its like that hard to get everyone together   yeah yeah they put one together for our family about once every June it was on my grandmothers birthday but shes shes gone now   yeah see thats kind of what happened with ours thats why we hadnt had one in a long time   yeah um   so so to make one successful what i mean what do yall do do yall just start planning real far ahead of time   oh shoot pardon   do you um do yall start planning real far ahead of time   well no theres kind of a set pattern to it theres uh so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually   oh really   yeah oh the we get together at the the uh the park uh the uh park and playground area of the church i was raised in   yeah   and uh everybody brings lots of food and well put up a volleyball net just sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat   eat a lot see its a lot harder for us because were like i say were spread out so they have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so everyone can say um   oh goodness yeah scheduled vacation time   their their vacation time   yeah we usually just Saturday Saturday uh Sunday afternoon   umhum   or maybe sometimes its been like on Saturday afternoon usually its like Sunday afternoon and most people dont have more than you know a couple hours drive tops to get there and back   yeah now is that where youre i mean is   well where im calling from is southern Mississippi so we got a ways uh uh my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most   but yall still manage to make them   uh actually weve only made one of them since we got married about four years ago one of the family reunions but were both in school so it makes it kind of tough   yeah yeah   they usually they been happening um just after the summer semester starts   you cant really get away   so usually not we managed to get to one that was before i started to school and she took that summer off but uh   well now that weve been talking about it im gonna im kind of getting home sick now  because its been over three years since ive been home   oh   yeah oh goodness   to see my grandparents or well my my grandfathers the only one thats still around   yeah   and see my grandmother was the one that used to plan the stuff basically   yeah   so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together its kind of like she was like the glue so   yeah i understand where is home for you   originally um i was born in Missouri   yeah   so and you know we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana Mississippi um here in Texas so its harder for everyone to get in get home   yeah yeah well maybe this year you can find a more central location   now well but see the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters so its easier for us few stragglers to go home   oh okay okay the majority of them are still in the Missouri area   yeah   okay yeah our family right now or most theres theres theres only like few stragglers uh if any with any distance yeah some of us theres one cousin uh in Colorado and uh some cousins over in Phoenix uh i got a sister over in in uh Washington state   well   uh rest of them are within you know a couple hours drive   well um how do yall communicate like to plan it and everything do yall just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend were gonna do it or do yall like mail out stuff   thats pretty much it yeah okay its gonna be such and such a weekend and uh yall come  thats about it   yeah   i mean you know this is the standard pattern is the everybody brings their their favorite dish and somebody brings the volleyball net somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon and   well um i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i hadnt seen in probably ten over ten years it was like dont you remember me and im like no   am i related to you yeah i married your cousins brothers uncle uh something like that   yeah i know   do you i mean is that since you i mean do you have them every year   uh yeah theyre every year and and still you wind up meeting people you you you never knew you were related to let alone   well see its probably not that yeah   yeah   well i think thats probably why ours always so interesting is because we dont have them that often and then when we do   yeah   and everyone does finally get together its like after the you know the just like   down right amazing isnt it   yeah
