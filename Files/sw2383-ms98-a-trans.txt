        well in the norman in in the normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first   alrighty  um well i uh have have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so im really just starting to get involved in uh in whats out there and how they do things um as as far as the system as a whole i really dont see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that cant read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think thats the main problem at this point how about yourself   all right im uh live in Plano Texas and uh um   uhhuh   uh today were not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isnt any funding for the school systems in Texas today   right   so uh i mean when you when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they cant get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line somethings wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the theyre not serious theyre more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so im not im more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but   uhhuh   uh its just a shame to me that that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our wellbeing   thats true   i have a i have a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then thats saying that somethings wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that um um matter of fact im very content to send my daughter out out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so im   uhhuh   my my opinion i think i think theres a big concern uh hopefully hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh i dont know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product   yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up   umhum   and uh and not really get down to teaching whats important teaching these kids you know how  really the basics is what it comes down to   exactly i i was astonished to find out that that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed   is that right   half they dont even a lot of the school systems dont even uh the kids nowadays dont even know what what the Presidents uh Fitness Education Programs all about they dont have to do situps and pushups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school   huh i remember   and yeah and uh ill i talked to a thirteen year old last night whos uh goes to uh one of the Plano schools high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting       over the regular gym i mean give me a break i mean the the the kids sit there and they drink and they drink Cokes and eat popcorn for for for lunch for lunch and then go out there and lift weights   and talk yeah   and dont learn anything its just a real i have a real problem with the whole system they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline   huh yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service   umhum   employees that there are and yet theyre so important   i used to i used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level   uhhuh   i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they would that she was paid true she was young you know but still its the principle of course if she got her Masters degree itd all be different but uh   right well you know its hard though because then you start talking taxes and uh  thats bad word     oh taxes lord forbid forbid lord forbid taxes goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads wed cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem     theres an idea   maybe i should run for office huh   run on that then no income taxes in Texas huh im in Texas too so   this is true thats funny thats funny     well gee   well thats about all i have here   well me too i uh i think we both agree theres some problems there but   yes maam   well small maybe do our small part to fix them up   surely ive enjoyed it bye bye   all right you too bye
