                                 Newsweek to Faludi All Is Forgiven            Chatterbox was a bit surprised to see Susan Faludis forthcoming bookStiffed The Betrayal of the American Man  get theredcarpet treatment from Newsweek  The magazine put Faludi on thisweeks cover and inside ran a lengthy excerpt with no fewer than four sidebars to read them clickhere and here and here and here and to top it all off an extremely sympathetic interview with the author Perhaps Chatterbox wouldnt have beenso surprised had he known that Faludi recently became a Newsweekcontributing editor But thats surprising too            Why Because Faludis hugely successful previous book Backlash  was in large part an attack on wellNewsweek  Backlash is remembered as a broadside against sculture as a whole and to quote its subtitle its undeclared war againstAmerican women That culture is represented in Backlash mainly throughthe news media which if you read the book quickly comes off as uniformlyhostile toward feminism But if you take a closer look youll notice that somenews outlets come off worse than others Faludi doesnt make a big deal ofthis presumably because she never really intended Backlash to be acritique of particular news organizations so much as well a broadside againstthe culture as a whole That the culture as a whole quickly turned Faludisbook into a runaway bestseller has always suggested to Chatterbox thatBacklashs thesis was an oversimplification            According to Faludis acknowledgements Backlash began as a story forthe San Jose Mercury Newss Sunday magazine debunking an unpublishedacademic study by David Bloom a Harvard economist and Patricia Craig a Yalegraduate student purporting to show that nevermarried collegeeducated womenfaced at age  only a  percent chance of getting hitched in theirlifetimes The findings became famous when they landed on the cover of Newsweek  Much of Backlash is dedicated to demolishing both theBloomCraig research itself and Newsweeks further distortion of itmostfamously Newsweeks preposterous claim that a single gal was morelikely to be killed by a terrorist than to find a mate Faludi writes that                                             a former Newsweek bureau intern who was involved in the storyspreparation later explains how the terrorist analogy wound up in the magazineWhat happened is one of the bureau reporters was going around saying it as ajokelike Yeah a womans more likely to get bumped off by a terroristandnext thing we knew one of the writers in New York took it seriously and itended up in print                                                      Newsweek also gets cuffed about in Backlash for decrying theemotional fallout of feminism for hyping cocooning a trend pretty muchinvented by Faith Popcorn for attacking the myth of Supermom for runningtwo covers on the trend of childlessness and for exaggerating the problem ofdrug addiction among pregnant mothers among other sins In many instancesFaludis digs at Newsweek are actually somewhat unfair The conflictbetween womens traditional motherhood role and their increased participationin the workplace isnt just something dreamed up by newsmagazine writers Butthat isnt the point The point is that an implicit theme running throughoutBacklash is that in a world plagued by stupid superficial journalismNewsweek is stupider and more superficial than most print outlets Thatdoesnt make Faludi a hypocrite for becoming a contributing editor atNewsweek  Even if she thinks the magazine is no better now than it wasin the s she probably figures shell help it improve But look at thisweeks Faludimania cover package from Newsweeks point of view Theyreheaping laurels onto someone whos called them a bunch of sexist ninnies Isthis an admirable show of openmindedness a pathetic demonstration of lowselfesteem or inevitable mindless worship of whatever is hot Perhaps a bitof each
