                                 Heads Up                                             SleepyHollow                is Tim Burtons first fullgallop Grand Guignol gutbuckethorror picture He has always borrowed from the genre but his scary motifswere leavened with homey oneswith elements inspired by cartoons Dr Seussand tacky Japanese giantmonster flicks Burtons early creatures howeverfantastic had a sadly mundane aura like the ghosts in Beetlejuice who looked so silly in their designer sheets that they couldnt evenfrighten a child In his new movie a ghost not only frightens a child itbeheads him Burtons take on Washington Irvings legendary headless horsemanis one of the great nightmare images in movies Our first glimpse is over hisshoulder as he hurtles through the woods after a fleeing servant We hear thescrape of a sword as its unsheathed and barely see it sweep across the frameand pop the victims noggin into the airso fast that the head seems to havebeen shocked off its torso The carnage ends before we can exhale            Burtons imagery has anecstatic intensity its too bad that the movieloosely based on the Irvingclassic about a ghost who haunts New Yorks Hudson Valley in the decades afterthe American Revolutionhas been constructed as a sort of proto Hound ofthe Baskervilles  In the screenplay credited to Andrew Kevin Walker Seven   but reportedly rewritten by Tom Stoppard theschoolteacher Ichabod Crane is now a New York City constable Johnny Depp whotravels upstate to solve a series of beheadings using the fledgling sciences ofpathology and deduction The idea is that Crane clings to scientific principlein the face of the supernaturalhe dumbfounds the locals by insisting that thekiller is human and appalls them by performing an autopsy on a female victimI was looking forward to the first thriller in ages without yucko autopsiesbut theres no dodging them these days It soon becomes apparent that solvingthe mystery will require a blend of reason and superstitiona mightystretch for a young man whose life is pledged to rationalism and whoseunconscious roils with visions of his freespirited mother Lisa Marie beingbrutalized by a Bibleblack tyrant of

Murder She Wrote             But you dont go to a Tim Burton picture for the narrativeriches you go because no one else packs this kind of emotion into a moviesdesign Sleepy Hollow is a ferocious yet lyrical piece of filmmakinganenchanted bloodbath In Ichabods fever dream his mother levitates and twirlsamid snowy blossoms and all Burtons feeling for his paramour Lisa Mariecomes throughhe paints her as the most vulnerable of spellcasters You knowfrom the start youre in a grand playpen for horror buffsfull of mistscovered bridges glowing pumpkinhead scarecrows black oaks that seem frozenin death throes In the haunted western woods Crane and his juvenile assistantMarc Pickering who resembles a young Burton tromp over dead leaves whileabove them the bare trees bend together at their tops

staging and editing actionsince the relatively crude martialarts battles of Batman  Thehorseman is like a samurai Terminator dismounted he comes at his victimsrelentlessly from all angles I dont know if Walken also plays the horsemansans head if he doesnt someone has done a hilarious job of recreatinghis chesty swagger Visually and aurally the attack scenes are built Leaves rustle torches go out in curly wisps of smoke hoofbeats start softlyand end up pounding your head Danny Elfmans crashing gongs andchoppingblade strings pound your head too The comic touches deepen thehorror In the first killing Ichabod witnesses the victims head doesnt justfly offit spins like a dervish and bounces between Ichabods legs where thepassing horseman skewers it like a marshmallow As he thunders off he knocks asmall scarecrow which spins aroundthe perfect button for the sequenceThen Ichabod keels over in a dead faint            This is Depps most ingratiating performance amarvelous blend of passion and parody His Ichabod is a little boy making likeBasil Rathbone Puffedup with conceit he takes in a new piece of evidence byraising his eyebrows expelling a hmmm and spinning around to announce hislatest theory to locals who regard him with a mixture of awe and embarrassmentBurton relishes squirting blood in this knowitalls face Ichabod is themovies dashing hero and also the butt of its jokes Depp and Christina Riccias Von Tassels witchy daughter are everything you could hope for in astorybook couple Its too bad Riccis dry flat voiceso wonderful in moderncomedies when it plays against those saucer eyes and angelbabyfeaturessounds amateurish amid all these declamatory Brits            Burtons work inSleepy Hollow is transporting but not it should be said to the HudsonValley circa  Were actually in England circa the late s and the swhen a studio called Hammer Films was churning out cheap but ritzylookingGothic melodramas In all of them scenes of repressive formality hoaryEnglish actors sipping sherry in drawing rooms would be shattered by scenes ofDionysian release Dracula or some other fanged entity swooping down in ananimalistic frenzy and an aristocratic figure of both science and Christianfaithusually the crisply selfsatisfied Peter Cushingwould show up tolecture the frightened villagers and pound a stake through the heaving bosom ofsome temptress Cushing alas is gone but Burton has cast Hammer stalwartsChristopher Lee in a too brief cameo as the burgomaster who dispatches Craneto Sleepy Hollow and Michael Gough also seen as Alfred in the Batmanfilms as a oneeyed accountant He has duplicated some memorable Hammercompositions and has gotten the tone of those old pictures just right LikeBurton I was weaned on Hammer horror I raise a goblet of blood to him forbringing it all so blissfully back            Many people who go see the documentary                   AmericanMovie                directed by Chris Smith and produced by Sarah Price will expectto revisit the title character of Burtons Ed Wood  a stumblebumwho maintained a cockeyed optimismand obliviousnessin the face ofinfinitesimal budgets and what amounted to an antitalent for continuity Butthe film the story of a yearold Wisconsin wouldbe moviemaker named MarkBorchardt and his efforts to finish a nobudget horror short calledCoven which he mispronounces throughout with a long o turns intosomething much fullerand much less easy to laugh off For one thing itsprotagonist isnt oblivious He has a surfeit of selfloathing disparaging hiswork even as he struggles to get it on screen In debt and with a couple ofkids to support juggling jobs as a cemetery custodian and a paper boyBorchardt oscillates between a tendency to drink and dream and a drive tocreate and compete With an extended family that regards himnot apparentlywithout reasonas a dreamer and a bull artist Borchardt sometimes comes offlike Gods loneliest man            The documentary beginswith his attempt to cast a feature called Northwestern  which seemsmeant as a cri de coeur for a generation of Midwestern druggies When hecant raise the money and concludes Aesthetically Im not ready Borchardthauls the abandoned Coven out of mothballs in spite of its stiltedperformances and sets about the seemingly impossible task of raising money tofinish it Most of those funds will come from Borchardts elderly and skeletaluncle Bill who lives in a ramshackle trailer but has evidently managed tosock away hundreds of thousands of dollars The attempt to wheedle money out ofthe caustic and notquitethere old man is the real glory of AmericanMovie  As Borchardt shows Bill pictures of pretty actresses offers him acredit as an executive producer buys him booze and promises big profits andglory down the road I see great cinema in this Cinnamon theirrelationship becomes a bleak absurdist parody of all artists and theirmoneymen And yet somehow it ends warmlyeven beautifullyfor both            As I watched American Movie  a lot of it struck meas untranscendent misery But in hindsight it seems less hopeless That mightbe because Smith and Prices smart and compassionate work has given Borchardtand his cohorts a measure of celebrity which removes the sting ofnonentityness Fans who visit the American Movie Web site will findsuch features as Borchardts daily diary and a phone number for his buddy MikeSchank a lovable PCP casualty and talented musicianIf hes home and in themood hell pick up Aint the Internet grand The vision may also seem lessgrim because when Coven finally premieres at the end of AmericanMovie  the images were shown from it have a certain George Romeroishgraphic powernot at all what we expect from the comically inept productionprocess Without seeing his work all the way through its hard for me to saywhether Borchardt has talent but he might not be such a stumblebum afterall            Already in the three years since this documentarywas shot digital technology has made moviemaking at this level moreaffordablewhich means that the road for impoverished filmmakers likeBorchardt will soon be less grueling But there will be a lotalot more of them American Movie suggests that theres no suchthing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore The American Dream hasbecome making movies If American Movie is a hit the American Dreammight become making movies about the American Dream of making movies
