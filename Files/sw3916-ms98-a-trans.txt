           to face the situation where you were looking at putting a loved one in the nursing home   well i were sort of in the middle of it um   really   last February we brought my mother from Florida to us here in Texas and so far she has been with us but i really look to the future that it may be occurring um i dont know what ill do i im almost inclined to hire somebody um to be in our home with her rather than have to   umhum umhum   put her somewhere you know but   uhhuh you dont feel as though that thats a decision youre comfortable with because   well i think  partly and its not me its the it seems to me the older generation my mother and father and my inlaws   youd be     um you know the stigma used to be you went there and and you died and so they have all kind of   you feel as though they are being abandoned if you leave them somewhere   right you know it just um and you try and say you know theyre nice now or or nicer and       you know i wouldnt want her in one in Florida because i couldnt check on her but if she were in one near here i i would probably be there     uhhuh uhhuh   you know several times per week and i would   sure   stand up and scream if i saw things that were you know  improper or or uh you know her care was not   umhum umhum its difficult boy i really   have you had that experience yet   can appreciate no i havent but um   well   i i work in a hospital and we see patients   oh   whose families are just not able to care for them once theyve left the hospital and so they have to make that decision often when the patients still in the hospital   right its uh well my father died several years ago and that was you know he had cancer and eventually the hospital comes and says you know your father uh care you know Medicare says he doesnt need the level of care to be hospitalized so you are going to   uhhuh   eventually theyll come and tell you you will have two days  to you know move him somewhere else and and that my mother and i needed to think what do we want to do at that point we did because he was   so then you begin right   not yet comatose but real close and he lived two weeks in the nursing home so we did do that but um at at that time three and a half years ago my mother was in such a   umhum umhum   state of depression i didnt think she could handle even if we had full time around the clock care i didnt think   yes   emotionally she could handle him being there it  well it yes that too you you know there is no question that uh   yes its a challenging job physically   just moving them about is um difficult but it really is and its just uh and i have friends whose were all in the age group where   umhum   were thinking about some of these things for our parents and it really is uh   yes yes what are some of the things that you have looked for for example with your father what what helped you identify an appropriate placement was it was it geographic was it how close it was to you or   with well of course this again was in Florida actually the level of care and in fact two that we looked at were you know they were all in mauve and blue and very elegant looking and   oh thats right   and so on but i didnt like the fact that they had you know eight patients for one uh you know nurse or one care giver and the one we selected was not nearly as   care giver uhhuh   uh up to date however it was clean  and the patients were well cared for and i like it because it had a level of five to one and i felt that  that would be   yes     better care for my father uh and but several of her neighbors and friends oh but you ought to i said i know but   umhum   were making this decision and my mom basically let me make the decision so   umhum   um and she was pleased with it because he did get um you know just wonderful care   thats a pretty important factor too that really influences the degree   oh absolutely i dont care what you know one of these had a little ice cream parlor and i looked at the manager i said my father you know will never get out of a bed i dont care about a ice cream parlor       you know if you went there and you were in your seventies and well you just went there to a you know retirement center yes you could do all that good stuff but this was   more a transitional setting uhhuh   i wanted him cared for and and not left uh you know if he spoiled his linens or something i did not want that   exactly   you know there what do you do in a hospital work with okay all right   my job is as occupational therapist um a lot of what we are looking at are are skills that the person is gonna have to be able to perform to be able to live independently once they leave the hospital and we sometimes help the family make that decision if it looks like theyre gonna be able to get in and out of bed or on and off the toilet with just a little bit of help then thats something that they can manage but you youre talking about an elderly spouse and when it involves quite a bit of assistance and lifting you dont want the other person   right
