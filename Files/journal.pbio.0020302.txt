                            I need a tricorderthe convenient handheld device featured on         Star Trek that can detect life forms even from orbit Unfortunately we        dont have a clue how a tricorder might work since life forms dont seem to have any        observable property that distinguishes them from inanimate matter Furthermore we lack a        definition of life that can guide a search for life outside Earth How can we find what we        cant define An answer may lie in the observation that life uses a small discrete set of        organic molecules as basic building blocks On the surface of Europa and in the subsurface        of Mars we can search for alien but analogous patterns in the organics                    Life As We Know It        The obvious diversity of life on Earth overlies a fundamental biochemical and genetic        similarity The three main polymers of biologythe nucleic acids the proteins and the        polysaccaridesare built from  amino acids five nucleotide bases and a few sugars        respectively Together with lipids and fatty acids these are the main constituents of        biomass the hardware of life Lehninger  p  The DNA and RNA software of life is        also common indicating shared descent Woese  But with only one example of lifelife        on Earthit is not all that surprising that we do not have a fundamental understanding of        what life is We dont know which features of Earth life are essential and which are just        accidents of history        Our lack of data is reflected in our attempts to define life Koshland  lists        seven features of life  program DNA  improvisation response to environment         compartmentalization  energy  regeneration  adaptability and  seclusion        chemical control and selectivity A simpler definition is that life is a material system        that undergoes reproduction mutation and natural selection McKay  Cleland and        Chyba  have suggested that life might be like water hard to define        phenomenologically but easy to define at the fundamental level But life is like fire not        waterit is a process not a pure substance Such definitions are grist for philosophical        discussion but they neither inform biological research nor provide a basis for the search        for life on other worlds        The simplest but not the only proof of life is to find something that is alive There        are only two properties that can determine if an object is alive metabolism and motion        Metabolism is used here to include an organisms life functions biomass increase and        reproduction All living things require some level of metabolism to remain viable against        entropy Movement either microscopic or macroscopic in response to stimuli or in the        presence of food can be a convincing indicator of a living thing But both metabolism        fire and motion wind occur in nature in the absence of biology        The practical approach to the search for life is to determine what life needs The        simplest list is probably energy carbon liquid water and a few other elements such as        nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus McKay  Life requires energy to maintain itself        against entropy as does any selforganizing open system In the memorable words of Erwin        Schrdinger  It feeds on negative entropy On Earth the vast majority of life        forms ultimately derive their energy from sunlight The only other source of primary        productivity known is chemical energy and there are only two ecosystems known both        methanogenbased Stevens and McKinley  Chapelle et al  that rely exclusively        on chemical energy that is they do not use sunlight or its product oxygen        Photosynthetic organisms can use sunlight at levels below the level of sunlight at the        orbit of Pluto Ravens et al  therefore energy is not the limitation for life        Carbon nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus are the elements of life and they are abundant in        the Solar System Indeed the Sun and the outer Solar System have more than  times        the carbon content of the bulk of Earth McKay  When we scan the other worlds of our        Solar System the missing ecological ingredient for life is liquid water It makes sense        then that the search for liquid water is currently the first step in the search for life        on other worlds The presence of liquid water is a powerful indication that the ecological        prerequisites for life are satisfied        Orbital images such as the canyon in Figure  show clear evidence of the stable and        repeated if not persistent flow of a lowviscosity fluid on Mars at certain times in its        past history The fluid was probably water but the images could also suggest wind ice        lava even carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide Recently results from the Mars Exploration        Rover missions have shown that this liquid carried salts and precipitated hematite in        concretions The case for water we could say is tight        On Jupiters moon Europa the cracks and icebergs on the surface of the ice indicate        water beneath the ice but not necessarily at the present time Present water on Europa is        indicated by the magnetic disturbance Europa makes as it moves through Jupiters magnetic        field not unlike the way coins in the pocket of a passenger will set off an airport metal        detector Europa has a large conductor and this is most likely a global salty layer of        water                    Viking on Mars Been There Tried That        The Viking missions to Mars in the late s were the first and as yet the only        search for life outside Earth Each Viking conducted three incubation experiments to detect        the presence of metabolism in the Martian soil Each lander also carried a sophisticated        Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer for characterizing organic molecules The results were        unexpected Klein   There was a detectable reaction in two of the incubation        experiments In the Gas Exchange experiment a burst of oxygen was released when the soil        was exposed to water The Labeled Release experiment showed that organic material was        consumed and that carbon dioxide was released concomitantly In the Labeled Release        experiment this reaction ceased if the soil was first heated to sterilizing temperatures        but the reaction of the Gas Exchange Experiment persisted        If considered alone the Labeled Release results would be a plausible indication for        life on Mars However the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer did not detect the presence        of any organic molecules in the soil at level of one part per billion Biemann  It is        difficult to imagine life without associated organic material and this is the main        argument against a biological interpretation of the Viking results Klein  but cf        Levin and Straat  It is also unlikely that the oxygen release in the Gas Exchange        experiment had a biological explanation because the reaction was so rapid and persisted        after heating It is generally thought that the reactivity observed by the Viking biology        experiments was caused by one or more inorganic oxidants present in the soil and was        ultimately produced by ultraviolet light in the atmosphere Consistent with the apparently        negative results of the Viking biology experiments the surface of Mars also appears to be        too dry for life Indeed conditions are such that liquid water is rare and transient if        it occurs at all eg Hecht                     Its Life Jim but Not As We Know It        Table  shows a categorization of life as we have observed it Using this diagram we        can speculate about how life might be different on Mars or Europa At the bottom of the        table life is composed of mattera reasonable assumption for now Carbon and liquid water        are the next level this makes Mars and Europa likely candidates because they have carbon        and have or have had liquid water Other worlds may have a different chemical baseline        for life The usual speculation in this area is that the presence of ammonia and silicon        rather than water and carbon might be preconditions for life on other planets Such        speculation has yet to lead to any specific suggestions for experiments or to new ways to        search for such life but this may just reflect a failure of human imagination rather than        a fundamental limitation on the nature of life        Life on Mars is also likely to be the same at the top of the table at the ecological        level Primary production in a Martian ecosystem is likely to be phototrophic using carbon        dioxide and water Heterotrophs are likely to be present to consume the phototrophs and in        turn to be consumed by predators Darwinian evolution would result in many of the same        patterns we see in ecosystems on Earth While it may be similar at the top ecological and        bottom chemical levels life on Mars could be quite alien in the middle in the realm of        biochemistry Pace  has argued that alien biochemistry will turn out to be the same        as biochemistry on Earth because there is one best way to do things and that natural        selection will ensure that life everywhere discovers that way Only observation will tell        if there is one possible biochemistry or many        Future missions to Mars might find microfossils in sedimentary rocks such as those at        Meridiani Planum Microbes dont readily form convincing fossils the one exception may be        the strings of magnetite formed by magnetotactic bacteria Friedmann et al  As        interesting as fossils might be we could not be sure that a fossil found on Mars was not        merely another example of Earth life We know that rocks have come to Earth from Mars and        it is possible that such rocks could have carried life between the planets Mileikowsky et        al  Weiss et al  Finding fossil evidence for life on Mars does not demonstrate        a second genesis in our Solar System                    Finding a Way to Search for Alien Life        If we were to find organic material in the subsurface of Mars or on the ice of Europa        how could we determine whether it was the product of a system of biology or merely abiotic        organic material from meteorites or photochemistry If this life were in fact related to        Earth life this should be easy to determine We now have very sensitive methods such as        PCR and fluorescent antibody markers for detecting life like us This case would be the        simplest to determine but it would also be the least interesting If the life turned out        to be truly alien then the probes specific to our biology would be unlikely to work What        then could we do to determine a biological origin        The question is open and possibly urgent On space missions already being planned we        may have the opportunity to analyze the remains of alien organics on the surface of Europa        or frozen below ground on Mars The instruments that will make this analysis must be        designed in the next couple of years        One approach appears promising I call it the Lego Principle It is based on the        patterns of the molecules of life Biological processes in contrast to abiotic mechanisms        do not make use of the range of possible organic molecules Instead biology is built from        a selected set Thus organic molecules that are chemically very similar to each other may        have widely different concentrations in a sample of biological organics An example of this        on Earth is the  amino acids used in proteins and the use of the lefthanded version of        these amino acids The selectivity of biological processes is shown schematically in Figure         by the distribution of spikes in contrast to a smooth nonbiological distribution        General arguments of thermodynamic efficiency and specificity of enzymatic reactions        suggest that this selectivity is required for biological function and is a general result        of natural selection Different life forms are likely to have different patterns and at        the very least we might find the mirror symmetry of life on Earth with         d  instead of         l amino acids        This approach has immediate practical benefit in the search for biochemistry in the        Solar System Samples of organic material collected from Mars and Europa can be easily        tested for the prevalence of one chirality of amino acid over the other More generally a        complete analysis of the relative concentration of different types of organic molecules        might reveal a pattern that is biological even if that pattern does not involve any of the        familiar biomolecules Interestingly if a sample of organics from Mars or Europa shows a        preponderance of Damino acids this would be evidence of life and at the same time would        show that this life was distinct from Earth life This same conclusion would apply to any        clearly biological pattern that was distinct from that of Earth life        Organic material of biological origin will eventually lose its distinctive pattern when        exposed to heat and other types of radiation examples of this include the thermal        racemization of amino acids but at the low temperatures in the Martian permafrost        calculations suggest that there has been no thermal alteration Kanavarioti and Mancinelli         An interesting question as yet unanswered is how long organic material frozen into        the surface ice of Europa would retain a biological signature in the strong radiation        environment        On Europa the organic material for our tests might be collected right from the dark        regions on the surface On Mars there is icerich ground in the cratered southern polar        regions Feldmann et al  which presumably overlies deeper older ice The surprise        discovery of strong magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere of Mars Acua et al         Connerney et al  indicates that the area may be the oldest undisturbed permafrost on        that planet Like the mammoths extracted from the ice in Siberia any Martian microbes        found in this ice would be dead but their biochemistry would be preserved From these        biological remains it would then be possible to determine the biochemical composition of        and the phylogenetic relationship between Earth life and Martian life We may then have        for the first time a second example of life
