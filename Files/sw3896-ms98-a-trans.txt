              well what kind of exercise do you do   uh well on a daily basis uh at lunch time i take a brisk walk for twenty minutes along with a friend at work   okay   i am uh paying for a lifetime membership with Presidents Health Spa     youre paying for it but not utilizing it too much   well i dont i dont get there very often but um  i figure one of these days i will   um yeah im not im not currently uh enrolled in a athletic club or anything uh i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or its a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but um uh i try to get out as much as i can   umhum umhum well i have an exercise bike um also thats thats in my my house   yeah   and it just sits there     sits there and collects dust huh   umhum not doing me  very much good   uh i i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i havent been as inspired  to get out and do as much   umhum umhum well i im from New York and im a lot more inspired here in Dallas than i was there  because theres a lot more uh open space   yeah   and you just you just see a lot more people doing it you know outside outside all of the time   yeah i i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular   and   schedule to work working out inside id much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing   hm umhum speaking of bicycling i saw a uh a video in uh Blockbusters and it was something for you to sit on your bike and look at while youre youre um youre doing your workout have you   uhhuh oh is it like a scenery or something   yeah its like youre going through hills or something and its   yeah i guess you can put it in a higher gear if  you wanted wanted to pretend youre going up the hill   yeah have you  have you watched one of those yeah   no i havent but i i have seen some things uh uh advertised in videos like that and ive heard some athletic clubs have uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer uh when when it shows youre going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that   oh wow   and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or something like that   yeah yeah um i keep saying im going to um rent one and maybe i ill get to to get on my bike and and use it   yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time ive tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because its so hard to get outside and   umhum   and and do much in the way of either you like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there there is a Y very close i guess i could do that   umhum umhum well they have those steppers in Presidents although i havent i havent used one of them but i do see people on them and they theyre supposed to be really really really a great uh workout   there they they do work you pretty good and um other things ive used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines arent to bad and one of the best ones although good for people who arent used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people dont like it because they dont feel like they they have good   umhum umhum   balance i guess its it its better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those   umhum yeah ive been on the rowing machine at uh Presidents and uh i i like that   whats the ive ive heard some other people uh not too happy with Presidents uh they join and then it seems like that they dont have a lot of good things to say about it     well well one thing i find that you know once the first time i joined and went in there they they measured me and weighed and weighed me and all this stuff and wrote my name down on a little card and they show take you around they show you all the equipment and then you never see hear from them again you know you youre really basically on your own   oh the yeah   you know they tell you how many of these to do and many of those to do and then you you know they never like call you back and say well its time for us to see how   yeah
