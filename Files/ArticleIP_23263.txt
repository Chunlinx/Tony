                                                            LoebBlow                        I am pained by the of me in                  Slate                for writing an essay on personal finance that ranin a special advertising section in the March  issue of Time  Much orall of the criticism is based on a false assumption that I was paid byTime for this assignment            In fact I did not receive payment fromanybodynot one penny Time did offer to pay me a fee sizeunspecified I declined But I suggested that Time might want to make acontribution to one of the charities of which I am an officer and directorRecording for the Blind  Dyslexic Time  of course was pleased todo so I do not know the size of this contribution My name will in no way beattached to it I certainly will not receive a tax deduction for it I willreceive no credit for it in any way To reiterate as emphatically as I can Iwas not paid by Time  not paid by Time Inc not paid by theadvertisers not paid by anybody in any way This a key point that I shouldhave clarified and corrected earlier            So why did I accept the writing assignment I didit because Time offers a magnificent platform because I frankly dontmind the limelight and because I believe that the counsel and cautions I haveto offer about personal finance may be useful to other people            This is also a good timefor me to reiterate that the Columbia Journalism Review was is andalways will be independent toughminded fair and impartial in all itsjudgments             Marshall Loeb                        Editor Columbia Journalism ReviewNew York City                                             Judith Shulevitz replies When I interviewed MarshallLoeb he said according to my notes I am paid by Time Inc He did not tellme that the payment had been made to charity and not to him personally He nowsays he does not remember whether the decision to give it to charity was madebefore or after my item appeared He also says that payment for the first twoadvertorials went to his book publisher and that he also did not profitdirectly or indirectly This is something else he did not mention in ourinterview It seems clear that Loeb has not personally profited from writingadvertorials I think my misunderstanding on this point is understandable butI apologize for suggesting otherwise I still think it is wrong from someone inLoebs position to be writing advertorials even for free                                       Game Over andOver                        Your discussion of the winners curse as it relatesto online auctions see  overlooked one very important point the multipliereffect that comes from the power of the Internet to reduce transactioncosts            Lets take video games as an example Over the lastfive years I have bought one or two new video games a year ones that seemed sogreat that they were worth the  The main reason I only bought one or twowas I knew that after playing them I would generally be stuck with them SureI might be able to sell them to a used software store but I wouldnt be ableto get more than  or so because those stores must mark them up sosubstantially to cover their own costs Now thanks to Internet auctions eBaybeing my personal favorite I can do most of my game shopping online When Iwas interested in picking up the new smash hit Unreal  I went to eBayand saw that over the past month some  or so copies of that game had beenauctioned for about  each Over the following week or so I tracked the  to auctions for Unreal that were going on and I eventually won a copyfor  plus  shipping The game arrived I played it for a few weeks andthen I put it back up for auction right there on eBay and made back almost allof my money            Now that consumers know that there is a fluidaftermarket for video games they are more likely to go into a store and buyone of these games for full price on the day it comes out They know that theycan play it and auction it off right away online when its value is still quitehigh The net result is not only far more transactions at much lower costs butalso a sharp increase in market participation thanks to the pricediscrimination seen over time If youre not willing to pay  wait a fewmonths until the online market is only going for             In addition any effects of the winners curse areoffset by the fact that losing bidders become winning sellers when theyreauction products The winners curse can therefore be said not to exist forproducts that we buy enjoy and resell without using up their inherentvalue            The winners curse may bepervasive in auctions for Beanie Babies and Faye Dunaways eye mask but thatis in large part because those items have such little inherent value and theycan lose their public appeal overnight Even there though the magic of theInternet auction helps out one last time He who has overpaid for FayeDunaways eye mask can enjoy it for a bit and then put it right back up forauction                           Bart ScottEpstein                        Charlottesville Va                           A Kosovar by AnyOther Name                        Just a point ofclarificationthese refugees from Kosovo are Kosovars not ethnic Albaniansas much of the media keep singing If they are not Kosovars then Jesse Jacksonis an ethnic African Dan Rather is an ethnic German and Simon Wiesenthalis an ethnic Jew and so on Please label things correctly Calling theKosovars ethnic Albanians makes it sound as if they are really Albaniansthough they have lived in

fromhitting the Serbian forces purging the refugees when it didnt seem to hamperthe bombing of Belgrade  The papers have shed little light on how poorweather can impede various missions            Heres the answerBombing buildings in Belgrade or other fixed sites with known coordinates canbe accomplished by GPS Global Positioning System a satellite navigationserviceguided weapons such as Tomahawk missiles It is not necessary to beable to see the target Bombing mobile targets such as troops performingethnic cleansing requires the use of laserguided weapons Because we dontknow in advance where these targets will be we cant use GPSguided weaponsand laserguided weapons require clear weather to operate             Lt Cmdr SeanPeters  US Navy            Chesapeake Va
