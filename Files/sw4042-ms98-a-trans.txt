            topic is recycling today and actually im pretty hot about the topic right now yes i am   oh you are youre youre into uh recycling   im into recycling ive got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact   umhum what materials do you recycle   i recycle glass plastic and aluminum also paper and plastic bags   umhum   and i uh in Dallas we recently had a report on the news in the evening about whats being done with the recycled the recycling materials   umhum   and green glass and several other items but green glass in particular is being tossed into the landfills and i got really hot about that because my husband my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale and its packed in green glass   so so youre trying to take action to have that changed   well yeah im im racking my brain thinking okay where can i what can i do to take action on this the only recycling plant i think in the south is in Atlanta   umhum   and theyre paying i think eighteen cents for every hundred pounds of green glass   right so economically its not a situation where youre going be able to attract a lot of attention   no im not but ive got   right   good gosh ive got probably twenty or thirty pounds of it in my yard right now   umhum   waiting for a recycling place to take it to and i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that   well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was   yeah   forty five cents a pound and now its twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound   umhum   so it uh  theres not a lot of money to be made but its just a question of trying to help the environment   no well thats the thats the thing is  i uh i would rather help my environment and uh when i turn in glass and aluminum i turn it in to my church which has a community center   umhum   and the community center uses the money to help with an after school program to help keep kids off the streets and to to give them a fighting chance in the world in regards to education and i think thats a real worthwhile project and   right   thats really what got me started recycling was this uh community center   hm yeah where  where i work we recycle paper thats about it   so do you which kind of paper computer paper   yeah any any um noncolored noncolored or nonfilm type paper just white paper and that sort of thing   oh any uhhuh oh uhhuh but do they recycle computer paper   and   i mean like the the green and white barred   uh oh we dont use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated   oh you dont use that paper okay   for personal printers and then like LaserJet type paper   oh yeah  uhhuh   we dont use the green bar type paper any more   the old the old green bars umhum   right   yeah because our our church also recycles computer paper and i dont know why i was thinking it was just the old green bar style as opposed to   umhum   even the personal uh letter sized   well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where theyre not really breaking even on their recycling i mean   uh well   unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing   yeah we have volunteers and theres not that its not that wide of a participation participation just yet   umhum   so although with my friends helping we we contribute quite a bit of glass we all have children and quite a few of the children are in baby food   umhum   and those baby food jars believe it or not really add up fast   right well there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then theyre collected on a regular basis   so oh yeah curbside recycling   right   yeah they have that in Houston and in Dallas and i saw another report where in Houston they take the bins and they load them up into the truck in the separate areas in the truck   right   and the truck goes and dumps all of it into one landfill       that got me heated up too       that got me real heated up a friend of my mothers told her about that and she was telling me about it and then i saw a report on TV too and i thought why are we going through this trouble and i had a report tell me why we are we go through the trouble because everybodys worried about the environment and now that we have uh the the smaller the lay people worried about the environment now we have to get the businesses worried about using the recycled product that not that many businesses are   right
