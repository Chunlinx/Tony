        so do you do a lot of camping     uh well yeah a fair amount mostly with boy scouts   oh is that right uhhuh um my sons are in the boy scouts also uh so i know they go a lot of camping but i dont go with them but uh we used to live in California and we did a little bit of camping in California not all that much but um enough to get a little flavor for it uh where mostly do you go with your camping   well mostly uh well boy scout camps near uh near Dallas uh in in fact i i think i know your sons Danny and Sean right Jan Novak   oh who am i talking to oh i cant believe that  well we can talk about anything  well   but we can talk about camping none the less they didnt   you know this is really funny because i ive tried to make these phone calls um whenever it pops in my head and sometimes they say oh we cant find another party and after they they say that two times i cant keep hanging on the phone and i just saw that card down there and now im really supposed to be baking bread for Cistercian  i said oh ill make another phone call i guess another five dollars helps  so anyway   but we we should talk about camping because theyre recording this   oh we have to talk about oh thats right were on this recording thing well anyway um we used to go camping out in California up by Mendocino and um  to um uh Lasson Park which is a volcanic a volcanic park and uh that was absolutely extraordinary and the rangers there that uh   umhum   do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were quite extraordinary so that was uh one of our uh major camping times that we enjoyed very very much uh do you ever go camping outside of the boy scouts   well we used to do a lot of camping uh in fact before we had kids Marie and i would go we did a lot of canoe camping uh either in upstate New York where there are a lot of lakes up near Lake Placid and in that area and in Northern Ontario which is also full of lakes   oh yes uhhuh   and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you you canoe   oh my   uh from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake   umhum umhum um   and so that that was a i i think its a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you you dont have to watch the weight so much   umhum   and its also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and its very easy to keep keep cool and keep clean   oh thats true too uhhuh     and thats   we took one canoe trip in California now but the boys were very very small when we were out there and um it was a friend of Webbies that got this group together and uh there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and um i i i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the Russian River yeah   what what river was that yeah ive seen ive seen the Russian River we never went canoeing on it that that can get pretty fast   yeah yeah yeah it can and it did and um it was my first time it was Webbies first time doing this also and we just trusted uh trusted in the uh knowledge of this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our   umhum   life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and uh you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didnt go again the next day we just uh kind of uh   umhum   stayed by camp site and uh cooked  but it it was it was very exciting and   sure sure   really very nice and um i wouldnt mind doing something like that again and i guess the first time you do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte you dont know exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do  but um it it was quite an experience uh   yeah well you you have to be careful   umhum umhum yeah yeah so   you have to be careful your your guys are going to Philmont are they   oh yes well Sean is Daniel went last summer so   again right so Dannys not going again   no no no hes not gonna go again this time but uh youre gonna inherit Sean on this trip and uh umhum   okay well ill im going with them so   i know uhhuh have you been out there before oh you havent well Daniel says its i think its really quite challenging   no really   uh absolutely uh i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part
