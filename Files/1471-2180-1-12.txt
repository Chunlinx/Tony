                    Background        Hepadnaviruses are small enveloped hepatotropic viruses        which replicate by reverse transcription of a pregenomic        RNA molecule   for reviews see    The replication        of hepadnaviral DNA is initiated by the interaction of the        viral reverse transcriptase P with an RNA stemloop         within a terminal duplication of the pregenomic RNA P        binds to the  copy of  and then begins DNA synthesis        using a tyrosine residue near its own aminoterminus as a        primer DNA synthesis arrests after  nucleotides and        then the proteinlinked nascent minusstrand DNA is        transferred to the copy of direct repeat  DR within the         terminal duplication This nascent DNA then acts as a        primer for the synthesis of full length minusstrand DNA        templated by the pregenomic RNA               During synthesis of the minusstrand DNA the pregenomic RNA        is degraded by the ribonuclease H RNAseH activity of P        However the RNAseH activity does not digest the extreme         end of the template RNA and this   nucleotide capped        RNA fragment is then transferred to direct repeat  DR        where it acts as a primer for synthesis of plusstrand DNA                  The hepadnaviral P protein possesses many unique        features relative to the better studied reverse        transcriptases of the retroviruses i it uses its own        aminoterminal domain as a protein primer for initiation of        DNA synthesis     ii it cannot be isolated in an        active form from virions without partial proteolysis or        denaturation     and iii under normal        circumstances it is active only on the endogenous        pregenomic RNA that is encapsidated with it in the viral        cores   The mechanism of this template commitment is        unknown although the covalent linkage between P and the        viral DNA is likely to contribute to it        RNAseH cleaves the RNA strand in a RNADNA heteroduplex        but it does not cleave DNA or RNA that is not hybridized to        DNA The RNAseH activity of P is required to remove the RNA        pregenome after it has been copied into DNA during reverse        transcription If there is no RNAseH activity positive        polarity DNA cannot be synthesized and no infectious        virions are produced The hepadnaviral RNAseH activity has        not yet been directly measured in viral core particles        however its existence is inferred from four observations        i Sequence alignment of P with known RNAseH enzymes        reveals conserved motifs in P      ii        Mutation of the putative RNAseH active site residues in        both Hepatitis B Virus HBV and duck hepatitis B virus        DHBV P blocks synthesis of mature hepadnaviral DNA and        results in the expected RNADNA heteroduplex             iii RNAseH activity has been detected for the human        hepatitis B virus when the RNAseH domain was expressed as a        fusion with the maltose binding protein   iv RNAseH        activity has been detected in activity gels employing        purified DHBV cores but the apparent molecular weight of        the RNAseH was less than that of the native DHBV P        indicating that P was either cleaved prior to the assay or        that the signal came from a cellular RNAseH          In this study we attempted to directly detect the RNAseH        activity of DHBV P within viral cores employing exogenous        substrates Extensive efforts employing a wide range of        conditions and substrates yielded no DHBV RNAseH activity        Because genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that P        possesses an intrinsic RNAseH activity we conclude that        the hepadnaviral RNAseH activity is likely to be substrate        committed in a manner similar to the template commitment        observed for its DNA polymerase activity                    Results                  RNAseH activity on endogenous nucleic acids          To demonstrate that the DHBV P protein possesses an          RNAseH activity that is active on RNADNA heteroduplexes          generated during reverse transcription we altered P          amino acid  from aspartic acid to valine DV          within the RNAseH domain of P and examined the effect of          this mutation on reverse transcription in viral core          particles Because no cell line exists that can be          infected with DHBV viral core particles were produced by          transfection of DHBV DNAs into LMH cells a chicken          hepatoma cell line LMH cells transfected with the          appropriate expression vectors eg DG and its          derivatives produce core particles competent for reverse          transcription and also secrete infectious virions            Viral DNA was purified from intracellular core particles          by proteinase K digestion phenol and chloroform          extraction and ethanol precipitation The DNAs were then          examined by Southern analysis using strandspecific RNAs          as probes Figure shows the expected distribution of          forms from cells transfected with wildtype DHBV DNA          lanes  and  As expected transfection of cells with          DHBV DNA carrying the YMHA polymerase activesite mutant          ablated all DNA synthesis lanes  and  Transfection          of cells with DNA carrying the DV mutation inhibited          DNA synthesis during minusstrand DNA synthesis yielding          immature minuspolarity DNAs lane  and it also          ablated positive polarity DNA synthesis lane           Analysis of the DNAs on denaturing gels revealed that the          negative polarity DNA synthesized by the DV mutant was          annealed to a complementary strand   indicating that          it was in an RNADNA heteroduplex This is the predicted          phenotype for an RNAseHdeficient hepadnaviral P protein          and it indicates that the P protein has an RNAseH          activity that acts on endogenously synthesized RNADNA          heteroduplexes                          Oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assays          To examine DHBV RNAseH activity on exogenous          substrates internally Plabeled RNAs were synthesized           in vitro and annealed to          complementary DNA oligonucleotides RNAseH activity was          detected as cleavage of the RNA at the position of the          hybridized oligonucleotide The first region selected for          this oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assay was positive          sense RNA derived from DHBV nt  to  DRF which          contains DR DR and the  half of  This RNA was          chosen as it contains the region where the DHBV RNAseH          activity likely initiates during reverse transcription          Oligonucleotide D was annealed to DRF RNA and          cleavage of this substrate by           E coli RNAseH yielded products of           nt and  nt Fig lane  An overlapping          oligonucleotide of positive polarity that cannot anneal          to the DRF RNA D was used as a negative control          and no cleavage of the RNA was detected under these          conditions lane  The detection limit of this assay          was less than  U           E coli RNAseH data not          shown          Viral cores prepared from LMH cells transfected with          DHBV DHBVDV and DHBVYMHA were employed with DRF          RNA in the oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assay in the          first attempt to detect DHBV RNAseH activity on exogenous          substrates The DHBV sample contained    genome          equivalents as determined by slotblot hybridization of          corederived nucleic acids Because hepadnaviral core          particles are impermeable to large molecules they were          treated with low pH prior to the RNAseH assays to allow          the substrate access to P within the cores   No          RNAseH activity was detected with the viral cores in          reactions containing the complementary negative polarity          oligonucleotide Fig  lanes    As expected          there was no cleavage in the negative control reactions          employing the noncomplementary positive polarity          oligonucleotide lanes             Five controls were performed to ensure that these          negative results were not artifacts First to ensure the          presence of enzymatically active DHBV P viral core          particles were monitored for DNA polymerase activity on          the endogenous nucleic acids within the core particles          the endogenous polymerase assay Fig A Second to          limit the possibility that the failure to detect RNAseH          activity was due to insufficient number of viral core          particles an RNAseH assay was performed with a fold          increase in cores Again no DHBV RNAseH activity was          detected data not shown Third permeabilization of the          cores was monitored by treating an aliquot of the          permeabilized cores with micrococcal nuclease and then          measuring DNA synthesis by the endogenous polymerase          assay Micrococcal nuclease cannot gain access to the          nucleic acids within unpermeabilized cores and hence DNA          synthesis would be unaffected if the permeabilization          failed However DNA synthesis was ablated by micrococcal          nuclease treatment of permeabilized cores indicating          that permeabilization was successful data not shown          Fourth to control for possible inactivation of the          RNAseH active site by low pH treatment cores were          permeabilized by treatment with  M NaCl or SDS          NP   again without yielding detectable RNAseH          activity data not shown Finally the ability of the          RNAseH substrate to access P within the viral cores was          verified using the recently reported ability of DHBV P to          synthesize limited amounts of DNA from an exogenous RNA          following removal of the endogenous nucleic acids the           trans reaction   The           trans reaction is          templatedependent reverse transcription of the exogenous          RNA that does not depend on the proteinprimed initiation          mechanism of the hepadnaviruses   In the           trans reaction the nucleic acids          within permeabilized DHBV cores were degraded by          micrococcal nuclease and then the nuclease was          inactivated by addition of EGTA DRF RNA and radioactive          dNTPs were added the mixture was incubated at C to          allow DNA synthesis and the products were purified and          resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis          The results Fig Blane  showed that DNA was          synthesized by core particles employing DRF as a          template indicating that the RNA had access to P within          the particles The complementary oligonucleotide D          did not support DNA synthesis lane  The RNAseH          substrate itself DRF RNA annealed to D also          supported DNA synthesis in the           trans assay lane  as did the          combination of DRF RNA and the noncomplementary          oligonucleotide D lane  The identity of the          additional band at the bottom of Lane  that is absent          from similar reactions lacking the complementary          oligonucleotide Lanes  and  is unknown It is likely          the result of an additional stop site for reverse          transcription that is present when the oligonucleotide is          bound to the RNA rather than extension from the          oligonucleotide because we have never detected          oligonucleotidedependent priming with the DHBV          polymerase under any conditions The key feature of this          important control is the detection of DNA synthesis using          the RNAseH template as a substrate because it directly          demonstrates that the substrate employed in these          experiments could access the polymerase within the          permeabilized viral core particles                          Survey of reaction conditions          The initial RNAseH assays were performed under          conditions optimized for the reverse transcriptase          activity of recombinant DHBV P   These conditions          were chosen because the RNAseH and polymerase activities          function coordinately during reverse transcription and          hence it is reasonable to assume they operate under          similar conditions However because the initial assays          failed to detect DHBV RNAseH activity the          oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assay was performed with          DHBV cores under a wide variety of conditions We first          employed conditions optimized for human immunodeficiency          virus RNAseH   RNAseH activity was detected using           E coli RNAseH and AMV reverse          transcriptase but it was not detected with the DHBV          cores data not shown We then varied the pH from  to                     E coli RNAseH was active at all          pHs but no cleavage was found in reactions containing          the permeabilized cores data not shown Negative          results for DHBV RNAseH activity were also obtained when          the RNAseH assay was performed at NaCl concentrations          ranging from  mM although the           E coli RNAseH was active in all          these conditions data not shown To examine the effect          of divalent cation composition  mM MnCl             was used instead of  mM MgCl             and again no RNAseH activity was          detected data not shown We next examined cleavage with          substrate amounts ranging from  ng to  ng per          reaction and with incubation times ranging from  h to           h DHBV RNAseH cleavage was not detected under any of          these conditions although the           E coli RNAseH activity was          detected in all of them data not shown Since the body          temperature of Pekin ducks is about C an RNAseH assay          was performed with DHBV cores at C Again no RNAseH          activity was observed data not shown          ATP has been reported to increase the cleavage          efficiency of RNAseH   Therefore  mM ATP was          included in an RNAseH assay DHBV RNAseH cleavage was not          detected within the cores under these conditions data          not shown Similarly inclusion of  M each of the          four dNTPs did not stimulate the RNAseH activity data          not shown This suggests that i there is no obvious          nucleotide requirement to activate the RNAseH activity          and ii any DNA synthesis that may have occurred on the          substrates during the reaction either primed by the          oligonucleotide or produced by the           trans reaction was insufficient to          induce detectable RNAseH activity          To detect DNA polymerization on exogenous RNA          templates the transreaction the endogenous nucleic          acids are first removed with micrococcal nuclease To          determine if a similar effect would be observed with the          RNAseH activity an RNAseH assay was performed in          permeabilized cores in which the nucleic acids had been          removed with micrococcal nuclease The results Fig           showed that RNAseH activity was not detected in          micrococcal nuclease treated cores lanes  to           Because the  RNA stemloop induces a structural change          in P that is required for DHBV DNA polymerase activity             we examined the possibility that  may activate          the RNAseH activity in micrococcal nuclease treated          cores  RNA was added in           trans to micrococcal nuclease          treated cores in the RNAseH assay and again DHBV RNAseH          activity was not observed data not shown                          Oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assays with          alternate substrates          The above experiments suggest that the DHBV RNAseH may          not be able to act on exogenous substrates To exclude          the possibility that the DHBV RNAseH simply could not          recognize the specific heteroduplex formed by DRF RNA          and oligonucleotide D a second pair          oligonucleotides D and DMSal were employed          with DRF RNA in oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assays          employing permeabilized DHBV core particles Again no          DHBV RNAseH activity was observed with the viral cores          under any condition employed although           E coli RNAseH recognized the          substrate under all conditions employed data not shown          To determine if the lack of success was specific to the          DRF RNA a second RNA DXB DHBV nt  positive          polarity annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide          D was employed in RNAseH assays Again no specific          DHBV RNAseH cleavage was observed data not shown          indicating that using different region of RNA from the          DHBV genome did not affect the observation that the DHBV          RNAseH could not engage an exogenous substrate Because          the micrococcal nucleasetreated cores may represent the          best likelihood of observing RNAseH activity a titration          of the substrate was performed employing  to  ng          DXB RNA annealed to D and nucleasetreated DHBV          core particles Again no DHBVspecific cleavages were          observed data not shown                          Alternate RNAseH assays          Other assays to detect DHBV RNAseH activity were also          employed Randomly initiated RNA synthesis by           E coli RNA polymerase was used to          make  PRNADNA substrates using synthetic          homopolymers or DRF DNA   In these assays RNAseH          activity is measured as a reduction in TCAprecipitable          radioactivity No viral RNAseH activity was detected in          experiments with DHBV cores supporting the observation          obtained with the oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assay          data not shown          Two different sources of recombinant enzymatically          active DHBV P were also employed in the RNAseH assays          without success DHBV P with reverse transcriptase          activity can be produced in yeast within recombinant TY          retrotransposnon particles as a fusion with yeast          retrotransposon TYA protein   DHBV RNAseH activity          could not be detected using yeastderived recombinant P          in either the oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assay or          the synthetic homopolymer assay although RNAseH activity          of the wildtype TY retrotransposon particles could be          detected data not shown DHBV RNAseH activity also          could not be detected with P translated           in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte          lysates although P expressed in this system possesses          reverse transcriptase activity                              Discussion        The hepadnaviral DNA polymerase activity is strongly        associated with the viral core structure and is normally        unable to synthesize DNA from an exogenous template          The aim of this study was to determine if the DHBV RNAseH        activity was similarly restricted to the endogenous        heteroduplex substrate generated during reverse        transcription Oligonucleotidedirected RNAseH assays were        performed with permeabilized viral cores under a wide        variety of conditions Temperature pH cation composition        salt concentration substrate concentration and inclusion        of ATP and dNTPs were examined RNAseH assays were also        carried out after removal of the endogenous nucleic acid        and multiple RNA sequences and DNA oligonucleotide        combinations were employed DHBV RNAseH activity was not        detected under any of these conditions although         E coli or AMV RNAseH activity could        easily be detected under all of them        Control experiments demonstrated that i the cores were        permeabilized because the viral nucleic acids were        sensitive to micrococcal nuclease following low pH        treatment ii the RNAseH substrate could access the        polymerase within the viral cores as determined by the         trans reaction Fig B iii the        DNA polymerase activity of the P survived the low pH        treatment as measured by synthesis of viral DNA and iv        the RNAseH substrates were suitable because they were        degraded by         E coli RNAseH and AMV reverse        transcriptase and because the DHBV RNAseH activity can        degrade these RNA sequences during reverse transcription        the target RNAs were derived from the DHBV genome        However the DHBV RNAseH activity could not degrade the        same sequences when they were presented as exogenous        heteroduplexes Therefore we feel the RNAseH activity is        likely to be substrate committed in a manner analogous to        the template commitment of the DNA polymerase activity        This conclusion is subject to a number of caveats        because it rests on negative data ie the failure to        detect RNAseH activity There are at least three other        potential causes for the failure to detect RNAseH activity        that we cannot formally exclude The first possible cause        is that the RNAseH activity in our core preparations may be        too low to detect To evaluate this possibility it is        useful to compare the enzymatic turnover number for the        polymerase activity in the         trans reaction with the turnover        number for the RNAseH activity that would be needed to        reach the detection limit in our assays Phosphorimage        analysis of the radioactivity incorporated in a         trans reaction employing           core particles quantitated as genomeequivalents of viral        DNA by slotblot hybridization indicated that about           nucleotides were incorporated into DNA in the        reaction Assuming one polymerase molecule per core        particle this gives a turnover rate of about         nucleotides per polymerase molecule in the         trans reaction To maximize the        possibility of detecting RNAseH cleavage products each        RNAseH assay was exposed to film for up to a week to burn        out the signal from the cleavage products that migrate        below the input RNA on the gels Under these conditions        our detection limit for the RNAseH assay was measured at         pg of internally Plabeled RNA or about           molecules of the  nt cleavage product To reach this        detection limit with the    polymerase molecules used        in a typical RNAseH assay would require just a single        catalytic cycle from  of the polymerase molecules in        the reaction Therefore the turnover number for the RNAseH        activity needed to reach the detection limit in our assays        is about fold less than the  cycles observed for        the polymerase activity under very similar conditions This        huge difference gives us confidence that our assays were        sensitive enough to detect RNAseH activity if it were        present        The second alternative cause for our failure to detect        RNAseH activity is that the RNAseH active site may be        sterically blocked in core particles However recombinant        P translated         in vitro has reverse transcriptase        activity outside core particles yet P expressed in this        manner was still unable to degrade the exogenous RNAseH        substrates Furthermore the DNA polymerase active site in        permeabilized core particles is accessible to the exogenous        RNAseH substrates Fig B The RNAseH active site must be        in very close proximity to the polymerase site and be        oriented in such a manner that it can access heteroduplexes        within   base pairs of the  end of the growing DNA        chain and hence steric occlusion seems to be unlikely The        third alternative explanation for our negative data is that        the DHBV RNAseH activity may have been inactivated by the        low pH pulse used to permeabilize the cores To control for        this possibility we employed three different        permeabilization methods low pH high salt and        detergent None of these conditions inactivated the DNA        polymerase activity yet we were unable to detect RNAseH        activity in cores permeabilized by any of these methods        Furthermore DHBV RNAseH activity could not be detected        with recombinant PTY particles purified from yeast        although TY RNAseH activity could be detected from        nonrecombinant TY particles TY particles are naturally        porous and do not require permeabilization for access of        substrate This allowed us to assay enzymatically active        recombinant DHBV polymerase for RNAseH activity on        exogenous substrates without permeabilization Together        these extensive controls lead us to believe that the        simplest explanation of our data eg that the RNAseH        activity is substrate committed is most probably        correct        The two enzymatic active sites of DHBV P are likely to        interact with the viral nucleic acids through a single        binding interaction because they are very close to each        other and because other reverse transcriptases such as        that of HIV bind to the RNADNA heteroduplex as a single        protein entity   Therefore our data imply that the        templatesubstrate commitment of the DHBV reverse        transcriptase may be a feature of that common interaction        rather than a feature of the polymerase active site alone        This hypothesis is consistent with the recent production of        enzymatically active HBV RNAseH as a fusion protein in         E coli   because the fusion        protein did not contain the polymerase domain and it was        not substrate committed Because one biochemical feature        eg substrate commitment of this recombinant HBV RNAseH        enzyme may be altered relative to the properties of the        native enzyme the possibility that other biochemical        parameters of the recombinant enzyme may differ from those        of the native enzyme should be considered        The molecular mechanism of this probable        templatesubstrate commitment is unclear We speculate that        the covalent linkage of the viral DNA to P or an unusually        tight association between P and the viral nucleic acids may        contribute to the commitment However this cannot entirely        account for the substrate commitment because removal of        endogenous nucleic acid with micrococcal nuclease only        partially relieves the template commitment of the DNA        polymerase activity and it did not relieve the apparent        restriction on the RNAseH activity Understanding the        mechanism of the templatesubstrate commitment of the        hepadnaviral reverse transcriptase may need to wait until a        threedimensional structure of the polymerase bound to a        nucleic acid primertemplate is obtained                    Conclusions        DHBV RNAseH activity could be detected on RNADNA        heteroduplexes synthesized within DHBV core particles in        the process of viral reverse transcription but no RNAseH        activity could be detected exogenously provided RNADNA        heteroduplexes Extensive controls lead us to believe that        the RNAseH active site is most probably substrate        committed in a manner similar to the template commitment        of the reverse transcriptase activity We acknowledge that        we have not formally proven this conclusion but at a        minimum we have demonstrated that the DHBV RNAseH activity        cannot degrade exogenous substrates under a very wide        variety of conditions that support vigorous activity by the        associated DNA polymerase domain                    Materials and Methods                  Viruses DNA constructs and          oligonucleotides          The vims employed in this study was
