                i guess you heard our conversation our topic for today was clothing   right yeah i certainly did   how you dress for work and season to season and everything   uh uhhuh   how do you dress for work   well uh uh about the same i dress for school i uh i im a graduate im a graduate student so  i dont have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time   sure   uh which is nice uh  uh  ive uh although i do uh a lot of im a speech pathology major and so i do a lot of clinical work  and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best   you bet look professional   yeah  unfortunately   yeah i understand im a i own my own company im in the im a manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and im very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that   umhum umhum   but then when i travel its a little different situation its uh suit and sports coat tie and the whole bit because you go to meetings and youre required to look your best and look professional of course   yeah sure uhhuh yeah yeah uh do uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a to a professional to professionally professionally dressed individual   yeah i think in todays society uh theres more credibility quite honest   umhum   ill always remember ill tell this real quick story when i graduated college my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty twenty nine years ago in fact was selling uh agricultural fertilizer   uhhuh   i worked for the uh Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and i sold uh you know manure   uhhuh   and uh i would go out and call on farmers  and i was always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls and so   uhhuh   one day i got up and thought well ill just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls  and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional   uhhuh   and uh he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of was   oh really even even the farmers oh wow   you bet even even back then so ive sort a uh been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best but but here again i dress casual quite a bit so   umhum uhhuh yeah certainly   it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the  the JC Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh  a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual   uhhuh   i call on Oshmans sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie so it just it it depends   uhhuh yeah it depends  sure uh so you dont you uh if you had the choice would you wear a tie or no   um probably no   uhhuh   probably no   umhum   because uh today i believe you can get away with it but then it depends on who youre calling on who youre itd be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh hed be missing something although he shouldnt be evaluated on that   umhum right right   so it is its its just different   uhhuh yeah that uh thats uh  if if you wanted to to uh really get into a hot issue uh  well at least in some in some beliefs uh uh how people dress when they go to church is uh is uh sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic   yes it is   uh unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately   im uh  lightly a Catholic and the people uh that go to my church are you know the Catholics dress very casual youre liable to find   umhum   people in jeans and and and whatever but yet the way i was raised im a converted Catholic the way i was raised i was raised a Baptist and it seems like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time but i guess that has changed also   uhhuh  uh yeah im im a  i i go to the Church of Christ ive been raised in Church of Christ and uh  i i uh   too many times you you hear you hear a lot about what what youre uh supposed youre supposed to look your your Sunday best and uh  uh dress in proper attire and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in   right   in uh when i see in other economic areas uh like in Kentucky   sure   uh you know people just dont have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they dont have the clothes to wear   but at the very thats a very good point im from West Virginia so i understand what youre saying there and there its its just a very good point   uhhuh yeah     but uh you shouldnt whats the old saying you shouldnt judge a book by its cover   certainly   and uh evaluation of of an individual of course i think it depends on the type of job responsibility you have i think you have to dress sort of accordingly   umhum   but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that   umhum umhum umhum   but what about season to season does i guess your dress changes   uh yeah a little bit uh  course in the summer if i can get away with it i wear uh uh a pair of shorts and thats it run around barefoot no shirt or anything  uh but uh
