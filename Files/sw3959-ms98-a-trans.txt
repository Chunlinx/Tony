        well do you have any children that uh go to college went to college are about to go or anything         yeah i had five go through college weve put five through college uhhuh   oh my goodness oh where did they go   uh two at Texas A and M and three at North Texas   uhhuh uhhuh oh my goodness well you are a very experienced person   right so   uh i have a son at the present moment who is a senior in high school and uh he has uh made three applications to schools that give a double degree program because thats what he wanted to uh take so he applied to the University of Texas at Austin and to the University of Pennsylvania and to Rice   umhum   so uh hes waiting at this time uh to uh see what kind of uh acceptances and money grants might uh come in for him so um i i think that uh it became very evident in the beginning of senior year when he actually had to sit down with the applications he had about six schools that he was interested in but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he also wants to keep a liberal arts degree and actually get both of them  and not all that many places actually give you two degrees   right right right   so he he weeded out the ones uh that did not offer that kind of thing and just really wound up making three applications  so um   umhum thats probably your best bet because you know you narrow it down youre better off i think on that and uh   yeah yeah uhhuh right well yeah and and as i saw the fall progressing and um and his viewpoint it really became more evident that uh he this is what he wanted to do and he didnt just want to get involved in the sciences without having the leeway of the liberal arts and i dont think hell ever be a um you know a kind of a research dedicated a test tube scientist so um   right right is he going on for his masters in his the engineering   i think he might wanna go to law school   umhum   and uh use the engineering background maybe in patent law or  yeah   you almost need a masters in like if hes in engineering in his major right now one of his majors anyway right now to do anything with it   yeah yeah oh yes thats right yeah what uh kinds of fields did your children study in   no matter what field youre in uh well my daughter uh both daughters let me see one daughter was in uh business   uhhuh   and business degree  and then the other daughter was in a special ed degree   oh wonderful uhhuh   and lives and worths works with autistic children umhum and then the other one was a personnel director   is that right uhhuh oh my   uh down in Houston for um several years seven years and then uh my son is a CPA   yeah uhhuh   and another has a business degree and then the fifth one is he was hotel management but actually hes in the sign business now and making signs   oh my oh gee whiz isnt that wonderful uhhuh   and uh likes that and has kind of hit on a nice setup with that so   is he uh local here in town or is uhhuh   he is local right here in Richardson and he really loves it umhum and its just you know   oh good for him   that signs the type of signs they do is new in the last five years its the latest thing in signs its the type that you put on the   uhhuh oh   put on windows and it peels off type and it looks like its painted on   oh yes ive seen those theyre remarkable because they come right off   yes and he yeah right he has the Dallas um  Furniture Mart um Clothing Mart and the Trade World Trade Center all tied up in that he has   oh   oh good for him   so yeah so its a nice deal for him yeah he has hes just starting in it but it seems to be a real up and coming thing   oh theyve done well uhhuh oh yeah oh yes that is terrific   because everythings so portable anymore i mean you know things are not stable and people are renting places for a short times and they dont want anything permanent anymore so   thats right thats right uhhuh thats right you just use it when you need it and uh then its you know gone and it it sure is very effective and then you can move into the next necessary thing that is uh right   it works out quite well right right umhum or on to a larger place and not put that much into anything permanent so it it works out pretty well for him   thats right its amazing isnt it amazing everything they do these days   it is its wonderful its wonderful   uh uhhuh it i i think it is too it really moves you from one thing to the other without  having to hassle and uh you know even like with you said with the signs have to you know to change   so right umhum   everything and uh you know   yeah  the have your son have your son use the library a lot in the college section   umhum umhum   for scholarships   uhhuh   and uh my daughters and sons both did that and they they came up with some of the you know you would never think of applying for and they would apply for them well nobody else did and so they would get some   yeah oh really
