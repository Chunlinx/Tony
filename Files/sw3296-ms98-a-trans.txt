        now were ready do you have a personal computer     we have one   you do in your home   yes yes maam   i do not have one in my home i use one all day at work but i dont have one at home   what   do you find you use it a lot   do you wish you i dont use it as much as my children and my husband do my actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college   umhum   called Microcomputers Microcomputers  and were just touching on database spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of you know different kinds of storage and were just kind of touching on a basic  computers   umhum umhum what kind do you have     we have an IBM compatible its Gateway brand   umhum   that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs   umhum well that sounds interesting   yeah what kind of a computer do you use at work   i i have a a PS  IBM type   uhhuh   uh and i use it all day at work and i put all my personal stuff on it at work   uhhuh   so i really dont havent had a need for one at home but probably if i didnt have access to one all the time at work id want one at home   right i worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years   umhum   it which was different   yeah what is that tracing tracking the flights and things   but i missed right right how long are we supposed to talk on this   uhhuh they tell us when were through   oh okay okay this is   they come in and tell us have you just started doing this   this is my very first time yes   oh really theyll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and its time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that   oh okay   its not more than five minutes  but im going to ignore that thats a call on my other line so im just gonna ignore it but   uh oh oh okay oh okay that i have that too   its kind of a hassle when you have this but other times   i   it   where where do you work   i work at Texas Instruments   oh you do oh well of course of course thats why you  why youre making these calls right   yes i sure do well no im doing this at home im already home for the day   oh i see well this is a pretty good deal   i  do it uh you know i cant do it at work i im i work in the legal department so im pretty busy   uhhuh   but i use my PC there mostly for creating legal documents we use WordPerfect Lotus   uhhuh oh you do know Lotus huh oh thats great thats something we want to learn   um yeah its really i love Lotus i think thats about my favorite   oh ive heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it   umhum   thats great   it really is and i know theres still a hundred things i dont know how to do on it   uhhuh   but uh you know you learn something every time you use it   i have a question on this this thing that im this survey or whatever you know this i volunteered for   umhum   do i start calling in myself or do i wait for people to call me   you can did they give you a number to call   right an eight hundred number   you can start calling in whenever its convenient for you but you can only make one call a day   oh only one a day   yeah if youve talked to someone like youre talking to me now and i place the call this counts as your call   right   so you cannot make a call now until tomorrow   oh oh i see okay so then do you get the five bucks or do i   no we both do   oh we both do well thats a heck of a deal   didnt they ask you for your ID number when you answered okay so you both do from what i understand   right i had to put that in well thats a pretty good deal so why why are we doing this   its for research   actually im doing this for somebody else but you know for a fundraiser   its a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know to uh its uh well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up   uhhuh oh its almost like that like a voice command computer type thing oh   umhum umhum theyre doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this now i dont know   well thats wonderful   i dont know everything about it but they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this and that way they can check voice patterns   i see different kinds of voices and   umhum and get the computer where it recognizes voices   things wonderful see thats why i its interesting because you have i im going to say you have an accent   well i probably do since ive   and i and i think that i dont i mean to you but you know     well ive been born i was born and raised in Texas have lived here forever so i probably do   and youre in what city   im in Richardson its right outside of Dallas   okay my sister one of my sisters lives in Plano   uhhuh well Richardsons right between Dallas and
