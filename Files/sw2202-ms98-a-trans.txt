          so what kind of music do you like   i like all kinds of music actually   yeah thats same here   im kind of partial to country western i like that   do you   and i like mood music like you know when im in the mood for that i like semiclassical   yeah   the real classics im not as familiar with as you know the ordinary sounds that you hear every day type of thing   uhhuh yeah thats about thats about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here   uhhuh   its uh gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody its uh one hundred percent listener supported   oh huh   and its a twenty four hour station   oh thats fantastic   yeah they they get a lot of support here   well we have a similar um radio station here and because of the uh people i guess being pressured to have advertisers you know a lot of the stations have to have advertisers they kind of like   uhhuh   compromised and they do some of it at like certain hours but its not always at a time when you can you know sit down and listen to it so   uhhuh   you you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is available type of thing you know   yeah yeah thats the good thing about them they do no advertising thats its really nice just music   uhhuh we have that on TV we have two public uh broadcasting systems uh channel two and thirty six also that are publicly supported and they have excellent programming   yeah i like i like PBS   yeah yep same thing   uh PBS here you cant get it unless you have cable   uhhuh   and that really upsets me because i wont pay cable prices because theres its its useless having cable i think   it is its expensive   its uh its far too expensive and they dont have anything on there   no and the the problem is that they can do it at will you know like up the prices and youre if you have it you just have to pay it   yeah exactly   you know thats the hard part   ive almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but   yeah uhhuh   ive avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss PBS     yeah   because they they have lots of good stuff Masterpiece Theatre and mystery and nature   yep see we have cable here   yeah   and almost everyone here has cable       and it its uh its good because you dont need the outside antennas with your TV and stuff and it gives you a lot more um   yeah   of the other you know of the widest uh uh television thats available to you   umhum yeah i i had cable before i uh came up here and i miss some of it i mean we had pretty good cable where i was but i miss Discovery Channel and AE and CNN   uhhuh yeah thats what i like yep right and i love that   you know im having CNN withdrawal pains   uhhuh do you go to the theatre for for music uh   every once in a while um   have you been to the opera ever   uh occasionally down in Charlotte   yeah oh thats nice   yeah it its its pretty good   ive seen Man of La Mancha and uh a few of those you know that in Boston and uh i enjoyed it thoroughly i really did   um yeah   ive seen a few musicals and i uh go to Atlantic City once in a while and i always like to catch some shows when im there   umhum   especially like when they have special singers and things and La Cage au Faux that was excellent   yeah yeah i been into Boston a few times uh i was there last year during the Fourth of July thing and went out to the um   uhhuh   Esplanade and listened to the Boston Pops and   oh wow well were only about two hours from there yeah   theyre good theyre really oh really yeah i Bostons okay i mean i wouldnt want to live there but its a nice place to visit   no right in fact i   yeah its crowded i know that   sure is   its murder driving in that place   isnt it awful   yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic   oh yeah i i think that the commute to to and from work has to be the worst horror show       because even the breakdown lane is used for a passing you know a travel lane in the morning   umhum   and thats really i think thats a very serious thing you know im surprised they havent had more you know really fatal accidents out there doing that   well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays im surprised were not killing more people than we are   oh i know its true its true   seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year   so what are you majoring in   um human factors   oh and and what is that   thats um well its sort of difficult to explain its its industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the human from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it   oh oh i see   and and   yeah we had someone from uh do some ergonomics in our area do you do   yeah it thats very similar   cover some of that yeah   yeah very similar um uh specializing in the computer and you know uh interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff   oh oh oh oh well then this is right up your alley what theyre trying   yeah this is uh sort of the same sort of thing thats why its it was the uh professor who brought this thing in hed gone to a conference   yeah yeah uhhuh   down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure ill do it   yeah   why not     really   hey if TI wants to give me five bucks a phone call thats okay   sure sure   you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place   yeah its true it is in in fact i have a friend of mine that moved to North Carolina shes um an emergency room nurse she does the operating room   umhum   and uh shes been down there a couple years and she really loves it   wheres she at   i dont know the city   yeah theres   all i know is its down in in North Carolina in fact the last time she was up i meant to ask her you know what city she was in i didnt but she said its really nice   yeah theres not too many not too many big ones around here     no   uh matter fact we dont have any big ones       after you know after being used to places like Boston and Atlanta you come here and you know they people think Charlotte is the big town you know   yeah oh wow   and its small   really   yeah   whats the population   uh Charlotte oh what about quarter of a million   oh thats thats pretty good size though   oh its fairly good size i mean its its not its not small but its certainly small by Atlanta standards   yeah yeah yeah   course everythings small consider compared to Atlanta   i i liked Atlanta too i have a sisterinlaw that lives in Atlanta   yeah my my brother and uh sisterinlaw live there i like   they she uh she in fact went from Massachusetts to uh Florida then to Atlanta and she really really likes it   yeah Atlantas Atlantas a good city it really is uh you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five   yeah   but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then youre okay   yeah yeah   but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north its more east   uhhuh   uh along I eighty five   umhum   and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day   oh yeah   i never managed to plan my departure right     the airports something down there   oh yeah   oh my God i i swear those  planes going or coming going or coming   yeah yeah its scary   it is its um   its scary they they rival even uh Chicago on uh departure and arrival uh number of arrivals every day   yes unbelievable in fact when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we watched i couldnt believe   yeah oh its a busy its a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there   the traffic it is i know isnt it   amazingly few   unreal   because uh i mean if youre flying anywhere down here you always go through Atlanta you cant avoid it   uhhuh   its the hub city   yep yep   and uh God   i went there to to visit the Underground when that was you know the Underground City   umhum yeah   and i thought that was really neat   yeah thats super its getting even better too   that amazing oh really   yeah they they just they never stop doing things to it   is that right   all kinds of good stuff go   course i havent been there in about uh eight years   yeah last well see i left there in uh eighty   so   what was it eighty six   yeah   so its been its been five years for me   five years the the growth in that place is phenomenal   yeah it just doesnt stop   they dont stand still thats for sure   i mean it   were having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and   yeah   credit unions and all that kind of good stuff   yeah yeah   and its starting to effect you know the economy   sure   because of uh the uh businesses that have their money tied up   yeah exactly   every place you go you know the   couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy im glad i didnt   uhhuh yeah yeah   because its really going downhill up there   it has i dont know what theyre going to have to do to boost it but they need to do something quick   well you know i i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius   yeah   and then i i i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election   yeah   because it certainly wasnt sustained   sometimes i wonder though if the presidential election isnt what really did everything in because he wasnt really paying attention to business you know you cant do both things well   well yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasnt a good system anyway   no true but uh   you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him   yeah   you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything   thats true yep thats true   hopefully   yeah  somebody has to watch the store though you cant really you know without overseeing   no thats true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasnt looking   sure sure   so   look at what happened just in Washington alone God   yeah well you can t   its mind boggling   you cant trust legislators anyway     no       well its been interesting talking to you   yeah we need we didnt talk too much about music but we had a good conversation   but oh yeah right  i hope to hear
