                                 Dumb and Dumber                           Liberal Media Bias Lives Exhibit A Minority Growth Slips at TopPrivate Schools read the headline on yesterdays frontpage New YorkTimes story by Randal C Archibold You could have been forgiven formuttering Uh oh and thinking here was another example of the project ofracial integration collapsing But the alarmist headline was a NixoniantrickNixonian in the sense of that presidents notorious declaration whileprices were soaring in the early s that we have slowed the rise in therate of inflation Prices were still rising The rate at which prices wererising was still rising Only the rate at which that rate was rising wasntrising anymore            The Times headline wasnt quite that deceptive but it was close Itturns out that minority enrollment isnt falling Its increasing It was percent in  and  percent in  and its about  percent nowWhats the problem then It seems Archibold ominously notes that the paceof growth has slowed But should we really expect the minority share ofenrollments not just to keep growing but to keep growing at its initialpace  Even in the best of all possible civilrights environments therate of increase would have to slow down sometime wouldnt it as minorityadmissions approached a fair nondiscriminatory level             It turns out there is a story buried in Archibolds piece but itsmostly a success story Minority children are indeed accepted at privateschools but even though they can afford the steep tuition their parentsoften choose other options including parochial schools and a move to thesuburbs where the public schools have a better reputation Isnt thisbasically a heartening trend Integrating the suburbs is arguably moreimportant than integrating Fieldston At elite private schools Archibold tellsus minority students fear cultural isolation They also fear becoming thesubject of speculation as to whether they are beneficiaries of racepreferences Yet the overall picture is positive The private schools arebecoming more integrated while the suburbs are becoming more integrated tooPrivate School Minority Enrollment Holds Steady Even as Qualified StudentsMove to Suburbs would have been a more accurate headline                            Liberal Media Bias Lives Exhibit B Meanwhile on Page B thespread of halfbaked fauxDowdism continues with John Kifners Metro sectionstory headlined Giulianis Hunt for Red Menaces Kifner writes A decadeafter the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the swift collapse of communismsEvil Empire Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani is still darkly wary of Marxistinfluence in the nooks and crannies of the city It seems the mayor didntlike it when the leader of a dissident group of transit workers decried anorgy of profitmaking by New York business over Christmas The union leadersaid Theyre not going to rake it in if the trains arent running Giulianiargued that that means taking jobs away from people and said it reflected atrue misunderstanding of what America is all about That comes from theinfluence of Marxism and if you need any better indication of it it was saidat a Marxist study group            Kifner implicitly ridicules this statementthe mayor he says hasdiscerned a sinister Marxist tingebut he never explains why its ridiculousAre there no Marxists left after the fall of the Wall Was the power of Marxand Marxism entirely bound up in the fate of Eastern Bloc capital CCommunism Thats not what they taught me in my Marxist study group Has Kifnerheard of the New Left And isnt it true that Marxists have a vision of classconflict that is at odds with a vision embraced by Giuliani that sees anorgy of profitmaking as a good thing because everyone has an interest incapitalist prosperity  Kifner doesnt even tell us whether the unionleaders statement really was said at a Marxist study group Giulianiapparently must be a wacky McCarthyist paranoid regardless of whether hestelling the truth  Kifners piece makes sense only as an appeal to theunexamined liberal antiantiCommunist biases of his readers  A couple ofKifners other examples do show that Giuliani has a tendency to view anydeploring of class disparities as Marxist But the mayor pays Marx morerespect by recognizing that his philosophy has some meaning worth criticizingthan Kifner does by acting as if it is so dead and meaningless that anyone whotakes it seriously is a fool             In the middle of his piece Kifner veers off and makes fun of Giuliani forhaving expanded his horizon to foreign affairs last week It seems the mayorlamented that Fidel Castro had been romanticized and urged asylum foryearold Elin Gonzlez And this was ridiculous because  why exactlyBecause Castro is a Marxist But Giuliani didnt use the word Marxist todescribe Castro though it surely would have been appropriate He was addinghis two cents to a controversy in the news and his position on asylum washardly outlandish             Kifners smug sneering piece wasnt labeled News Analysis But thatwouldnt have saved it              So the Times has a liberal bias Isnt that an easytargeted First shoot the fish in the barrel Plus the Timesseems to be getting worse playing to its target NPR demographic the same wayNBC Nightly News plays to geriatric women
