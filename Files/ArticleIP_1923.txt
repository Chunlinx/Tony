                                 Bahtulism            I often runinto people who assert confidently that massive speculative attacks oncurrencies like the ones on the British pound in  the Mexican peso in and the Thai baht in  prove that we are in a new world in whichcomputerized trading satellite hookups and all that mean that old economicrules and conventional economic theory no longer apply One physicistinsisted that the economy has gone nonlinear and is now governed by chaostheory But the truth is that currency crises are old hat The travails of theFrench franc in the s were thoroughly modern and the speculative attacksthat brought down the Bretton Woods system of exchange rates in the early swere almost as big compared with the size of the economies involved as thebiggest recent blowouts Currency crises have been a favorite topic ofinternational financial economists ever since the s In fact they areamong my favorite topicsafter all I helped found the field            Thestandard economic model of currency crises had its genesis in a brilliantmids analysis of the gold market by Dale Henderson and Steve Salant twoeconomists at the Federal Reserve They showed that abrupt speculative attackswhich would almost instantly wipe out the governments stockpile were anatural consequence of typical pricestabilization schemes In  I was anintern at the Fed and realized that Henderson and Salants story could withsome reinterpretation be applied to currency crises that suddenly wipe out thegovernments foreign exchange reserves A bit later Robert Flood now at theInternational Monetary Fund and Peter Garber of Brown produced the canonicalversion of that conventional story            The keylesson from that conventional model is that abrupt runs on a currency whichmove billions of dollars in a very short time are not necessarily the resultof either irrational investor stampedes or evil financial manipulation On thecontrary they are the normal result when rational investors contemplate theimplications of unsustainable policies            Someeconomists howevernotably Berkeleys Maurice Obstfeld and BarryEichengreenargue that the standard model is too mechanical in itsrepresentation of government policy and that the more complex motives ofactual governments make speculation a more uncertain and perhaps morepernicious affair Selffulfilling crises in which a currency that could havesurvived is nonetheless brought down are a hot topic these days But everyoneagrees that a sufficiently credible currency will never be attacked and asufficiently incredible one will always come under fire
