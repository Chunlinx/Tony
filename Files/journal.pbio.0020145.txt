                            The next generation of life scientists are currently undergraduatesand the success of        this generation depends upon the quality of the education they receive It is clear the        expectations for undergraduate education are changing Collins et al  When the        National Research Council published its recommendations for changing the undergraduate        training of future life scientists the BIO report access to studentbased research        was a primary recommendation Colleges and universities should provide all students with        opportunities to become engaged in research  National Research Council  As every        investigator knows research begins in the literature not in the laboratory Therefore an        unstated assumption of the BIO report was that students need to have unencumbered        access to the research literature in order to engage in research and become scientific        leaders in the st century        Early in my teaching career I discussed graduate student preparation with a colleague        at MIT He said new graduate students knew about the different methods they could even        recite fine definitionsbut if you asked them which method would be best to answer a        particular question they were uncertain This reinforced my attitude towards teaching and        testing I realized that teaching science to students should be modeled on the way all        scientists learn new information in the context of an interesting question and on a        needtoknow basis This new style of teaching applied education would require me to        reorganize reading materials for students since most textbooks are written by someone who        already knows all the information and has organized it accordingly For example describing        membrane structure protein structure and signal transduction in Chapters   and         respectively spanning  pages is not helpful for most students It makes more sense to        cover these three topics in close succession        Gradually I converted all my courses over to this applied education format in which        students were learning new information the same way all other scientists do I began by        asking questions that could be answered by learning the information provided by textbooks        or the literature With time I realized that published research papers are ideal teaching        tools because they cover information in the context of an interesting question and new        material is presented as needed This led me to collect series of related papers to create        my own course materials see        wwwbiodavidsoneducoursesMolbioPublicschedulehtmlanchor So for example        in my classes students first read the elegant paper by Munro and Pelham  that        uncovered the tetrapeptide lysineaspartic acidglutamic acidleucine KDEL retention        signal for proteins destined to remain in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen Then students        read four additional papers one of which is composed of weak data and overinterpreted        analysis Through this series of papers students learn to trust their own assessment of        the data rather than the authors this is a very substantial improvement in student        thinking and in their attitude towards the literature I do not emphasize the particular        details of these paper but I do want the students to gain higherorder thinking skills        Therefore my tests consist of figures from research papers that the students have never        seen before They are asked to interpret the figures as they appear in the papers andor to        design new experiments to answer a new question given what they have learned from the        published figure Testing them in this way students very quickly understand that        memorizing details is not productive but learning how to read scientific literature and        design wellcontrolled experiments is much more rewarding see        wwwbiodavidsoneducoursesMolbiomolecularhtmlexams Based on this success I        have designed my genomics course on the applied education principle see below see also        wwwbiodavidsonedugenomics                    Access to Information Changes Education        When I was a graduate student in the late s and early s PubMed was restricted        to those institutions that could afford the subscription fee now PubMed is freely        available to all who have Internet access This change in access to PubMed has        significantly improved undergraduate training by providing students with the opportunities        to do literature searches for their lab reports papers seminars and of course original        research Free access to information in the life sciences has continued to evolve with the        newest phenomenon in publishingopenaccess journals PubMed Central        httpwwwpubmedcentralnihgov is a rich repository of and portal to open access        articles BioMed Central httpwwwbiomedcentralcom publishes a growing number of        openaccess journals and there are a few new openaccess education journals such as         Cell Biology Education httpwwwcellbioedorg and the         Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience        Education httpwwwfunjournalorg As the newest player in the openaccess arena         PLoS Biology has further enriched the growing espritdescorps of        publishing and has already improved undergraduate education My students now have equal        access to a growing portion of the literature that Nobel laureates and investigators at        wealthy institutions enjoy        Interestingly the push towards open access has led many subscriptionbased journals to        permit free access two to  months after publication These timedelayed freeaccess        journals are helpful for course adjustments in the subsequent academic year but not the        current semester Unfortunately owing to the high cost of subscriptions for many journals        the library at my institution like many other libraries is forced to make difficult        choices about which journals we can afford The number of journal subscriptions goes down        in proportion to the rise of subscription costs but fortunately this loss is being offset        by the creation of new openaccess journals                    The Promise of the Internet        I have been teaching undergraduates since  and have noticed a trend in the way I        teachincreasingly I have provided research papers to my students so they can learn to        read those papers and improve their critical thinking skills One reason for my increased        use of research papers is the development of PDFs When I first started using journal        articles in my molecular biology course the class had to meet in the library so we could        pass around the bulky bound volumes to detect the important subtleties often lost in        photocopied versions of figures Later I learned how to scan the figures and generate Web        pages so that I could project the images in class and so that students could print        laserquality versions of papers see httpwwwbiodavidsonedumolecular Now I use PDF        files for students to print and for me to display in class with no loss of information due        to reformatting or resolution problems Figure         With my increased confidence from using research papers in my molecular biology class I        began experimenting with research papers for my introductory students Firstyear students        are not ready to critically evaluate complex data but they are beginning their first        forays into reading review articles and occasionally original research papers When        introductory students make presentations of their findings in laboratory courses        increasing numbers are utilizing PubMed and PDF reprints when they are available        Students have been reading primary research papers since well before PDF files became        available but the increased access to papers online and the improved quality of the format        has significantly enhanced the use of research and review papers in the undergraduate        curriculum It is common for students in upperlevel lecture and lab courses to read papers        DebBurman  Hall and Harrington  Kitchen et al  Mulnix  and seminar        courses are usually dominated by student presentations of literature Wright and Boggs         Hales  Lom         It is worth noting that most colleges and universities are being told to reduce        expenditures and one frequent target of moneysaving measures is the everincreasing costs        of library journal subscriptions This fiscal reality will erode the pedagogical gains made        by faculty who are already meeting one of the goals of the BIO report by immersing        students in the research literature However openaccess journals are proving to be        virtual oases in a desert of payperview journals that are available on a sliding scale        that favors the richest and biggest institutions                    Using OpenAccess Resources for Creative Teaching         During the past three years I have taught an undergraduate course in genomics        wwwbiodavidsonedugenomics in which I capitalize on a confluence of two trends in the        field public domain databases and openaccess journals Campbell  In my genomics        class students have three assignments for which they are required to mine databases for        sequence transcriptome and proteome information see        wwwbiodavidsoneducoursesgenomicscainhomehtml But genomics courses are not        the only beneficiaries since other classes at many institutions eg introductory        biology biochemistry cell development genetics microbiology molecular biology see        httpwwwbiodavidsoneducoursesMolbiostandardsHPhtmlanchor and        neuroscience require students to mine public domain databases Dyer and LeBlanc         Honts  This year we introduced genome database searching to our introductory biology        students see wwwbiodavidsonedupeoplemacampbellHopeDQDQhtml and        wwwbiodavidsonedupeoplemacampbellHopeDQDQhtml Firstyear students use Genome        Browser and BLAST to determine the molecular causes of cystic fibrosis and Huntington        disease respectively The benefit of public databases and openaccess literature to        educators is obvious and immediate Images can be used in lectures and papers can be        distributed easily and on short notice for class use There is no need to worry about        limited access due to subscription costs nor an obligation to obtain copyright permission        from publishers which is a bothersome and sometimes expensive process for busy faculty        members By reducing nonproductive busy work for faculty openaccess journals have already        created an environment that is improving undergraduate education today with longterm        benefits in creating researchready graduate students        Students who are exposed to publicly available literature through their coursework often        develop an expectation that all research papers will be freely available to them from any        computer and become frustrated if they do not have access to all the journal articles they        want and need to read Increasingly I have students sending me PDF files of openaccess        journal articles they have read and want to share with me Who would have guessed that free        access to journals would result in students mining the literature for relevant papers and        sending them to their instructors for consideration In addition to papers related to their        own classes and research students also enjoy learning about hot topics from scientific        publications and those stories that quickly reach the popular press Examples include the        use of DNA microarrays and sequencing to identify the causative agent for SARS Wang et al         and a good review article of small inhibitory RNA Dillin         Two common educational goals are to encourage students to become skeptical of        unsubstantiated claims and to enable students to evaluate data critically One way to        accomplish these goals is to capitalize on the natural curiosity of students and ask them        to compare topics in the popular press to that in the scientific literature see        httpwwwbiodavidsoneducoursesgenomicspoultonphtml Openaccess journals        make these two educational goals much more feasible because students can utilize current        findings immediately without having to wait for interlibrary loans which can take up to        two weeks can cost up to  per article and can result in poorquality blackandwhite        photocopies                     and for ThoughtProvoking Testing        If we want students to achieve higher levels of thinking Bloom et al  we need to        model our courses so students can learn by examples and are rewarded for learning to        critically evaluate data and for inspecting evidence before believing claims made by        authors Brill and Yarden  Students quickly figure out what intellectual behaviors        are rewarded in exams If exam questions simply require students to regurgitate factoids        then higher levels of thinking are unlikely to be demonstrated by students It is difficult        to create good exam questions that cover the course material and reward students who have        learned to read critically and to interpret data Over the last few years increasingly I        have turned to current literature to find raw data for my exam questions For example for        my genomics class in Fall  I used a paper published in         PLoS Biology that utilized DNA microarrays to analyze the life cycle of        malariacausing         Plasmodium Bozdech et al  I asked students to interpret several        figures using their own words Figure  Owing to my choosing to use an openaccess        journal my students also had full access to the supporting information which two students        utilized to enhance their answers For this question these two produced answers that were        better than mine Another exam question required students to mine a database associated        with the Bozdech paper see httpmalariaucsfeduindexphp Students were asked to        combine what they learned from the paper and the course and choose new proteins in        addition to the ones described in Bozdech et al  that would make good candidates        for vaccines based on the timing of gene transcription In order to answer this question        students performed the first steps in real research which rewards students for learning        higherorder thinking skills        At the end of their exam students were given an opportunity for extra credit points a        maximum of three points out of  available on the exam if they provided constructive        criticism directly to the database curators About  of the students sent comments        including this one In recently using your database I found it difficult to search the         Plasmodium gene expression data with multiple constraints For example        it would be helpful if there were a way to identify all the genes within a certain        functional group that fell within certain time or amplitude constraints Is this possible        in this database The curators very professionally responded to the students suggestions        which resulted in three new search capacities being added to the database as can be seen        on the left side of the main page see httpmalariaucsfeduindexphp As a result of        these professional interactions students became participants in a community of scholars        interacting with investigators at the University of California San Francisco while taking        their exams        The use of openaccess journals for teaching and testing has already improved my        courses I can provide exam questions that are more interesting more educational and more        current Furthermore I accomplish two tasks simultaneously I keep abreast of new        developments in my field and I write exam questions But what do students think While I        have not formally assessed student attitudes I have collected information from        endofsemester course evaluations including the following comments One of the best        parts of the entire course for me were the exams The exams really gave me an opportunity        to show how I could work through real problems This class definitely increased my critical        thinking skills Each test presented me with new ideas and problems to work through I        enjoyed the idea that each exam would be a learning experience                    The Future        Teaching is a lot like raising children Like parents teachers provide learning        opportunities in part by modeling the behavior we want our students to learn By choosing        the most current literature as testing material my students realize that I read the        literature to stay current in my field and that there are always new opportunities to        learn analyze and design experiments etc By my choosing openaccess papers such as        those published in         PLoS Biology  my students benefit from free access to published research        results Free access to research literature enhances student learning and helps produce the        next generation of graduate students who are then better trained Openaccess publishing        provides the right mix of benefits for educators and students alike
