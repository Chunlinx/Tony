                                  Monica Saves Bill            Monica Lewinskys videodeposition intrigued the Senate over the weekend but it seems not to havechanged any votes in part because Lewinsky has said it all before but in partbecause she phrases her testimony in ways that protect President Clinton AsLewinskys interrogator Rep Ed Bryant RTenn tries to get her to implicateClinton in subornation of perjuryparticularly in a Dec   phone calland a Dec   meetingshe repeatedly foils Bryants plan not with liesbut with Clintonesque verbal tricks                            Analysis Bryant wants Lewinskyto connect the dots of circumstantial evidence in the prosecutions case Twoof these dots are her false affidavit and the cover stories she and Clintonhad agreed to offer if asked about their relationship So in his question aboutthe Dec  phone call Bryant asks When the president told you that you wereon the witness list he also suggested that you could sign an affidavit and usemisleading cover stories Isnt that correct Bryant is trying to forceLewinsky to affirm the two parts of his questionaffidavit and coverstoriestogether But she refuses to give him a yes or no In my mind Iseparate necessarily signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories shereplies Those three events occurred but they dontthey werent linked forme            When Bryant asks aboutthe Dec  meeting he again sneaks a causal link into his question Do yourecall anything being said about you going  to New York and that the effectof that might be that you would be more difficult to find Again Lewinskymuddles the inference I believe that might have been mentioned briefly shereplies but not as a reason to go to New York but as a possible outcome ofbeing there             Synthesis Having thwarted some of Bryantsquestions by refusing to draw connections Lewinsky confounds others by drawingalternative connections Bryant keeps trying to link the Clintonauthorizedcover story to the false affidavit but Lewinsky keeps linking it to theirpreexisting affair It was from the entire relationship that story sheexplains It was part of the pattern of the relationship Later he tries todeduce that her attempt to avoid testifying in the Paula Jones case must havebeen Clintons idea Why would you have wanted to avoid testifying he asksShe throws other explanations at him First of all I thought it was nobodysbusiness Second of all I didnt want to have anything to do with Paula Jonesor her case Bryant presses her But you didnt file the affidavit for yourbest interest did you Lewinsky doesnt budge Actually I did                            Reticenceabout Clintons thoughts The prosecutors want to prove a theory aboutClintons motives but they cant put him on the stand So Bryant tries to coaxLewinsky the best available eyewitness to infer Clintons motives based ontheir conversations She doesnt cooperate After reminding her that Clintonnever told her she had to tell the truth in an affidavit Bryant adds Itwould have been against his interest in that lawsuit for you to have told thetruth would it not Lewinsky replies that she isnt comfortable surmisingClintons interests Later observing that Clinton had discussed their coverstory in the Dec  phone call Bryant asks her Was that in connection withthe affidavit  Why would he have told you you could always say thatAgain she refuses to speculate             Loquacity about her own thoughts Lewinskysfailure to say how Clintons motives and calculations might connect thescandals behavioral dots is bad enough for the prosecutors Whats worse isthat she offers the defense an alternative explanation by using her ownmotives and calculations to connect the dots Bryant asks her Did youunderstand in the context of the telephone conversation with the president thatearly morning of December the  th  that you would deny yourrelationship with the president to the Jones lawyers through use of these coverstories Here Bryant is offering the word understand as a bridge from hermind to Clintons hoping she will affirm that Clinton made clear to her thatshe should lie under oath Instead Lewinsky absorbs the blame for thisinference I dont know she answers But from what I learned in thatconversation I thought to myself I knew I would deny the relationship                           Relativism Having mocked Clintons plastic conception of truth egIt depends upon what the meaning of the word is is the prosecutorsencounter the same maddening fuzziness in their star witness Bryant asks herDid you appreciate the implications of filing a false affidavit with thecourt Lewinsky responds I dont think I necessarily thought at that pointit would have to be false She insists that her affidavit her cover story forthe relationship and even her statement that there were other people presentwhen she was with Clinton virtually identical to Clintons assertion that Iwas never alone with her were incomplete and misleading but literallytrue            At times Lewinskys dexterity is eerily Clintonesque WhenBryant asks her whether she did deny the relationship with Clinton in heraffidavit she objects I denied a sexual relationship And whenBryant asks her whether she believes the presidents version of the PaulaJones incident she replies I dont believe Paula Jones version of thestory Bryant dazzled by her ingenious retort babbles helplessly OK goodthats a fair answer and stumbles to his next query            More than a year afterthe world first heard of her Lewinsky has solved the scandals ultimatemystery Clinton never told her how to confound his investigators He taughther by example
