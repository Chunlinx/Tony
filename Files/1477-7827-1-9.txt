                    Background        The adult mammalian ovary is a complex tissue composed        of four fundamental cell types the oocytes granulosa        interstitial and corpora luteal cells Within this basic        quartet are many other cell types such as the ovary surface        epithelium and blood vessels in addition to the classic        subtypes of granulosa membrana periantral cumulus and        corona radiata theca interna and externa and luteal        cells granulosa and theca lutein The coordinated control        of proliferation differentiation and apoptosis in these        cell types is the underlying basis for primate and        nonprimate menstrual and estrous cycles respectively The        process by which each cell type obtains its state of        differentiation is the subject of intense study The role        of hormones in this process is clear however new results        indicate that autocrineparacrine or growth factor        mechanisms also have important roles        The bone morphogenetic protein BMP family including        ligands receptors and binding proteins has emerged as a        central player in ovary physiology and female fertility            The BMPs represent a large subclass of the transforming        growth factor TGF surperfamily of ligands whose        biological responses are mediated by SerThr kinase        receptors via the Smadsignaling molecules     The        mRNAs encoding several BMP family members have been        identified in the murine ovary including the ligands        BMP     BMP     BMPb     BMP            BMP     BMP     BMP       the BMP        receptors BMPRIA BMPRIB and BMPRII    and the BMP        binding protein follistatin FS     In the murine        BMP and  mRNA have been identified in the theca        interstitial cells     BMP and  in oocytes               BMPRIA BMPRIB and BMPRII in oocytes and granulosa        cells GCs     and FS in granulosa and lutein cells                    The direct involvement of the BMP system in regulating        ovary function has been established         In vitro experiments with rat GCs        have demonstrated that BMP and  inhibit and stimulate        FSHinduced progesterone and estradiol production        respectively     In related studies BMP and BMP        were found to block FSH action through inhibiting        FSHdependent adenylate cyclase activity and FSH receptor        expression respectively      The importance of        these findings is underscored by the fact that FSH action        is obligatory for normal folliculogenesis and female        fertility In addition BMP and  but not BMP have        stimulatory effects on GC DNA synthesis indicating they        may play a mitogenic role in follicle growth              The importance of this finding is underscored by the fact        that the control of GC proliferation is crucial for        follicle dominance and atresia Equally important other        studies have shown that lossoffunction and naturally        occurring mutations in BMP ligands and receptors are        associated with dysregulation of folliculogenesis and        ovulation          Of particular interest is        the finding that ewes having a mutation in the         bmp gene in both alleles are        infertile whereas the heterozygotes are superfertile            Thus the         bmp gene can control ovulation        quota through a dosagesensitive mechanism Evidence that a        mutation at the SerThr kinase domain of BMPRIB leads to        high fecundity in ewes      provides further        support that BMP signaling pathways play a key role in        specifying ovary function        Although it is becoming clear that intrinsic BMPs are        important players in the ovary the cellular localization        of BMPs in the ovary is poorly understood and a proper        understanding of how the cellspecific expression of the        BMP system changes during the cycle is still lacking As        part of our ongoing investigations of the roles of BMPs in        ovary physiology we have analyzed the spatiotemporal        expression patterns of the BMP system in the rat ovary cell        types during the normal estrous cycle                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          Adult female SpragueDawley rats  months of age          were housed four animals per cage in isolation under          controlled lighting conditions  h of light  hr of          darkness lights on from  to  h at C and          provided formulated rat chow and water           ad libitum  Vaginal smears were          taken daily and rats exhibiting two or more consecutive          day estrous cycles were used The animals two at each          time of the cycle were sacrificed on proestrus P          and  h estrus E and E h diestrus I DI           h and diestrus II DII  h The rats were          handled in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and          Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocols were          approved by the University of California San Diego          Animal Subjects Committee                          Plasmid construction for synthesizing          riboprobes          Probes for           in situ hybridization studies were          made by RTPCR Total RNA from adult rat ovaries was          prepared and singlestranded cDNA was synthesized by          reverse transcriptase and then subjected to PCR as          described previously     To design primers for PCR          DNA sequence information was first collected from GenBank          and primers for PCR were designed based on standard          guidelines All sequence information was derived from rat          cDNA clones except for BMP  BMPRIB and BMPRII          whose cDNA sequences in rat have not been deposited into          the GenBank However because cDNA sequences in human and          mouse are available from the GenBank we designed the PCR          primers by choosing the homologous DNA sequence regions          between human and mouse homologues Specifically these          primers are derived from the cDNA clones at the following          nucleotide numbers    and             accession number of the cDNA clone is M for BMP                 and    accession number          D for BMP Kangawa unpublished    and             accession number D for BMPb                 and    accession number Z          for BMP        and    accession          number U for BMP Knittel et al unpublished             and    accession number X for          BMP        and    accession          number D for BMPRIA        and             accession number U for BMPRIB Astrom et          al unpublished    and    accession          number AF for BMPRII     These primers were          selected from different exons of the corresponding genes          to discriminate PCR products that might arise from          possible chromosome DNA contaminants All PCR products          were cloned into pBluescript SK and their DNA sequences          confirmed The plasmid containing FS was constructed by          subcloning of the XbaIPstI fragment derived for rat FS          cDNA clone     pROF into pBluescript SK                          In situ hybridization          Ovaries were fixed in  paraformaldehyde at C          washed in PBS dehydrated and embedded in paraffin Eight          consecutive sections  m were cut from each ovary and          mounted onto polyLlysinecoated glass slides The          sections were digested with proteinase K acetylated          washed and dehydrated as previously described               Antisense and sense cRNA probes were prepared by means          of           in vitro transcription using T or          T RNA polymerase Hybridization was carried out with the          Slabeled RNA probe    cpmml in a solution          containing  volvol deionized formamide  M NaCl           mM Tris pH   mM EDTA  yeast tRNA  mM          dithiothreitol   Denhardts solution and  dextran          sulfate Hybridization solution  l was placed over          each section and covered with a    mm acid washed          siliconized coverslip Coverslips were sealed with liquid          DPX Sections were hybridized for  h at  C in a          humidified chamber After hybridization the sections          were treated with ribonuclease A and washed in  mM          NaCl mM sodium citrate at  C for  min          Dehydrated slides were exposed to Xray film for several          days After adequate Xray film images were obtained the          ovary sections were treated with xylene rinsed in           ethanol air dried and then coated with Kodak NTB          liquid autoradiograph emulsion Slides were exposed for          four weeks at  C in a linedesiccated dark box After          exposure the slides were developed Kodak D  min           C rinsed briefly in distilled water and fixed After          washing in distilled water for  h slides were lightly          counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin          After an autoradiography and counterstaining the          sections were analyzed microscopically The           in situ experiments were performed          two times for each BMP ligand and receptor The intensity          of the hybridization signals were determined as          previously reported       A subjective          comparison of eight sections from each ovary from six          animals hybridized with the same concentrations of sense          and antisense cRNAs and exposed for the same time           weeks was made The hybridization signal was estimated          on a scale of  to  as originally described by Meunier               silver grains sparse but positive          hybridization  silver grains are numerous but do not          cover the cell type in question  silver grains are          very numerous and begin to merge in some places           silver grains are very dense and form a near uniform mass          above the cell type in question  there was          heterogeneity in the hybridization signal eg some of          the histological units contained a signal others did          not  no detectable hybridization signal The slides          were analyzed simultaneously by two investigators and the          results confirmed independently by another researcher In          each experiment tissues hybridized with the sense probe          were used as the negative control In all cases the          sense probes showed no specific hybridization to the          adult ovaries above background see for example Fig          C                            Results                  Expression of BMP mRNA          In adult rat ovaries BMP mRNA is highly expressed          in the GC of atretic follicles and at relatively high          levels in the GC of Graafian follicles GF and some          corpora lutea CL Table  Fig AB BMP mRNA is          also expressed at lower levels in the secondary          interstitial cells SIC and theca interstitial cells          TIC but undetectable in other ovary cell types Table           In the SIC BMP mRNA was constitutively expressed          at low to moderate levels over the cycle A weak variable          expression was sometimes seen in the TIC Table           In the GC BMP mRNA is expressed in a precise          manner indicating that gene activity is regulated during          follicle development A weak hybridization signal was          first detected in some GC of early primary follicles          consistent with BMP gene activation during recruitment          As folliculogenesis progressed BMP mRNA expression          increased rapidly reaching maximal levels in the GC of          secondary follicles The expression of GC BMP mRNA was          heterogeneous In preantral follicles BMP mRNA          expression was confined mainly to the membrana GC with          little or no expression in the corona radiata GC next to          the oocyte Fig DE This indicates that the GC          become functionally diverse very early in follicle          development ie about the time the follicle has two          layers of GC As the follicle undergoes its development          to the preovulatory stage ie from selection at E           h through ovulation at E  h the next cycle the          membrana but not the cumulus and periantral GC express          high levels of BMP mRNA Fig FG These findings          indicate that the oocyte may regulate GC BMP gene          expression by a morphogen gradient mechanism Finally the          highest levels of BMP mRNA in the ovary were seen in          the GC of atretic follicles Fig HI          BMP mRNA expression in the dominant follicle was          rapidly downregulated following ovulation As such          there was no detectable BMP mRNA in the new CLI during          luteinization ie E  h to DI  h Fig JK          The message was reexpressed at DII  h luteolysis          with strong hybridization for BMP appearing in clusters          of endothelial cells scattered throughout the CLI Fig          ABLM This correlation suggests a possible          function for endothelialderived BMP in luteolysis          Fig N                          Expression of BMP and b mRNA          The hybridization signal for BMP was relatively weak          in the ovaries examined data not shown BMP mRNA          expression was present in the TIC of healthy Graafian          follicles and in the theca lutein cells TLC of the CLI          at DI  h Table  This is consistent with a role          for thecaderived BMP in regulating the dominant          follicle and CL          A strong expression of BMPb mRNA was seen in some          ovaries Table  During folliculogenesis the theca          cells T of the theca interna TI and externa TE of          dominant follicles strongly expressed BMPb mRNA Fig          ABC In the TI the expression appeared mainly in          the TIC located nearest the TE Fig C After ovulation          the signal was reduced In the CLI BMPb mRNA was          expressed at low to moderate levels in the TLC and TE          cells during luteinization Fig DE Little or no          BMPb mRNA was evident in degenerating CL Table  Fig          AB Interestingly there was high expression in the          ovary surface epithelium OSE Fig F and in the          epithelial cells of the sex cords SC located in the          hilum of the ovary Fig G In atretic follicles BMPb          mRNA expression was undetectable Fig HI                          Expression of BMP mRNA          BMP mRNA was expressed in a variety of ovary cell          types with the highest levels appearing in the theca CL          OSE SC and endothelium of some blood vessels Table           Fig ABC BMP mRNA was constitutively expressed          at high levels in both the SC Fig C and the          endothelium lining the large sinusoids in the mesovarium          Fig D A weak hybridization signal was occasionally          seen in some oocytes of primary follicles but it was          rare          In the theca the levels of BMP mRNA change during          folliculogenesis A weak BMP signal was first          detectable in primary follicles being localized to a few          stroma fibroblasts near the basal lamina This finding is          consistent with the intriguing idea that the theca may          begin to develop very early in preantral          folliculogenesis ie during the initial steps of          primary follicle development In secondary follicles          BMP mRNA was present at moderate levels in an outer          layer of flattened cells the TE and in a subset of TIC          adjacent to these cells Fig EFG BMP mRNA was          expressed at high levels in the theca of developing          dominant follicles again being localized to the TE and          adjacent TIC Fig HIJ Unlike healthy follicles          BMP mRNA was very low or undetectable in atretic          follicles High levels of BMP mRNA continue to be          expressed in the TE of the CL throughout luteogenes ie          luteinization E  h to DI  h and luteolysis          DII  h to E  h the next cycle Fig KL A          potentially important finding is that the OSE covering          the ovulated follicle and newly formed CLI expressed          high levels of BMP mRNA while little or no BMP mRNA          was detected in other areas of the surface epithelium          Fig MNO This is consistent with a role for BMP          in OSE regeneration following ovulation                          Expression of BMP mRNA          BMP mRNA was present in the oocytes GC CL blood          vessels and the OSE Table  Fig AB In the          vascular system BMP mRNA was continuously expressed at          relatively high levels in the endothelial cells of some          large arteries and veins in the medulla Fig C Thus          BMP like BMP could have a role in ovarian blood          circulation BMP mRNA showed relatively high expression          in the OSE throughout the cycle suggesting a general          nonregulated role for BMP in the OSE andor adjacent          tissues Fig AB          The expression of BMP mRNA in oocytes was          developmentally regulated There was no detectable BMP          mRNA in primordial and primary follicles Table           however a weak hybridization signal was detected in          oocytes of early secondary follicles when the second          layer of GCs was forming Fig D Thereafter          expression increased sharply and was maximal in oocytes          after the fourth layer of GC had developed Fig EF          High levels of BMP mRNA were present in oocytes of all          Graafian follicles both healthy and atretic Fig          ABEFGHIJ The developmental changes in          oocyte BMP mRNA expression showed no obvious cyclic          variation          Like oocytes BMP mRNA was first detected in the GC          at the early secondary stage Expression increased as the          follicle grew and was maximal after the fourth layer of          GC had formed Fig DEF In the preantral          follicles only the membrana GC expressed BMP mRNA          consistent with a role of the oocyte in regulating GC          BMP expression Fig EF BMP mRNA was not          detectable in the GC of dominant follicles Fig GH          This loss of BMP mRNA became evident soon after          selection at E  h and continued through dominant          follicle development This suggests the inhibition of GC          BMP gene activity may be required for the formation of          dominant follicles The finding that BMP mRNA is          strongly expressed in GC during atresia Fig IJ is          consistent with this idea It is notable that BMP mRNA          was expressed in the TE of the CLI from ovulation          throughout luteolysis Fig ABKL                          Expression of BMP mRNA          As with BMP relatively high expression of BMP          mRNA was identified in the theca CL and SC Table and          Fig ABC A specific pattern of BMP expression          was identified in the theca during folliculogenesis and          luteogenesis The theca of developing follicles first          exhibited BMP mRNA when the second layer of GC          appeared ie at the primarysecondary follicle          transition Table  Subsequent follicle growth was          accompanied by increased BMP mRNA expression which          reached high levels in the theca of dominant follicles          Fig DE An intriguing feature of theca BMP mRNA          expression is that it restricted to the inner most layer          being present in a subset of fibroblastlike cells          juxtaposed to the basal lamina and a subpopulation of          adjacent TIC Fig DEF Notably this pattern of          theca BMP mRNA expression is just the opposite of BMP          mRNA whose expression is limited to the outer half of the          theca These observations are consistent with the novel          concept that the TIC of the TI represent two classes          based on the BMP mRNAs that they expressed As atresia          occurs BMP mRNA is rapidly decreased to low or          undetectable levels indicating that BMP is a marker          for healthy follicles          Following ovulation BMP mRNA was expressed in          moderate amounts in groups of TLC of the newly formed          CLI from E  h to DI  h Fig ABG however          after the initiation of luteolysis at DII  h BMP          mRNA becomes undetectable Thus BMP transcripts are          downregulated in both the luteolytic CL and apoptotic          follicles                          Expression of BMP mRNA          BMP mRNA expression was strictly germ cell specific          and was developmentally regulated during normal          folliculogenesis over the estrous cycle Table  Fig          AB BMP mRNA was absent in oocytes of primordial          follicles When the squamous GC start to become cuboidal          a weak hybridization signal was detected in the oocyte          Fig C indicating BMP gene activation is closely          correlated with recruitment Low levels of expression          were seen throughout the growth of the primary follicle          but began to increase when a second layer of GC was          forming Fig D As follicle development proceeded the          expression of BMP mRNA increased dramatically and very          high near maximal levels were seen after the third layer          of GC had formed Fig E Expression was maintained at          high levels from this stage through ovulation Fig F          It is notable that the BMP mRNA levels appeared to          decrease during atresia Table  Fig G The stage in          the cycle did not appear to affect the BMP          expression                          Expression of BMPRIA mRNA          The BMPRIA mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the          adult rat ovary indicating a broad function in a variety          of ovary cell types during the cycle Table  Fig          AB The highest expression was in the oocytes GC          theca and CL with the greatest concentrations appearing          in developing oocytes Table  Constitutively low to          moderate expression was seen in the vascular system SIC          SE SC and TE Table           The potential importance of oocyte BMPRIA mRNA is          illustrated by its continuous expression throughout the          course of oogenesis as it occurs within the adult ovary          A weak hybridization signal could be identified in          primordial follicles Fig C In the early stages of          primary follicle development the levels of BMPRIA mRNA          in the oocyte increased and were maximal in late          preantral follicles Fig D F During the development          of the dominant follicle BMPRIA mRNA was abundantly          expressed but the signal appeared weaker than in the          secondary follicles Fig GH In atretic follicles          BMPRIA mRNA was highly expressed Fig IJ          In the GC Fig CDGH the pattern of BMPRIA          mRNA expression during folliculogenesis was similar to          that found in developing oocytes In CL moderate amounts          of BMPRIA mRNA were expressed as it underwent          luteinization and luteolysis In the theca BMPRIA mRNA          expression was not notable except for a stagespecific          increase among the early tertiary follicles at P  h          Fig EF                          Expression of BMPRIB mRNA          The expression of BMPRIB mRNA was strong in oocytes          GC CL and SC Table  Fig ABC There was also          expression in the theca vascular and SIC tissues but          at lower levels In blood vessels the BMPRIB mRNA was          moderately expressed in the tunica adventitia of the          ovarian arteries suggesting a role for the BMPs in the          ovary arterial system Fig D In the theca some TIC          and TE cells showed BMPRIB expression with the highest          levels appearing in dominant follicles at proestrus          Table  Fig ABHI          As with BMPRIA the message for BMPRIB was clearly          visible in oocytes of primordial and primary follicles          Fig E At the primarysecondary follicle transition          a sharp increase in oocyte BMPRIB mRNA expression          occurred Fig G High expression was observed in all          dominant follicles In the GC there were also clear          follicle stagespecific shifts in BMPRIB mRNA          expression BMPRIB mRNA was first detected in some          cuboidal GC of newly recruited primary follicles Fig          EF The formation of a second layer of GC at the          primarysecondary follicle transition was marked by a          sharp increase in BMPRIB mRNA expression in all the GC          Fig G The entire mass of GC in developing dominant          follicles strongly expressed BMPRIB mRNA Fig          ABHI Cells in atretic follicles GC and oocyte          continued to show high expression of BMPRIB mRNA Fig          JK          There was a marked decrease in BMPRIB mRNA following          ovulation whereby little or no expression was evident in          the CLI during the luteinization ie E  h to DI           h Table  However when luteolysis was initiated          at DII  h the BMPRIB mRNA is expressed in the TE          Fig LM Then at P  h there was strong BMPRIB          expression in both the TE and in groups of endothelial          cells scattered throughout the luteolytic CLI Fig          NO                          Expression of BMPRII mRNA          Over the cycle the GC expressed the highest levels of          BMPRII mRNA with the CL SC and the vascular          endothelium showing low variable levels of expression          Table  Fig AB Although the oocytes of most          follicles showed no hybridization signal above          background a weak expression was consistently seen in          some oocytes of primary and early secondary follicles          Table  Fig C There was no detectable BMPRII mRNA          expression in GC of the primordial follicles however a          low expression was detected in primary follicles after          recruitment Fig C During preantral follicle growth          expression increased reaching high maximal levels in the          GC of secondary follicles Fig AB High expression          was seen in all the GC of the dominant follicle except          at ovulation when there appeared to be a decrease in          BMPRII mRNA within the cumulus GC Fig DE          Ovulation was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the          levels of BMPRII mRNA During the life of the CL low to          moderate expression was seen in the lutein but not the          endothelial cells Fig H BMPRII mRNA was strongly          expressed in all GC during atresia Fig FG                          Expression of FS mRNA          The message for the BMP antagonist FS was highly          expressed during the estrous cycle being present in the          GC CL and SIC Table  Fig AB It is notable          that a striking change in FS mRNA expression occurred in          the SIC during the preovulatory period In all the SIC          FS mRNA was absent during most of the cycle but at P           h it was very strongly expressed Fig          CDE This observation suggests a burst of FS          gene activity that may be associated with the          preovulatory surge of LH during proestrus          Folliculogenesis and luteogenesis were accompanied by          striking changes in FS expression some of which were          cycle dependent During the preantral stages of          folliculogenesis FS mRNA was poorly expressed in the GC          By comparison FS mRNA was highly expressed in all the GC          of the dominant follicles over the cycle Table  Fig          AB Then during atresia FS mRNA was low or absent          in the GC Table  Thus FS gene activity and follicle          dominance appear to be physiologically coupled After          ovulation the CL showed high levels of FS mRNA          expression during luteinization at E  h and E  h          and moderate levels at DI  h Fig          FGHIJK The high expression of FS mRNA          correlates with a high expression of progesterone by the          new CLI Interestingly FS mRNA fell to nondetectable          levels in the CLI when luteolysis occurred at DII  h          Fig LM FS mRNA remained undetectable in the CL          until P  h when high expression was induced in a          subset of lutein cells Fig NO This high          expression in the luteolytic CLI persisted through          estrous of the next cycle                            Discussion        To better understand the physiological role of the BMP        family in ovarian function the spatiotemporal expression        patterns of a number of relevant BMP ligands receptors        and a binding protein were determined by in situ        hybridization in rat ovaries over the estrous cycle The        general principle to emerge from our data is that the        developmental programs of folliculogenesis recruitment        selection and atresia ovulation and luteogenesis        luteinization and luteolysis are accompanied by precise        cellspecific changes in the expression of the genes        encoding the BMP family Therefore we hypothesize the        regulated expression of BMP gene activity forms a part of        the controlling network that ensures the proper timing of        the developmental events that generates a normal estrous        cycle        The finding that the genes encoding the three types of        BMP receptors are expressed in primordial follicles        indicates that these fundamental reproductive units are        targets for the BMPs In this regard we have shown        recently that BMP can promote primordial follicle growth            Thus it is reasonable to propose that one        function of the BMP receptors in the primordial follicle        might be to mediate the activation of recruitment by        endogenous BMP As there is no evidence that primordial        follicles express BMP ligands the mechanism by which this        activation occurs would be paracrine most likely involving        BMP from adjacent tissues such as the theca secondary        interstitial or sex cords        Unlike lower vertebrates the developing mammalian        follicle is composed of more than one layer of GC One of        the most important concepts generated in the ovary BMP        field is that oocyte derived GDF    plays a role in        the mechanisms governing the development of the second        layer of GC ie the primary secondary follicle        transition The question of how GDF controls this step        has yet to be answered Our data show that the        primarysecondary transition stage is accompanied by some        rather dramatic changes in BMP expression including        increased expression of i BMP BMP and BMPR IB in        the oocyte ii BMP BMP and BMPRIA IB and II in        the GC and iii BMP and BMP in the theca Because        folliculogenesis in the murine proceeds to the preovulatory        stage in the absence of BMP     BMP     and        BMPRIB     one can assume that the marked increases        in these regulatory molecules are not essential for the        development of a second layer of GC The question of        whether the increased expression of BMPR II and BMP         and  contribute to this important developmental event        remains to be answered One interesting implication of our        BMP data is that the GC have already attained different        states of differentiation by the early stages of secondary        follicle development Based on previous work      it        is not unreasonable to propose that oocyte morphogens may        have control over GC fate beginning as early as the        primarysecondary follicle transition It will be        interesting to investigate how this phenomenon fits into        the mechanisms underlying the primarysecondary follicle        transition        Our results demonstrate for the first time that the        theca interna of healthy follicles is composed of two        distinct populations of theca interstitial cells TIC One        group which expresses BMP is present as an outer layer        of cells juxtaposed to the theca externa TE and another        which expresses BMP is present at the proximal side of        the theca interna near the basal lamina of the follicle        These differences can be found throughout folliculogenesis        beginning during the secondary stage This together with        the failure to detect BMP and  in the theca of atretic        follicles supports the idea that the cellular sites and        coordinate expression of these BMP genes may have important        regulatory roles in maintaining folliculogenesis In this        regard a recent study has demonstrated the ability of        BMP to inhibit cyclic AMPstimulated androgen production        by the cultured human theca cell line presumably by        activating BMP receptors BMPRIA IB and II which are        expressed in these cells     Because theca derived        androgen is required for follicle estrogen biosynthesis and        has been implicated in ovary pathology     it will be        interesting to determine how the expression and functions        of these TICspecific BMPs are integrated into the overall        processes of physiology and pathophysiology Besides the        TI a high level of BMP expression BMPb and  is found        within the smooth muscle cells of the TE during the process        of follicle formation Very little is known about the role        of the TE in folliculogenesis however this new finding        raises the possibility that BMPb and  could have        autocrine actions on TE histogenesis andor paracrine        actions on thecafollicle morphogenesis        The rapid cessation of mitosis and the expression of        apoptosis in the GC is the sinequanone of follicle atresia        Our results suggest a possible role for BMPs in follicle        atresia The supporting data are as follow First a        striking feature of atresia in the rat ovary is the        cessation of BMP expression BMPb  and  within the        theca compartment This observation is particularly        interesting with respect to BMP In previous work we        demonstrated that BMP could stimulate DNA synthesis in        rat GC     as it does in human osteoblasts            Equally relevant several reports have demonstrated the        role for BMP in preventing apoptosis in other cell        systems      Together these data suggest that        thecaderived BMP might be a follicle survival factor        through its ability to enhance GC proliferation and        suppress apoptosis Second atresia is accompanied by a        relatively high level of expression of BMP and  and the        BMPRIA IB and II Significantly this occurred in the        absence of the BMP antagonist FS Thus it is possible        that GC BMP receptor signaling pathways are under maximal        stimulation by BMP and  during atresia How this        phenomenon contributes to atresia is unknown but our        finding    that BMP inhibits FSH signaling is        relevant because there is compelling evidence that        continuous FSH stimulation is essential for follicle        survival        The expression of the family of BMPs ligands receptors        and a binding protein in the fundamental cell types of the        dominant follicles DF argues for a physiological role of        an intrinsic BMP in directing growth and cell fates in the        DF This is supported by two main lines of evidence First        we found that the genes encoding the BMP receptors        BMPRIA IB II are highly expressed in the DF        throughout its course of development And second the BMP        ligands BMP   and  act on the GC to control        the level of mitosis and FSH receptor signaling     In        this regard one particularly interesting observation is        the dramatic loss of BMP mRNA in the GC when the DF is        selected at E  h Because BMP can prevent FSH action            the rapid loss of BMP expression may be required        for FSH to exert its crucial functions during        DFdevelopment The secondary rise of FSH on estrous        morning is obligatory for DF selection and we have        preliminary data showing that FSH induces the loss of BMP        mRNA in GC Thus the secondary rise of FSH may down        regulate BMP expression in the DF It is notable that the        absence of GC BMP is a marker for the DF Finally with        regard to FSH action FS has been shown to neutralize the        bioactivity of the FSH inhibitor BMP     It is        possible therefore that the strong expression of FS by        the DF may serve to modulate BMP action such that        sufficient FSH receptors are expressed in the GC to permit        the development of a preovulatory follicle        A role for the BMPs in regulating luteogenesis is        strongly suggested our data Some key findings are as        follows First the classical view of CL development is        that luteinization is inhibited by oocytederived        luteinization inhibitors       two of which have        been identified as BMP and       Therefore the        loss of oocyte BMP and  at ovulation undoubtedly plays        an especially prominent role in activating luteinization        Second the fact that CL BMP expression is suppressed and        activated during luteinization and luteolysis        respectively suggests that BMP might be a novel        luteinization inhibitor Further work is necessary to        investigate this possibility Third FS is strongly        expressed during luteinization but is undetectable at        luteolysis Thus it is conceivable that the cyclespecific        expression of FS within the CL may control the level of        progesterone production through antiBMP mechanisms And        fourth a role of BMPRIB in luteogenesis was suggested by        our finding that luteinization and luteolysis respectively        are characterized by the absence and presence of BMPRIB        expression in the CL A functional link between the        expression of BMPRIB and luteolysis comes from        lossoffunction studies showing that the CL of the cycle        continues to secrete progesterone in the absence of BMPRIB            This work together with our finding that BMPRIB        is selectively expressed in the TE of the CL at luteolysis        supports the novel hypothesis that the regulation of        inducible and TE specific BMPRIB gene expression may        control luteolysis        The observation that the ovarian sex cords SC express        an intrinsic BMP system replete with ligands BMPb          and receptors BMPRIA IB II is novel The SC are        vestiges of the cranial portion of the mesonephric tubules        and ducts and in the adult ovary appear as a cluster of        blind tubules in the hilar region Although little is known        about the physiology and biology of ovarian SC they have        been linked to the genesis of ovary cancer through distinct        TGF signaling pathways      Significantly the        importance of FS in the genesis of this cancer has been        established     Given the evidence that BMPs are        potent growth factors and that FS can modulate their        bioactivity it will be interesting to investigate the        possibility that this intrinsic BMP system may be involved        to pathogenesis of SC tumors Because SC were occasionally        found juxtaposed to developing follicles blood vessels and        secondary interstitial cells one cannot exclude the        possibility that the SCderived BMPs may have paracrine        functions        A functional role for the BMPs in the ovary surface        epithelium OSE is suggested by the strong expression of        BMPb  and  Based on our data BMPb and  appear        to be constitutively expressed throughout the epithelium        over the cycle a finding consistent with a        maintenancetype role for these OSE BMPs An interesting        finding is the cellspecific induction of BMP gene        expression in a subset of epithelial cells covering the        ovulated follicle and the newly formed CLI Although the        function of this inducible and cellspecific gene        expression is unclear it is tightly correlated with the        replenishment of the surface epithelium that is exfoliated        from the surface of ovulating follicle Thus the        importance of this highly specific expression of BMP may        relate to the regeneration of the OSE during postovulatory        repair Although BMP expression appears tightly regulated        over the cycle it remains to be determined how the        regulation is controlled Because the OSE does not appear        to express BMP receptors the OSEderived BMP probably        acts as a paracrine growth factor in the underlying stroma        It is noteworthy that epidemiological studies have shown        that the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer is decreased by        factors that suppress ovulation ie pregnancy        breastfeeding and oral contraceptive pill             Given the relationship between LHdependent ovulation and        the induction of BMP expression it will be important to        explore a possible link between the risk of ovary cancer        and the ovulationinducible and OSE cellspecific BMP        gene expression        It is clear from this work that the regulation of        inducible and cellspecific expression of the BMP family is        a general property of the mammalian ovary Consequently        the potential for independent and coordinated contributions        of different BMPs to control growth differentiation and        apoptosis is widely distributed throughout all the        histological units of the ovary The current challenges are        to understand how specific hormonegrowth factor        interactions regulate BMP expression in the fundamental        ovary cell types and how these interactions are integrated        into the morphological and histological events that        generate the estrous cycle The clinical relevance is        emphasized by our previous finding that the expression of        GDF is dysregulated in oocytes of women with Polycystic        Ovary Syndrome
