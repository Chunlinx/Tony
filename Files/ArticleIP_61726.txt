                                 Raising McCain            Everypresidential candidate who does well enough to attract media scrutiny is doomedto have a bad story written about him Al Gore A phony career politician BillBradley A donothing lecturer George W Bush A Clintonesque playboy NowJohn McCain faces the same ritual Rather than resist it McCain has turned itto his advantage He has chosen his own bad story Hes an angry Vietnamveteran Its an ingenious choice a good story disguised as a bad one Itadvances McCains campaign themesintegrity and fearless independencewhilesating reporters who imagine that their questions about his temper amount totoughminded scrutiny            McCains anger is supposed to be bad because he cant control itand thereforecant work with Congress and cant be trusted with nuclear weapons To refutethis charge all he has to do is restrain his temper in a few highly visiblesituations Journalists unwittingly oblige him Bent on making news theybombard him with questions designed to provoke an explosion Why is it thatthose who know you best seem to like you the least debate comoderator KarenBrown asked him at last weeks debate in New Hampshire Responding to suchquestions McCain always smiles thanks his interrogators praises hisopponents and deflects the challenge with a selfmocking joke A comment likethat really makes me mad  he quipped during the debate            ButMcCain understands that while voters want a president who can control histemper they also want one with a sense of outrage He flaunts his anger atHMOs trial lawyers agribusiness conglomerates and defense contractors whofeed on corporate welfare Its important to have passion and to get angrywhen you see injustice he argued on Larry King Live  On Face theNation  he boasted Sure I get angry I get angry at this last bill thatwe just passed that is an outrageous waste of taxpayers money In the NewHampshire debate McCain vowed From time to time those of us  who stand inan independent fashion are going to break some china  It is very clear to allthe lobbyists and the special influence people that run Washington now that ifJohn McCain is president of the United States things are going to be a lotdifferent            McCains enemies make this spin an easy sell Whos spreading the rumor thathes too volatile to be president Republican Senate leaders Newsweeksupplies their motiveMany senators despise McCain  for his crusade infavor of campaignfinance reformand McCains campaign manager affirms thattheyre out to stop him because Johns shaken up the establishment by talkingabout strong conservative reform On Face the Nation  panelist GloriaBorger asked McCain The entire Senate leadership is against you  Is therea sense perhaps that you are too much of a maverick to really becomepresident and govern Too much of a maverick The question was practically acampaign contribution            Inparticular McCain asserts his anger on behalf of soldiers This combines twogood stories his principled outrage and his war record Do I feelpassionately about issues Absolutely he conceded in the debate When I see wasteful porkbarrel spending while we have  enlisted familiesbravemen and womenon food stamps yeah I get angry On Meet the Press McCain defended a  shouting match with a fellow senator over the fate ofVietnam POWs I took strong exception to his allegations that somehow I wasignoring important evidence McCain explained Were talking about an issueof literally life and death Such patriotic outbursts have captivated themedia McCain is best when he is angry swoons Time  He blazes withindignation that  military families are on food stamps            McCains cleverest strategy has been to associate the anger story with his POWordeal This week citing nasty rumors that his torture and imprisonment inVietnam had left him emotionally unbalanced his campaign released medicalrecords indicating that he had never been mentally ill The records did morethan kill a bad story They revived a good one McCain got to tour the TVstudios retelling his heroic saga In every interview he alluded to hiswounds calling his medical records an orthopedic surgeons dream The NewYork Times discussed his major fractures and solitary confinement TheAssociated Press recalled his  testimony that he had survived throughfaith in country the Navy family and God NBCs David Bloom recountinghow McCain had been brutally and repeatedly tortured quoted a commander whosaid of McCain There was no tougher resister among POWs            TheVietnam angle doesnt just help McCain It hurts Bush When stories aboutMcCains temper first began to circulate McCain told reporters I guess thememo from the Bush campaign has come out to attack John McCain McCain hassince backed away grudgingly from that allegation I was speakingmetaphorically he says but his aides have kept it alive by publicly urgingthe Bush campaign to make sure its agents arent spreading the rumors Byframing these rumors in the context of Vietnam McCains surrogates create theimpression that Bush who joined the National Guard to avoid Vietnam is usingMcCains war record against him            Theres no evidence to support this insinuation but since Bush cant prove thenegativethat no one associated with his campaign has ever said any suchthingthe insinuation sticks Front pages and Sunday political shows continueto discuss the antiMcCain whisper campaign a phrase concocted by McCainsaides Its going to be next to impossible to finger anyone in the Bushcampaign for fomenting antiMcCain sentiment lamented Newsweek Vietnam veterans in the Senate called the trauma rumors disgraceful Punditscalled them disgusting and despicable A POW expert told NBC that those whowere spreading the rumors had spit in the face of every Vietnam veteran            NowMcCain is being asked whether hes angry about the rumors about his angerAgain he gets to impress everyone by turning the other cheek It doesntmatter to me he shrugged on Meet the Press  We need to move forwardWhen asked about reports that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had circulatedthe rumors McCain defended him Trent Lott has been a personal friend of minefor many many years McCain has won the fight the best wayinvisiblybyframing the orientation of the questions Everyone asks him about the whispercampaign against him No one asks him about the proMcCain whisper campaignabout the whisper campaign Everyone expects Bush to halt theantiMcCain whispers No one expects McCain to halt the whispers that Bush isbehind the antiMcCain whispers            Pundits cant believe McCain would fan and exploit rumors about his angerEven if you handle it right you still dont want this kind of thing outthere argued Susan Estrich on Fox News Sunday  Theres some peoplewho only hear a piece of it and say to themselves is something wrong with JohnMcCain Estrich misses the point Voters are already asking whethersomething is wrong with McCain They approach a presidential candidate the waya woman approaches a date First they want to know whats attractive abouthim Second if he passes that test they want to know whats wrong with himThey wont be satisfiedand wont relaxuntil theyve identified his flawsThird they want to observe those flaws examine them discuss them and figureout whether theyre manageable Every candidate has many flaws some of whichare worse than others A candidates best strategy therefore is to show themedia and the voters his most manageable flaw in the hope that they will focuson that flaw and stop looking for others            Thisis precisely what the anger story has accomplished By consuming the media ithas overshadowed and smothered more dangerous antiMcCain stories With fewexceptions reporters arent pressing McCain about his role in the Keating Fivecampaignfinance scandal They arent asking him to explain to Republicanvoters how his crusades for campaignfinance restrictions and ahalftrilliondollar tobacco tax square with conservative principles Theyarent asking him to explain to independents why he opposes the Brady Bill andRoe vs Wade  Reporters arent trying to protect McCain they just thinkhis mental stability is a more damaging issue It goes beyond accusing McCainof hypocrisy on campaign finance says Newsweek  For McCain thisillusion is felicitous The anger story has distracted the media because itlooks so much worse than it is            Aboveall the story of McCains anger has obscured what his quarrels have beenabout By focusing attention on tone it has deflected attention from contentWhen reports about McCains bad temper first emerged out of Arizona this fallthey indicated that he had muscled rebuked punished and cowed fellowRepublicans in order to squelch dissent Those reports could have generateddiscussion about whether McCains tirades against entrenched power inWashington are hypocritical Instead they have been reduced to discussionabout whether he is prone to tirades            Likewise Sen Mitch McConnell RKy has tried to focus scrutiny on McCainstobacco and campaignfinance crusades I dont think John McCains personalityis the issue McConnell pleaded on television two weeks ago For me itsbeen a policy difference over big taxes and putting the government incharge of everybodys political speech But the anger story has overwhelmedMcConnells critique Reporters arent interested in the clash of ideasTheyre interested in the clash of personalities            Is John McCain too crazyto be president The question answers itself A man who can use that issue toobscure his more serious weaknesses underscore his strengths and besmirch hisopponent cant be accused of showing too little rationality and discipline Thebetter question is whether he has shown too much
