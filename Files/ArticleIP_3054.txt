                                 History Lite            If you want your historybooks to be entertainingfull of anecdotes about the lives of the rich and thefamousPaul Johnson is the author for you A prolific Britishjournalisthistorian Johnson is the author of many popular books includingModern Times  and A History of the Jews  whichexplore the past in large sweeps More opinionated than academic historianstend to be he is also skilled at offering character sketches and at spinningout stories While this ambitious and lengthy history of the American peoplegets bogged down here and there it manages for the most part to move aheadat a lively pace It covers developments from  th centuryexplorations of the New World to the mids but you can open the bookalmost anywhere and have a good read            You willalso encounter a host of superficial and slanted judgments Some of thesereflect thin researchhard to avoid entirely in a book of such scope Othersexpose a sourness about modern American politics and culture that becomesincreasingly acid as Johnson moves toward the present day Particularly in thesections devoted to the years since  Johnson has trouble containing hisconservative political and cultural agenda He is better when he keeps thingslight            This is not to say that Johnson dislikes what he discoversabout the American people Far from it Indeed if he may be said to have anoverall interpretation it is one that is fairly conventional that AmericasEnglish colonies there is little here about Spanish or French colonies weresettled by extraordinarily adventurous and idealistic people and that the NorthAmerican continent until well into the  th century was a fantasticlandan economy of plenty that rewarded bold and ambitious dreamers EarlyAngloAmericans had the English virtues of pragmatism fairmindedness andhonorable loyalty to each other The founding fathers were the mostremarkable group of men in historysensible broadminded courageous usuallywelleducated gifted in a variety of ways mature and longsighted sometimeslit by flashes of genius Their British opponents during the revolutionaryera by contrast included boobies such as the royal ministers CharlesTownshend and Lord George Germain as well as King George III himself ayoung selfconfident ignorant inflexible and pertinacious man            WhenJohnson turns to the  th century he continues to reward us withlively prose and wellcrafted sketches of peoplemostly presidents and bigbusiness leaders such as the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and the banker JPierpont Morgan this is decidedly a topdown history in which the poor laborunion leaders and minority groups receive far less attention than in mostscholarly histories these days Johnson a shrewd observer often needsrelatively few words to convey his opinionated judgments Thus on John Adamsas president            The historian warms tothis vain chippy wildeyed paranoid and fiercely patriotic seer Butwhatever they think presidents of the United States should not publiclyproclaim their detestation of democracy and equality That leaves onlyfraternity and Adams was not a brotherly man either He was much too good ahater for that            On President UlyssesGrant Johnson writes simply            Grantthe great general turned out a political and administrative booby He wishedto run a third time but his party was not having it  He then went on atwoyear tour of the world during which he got spectacularly drunk andcommitted many enormities            If there is a sexual bit to be found in astory Johnson usually contrives to slip it in Dolley Madison he explainscontrolled her diminutive husband and launched the White Houses firstdrawing room receptions which in her day were celebratedthe men in blackor blue coat with vest black breeches and black stockings the ladies notremarkable for anything so much as for the exposure of their swelling breastsand bare backs  Woodrow Wilson was fond of women highly sexed evenpassionate and capable of memorable loveletters His first wife Ellen was aprotofeminist and their marriage was a grand loveaffair But it did notprevent Wilson striking up in due course an acquaintance with a frisky widowwhom he met in his favorite vacation haunt Bermuda This developed into aliaison which led in time to a bit of genteel blackmail Readers can guesswhat is in store when Johnson yanks back the White House curtains during theKennedy years            Wellbefore then Johnsons political agenda moves to front and center bestrevealed in a lengthy section lauding the minimalist economic and politicalphilosophy of Calvin Coolidge perhaps his favorite American president and inanother passage concerning Norman Rockwell whose representations of themagnanimity of Middle America send Johnson into raptures It is now possibleto predict his Rockwells emergence as an Old Master like the Dutch genrepainters especially Jan Steen or the English moralist William Hogarth            Alas there is not much else about Americas recent pastsave Harry Trumans decisive stance during the early Cold War years thatappeals to Johnson Franklin Delano Roosevelts New Deal gets short shriftSocial Security is a kind of pyramid fraud played on youth Worse FDRtended to give Stalin what he wished thus making possible the immensesatellite empire of Communist totalitarian states in eastern Europe LyndonJohnson the author adds threw money at problemsso much so that one mightconclude that the whole of the Great Society program was unconstitutionalCiting conservative critics of Brown vs Board of Education  Johnsonseems to agree that it was an unprincipled decision that turned out to be aprelude to a major step backward in American race relations Affirmativeaction programs he adds are based on illegality            Nothing distresses Johnson adistinguished journalist more than the behavior of the liberal American newsmedia which are described as having abused enormous power in recent yearsFidel Castro climbed to power Johnson informs us on the back of adulatorynews stories in the New York Times  The media have developed aninsatiable passion for witch hunts such as the one that badly distorted IranContra stories during the Reagan years We are asked to feel especially sorryfor Richard Nixon who endured vilification from the New York Times andWashington Post that was continual venomous unscrupulous inventiveand sometimes unlawful            Statements such as these adda great deal of spice to Johnsons ambitious History  No one can accusehim of waffling Sometimes he seems mainly to be having funwhacking away ateverything from Marxism to contemporary political correctness offers him happysport All too often however such statements are zingers as if whipped outfrom the comfort of his easy chair or dashed off for the oped page of aconservative newspaper Popular history need not come at the expense ofthoughtful reflection and serious research but Johnsons zingers are too oftensubstitutes for those qualities This is a pity for his caustic tone andshallow glosses undermine what is a bold and worthy effort to write a readableonevolume history of the American people
