                                 What Did You Do in the War Junior            Thedraft issue is back On July  the Los Angeles Times reported that George W Bush avoided Vietnam by being admitted tothe Texas Air National Guard with unusual speed That same day the DallasMorning News presented Bushs side of the story Did Bush use his connectionsto dodge the draft That depends on the standards by which his conduct shouldbe measured which in turn are the subject of a vigorous spin war                           Morality vs legality The moral argument against sons of the elite whojoined the Guard to avoid Vietnam is that they jumped the linethat they usedtheir connections to leapfrog ordinary Guard applicants leaving thoseapplicants to be drafted into Vietnam to die in their place The Timesfocused its story on the alleged unfairness of Bushs quick admission butconcedes that there is no evidence of illegality or regulations broken toaccommodate Bushs entry and rise in the service            Sincethe moral question is tricky but the legal question is open and shut Bushssupporters want to focus on the latter So far the media are obliging themIf Bush didnt do anything illegal or didnt break any regulations howimportant or serious is this allegation asked Tim Russert on NBCs Meetthe Press  Richard Serrano the author of the Times piece repliedthat its serious in the sense that others probably had to go into the regularservice because of the favoritism that he got But that answer didnt cut itFox News Brit Hume concluded that no rules or laws were broken and evenBushs fiercest rival Steve Forbes confined the issue to whether anythingillegal was done                           Preference vs qualification The Times constantly compares Bushsexperience to that of other Guard applicants Although getting into the stateunits was difficult for most others Bush was soon in the Guard says theTimes  Bush got a special commission making him an instant secondlieutenant and was able to jump into the officer ranks without theexceptional credentials many other officer candidates possessed TheNews adds that in the pilot aptitude section of the written test forpilot trainees Bush scored in the  th percentile the lowestallowed for wouldbe fliers In short when Bushs merits and treatment areexamined relative to other applicants his story looks fishy            Bushsresponse is to shift the analysis from a relative to an absolute standard fromwhether others were more qualified or more slowly admitted to whether he metthe Guards minimum qualifications I met all the criteria I met all thequalifications he told reporters who asked about the Times story July His spokeswoman used the same term The military found him absolutelyqualified to be commissioned                           Treatment vs stringpulling Bushs enemies want the story to be about howhe was treated Bush wants the story to be about whether he pulled stringsThats because if your dad is the local congressman you can get specialtreatment just by introducing yourself You dont have to pull strings TheTimes says Bush received favorable treatment and doors were openedfor him Note the passive voice The Times found no sign that politicalinfluence helped Bush along and the News adds Officers whosupervised Mr Bush and approved his admission to the Guard said they werenever contacted by anyone on Mr Bushs behalf For the pundits that ends thediscussion The favoritism was all on the side of the military reaching out tohim rather than anything he or his father did observed Hume ABC News SamDonaldson agreed I am sure he got preferential treatment But what is hesupposed to do Say My name is Gonzalez not Bush  No strings nostory            Thequestion pundits are too coarse to contemplate is whether theres a zonebetween passive innocence and active manipulation The Guard official to whomBush applied for admission told the Times that Bush mentioned his fatherright away He said he wanted to fly just like his daddy Bushs spokesmanpointed out that Bush because of his circumstances made an ideal subject forNational Guard publicity In short Bush knew the deck was stacked in hisfavor All he did was play the cards                           Location vs job title Bush flew fighter jets in Texas Al Gore served asan Army reporter in Vietnam Gores location sounds more manly but Bushs jobtitle looks better The Times focuses on Bushs location warning thathe will be asked to explain how he did not come to serve in Americas leastpopular war To underscore the TexasVietnam comparison the Timesnotes that one of Bushs rivals Sen John McCain RAriz has joked that asa prisoner of war in North Vietnam he slept more soundly knowing that Bush wasdefending the shores of Texas from invasion On Meet the Press  EJDionne of the Washington Post  a Gore sympathizer suggested that thedifference between Gore and Bush is that one went to Vietnam and one didnot            Bushhas several weapons with which to combat this characterization Since punditsare journalists they find Gores portrayal of his journalism as militaryservice somewhat preposterous Gore served as a reporter not as a combatantobserved Fortune s Jeffrey Birnbaum on Fox News Sunday  Gorewent to Vietnam but as journalist not as an infantryman agreed USAToday s Susan Page on CNNs Late Edition  Bush also points out thathe tried to volunteer for a Guard program that sent several pilots to SoutheastAsia The News indicates that he was rejected because he was clearlyunqualified Whether Bush deserves admiration for volunteering or deservessuspicion because he knew he would be rejected can be debated But Bushs mosteffective point is that he was as he told reporters July  a fighter pilotBush never had to fight but he did fly fighter jets and fighter pilotsounds a lot better than reporter                           How you served vs whether you served Investigative journalists andcritics of Bush assume that his Guard service should be compared to analternative scenario in which he served in Vietnam Bush wants to highlight adifferent alternativedodging the draft and ducking military servicealtogetheragainst which the course he chose looks better In Vietnam he toldthe Houston Chronicle this year your options either were to avoidthe draft or sign up and I signed up After the Times story broke thisweekend Bush told reporters I asked to become a pilot I served mycountry and Im very proud of my service            Bushhas several decisive advantages on this question Most people of his generationknow someone who avoided the draft in a less respectable way than Bush didMeanwhile voters younger than Bush know little of the military and thereforetend to be impressed that he served at all rather than concerned with how heserved Moreover Gores patron Bill Clinton overshadows the campaign as aconstant reminder of the contrast between serving and not serving Clinton usedthe Reserve Officers Training Corps to escape the draft then backed out andnever served in the ROTC Against this background Bushs Guard service looksnoble A lot of other people did not do nearly as much as he did arguedSteve Roberts on Late Edition  He did something honorable At least heactually joined the military Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah a Bush rival agreedHere is a fellow that went and flew airplanes and learned to be a pilot andwas prepared to go if he had to go That is a lot            Whoswinning the war over the draft Since the talking heads agree with Bushscompetitors that its a nonstory Round  goes to Bush But the contestbetween the pro and antiBush spins is less interesting than the reality thatlies between them A pilot who flew with Bush in Texas told the Newsthat their service was a nonthreatening way to do your military get paidwell for some long shifts and feel good about your own involvement  It wasa cushy way to be a patriot Perhaps the story worth telling about Bushsmilitary service is not whether it was cushy or patriotic but how it wasboth
