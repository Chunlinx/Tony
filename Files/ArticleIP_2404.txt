                                 The CPI Trap            Last Wednesday MichaelBoskin George Bushs economics guru unveiled his report that the ConsumerPrice Index overestimates inflation by more than  percent a year Stalwartbudget balancers from both parties quickly embraced revision of the CPI Even arelatively small reduction could push the budget several hundred billiondollars closer to balance by the year  and put Social Security on a sounderfooting for the long term But Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee whorequested the study and stacked the Boskin Commission may have seriousregrets            After all if you are one ofNewts revolutionaries an overestimated CPI is the practical equivalent of BobDoles tax cuts Steve Forbes tax reforms and Richard Lugars IRSabolitionwith no messy votes and no responsibility            Since tax brackets have moved up in tandem with the CPI In more recent yearsthe personal exemption and standard deduction have been inflated along with theindex The CPIs overcounting of inflation during those  years means thatthe IRS thinks peoples purchasing power is about  percent less than itactually is The resulting revenue loss compounds itself with every year of CPIoverestimation This year alone the cumulative effect has cut the IRS take byat least  billion            Inflation exaggeration should have special appeal toproponents of a flatrate income tax As long as the tax code is overindexedpeoples incomes have to outpace actual inflation substantially for them toreach the income levels at which higher tax rates cut in Already mostAmericans never pay an incometax rate higher than  percent the  medianhousehold income was a married couple would have to make more than to hit the next tax bracket A few more years of CPI overestimationand tax brackets and indexed deductions will be pushed so out of whack withreality that only a tiny percentage of Americans will ever encounter theprogressivetax system            CPIoverestimation also serves another GOP interest cutting federal programs Asthings stand if Democrats want to combat the steady erosion of the tax baseand the pressure it puts on their favorite programs theyll have to voteeventually to raise taxes and face the electoral consequences Republicans bycontrast can count on their program being implemented without ever puttinganything on the record            The explicit adoption of such a strategysubversive as it may seem of both the democratic process and deficit reductionmay strike Republicans as irresponsible But sober reflection should quiettheir qualms Republicans after all do not want to balance the budget justbecause it will make their accountant constituency happythey want to balancethe budget because it is an excuse to cut the federal government which if youare a Republican is the definition of responsible            Adoptingan adjustment to the CPI as the centerpiece of a balanced budget would be aboon to the Democrats If the last few elections have shown anything it isthat voters dont like cuts if the deficit evaporates the demand forcutsand reformsevaporates with it            Social Security is the perfect example Adopting Boskinsplan to adjust the index will push Social Securitys financing problems anotherdecade or more into the murky future upon which voters and politicians neverfocus That would surely be a disaster for Republican dreams of privatizing allor much of the programa dream they have not so much because theyre keen onthe elderly but because it would convert all Americans into capitalistswhether they liked it or not When the CEO of Exxon and the lowliest janitor inone of his plants have the same financial interest Republicans have it madeIf the CPI is corrected the pressure to make more than token reforms willevaporate and the whole deal may be off            Strangelyas Republicans continue to make nice about the prospect of adjusting the CPImany natural opponents of such a move are silent Americans for Tax Reform ledby Newt adviser Grover Norquist has said nothing Neither has thesmallbusiness lobby The National Association of Manufacturers supports theadjustment            Even liberal economists who are opposing theCPI adjustment understand how good the status quo is for the GOP In the shortterm readjustment hits EITC Social Security WIC food stamps and schoollunches says Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute but in the longterm taxes will be  percent or  percent higher            Whether all that amounts toa tax hike or not depends on whether you count not getting previouslyguaranteed tax cuts as a tax increase  But there is a threat of areal tax increase Boskins report admits that much of the commissions percent overestimation number is a guess If they have overestimated how farthe CPI is off Boskin and his commission may institutionalize anunderestimated CPIguaranteeing a yearly stealth tax increase It isthat prospect that may bring Republicans together to defend a CPI everyoneknows is inaccurate
