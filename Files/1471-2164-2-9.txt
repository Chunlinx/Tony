                    Background        The Carbon Catabolite Repressor  factor in         Saccharomyces cerevisiae yCCR        regulates the expression of a number of genes involved in        nonfermentative growth     in cell wall integrity            in UV sensitivity     and in methionine biosynthesis            yCCR is an essential component of several        complexes involved in transcription A first one is the        CCRNOT multisubunit group of proteins which comprises        at least two complexes of  and  MDa The  MDa        complex contains yCCR yPOP also referred to as yCAF        and at least five yNOT proteins       In this        complex yPOP independently binds to yCCR and yNOT and        is absolutely required for yCCR to associate with the         MDa complex      In the  MDa complex yCCR binds        to proteins such as yDBF a cellcycle regulated protein        kinase     yCAF and yCAF and is essential for the        interaction of both yCAF and yCAF with ySRB a        component of the RNA polII holoenzyme     yCCR was        also reported to be associated with Paf Cdc and Hpr        in a RNA polII complex distinct from the SRBPcontaining        holoenzyme     Accordingly yCCR contains in its        central region a leucinerich repeat LRR domain           which was demonstrated to be necessary for yCCR binding to        the yPOP      yDBF     yCAF and yCAF           components of the CCRNOT complex Moreover its        Nterminus discloses two activation domains which are        required for transcriptional activation     Hypotheses        concerning yCCR function in yeast have been documented        recently First Dlakic    and Hofmann         et al    showed that the yCCR        Cterminus contains a fold related to the Mg dependent        endonuclease core suggesting that it may function as a        nuclease Second yCCR was shown to be a component in        association with yPOP of the major yeast cytoplasmic mRNA        deadenylase complex and to be required for efficient        polyAspecific mRNA degradation      yCCR might        be a catalytic subunit of this complex because of its        nucleaselike domain Hence yCCRassociated complexes are        likely to fulfill fundamental functions in gene regulation        and it is therefore of general interest to determine if        similar complexes exist in mammals Several components of        the yCCRassociated complexes have already been identified        in humans two homologs of yPOP named hCAF and        hPOPhCALIF        and homologs of NOT        proteins named hNOT hNOT hNOT hNOT            Moreover interactions between these proteins were        demonstrated      Yet at the present time there has        been no report of a human protein that would be        structurally and functionally close to yCCR We    and        others    previously characterized genes for highly        related proteins in         X laevis M musculus and         H sapiens named         nocturnin mCCR and hCCR         disclosing circadian expression     and with        Cterminus displaying significant similarity with the        Cterminus of yCCR close to  Yet these proteins        lack the Nterminal region of yCCR ie aa  to         which contains the two activation domains and the        leucinerich repeat region necessary for proteinprotein        interactions To identify orthologs of yCCR in higher        eukaryotes and unravel the phylogenetical relationships        between yCCR and the previously identified genes we made        a systematic search for other proteins related to yCCR        Here we report the identification of nineteen yCCRlike        proteins in eukaryotes and show by phylogenetic and        genomic analyses that they are grouped into four distinct        families one of which contains the yCCR orthologs  these        orthologs in animals have conserved the yCCR        leucinerich repeat and we show using twohybrid assays        and farWestern experiments that the human protein binds        to the human yPOP homologs ie hCAF and hPOP in a        LRRdependent manner Amino acid alignments show that the        endonucleaselike catalytic motifs of the yCCR Cterminal        domain are strictly conserved among all yCCRrelated        proteins and identify CCRspecific residues in this        domain The results therefore strongly suggest the        existence of a conserved CCRNOT complex in human cells        and of a new family of potential deadenylases in        mammals                    Results                  Characterization and phylogeny of yCCRrelated          proteins          Sorting out of yCCRrelated proteins was performed by          i searches in databases using the yCCR Cterminal          domain aa  conserved in the three previously          identified yCCRlike proteins      and ii          PCRamplification of cDNA libraries or          reversetranscribed RNAs using appropriate primers          followed by sequencing when required Table  The          majority of matching hits obtained through BLAST search          in eukaryotic databases belongs to           Arabidopsis thaliana plants           Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungi          and           Caenorhabditis elegans Drosophila          melanogaster Mus musculus and           Homo sapiens animalsmetazoa as          expected from the abundance of these sequences in          presentday databases Sequences obtained from bacteria          databases were not included in the phylogenetic analysis          because of their poor lodscore but were considered in          subsequent analyses After compilation of the positive          hits and for several of them PCR amplification of the          corresponding cDNAs and sequencing the open reading          frame of each of the  matching proteins was determined          Fig B Table  A comparative analysis of the          fulllength sequence of all yCCRrelated proteins          indicates that they all share as expected from the          search strategy a highly conserved yCCRrelated          Cterminus hatched box in Fig B but conversely          their Nterminal regions are highly divergent except for          the LRRcontaining group of proteins see below A          multiple sequence alignment performed with the Cterminal          regions see Fig  allowed the establishment of          phylogenetic relationships among all proteins see          Material and Methods As illustrated in Fig A the          tree constructed using the neighborjoining method          similar results were obtained using the parsimony          method not shown indeed shows that the proteins can be          classified into four major groups with significant          bootstrap values which can therefore be considered as          distinct protein families          The formerly identified mCCR hCCR    and          nocturnin    proteins are grouped within the same          family called hereafter the nocturnin family with the          mCCR and hCCR proteins renamed mnocturnin and          hnocturnin and the           xenopus nocturnin protein          xenocturnin BLAST searches identified a putative           drosophila ortholog from genomic          scaffold AE PCR amplification of cDNA           drosophila libraries using primers          indicated in Fig C designed from the predicted open          reading frame allowed us to provide the entire coding          sequence of this gene named dnocturnin assigned          GenBank accession number AY Table  Human          murine           drosophila and           xenopus nocturnin proteins display          significant levels of similarity in their Cterminal          region  among themselves and  with the yCCR          Cterminus Fig B but not in their Nterminal part          No ortholog of the nocturnin genes could be found in the           C elegans genome although          completely sequenced thus strongly suggesting that          there is no such gene in this species Besides proteins          from animals two yeast predicted proteins yml and          ymr Table  with significant similarity with the          yCCR Cterminus  and  respectively also falled          within the nocturnin family Finally two           arabidopsis predicted proteins          Atlg and Atlg were found to be close to the          nocturnin family members not shown but lacked the most           part of the Cterminal region and were therefore          excluded          The second family hereafter named the  family          contains as yet unknown proteins from           C elegans D melanogaster and           H sapiens Table  The           caenorhabditis protein ce          corresponds to the CAB predicted protein The           drosophila protein d          corresponds to a putative protein that we predicted from          genomic scaffold AE nt  to  see          Additional File  The human protein h was          predicted from the human genomic sequence AC the          human ESTs AI AW AW AW          H and by comparison with the murine EST BE          for determination of the putative initiation codon see          Additional File  It should be noted that although some          mouse ESTs do match in BLAST searches suggesting the          existence of a murine  protein its Cterminal region          could not be predicted in its entirety because of the          lack of corresponding overlapping ESTs or genomic          sequences Again  proteins display a conserved          Cterminal region  similarity among themselves and           similarity with the yCCR Cterminus but differ          in their Nterminal region          The third family of yCCRrelated proteins called          hereafter the angel family contains the formerly          identified angel           drosophila gene product with as          yet no identified function      accession number          X as well as           M musculus H sapiens C          elegans and           A thaliana proteins Table  The          murine protein mangel was determined from the assembly          of several murine overlapping matching ESTs AI          BF AB AA  see Additional File           The human protein hangel was predicted from a human          fulllength cDNA accession number AL and the          corresponding genomic sequence accession number          ACsee Additional File  The           caenorhabditis protein ceangel          derives from the AAC putative protein predicted          from cosmid AF with a modification for a          misassignment of a  exon see Additional File  The           arabidopsis protein arag          corresponds to the Atg predicted protein Once          more the human murine           drosophila caenorhabditis and           arabidopsis angel proteins have a          highly conserved Cterminal region  similarity          among themselves and  similarity with the yCCR          Cterminus but differ in their Nterminus          The fourth family hereafter named the CCR family          contains the formerly identified yeast CCR protein and          as yet undefined human murine           drosophila caenorhabditis and           arabidopsis proteins The human          protein named hCCR is putatively encoded by the          KIAA fulllength cDNA      accession number          AB The cDNA encoding the murine protein named          mCCR was isolated by us using RTPCR and primers          derived from matching EST clones and its open reading          frame was entirely sequenced assigned GenBank accession          number AY Table  Aside their Cterminal regions          which display the highest similarity with the yCCR          Cterminus  the Nterminus of the human and          murine proteins display a leucinerich repeat LRR          region very similar to that of the yeast CCR Fig and          see below The           drosophila and           caenorhabditis proteins were          characterized from matching genomic clones accession          number AE and Z respectively in which we          identified a similar LRR domain  kb and  kb          respectively upstream of the exons for the yCCRlike          Cterminus PCR and sequencing using cDNA libraries and          primers that mapped upstream of the LRRs and in the          Cterminal region primers indicated in Fig C          demonstrated that the           caenorhabditis and           drosophila putative proteins          hereafter named ceCCR and dCCR with assigned GenBank          accession numbers AY and AY respectively          Table  also possess in their Nterminal region a LRR          motif related to that of the yCCR protein Fig Band           Alignment of the leucinerich repeats Fig  of the          human murine           drosophila caenorhabditis and          yeast proteins disclosed high conservation of the          residues previously shown to define the amino          acidlong LRRs including those of yCCR and of the          adenylyl cyclase PxxaxxaxxLxxLxLsxNxaxxa     thus          suggesting that the function of this motif has been          conserved from yeast to mammals Besides proteins from          animals two           arabidopsis predicted proteins          arag and arag Table  also branch with          significative bootstrap values with the CCR family          proteins Interestingly although their Cterminal          regions display significant similarity with the yCCR          Cterminus  none of these two proteins possesses a          LRR domain see Fig Band Discussion Finally it          should be noted that the proteins of the CCR family are          all significantly smaller than the yeast member all of          them lacking the two activation domains aa  to           located in the yCCR Nterminal region see          Discussion          Finally BLAST searches identified a           S cerevisiae putative protein          yo accession number NP and an           A thaliana predicted protein          arag accession number Atg which disclose          similarity with the Cterminal part of the yCCR protein           and  respectively but which do not cluster in          an unambiguous manner with any protein from the four          families Fig A It should be noted that all the           A thaliana S cerevisiae D          melanogaster C elegans and           H sapiens genes disclosing          similarities with yCCR have most probably been          identified since the genomes of these five species have          now been entirely sequenced and since a BLAST search          using the Nterminal instead of the Cterminal sequence          of yCCR aa  did not reveal any significant          similarity with any other protein from the databases                          Genomic organization of the yCCRrelated gene          families          Phylogenetic relationships between the yCCRrelated          proteins was also analysed through the characterization          of the genomic organization of the corresponding genes          Fig C The intronexon boundaries were determined          upon alignment of the coding regions of cDNA sequences          with the corresponding genomic sequences available in          genomic databases Table  For all families the          genomic organization of several members of the family          could be compared In all cases the human locus was          significantly longer than the           drosophila andor           caenorhabditis locus as a result          of an increase in intron number andor size The four          families do not behave similarly when considering the          evolution of the number of exons at least for the animal          genes In the CCR angel and  families the           drosophila genes contain   and           exons respectively whereas the human genes contain            and  exons consistent with a gain of introns in          evolution Conversely a loss of intron can be suspected          for the nocturnin family for which the           drosophila and mammalian genes          disclose  and  exons respectively In all families          yeast genes are devoid of intron and           arabidopsis genes display the most          exons Although the number of exons is clearly not          constant within a given family intron positions are in          several cases conserved except for the  family and          for           arabidopsis genes which do not          share any intron position with their family members see          Fig C In the CCR family  introns of the           drosophila gene and  introns of          the           caenorhabditis gene have positions          homologous to those of the human gene In the nocturnin          and angel family the           drosophila and human genes share          one intron position Conversely paralogous genes in a          given species ie genes belonging to different          families do not have any intron position in common          These features suggest at least for the nocturnin CCR          and angel families that proteins which cluster in the          same family indeed share a common ancestor in agreement          with the phylogenetic data They also strongly suggest          that introns were independently acquired in the four          families This could be easily accounted for assuming          that the four families were derived by gene duplication          from an ancestral gene or genes devoid of intron at          the time of duplication                          Conservation among the yCCRrelated proteins of          a Mg dependent endonucleaselike domain with          CCRspecific residues          Dlakic    and Hofmann           et al    recently reported that          the xenocturnin and yCCR proteins contain a domain with          similarities with the enzymatic core of Mg dependent          endonucleases Therefore we investigated whether such          sequence similarities also exist for the other          yCCRrelated proteins with possibly conserved features          specific for these proteins The multiple sequence          alignment of all yCCRrelated Cterminal regions Fig           allowed the identification of several blocks of local          homology with more than  similarity among          yCCRrelated proteins as well as residues strictly          conserved among these proteins see below This          alignment could be extended to the enzymatic core of          three characteristic Mg dependent endonucleases the          bovine DNAseI    and two apurinicapyrimidinic AP          DNArepair endonucleases ie the           E coli Exonuclease III    and          the human HAP protein     These nucleases share the          same catalytic residues and form a similar fourlayered          sandwich motif Interestingly the blocks of homology          defined for the yCCRrelated proteins all correspond to          secondarystructure elements strand or helix which          form the core of AP endonucleases Fig  In addition          the putative active residues shared by both AP          endonucleases and DNAseI        are strictly          conserved in all the yCCRrelated proteins these are          residues involved in catalysis indicated by triangles in          Fig  Mg binding indicated by black circles          orientation or stabilization of catalytic residues          indicated by squares or interaction with the phosphate          group indicated by empty circles Hence all the          yCCRrelated proteins possess as observed for yCCR a          Cterminal Mg dependent endonucleaselike domain          Alignment of the yCCRrelated proteins with the Mg          dependent endonucleases discloses another important          feature  several residues Leu  Arg  and Glu           indicated with an asterisk in Fig  can be identified          which are strictly invariant among all the yCCRrelated          proteins but have no equivalent in the presently aligned          APendonucleases and DNAseI or in other Mg dependent          endonuclease foldcontaining proteins previously          described not shown      These CCRspecific          amino acids are most probably relevant to functions          common to and specific for all yCCRrelated proteins          see Discussion                          Interaction of the human homolog of yCCR with          hCAF and hPOPCALIF          The search for yCCRrelated proteins identifies          possible orthologs of yCCR according to the sequence          analyses reported above To confirm these data and gain          some hints for the existence of a CCRNOT complex in          mammals we investigated whether the interaction between          yCCR and yPOP in the CCRNOT complex is conserved for          the human ortholog hCCR Two homologs of yPOP have          been identified in mammals the mousehuman CAF                and more recently the human homolog named hPOP          or hCALIF      Both mCAF    and hPOP             interact with yCCR and the yCCR LRR is essential for          these interactions To determine whether yCCRyPOP          interactions are evolutionarily conserved we examined          whether hCCR can bind hCAF and hPOP in a twohybrid          assay in mammalian cells The complete hCCR cDNA was          obtained KIAA cDNA Kazusa DNA Research Institute          and vectors were constructed to express hCCR fused to          the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL transcription          factor pGalhCCR Fig A A vector expressing hCAF          pVPhCAFl or hPOP pVPhPOP fused to the VP          activation domain was also produced Fig A Twohybrid          proteinprotein interaction assays were performed in Hela          cells with a reporter plasmid pGTKLuc containing          six GAL binding elements upstream of the thymidine          kinase TK promoter region fused to the luciferase          reporter gene Fig A In Hela cells transfected with          the fusion constructs and the reporter plasmid an          interaction between GAL and VP fusion proteins should          result in an increase in luciferase expression Fig A          As observed in Fig B coexpression of pGalhCCR with          either pVPhCAF or pVPhPOP elicited a significant          increase   fold in pGTKLuc expression thus          demonstrating association between hCCR and either hCAF          or hPOP This increase is dependent on the presence of          the leucinerich repeats within hCCR since deletion of          four out of the five leucinerich repeats within          pGalhCCRLRR see Materials and Methods completely          abolished the effect Fig  Finally a GAL fusion          vector expressing a murine paralog of hCCR i e          mnocturnin had no effect when coexpressed with either          pVPhCAF or pVPhPOP Fig  thus indicating that          mnocturnin does not interact with hCAF or hPOP as          expected from the absence of an LRR domain in this          protein As a control pGalhCCR alone or in          association with the pVPnone plasmid had no          effect          To verify that hCCR can bind directly to hCAF we          performed a farWestern blot analysis Fig           Bacterially produced purified GSTCAF and control GST          proteins were subjected to SDSPAGE transferred onto a          membrane and probed with a Smethioninelabeled hCCR          protein synthesized in vitro As shown in Fig           specific hybridization was observed only with GSTCAF          and not

LRRcontaining orthologs of          yCCR          In the course of our search for genes encoding          proteins displaying significant similarity with the yeast          yCCR factor the best hits were found for cDNAs encoding          a family of proteins from           C elegans D melanogaster M          musculus and           H sapiens that we further          characterized by both in silico and in vivo approaches          By several criteria these proteins appear to be yCCR          orthologs First they cluster together with yCCR in a          phylogenetic tree constructed for the yCCRrelated          proteins Likewise analysis of their genomic          organization revealed that the           caenorhabditis drosophila and          human CCR genes had several introns in common located          at homologous positions suggesting that they arose from          a common ancestor Second their Nterminus contain a          five leucinerich repeat domain disclosing a high level          of similarity with that of yCCR and with strictly          conserved amino acids at consensus positions Third the          ability of yCCR to bind mCAF and hPOP is conserved for          the mammalian protein since we could demonstrate using          twohybrid assays and farWestern blot analyses an in          vivo and in vitro interaction between hCCR and hCAF or          hPOPCALIF Moreover we could show using a deletion          within the leucinerich repeat domain that this motif is          essential for the interaction a key feature of the          previously characterized yCCR factor          Interestingly the putative hCCR mCCR dCCR and          ceCCR proteins are much smaller than yCCR In fact          they contain the central LRR plus Cterminal region of          yCCR but they lack its Nterminus residues  It          is noteworthy that in yCCR these two parts of the          protein  and  have welldefined and          distinct functions which can be uncoupled The          Nterminal region contains two transactivation domains          one of which is glucoserepressed residues  This          region can by itself activate transcription when          targeted to the DNA via a heterologous DNAbinding domain              On the other hand the LRR plus Cterminal region          of yCCR cannot mediate transcription activation but is          involved in proteinprotein interactions     The          yCCR LRR is necessary for the binding of several          components of the CCRNOT complex including yPOP and          mCAF     yDBF     yCAF and yCAF              and deletion of the yCCR Nterminus does not impair          these associations Consistently the region encompassing          the LRR and part of the Cterminus residues  has          been defined as the smallest region necessary and          sufficient for the association of yCCR with yPOP                       Conservation of the yCCR LRR plus Cterminus          together with the absence of its Nterminus in the CCR          proteins of animals could be interpreted along two          lines First the Nterminal domain might mediate          yeastspecific functions eg glucoseregulated growth          not conserved in animals because they were unnecessary or          redundant in these species Second the N and Cterminal          domains observed in the yCCR multifunctional protein          might have been split into two or more independent          proteins in animals If neither interpretation can as yet          be favoured it is noteworthy that yCCR evolution          parallels that of its partner in the CCRNOT complex          namely yPOP Indeed both human homologs of yPOP hCAF          and hPOP lack the  Nterminal amino acids which are          in yPOP required for transcriptional activation          whereas the yPOP Cterminus which is involved in the          interaction with yCCR is conserved in hCAF    and          hPOP     Similarly hNOT the human homolog of the          yNOT component of the CCRNOT complex harbors a          Nterminal domain divergent from that of yNOT required          for transcriptional activation and interaction with the          yeast ADA factor but has conserved the Cterminal          domain which is absolutely required for the          yCCRassociated function of yNOT      Therefore          it looks as if genes of the CCRNOT complex have          undergone a concerted phylogenetic evolution with the          yeast genes encoding multifunctional proteins and the          animal genes only encoding specialized proteins          specific for the CCRNOT complex It is tempting to          speculate that partition of the CCR or POP functions in          the course of evolution has been positively selected as          resulting in a gain of efficacy Along this line Draper           et al    observed that the two          transactivation domains present in the yCCR Nterminus          residues  to  are alone more potent activators          than within the fulllength yCCR protein Likewise          mCAF which has lost the Nterminal transactivation          domain of yPOP binds to yCCR with a higher affinity          than yPOP              In yeast yCCR is one of the components of the           MDa CCRNOT complex which also includes yPOP and at          least five yNOT proteins In this complex yPOP          independently binds to yCCR and to yNOT A previous          report    identified the human orthologs of yPOP          hPOPCALIF and yNOT hNOT and showed that they          have conserved their ability to bind to each other          Hence the present identification of the human ortholog          of yCCR and the demonstration that it binds to hPOP now          provide an additionnal piece of the puzzle strongly          suggesting the existence of a CCRNOT complex in humans          Additionally yCCR interacts via its LRR domain with          three other proteins ie yDBF yCAF and yCAF of          the  MDa CCRNOT complex Conservation of the LRR          domain in hCCR suggests that the interaction with these          proteins might be conserved as well in humans          Interestingly we found that hCCR also binds to the          second human yPOP paralog hCAF However at variance          with hPOP hCAF is not able to interact with hNOT nor          with hNOT     This suggests that human cells may          contain at least two complexes involving a CCRPOP          association a CCRNOTPOP complex analogous to the          CCRNOT yeast complex and a still unknown CCRCAF          containing complex Interestingly in yeast only one          CCRPOP complex has been described until now whereas          CCRPOP interactions have been found associated with          both transcription regulation and mRNA deadenylase          activity This may suggest a physical partition of          these two CCRPOPassociated functions in the course of          evolution                          Four families of yCCRrelated genes function and          origin          Recently Dlakic    and Hofmann           et al    showed that the yCCR          Cterminus contains a fold related to the Mg dependent          endonuclease core yCCR was also shown to be a component          of the major yeast cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase complex          and to be required for efficient polyAspecific mRNA          degradation      Interestingly this          yCCRdependent activity copurifies with yPOP Since the          presently characterized mammalian yCCR ortholog has          conserved the ability to bind yPOP homologs and displays          high sequence similarities with yCCR in the nuclease          core domain it suggests that the mammalian yCCR          orthologs might also be associated with a deadenylase          function The three other characterized families of          yCCRrelated proteins have also conserved catalytic          residues and structural elements of the Mg dependent          nuclease core In addition their nuclease regions          possess residues which are strictly invariant among all          the yCCRrelated proteins from plants to humans and          which are not conserved in any other Mg dependent          endonucleasecontaining protein thus strenghtening the          notion of a common and specific function for the          yCCRrelated proteins Hence according to the present          data proteins of the angel  or nocturnin families          may deserve the same putative function as yCCR ie          deadenylation or at least share common substrate binding          andor catalytic specificities for instance preference          for RNA andor poly A tail Along this line          CCRspecific conserved residues may be important for the          setting of such a specificity whereas the presence or          not of a LRR domain may determine different associations          for these proteins possibly responsible for differences          in cellular localization or in enzymatic activity Until          now the only known deadenylase in vertebrates is a          polyAspecific exoribonuclease PARN a member of the          RNaseD family of exonucleases     The present          results therefore propose a series of new putative          mammalian deadenylases and predict a set of residues          that should be functionally important for all          yCCRrelated proteins          Finally the high level of similarity among the          Cterminal regions of all paralogous yCCRrelated          proteins along with the divergence of their Nterminal          domains is intriguing in terms of phylogenetic          evolution The Cterminus strong conservation leads to          the assumption that all the related genes derive by          duplication events from a common ancestor but the          identity of this ancestral gene and the date of expansion          can only be hypothesized Occurrence within the CCR          family of LRRcontaining genes both in yeast and animals          suggests that a LRRcontaining gene existed before the          divergence of yeast and animals Whether such a          LRRcontaining gene could be the common ancestor for all          the yCCRrelated genes with deletion of the LRR and          several duplication events for the angel  and          nocturnin families is not known However the fact that          the two           arabidopsis proteins which cluster          with the LRRcontaining proteins in the CCR branch Fig          A do not possess a LRR domain is not in favour of the          existence of a LRRcontaining ancestor in that case at          least two independent LRR deletion events versus one LRR          acquisition event see below would be required to          generate the angel  and nocturnin families on the          one hand and the CCR           arabidopsis proteins on the other          hand Along this line BLAST searches in bacteria          databases disclosed in one incompletely sequenced          bacterial genome            Paenibacillus azotofixans  an          open reading frame nt  to  in the AJ          genomic clone which contains almost all and displays          significant similarity with the yCCR Cterminal region          but does not contain a LRR nor a Nterminal domain It is          therefore plausible that a Cterminal core domain          existed first which was subsequently duplicated several          times giving rise to the four identified protein          families and which has been well conserved because it          deserved a common enzymatic function at the opposite of          the Nterminal divergent regions A LRR domain would have          been acquired in one of the duplicates prior to the          divergence of animals and fungi                            Conclusions        The present characterization in higher eukaryotes of        proteins related to the yeast yCCR factor leads to two        main conclusions Firstly we identified yCCR mammalian        orthologs and demonstrated that the human member can        interact with the human yPOP homologs This result along        with the identification by others of human homologs of NOT        proteins now provides strong evidence for the existence of        a human CCRNOT complex with conserved proteinprotein        interactions Secondly we showed that all members of the        four yCCRrelated protein families that we have        characterized contain the canonical catalytic residues and        motifs of the Mg dependent endonuclease core as well as        strictly conserved yCCRspecific residues These proteins        might constitute a new family of deadenylases in mammals        for which critical residues can be predicted                    Materials and Methods                  Sequence analyses          DNA and aminoacid sequences were examined for          homology with the nonredundant nucleotide protein and          dbEST databases at the NCBI using the BLAST  program          Multiple alignments of aminoacid sequences were carried          out using CLUSTALW computer algorithms     The          aligned sequences were further analysed either by the          distances method NeighborJoining program or by the          parsimony method Protpars program not shown In the          former case trees were constructed using different          parameters ie correction or not for multiple          substitutions and exclusion or not of the positions          with gaps The trees obtained under these various          conditions were closely related disclosing only limited          variations in the branching pattern of the identified          phylogenetic families                          Characterization of yCCRrelated cDNAs          Characterization of dnocturnin and dCCR cDNAs was          achieved by PCR using two           drosophila cDNA libraries an oligo
