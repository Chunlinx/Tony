                    Background        Human chromosome qq is associated with genomic        disorders involving deletions duplications and        triplications of different intervals in this region The        formation of these cytogenetic abnormalities is mediated by        lowcopy repeated sequences or duplicons     High        sequence homology between copies presumably facilitates        mispairing and unequal recombination events in meiosis        Interstitial deletion of qq results in PraderWilli        syndrome PWS MIM   or Angelman syndrome AS MIM          when deletions occur on the paternallyderived        or maternallyderived homolog respectively see Figure         reviewed in refs       Interstitial duplication of        the same interval has been found in cases of autism and        data suggest a higher risk for autism with maternal        compared to paternal duplications       Chromosome         is the most frequently involved chromosome in cases of        autism with supernumerary marker chromosomes qderived        markers are inverted duplicated and pseudodicentric        structures and are known as inv dup or idic Small        markers which do not contain the PWSAS deletion interval        are associated with a normal phenotype     Larger        idic duplications are typically associated with a more        severe autistic phenotype than that seen in cases of        interstitial duplication           The        increased severity may be due to the presence of two        additional copies of this region however these        duplications also extend significantly farther        telomerically and therefore contain more duplicated genes        ldic markers also vary in the location of the distal        breakpoint depending on which duplicon sequence mediated        the rearrangement Interstitial triplications have also        been described and these tend to utilize variable distal        breakpoints common to idic chromosomes            Triplications are associated with a phenotype analogous to        that for idic when maternallyderived              Several functional duplicons have been described and        these may be divided into two classes There are two        proximal breakpoints BP and BP that define two classes        of PWSAS deletion     The common distal breakpoint is        termed BP and has a bipartite structure      The        BP and BP duplicons span several hundred kb and contain        at least seven expressed sequences One prominent example        is the         HERC Hect domain and Rcc domain        protein  gene     Approximately          HERC copies have been identified on        chromosomes  and  although most map to qq        Another class of q duplicons has been termed LCRs for        low copy repeats      These share some sequences in        common with the large         HERC duplicons LCRs extend only         kb individually but are often present in clusters        extending to  kb This class of duplicon has been        proposed to help mediate rearrangements in idic markers        and larger interstitial duplications and triplications                   The gene encoding the amyloid precursor proteinbinding        protein A          APBA  was previously mapped to        chromosome     and localized to the common PWSAS        deletion region centromeric to BP and distal to a cluster        of GABA         A receptor subunit genes     see        Figure  This location made         APBA an attractive positional        candidate gene for involvement in duplicationassociated        and inherited autism On this basis we sought to        characterize         APBA in terms of structure and        expression APBA has also been termed Mint for        Muncinteracting protein  or X Mint functions as a        neuronal adaptor protein that binds to the Munc        protein which is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis            Biederer and Sdhof have shown that a multiprotein        complex containing Mint APBA binds to the cytoplasmic        tail of neurexins which play a critical role in synaptic        vesicle exocytosis Mint and Mint can bind directly to        neurexins via a PDZ domainmediated interaction Thus the        Mint proteins serve to anchor Munc to the neurexins and        thereby facilitate exocytosis We show here that         APBA actually maps to a more distal        location outside the narrow common interstitial        deletionduplication interval but within the larger        idic duplications We found that a large  and the        first coding exon of         APBA is duplicated and these        transcriptionally inactive copies are located at more        telomeric sites within the region The nature of the        duplication may have implications for the evolution of        APBAMint from its other family members                    Results        We sought to characterize the structure and expression        of the         APBA gene as a prelude to analysis        of this gene as a possible autism candidate We obtained a        bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clone I        containing genomic sequence of the         APBA transcriptional unit We also        obtained yeast artificial chromosome YAC clones covering        the interval between the  end of         GABRG and         OCA D contig WC and to        which an         APBA EST Wl and nearby        markers had been mapped C contig WC STS content        mapping demonstrated that         APBA sequences and other markers are        present within the BAC I and YAC C but absent from        the YAC clone covering the         GABRGOCA interval Figure b        Thus the previous map position appeared to be incorrect        Based on STS marker content in the  clone         APBA maps to a more distal location        in q The revised map position places         APBA outside of the most narrow        interstitial duplication interval and the area most        supported by linkage data but within the larger idic        duplications Current genomic sequence assemblies now agree        with this experimentallydetermined data        To facilitate direct screening of         APBA  we determined the gene        structure and developed exonspecific PCR assays We        characterized genomic structure using a combination of        existing genomic sequence and direct sequencing from BAC        clone template         APBA is encoded by  exons         exons are coding and  exons contain  untranslated        sequence All exons are now accurately predicted in the        NCBI Genbank NT and Celera assemblies while the        EnsembI assembly lacks the putative first exon A sequence        containing this exon has been deposited in GenBank        accession AY Junctions for most exons were        confirmed by direct sequencing from RP BAC K        template which also contains the         APBA transcriptional unit Table        itemizes intronexon boundary information Primer        sequences and conditions for PCR amplification of coding        exons  are presented in Table          APBA is transcribed towards the        telomere        In the course of analyzing the structure of         APBA  we noted that a large  exon        containing the initiating methionine codon was present not        only in the I BAC but also highly homologous to        sequences from other BAC clones with nonoverlapping STS        content         In silico STS content mapping        revealed two distinct pairs of BAC clones containing the        partial duplications Figure a One of these RP        clones M and P also contains a partial        duplication of a pseudogene containing the  end of the        neuronal nicotinic receptor   subunit          CHRNA  gene     This        pseudogene locus maps to a site telomeric to         APBA in q The second group of        BACs RP P and  H contained the partial         APBA duplication and the K CI        cotransporter          SLCA or KCC gene The        duplications include the entire kb exon and kb of        downstream sequence however this sequence is interrupted        in the intact locus by an kb nonduplicated interval        The first block of homology includes exon   bp of        sequence  and  bp  to the exon Following the        homology gap there is an additional  bp of duplicated        sequence Furthermore an additional  kb region in both        sets of BACs containing partial         APBA duplications is highly        homologous to a region approximately  kb upstream of the        presumptive first exon of         APBA  Current sequence assemblies        show the correct map location for the intact locus and show        the map location of these dupAPBA sequences at  Mb        telomeric        BLAST analysis of BACS containing the partial         APBA duplications revealed        dupliconlike sequences based on significant homology to a        large number of BACs from known duplicons The largest        number of similarities detected  corresponds to an        interval of  kb located  kb centromeric to the         APBA duplications However there is        highly significant homology over kb of sequence from        assembly contig NT mapping to q where LCR        duplicon sequences have been reported     These        sequences appear to correspond to the LCR class of        duplicons based on sequence content BLAST analysis of        sequence at the intact locus revealed a similar low copy        repeat or duplicontype sequence of kb More than         copies of this sequence are present at sites across the        genome on every chromosome and with an apparent clustering        at telomere locations This sequence while short does not        correspond to any of the known chromosome qq        duplicon sequences and therefore could represent a novel        class of such low copy repeats This sequence has been        deposited in GenBank AY It is worth noting that        the presence of multiple duplicons and repeated sequences        has significantly complicated genomic sequence assembly for        this region        Since the partial duplications of         APBA contained the first coding exon        and the transcription start sites for         APBA have not been characterized we        sought to determine whether these copies were        transcriptionally active We developed restriction fragment        length polymorphism RFLP assays to detect sequence        differences discriminating the intact         APBA locus from the partial        duplications These assays were used following PCR from        genomic or BAC DNA and cDNA from adult and fetal human        brain Figure c Distinct fingerprint patterns are        apparent for the intact locus and the duplications The        sequence differences used in Figure cthat distinguish the        duplications from the intact locus do not distinguish the        duplications from each other This distinction was made        based on         in silico analysis of numerous        sequence differences clonesequence assembly and        clonemarkergene content relationships The pattern in        cDNA samples was identical to that in clone I but not        either of the two duplications These data argue that the        only transcript present in brain corresponds to the intact        locus and that the two partial duplications are therefore        not transcribed        Immediately telomeric to         APBA lies another gene KIAA        see Figure a which was initially identified from a        sequencing project of large brainderived cDNAs            KIAA encodes a protein of unknown function and is        transcribed in the opposite orientation relative to         APBA  BLASTP using the KIAA        predicted amino acid sequence detects weak homology         identity  similarity over  residues to a protein        termed X the gene for which is located in the q        Freidrichs ataxia region The X gene in turn maps        immediately adjacent to         APBA alias Mint or X APBA        and APBA are highly homologous for the Cterminal half of        their respective sequences  similar  identical        The Nterminal half corresponding to the duplicated exon        is only weakly similar  similar  identical Thus        the distinction between the APBA and APBA proteins        corresponds to exon encoded residues Despite the        comparatively weak homology between the KIAA and X        predicted peptides this scenario suggests a clear        evolutionary relationship between these gene pairs The        propensity of the qq region to undergo rearrangement        may have played a role in the evolution of this gene        family        The distribution of         APBA brain expression was determined        using         in situ hybridization and northern        blotting Commercial brain northern blots were hybridized        with a cDNA probe corresponding to exon  Such a probe        allows us to discriminate between         APBA expression and potential signal        from         APBA  Northern blotting revealed a        predominant moderateabundance transcript of kb widely        distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord Figure        a Several smaller transcripts were also seen A cDNA        clone for the mouse ortholog of         APBA was obtained and a similar        probe was used to test for expression using         in situ hybridization to mouse brain        sections Figure bshows representative coronal and        sagittal mouse brain sections         Apba demonstrates moderate        expression in mouse cortical and limbic regions including        frontal parietal and temporal cortex hippocampus        amygdala thalamus and cerebellum and lower level        expression in many other regions summarized in Table  A        developmental expression series illustrating expression        from embryonic day  through day  EE is shown in        Figure  Early expression in the primitive neural tube        emerges at day E         Apba expression extends throughout        the neural tube during days E and E but is apparently        restricted to the primitive brain vesicles during days E        and E Within the brain distribution is ubiquitous and        uniform In addition to diffuse expression throughout the        brain by day E a punctate pattern appears around the        spinal cord corresponding to expression within the dorsal        root ganglia        The availability of emerging mouse genomic sequence        allowed us to examine sequence conservation across the        transcriptional unit We submitted human and mouse genomic        sequences to the VISTA web site        httpwwwgsdlblgovvistaand homology is plotted and        shown in Figure  Murine genomic sequence for exons  and         was not available and the comparison was made for the        remainder of the transcriptional unit We would expect        coding sequences to be conserved but regions of noncoding        conservation which could harbour potential functional        conserved sequences are of particular interest Several        such regions are present within the         APBA transcriptional unit                    Discussion        We have described the mapping of         APBA to q within a region        duplicated in idic marker chromosomes thus clarifying        the map position of this gene While public and private        sequence assemblies now depict the correct location for        this gene previous published reports indicated that this        gene mapped proximal to BP within the PWSAS deletion and        autismassociated interstitial duplication interval             STS content mapping with regional clones confirms the        predicted genomic assemblies and places this gene distal to        the BP HERCcontaining breakpoint Two partial         APBA copies containing the first        coding exon and downstream sequence and are located Mb        telomeric in q This location contains dupliconlike        sequences based on BLASTdetected homology relationships        to other nonoverlapping BAC clones which contain        LCRinclusive sequences This region may represent yet        another functional duplicon This suggests the possibility        of such sequences upstream from         APBA  most likely corresponding to        BP or in a sequence gap between         HERC and         APBA  The existence of a        dupliconlike region near         APBA would most easily explain the        duplication The duplicated region corresponded to two        blocks in the intact locus which are joined together in the        duplication copies perhaps reflecting the original        organization of the intact ancestral locus Within the         kb gap between homology blocks another lowcopy repeat        sequence of  kb was identified The pattern of partial        duplication seen with         APBA is similar to that of         CHRNA  The repetitive nature of        this region has presented significant challenges to genomic        sequence assembly It is likely that repeated elements        cause some segments to be poorly represented in E        colibased libraries Our interest in this gene was driven        by its plausibility as a candidate for autism based upon        function The location of         APBA outside the narrow        deletionduplication interval makes this gene less        attractive as a candidate for inherited autism However        overexpression of this gene in idic cases could be        responsible in part for the increased phenotypic severity        in those cases compared to interstitial duplication        We characterized gene structure for the human gene and        expression for both human and mouse genes There are         known exons  of which are shown in the current public        human genomic sequence assemblies A putative first exon        corresponding to the  end of the Celera transcript maps        at least kb upstream of exon  Based on a combination        of the public and Celera assemblies the         APBA transcriptional unit spans         kb We provided primer sequences and amplification        conditions to facilitate SNP and disease variant discovery        at this locus                APBA is expressed throughout the        central nervous system in the adult human and mouse and        developing mouse embryos The kb predominant        transcript is larger than the longest available mRNA        sequence of  bp The difference is most likely due to        as yet unidentified  untranslated exons or by use of        alternative polyadenylation sites The presence of multiple        consensus polyadenylation signals both before and after the        one utilized in this transcript is consistent with the        latter hypothesis Additionally less abundant smaller        transcripts exist EST data supports the occurrence of        alternative splicing for this gene To our knowledge        transcriptional initiation sites have not been        characterized for         APBA  The fact that the partial        duplication copies are not expressed supports the premise        that the intact locus may not have a transcriptional        initiation site at exon         Genomic sequence corresponding to the mouse ortholog is        present in the public assembly although sequence upstream        of exon  is not available VISTA comparison of human and        mouse sequences reveals several sites of conserved        noncoding sequences these may contain functional elements        necessary for proper expression                    Conclusions        The         APBA gene maps to q telomeric        to         HERC and BP Partial duplications        of a kb segment containing the first coding exon are        present as two copies at Mb telomeric in q and are        not transcribed The pattern of duplication for         APBA adds to a complex mosaic        including many dupliconlike structures in q The        tendency of this region to undergo rearrangement may bear        relation to the evolution of this gene family                    Methods                  PCR Analysis of APBA Clones and Expression
