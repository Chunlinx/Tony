                                 The Death of the Comic Strip                        Dear Steve            Im kind of surprised that we never got down to discussing the BrooklynMuseum of Arts Sensation show Have you seen it I havent just read theusual reportage As usual I hate both sides of the debatethe conservativeBiblethumping morons who hate anything other than their own racist andhomophobic rhetoric as well as the liberal simpletons who favor the NEA            Back when I was a struggling cartoonist trying to get my career off theground I applied for a  NEA grant to allow me to cut my day job back to hours a week I wanted to focus on marketing and improving my cartoons sothat I could turn it into a fulltime job Guess what the NEA people told meThey liked my stuff but Cartoons are not an art form  Tell it to BillWatterson or for that matter to Charles Schulz My response to them PissChrist is My objection to the Brooklyn Museums show is that itsprovocation without substance it isnt so much offensive as it is dull andpredictable But the bottom line is postDada art is subjective and theresno way any group of government experts can render a fair judgment as to whatsgood art and what isnt Either give money to everyone who calls themselves anartisthey its a better use of tax money than B bombersor dont give itto anyone at all            OK down to cartooning I now officially pronounce the art of the comicstrip dead Perhaps theres something running in some paper somewhere that Idont get to read thats really great but I havent seen it So as far as Iknow all comic strips seriously suck I would make an exception forPeanuts  which has become popular in the comics world to trash ifthat strip came out today as is it would be too weird and melancholy for dailypapers it might run in a few of the more daring weeklies            Most of the interesting stuff is going on in the alternative weeklies RubenBollings Tom the Dancing Bug is handsdown my favorite strip in America Imjealous of the ideas that guy comes up withalways topical hilarioussardonic smart I always check out my friendly competitor Tom TomorrowsThis Modern World  And although I dont get to see it as muchanymorethe New York Press is very uneven about running itCarol LaysStory Minute is one of Americas unsung gemssad and ironic            Editorial cartooning I assume youll agree has declined into stupid gagsabout the news my test for a good editorial cartoon is that you should be ableto tell the artists political affiliation andor stance on an issue at aglance If you cant be absolutely certain its not an editorial cartoonitsa gag cartoon in that they make me want to gag well Roz Chast is OK Thebrighter lights in the field in my opinion are the LexingtonHeraldLeader s Joel Pett the Philadelphia Daily News  SigneWilkinson and Jack Ohman of the Oregonian  among others Everyonealways talks about the genius of Pat Oliphant and he is an amazing draftsmanbut he doesnt give a shit about anything which makes his work soulless TheNew York Post s Sean Delonas work drives me nuts the fact that such aninept artist and politicallydead commentator is working fulltime is an insultto those of us who have been looking for fulltime cartooning work for yearsand been rejected for inane reasonshe is the worst of a lousy lot            The most depressing aspect of the profession for me is that the youngest newhires at the big dailiesGeneration Y guys under are indistinguishablefrom their parents and grandparents they draw like Jeff MacNelly but withoutMacNellys wit or intelligence It seems that all editors want these days ischeap jokes without venom            I shouldnt leave out comic books I like Peter Bagge Hate but I thinkIvan Brunetti who does a filthy rancid brutal comic book called Schizo isbrilliant Hes so totally selfloathing I keep worrying that hell killhimself before he does the next one which would be sad since hes such agenius This stuff is not however for the faint of heart Perhaps the mostoverrated creator in comics today is Chris Ware his art is soso hiscompositional skills are amazing but he has absolutely nothing to say Its acosmic joke that someone so talented is so utterly clueless about the realworld Ive read book after book by this guy in an effort to understand whyhes so highly regarded by comics critics but I dont get itmaybe its hisfondness for retro s graphics People always relate to the familiar andiconic and reject whats truly new Journalistic conflict Ware wrote a letterto the Voice tearing me a new bunghole over my Art Spiegelman piece ButI always thought his work sucked his letter merely reminded me of hisexistence            All superhero comic books are stupid have always been stupid and should bebanned by lawand all of their readers over  should be deported to postcoupPakistan for service in the coming war against India            So who do you hate in cartooning Love            And yes Steve I do want to hear your Phil Harris theory ofpolitics            Very truly yoursTed
