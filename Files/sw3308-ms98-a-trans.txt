        there okay i hope weve done it right uh were supposed to talk about music     yes okay oh well thats good because im a singer   well good what kind of singer are you     um in high school and college it was classical lately its been more contemporary country   oh really do you do you sing in a group or   well no actually i do whats called karaoke um the   oh tell me what that is   its a a thing where youve got a background video that just has the background music the instrumentals and there the video has the words to the songs on it and you can sing along with the with the tape its pretty neat they do it at a lot of different clubs   oh   um like Dave and Busters and   oh yeah   oh little country bars and stuff   and and so you stand up in front of the   you get up in a front of the audience and a microphone   and and where and uh are you looking at the words   uhhuh yeah theyve got a little TV monitor on the stage most most places do   so so who sees it do you just see it   um the person singing sees the monitor and most places have a big screen behind you so that everybody can see the words yeah   so that everybody sees it do they sing along   uh not usually unless its a real ratty song  its its fun   well how cute so that way that keeps them from being able to have other uh have or other musicians   uhhuh uhhuh yeah its you some of the places do karaoke like once or twice a week and then they have like theres a a country bar or country saloon i used to go to that they have uh country bands most of the rest of the week   uhhuh   its its pretty neat i like it   well that and and you and so you get up and sing it yourself     uhhuh umhum   well great   i i i had a a music scholarship to college but i didnt use it  so what do you do   uhhuh well i am a music teacher  i teach uh elementary music in Plano and   oh how neat oh i dont know about elementary  i dont know i think elementary would be good  that would be interesting with the little kids   huh well it it it it has a lot of uh very  um  rewarding parts and then the there are lots of it that you know you feel like youre just a bouncer   uhhuh   uhhuh yeah i i i can remember music back then   and then the paperwork and all of that but generally where i am i um i uh this has been the the best situation in terms of not having a lots of discipline problems and and having children that really are pretty interested in in music in general   oh good hm   so its really been nice but   i think thats one reason i got out of music because i didnt think i wanted to go into teaching and at at that point it was either performing or teaching it was like oh well   well it and yeah it its and i think thats a real valid reason for not majoring in it my boys   yeah   were good in it and  they didnt even even i mean that was the reason they they took a lot of it in college but they didnt go on with it   yeah yeah well i after college i got out got married started working or started working got married and i didnt sing for ten years and i just found karaoke last October i guess and i was just thrilled i loved it its its neat   now you didnt you didnt sing in uh uh  during those ten years you didnt sing at all     um not really not in not in anything not in anything organized no   not even like in church choir   it periodically if we go to like a Christmas Eve services where they do the part of Messiah or something like that but that was about it but back in high school i was more of a classical kind of stuff through Wagner and Chopin and and Schubert and   umhum uhhuh uhhuh yeah things that they they have you do during high school   yeah yeah the things you have to do for competition   well what is what is your um uh what is your voice is it alto or   um in high school i was from second soprano down to tenor believe it or not  i i sang tenor a lot in church   my goodness  i kind of wondered i kind of wondered if your voice if you uh  might be you know old usually country singers uh or folksingers have lower voices that     uhhuh they yeah thats i found a lot of stuff like Anne Murray she i have to thats one thing neat about karaoke you can change pitches i mean you can change the keys   uhhuh ooh really   and her stuff i normally have to take up at least a step if not a step and a half   well is that a bad uh oh theyre probably i wonder if that means theyve cut us off   i dont know   heard a little   oh okay   i i cant remember ive only done this one other time   oh  good i dont feel bad   are you doing this uh as a fundraiser   no my im in a sorority but we decided not to do it for the sorority my boss his wife is one of the uh   uhhuh   the sorority the transcribers for the tapes and he was like do you wanna make some money okay here  so   umhum umhum my its an easy way to do it well were doing it in our church choir   yeah it is oh now thats a neat idea   and its supposed to you know be a a really i mean they a lot of theyve already made a lot of money on it   thats wow now that that would be a good idea yeah i proposed it for the uh for im in a service or actually its a social sorority and its Beta Sigma Phi   so isnt that yeah   and they decided no that we wouldnt not everybody might be able to make all the calls so i was like okay thats fine ill do it for myself   well i just decided i would do it once  try to do it once a night and um   uhhuh   and i i mean i just started doing it this week but uh  the first time we had to talk on exercise and then this time music so   um boy
