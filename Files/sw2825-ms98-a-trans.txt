        okay okay now as you were saying   i said one thing weve been doing around here is trying to find ways of having uh my husband likes gourmet food   uhhuh   and im trying to figure out how how to feed him so hell eat this stuff  and the kids will eat it too and its not going to be fattening high in fat or high in cholesterol gets to be a a real chore with little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese   right thats true um i have the same problem ive uh in fact both of us like cheese uh my children are grown now um and i also like ice cream so     i just have been fortunate with that i have never really had an ice cream fetish but im married to somebody who just feels that you know if you offer it to him hed eat a hot fudge sundae every night of the week   oh   and i hate him for it     yeah well everyone has their own little things right his is ice cream or hot fudge sundaes but i tell you what we use to do even when the children were growing up every Friday night   oh yeah   would be our night that um uh put to kids to bed when they were younger and my wife and i would would uh shed set the dining room table with candles and no one disturbed us no one called on Friday night and we would just have this quiet dinner for the two of us and that uh thats held up until our youngest is graduating college in the couple of weeks and we still do that   wow   um well we also like to do is we like to cook out a lot even in the winter time we got we got a grill and ive got like a wood shop off the garage and ive got a a like an over hang and we keep the grill out there so i just out and we you know grill steaks or salmon or whatever   uhhuh   um so um so i can give you something that we like to do   give me something thats really easy to do   or well clams casino if you like clams casino   i love clams but im not sure what clams casino are and i dont know if i could find clams that i would eat down here in Texas   oh yeah well but well i like  well you lived in Boston so you know a little about you know   uhhuh   and in a restaurant they they just kind of serve them on a half shell with a little bit of uh stuffing what we like the to do is uh is to cut them out and then cut them into little quarters or eighths you know not so much just one big bite   uhhuh   and then cut up fresh peppers and fresh tomatoes and fresh celery and bread crumbs and mix it all together and pre cook bacon so its kind of soft   uhhuh   and put a strip of bacon over the top of that and then and then pop them in the oven   God that sounds good   and we usually have that and then well have a salad and ill throw a steak on the grill with uh what i call a potato bake i buy a uh couple of yams and some either red potato or either white potato and i put them in a microwave and cook them so theyre fairly soft and i slice them i peel the yam slice that   uhhuh   i slice the white potato with the skin on i slice up a mild onion preferably a  onion   now in Texas it would have to be ten fifteen   oh and then i put it in tin foil and i interweave put a i put a slice of white potato and slice sweet potato and slice of onion and then i do that until i got the size of a baked potato put butter and salt on it garlic close the tin foil and i throw it on the grill cause i like it a little crispy on the bottom so i throw it on the grill maybe about   uh   ten minutes before i put the steak on and then once once the steak is done thats usually done and then we have uh   God that sound wonderful   and then either spinach i like spinach or uh asparagus because we grow own asparagus we have asparagus patch so in fact right now its its in season so we just go out and there lop off a few and then whatever you want for desert   well ill give you one that that that i i put together modified out of a Heart Smart Cookbook now my husband really thinks that this is one of those French fancy French sauces   oh   so when he  when he request this i always tell him he has to take the kids for an hour and it really only takes about fifteen or twenty minutes to do  but it gives me forty five minutes to sit by myself where its quiet   thats nice   but what you do is you go take you can use pork tender loin its more expensive but i and i like the leaner cut of pork   yeah   the um like the center cut pork chops   uhhuh   and you you need to have them thick at least a threequarters of an inch think   okay   and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade   okay   on both sides     um when you say lemon pepper marinade you put lemon juice and pepper together   no just the uh the you know you can do that just that you buy just lemon pepper   the spice that you buy   okay all right   and then you take about two tablespoons of butter which you know most people kind of go  you know this is a low fat recipe but it is   oh yeah     and you just melt that in a skillet   okay   you broken the uh the pork chops or the pork fillets   okay uhhuh   you just brown them on both sides and i like to get them at a good golden brown   yes   and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the juice of lemon about anywhere from a quarter to a half a cup to that you add two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce   two   and one teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on how much you like it   two tablespoons wait wait a minute that was two tablespoons of Worcestershire   uh yeah Worcestershire   okay   and then anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and what you do is you just cook this down and it makes a a really pretty almost dark black brown viscous sauce   uhhuh   its pretty spicy now i like to throw in just a you know a shot of white wine and then you just take the pork chops put them on a serving platter pour this sauce over it and i garnish it with fresh cut chives it really is a really pretty entree to look at   um   uhhuh and the sauce i mean it has kind of this nice complex flavor where you feel that somebodys you know played around with this all afternoon   yeah that   and i have served it to company   so so you cooked the the pork is cooked at that point then okay   and uhhuh but you know the trick with pork most people think you have to cook it at a hundred and eighty five degrees well done   oh no no   you dont have to do that it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference   oh uh um   the other thing that that ive really got into down here in Texas is fresh uh herbs   thats what we do we we grow our own and dry them and   oh yeah   um   well see i dont have to try them cause theyll theyll pretty much grow all winter long and if   yeah you guys are kind of lucky down there   oh i dont know we also have you know foot long roaches all year long too   yeah  yeah   hey dont laugh dont laugh but what makes a really elegant um just a side dish and most people dont have any idea what it is why they dont i dont know and you can make it a day ahead of time because i just take about a cup of fresh cut basil i mean i really like basil   yes   and then cook spaghetti and i the the this is smaller thread spaghetti its like the cappelletti is the better   okay yep   add and i add almost equal parts parmesan cheese a a healthy balance of garlic i mean i really like garlic   oh thats what we do we yeah   yeah so youre basically makes a kind of a a pesto   like a pesto yeah   yes but if you serve it cold it really is just a wonderful   so is it a cup of basil leave fresh basil leaves   uhhuh uhhuh and pine nuts and if you cant get pine nuts because to me theyre always kind of mushy i just grind up walnuts and use that in it   uh   it really is nice   yeah thats uh   and even my kids will eat it and theyve gotten to be kind of food snobs one of them went over to   were going were going to have that Friday were going to do the pork and we dont have the we dont have any fresh basil but weve got dried well well have to go down to the market   dry basil doesnt have quite the taste   it doesnt you cant pesto out of it theyve got some pesto frozen though   yeah i keep i do that and i find that it tastes just about as good       and i freeze it in like little half cup quantity so i can even pull it out whenever i want to   but i like that i like those uhhuh i like that sauce with the pork   you youll be surprised youll be really surprised at just how simple it is and and its not a a clear cut you know this this this and this its kind of to taste   and yeah thats what im going to do because we each take turns doing it you know i usually do the grill work and you know it depends if she makes uh uh anything with shrimp on it or not you know shell do that but ill do the grill stuff but this is nice this is i can cook the pork on the grill   uhhuh   and just make the sauce   you know what also is really good just really really good and really really simple if you like to do grilling if you can get a hold of fresh sage   yep yep   have you ever worked with that just take the fresh sage and and you know crumble it so that you you release the oils   yep   pour you know put that stuff over fresh pork chops and if youve got balsamic vinegar there   we do we make all of our vinegars in fact we do canning too we do all of our own canning and   oh i love that stuff oh i do my own vinegars too but just put a a touch of balsamic vinegar on that until
