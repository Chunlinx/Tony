                    Introduction        Hysterectomy is the most common gynecologic operation        performed in the United States It is estimated that by the        age of   of  women will have undergone a hysterectomy             Current practice in the United States strongly        favors total abdominal hysterectomy TAH over        supracervical hysterectomy SCH for benign gynecologic        disease However there has been a small but steady rise in        the number of supracervical hysterectomies performed both        regionally and nationally      The reasons for this        shift in hysterectomy type are multifactorial and poorly        understood but may reflect changing attitudes on the part        of both patients and surgeons favoring less invasive        operations Potential advantages of SCH over TAH include        decreased operative morbidity and reduced risk of urinary        and sexual dysfunction          Patient concerns        about sexual functioning after hysterectomy may also play a        role in the decision to undergo a supracervical        hysterectomy versus total abdominal hysterectomy        Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain why        cervical conservation SCH may have a less detrimental        effect on sexual function than TAH Early pioneering work        from the s    described elevation of both cervix        and uterus during the excitement and plateau phase followed        by fundal uterine contractions progressively involving the        lower uterine segment as orgasm developed Cervical os        dilatation occurred immediately afterwards implicating a        role for the cervix in the female sexual response        Another theory postulates that the ability to achieve        internal orgasm depends on the stimulation of nerve endings        of the uterovaginal cervical plexus of Frankenhauser             This plexus is a matrix of afferent nerve fibers        intimately surrounding the cervix Stimulation of the        cervix may contribute to a pleasurable sensation        ultimately experienced as orgasm Excision of the cervix        that occurs during TAH necessarily results in the loss of a        major portion of this plexus        Studies examining sexual function after hysterectomy are        contradictory and the controversy surrounding this topic is        not new Several investigators have reported a measurable        decrease in sexual response after total abdominal        hysterectomy       while others have found sexual        functioning improved after hysterectomy      Data        regarding sexual function after an aggregation of all types        of hysterectomy TAH SCH vaginal and laparoscopy assisted        vaginal hysterectomy are especially difficult to interpret            One intuitive mechanism to account for improved        sexual functioning post hysterectomy is the relief from        dyspareunia caused by excision of uterine pathology          ie fibroids menorrhagia        Although there have been many studies exploring the        general impact of total hysterectomy on sexual function        few have compared particular types of hysterectomy and        their associated effect on subsequent sexual function        Indeed only one investigator to date has explicitly        examined the effect of type of hysterectomy SCH versus        TAH on sexual function      A statistically        significant reduction in orgasm frequency among TAH        patients when compared to SCH was reported in this        population     Ours is the first investigation in over        a decade to offer a comparative analysis of sexual response        as a function of hysterectomy type SCH versus TAH                    Methods        A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who        had undergone a TAH or SCH at The New YorkPresbyterian        Hospital Weill Medical College of Cornell University from        January   to December   Patients with a        diagnosis of cancer gynecologic or nongynecologic        psychiatric illness neurologic disease diabetes chronic        pelvic pain endometriosis or a debilitating medical        condition were excluded Patients greater than age sixty        and nonEnglish speaking patients were excluded        Institutional review board approval was obtained before        data collection        A total of  hysterectomy patients were identified for        the study period and  of these did not meet criteria        for participation as defined above An additional  charts        could not be located This resulted in  patients        eligible for inclusion in the study Demographic data were        obtained from the chart review of these patients and were        entered into a computer database        All hysterectomies were performed intrafascially using        the clampcutligate method as described previously            For SCH patients the corpus was amputated below the        level of the internal cervical os The cervical stump was        closed using interrupted No  delayed absorbable suture        Polyglactin         Patients were sent a confidential questionnaire        developed by a multidisciplinary team comprised of        psychiatrists statisticians gynecologists pathologists        and a sexual therapist It was pretested on a group of        hysterectomy patients identified from a  chart review        at the same institution Patient response and feedback from        that survey resulted in the questionnaire being modified        and condensed to one page In its final form the survey        included  questions evaluating demographic data and        measuring the following sexual variables libido desire        frequency of intercourse dyspareunia orgasm frequency        multiple orgasm frequency and overall sexual satisfaction        All questions were in a multiplechoice format although        patients were allowed to add additional comments In the        questionnaire patients were asked to describe their sexual        function before and after their operation in absolute        rather than relative terms in order to minimize recall bias        Table  Preoperative to postoperative         change was then determined for each        sexual variable and recorded as better unchanged or        worse For example a patient who preoperatively reported        her frequency of intercourse per month as  and        postoperatively as  was identified as better        Nonrespondents were sent a second mailing approximately        one month later After this second questionnaire no        further attempt was made to contact patients Patients who        did not wish to participate in the study could so indicate        and they were not contacted further        Data were analyzed using the JMP statistical package        version  SAS Institute Carey North Carolina USA        Chisquare or Students         t test was used to evaluate        categorical or continuous demographic data and preoperative        sexual function variables as appropriate A multiple        logistic regression model was used to analyze independent        predictor variables Percent distributions were calculated        for all variables Statistical significance was defined as         P                      Results        The patientpartitioning schema for the study population        is shown in Figure  The proportion of responders was not        significantly different between the two surgical subgroups        Table  Fortyeight percent n   of women undergoing        a SCH returned the questionnaire while  n   of        those undergoing a TAR chose to participate While all        respondents answered the majority of questions not all        study patients answered every question Nonetheless there        was no question in the survey answered by fewer than  of        the respondents The mean time SD from surgery to        questionnaire was  months   months in the SCH        group and  months   months in the TAH group        range   months         P          The demographic data obtained from the chart review and        from the questionnaire are summarized in Table  The data        illustrate that the two groups do not differ significantly        except for oophorectomy status Significantly more women        underwent bilateral salpingoophorectomy BSO in the TAH        group than in the SCH group  percent versus  percent        respectively         P   Since removal of the        ovaries may have a deleterious effect on sexual function            the possible effects of oophorectomy on outcome        measures were considered in the analysis In addition we        considered the possible effects of hormone replacement        therapy HRT of current users on sexual function even        though the two surgical groups showed no significant        difference in reported use of HRT        Outcome variables in which a presurgical subjective        rating was elicited were evaluated and compared between the        two groups Table  In the TAH group three women        reported the absence of intercourse before surgery versus        no women in the SCH group while in the SCH group        proportionately more women reported intercourse         timesmonth Although the possible effect of this finding        on our ultimate outcomes was unclear we included it as a        possible confounder in our subsequent modeling process to        insure that the results were not biased We also added        consideration of prior expectations regarding the likely        effect of the surgery on sexual function in an attempt to        control for as many potential confounding variables as        possible        The results of our initial analysis led to the        construction of a multiple stepwise logistic regression        model in which type of procedure oophorectomy use of HRT        frequency of intercourse prior to surgery and preoperative        expectations were used to predict the various sexual        function outcome measures Since our hypothesis centered on        loss of sexual function each of the outcome measures was        categorized according to a binomial classification of        function relative to presurgical status        The relevant findings of this modeling procedure are        summarized in Table  Changes in libido dyspareunia and        multiple orgasm frequency were not predictable based upon        any of our independent variables However intercourse        frequency orgasm frequency and overall sexual        satisfaction were all significantly related to type of        procedure          P    and         respectively Regarding intercourse frequency  n          of TAH patients experienced worse outcome compared with         n   of SCH patients Fortythree percent n   of        TAH patients experienced a decrease in the ability to        achieve orgasm compared with  n   of SCH patients        Overall sexual satisfaction was worse for  n   of        TAH patients compared with  n   of SCH patients Only        for overall sexual satisfaction did oophorectomy add        significant predictive value          P   Thirtyfive percent n          of patients who had a BSO with their hysterectomy had        worse overall sexual satisfaction when compared to  n          of patients who had hysterectomy only without BSO With        respect to HRT there was no significant difference between        sexual function of patients who were receiving hormone        replacement and those who were not Frequency of        intercourse prior to surgery was not associated with        postoperative change in any of the sexual variables        analyzed          P                      Discussion        The results presented here support a role for the cervix        in the female sexual response In particular our finding        of a statistically significant decrease in the ability to        achieve orgasm among TAH patients when compared to SCH        patients  vs          P   is noteworthy Our results        support and expand upon the work by Kilkku    who        reported a greater reduction in orgasm following TAH when        compared to SCH          P          If patients derive less satisfaction from sexual        intercourse by experiencing a reduction in their ability to        achieve orgasm then the frequency of intercourse might        decrease Indeed in this study population both frequency        of intercourse and overall sexual satisfaction were worse        among TAH patients when compared to SCH patients Previous        investigators    found that  of patients after        TAHBSO had a reduction in frequency of intercourse        similar to the  in our study group The decline in        overall sexual response after hysterectomy in our        population was also consistent with results published by        others             Dyspareunia was the only sexual variable where the        results after surgery revealed no trend favoring SCH Nine        percent n   of SCH patients and  n   of TAH        patients experienced worsening of dyspareunia after the        operation Sixty six percent of TAH patients and  of SCH        patients experienced some degree of dyspareunia prior to        surgery Perhaps the dyspareunia was caused by intrauterine        pathology such as leiomyoma Since uterine leiomyoma was        the main indication for hysterectomy in  of SCH patients        and  of TAH patients hysterectomy could have resulted        in a similar reduction of pain in the two groups That        hysterectomy SCH or TAH is associated with improvement in        dyspareunia supports the findings of others                      Although the two surgical groups in this study are very        similar they do differ with respect to intercourse        frequency and BSO status Table and  Because the        independent variable in the statistical model was         change in frequency of intercourse        postoperative frequency minus preoperative frequency and        not the         magnitude of intercourse frequency        this disparity in the preoperative characteristics does not        adversely impact our findings Indeed realizing that a        sexual frequency of zero cannot become worse this may have        in fact biased the results in favor of the TAH cohort        As demonstrated in the literature the analysis of the        relationship of BSO and postoperative sexual function is        complex Although one investigator reported no difference        in libido between patients who underwent TAH and TAHBSO            our data are consistent with the findings of a more        recent investigation    where BSO status did influence        sexual outcome in the study population        In accord with previous investigations      we        determined that HRT did not affect sexual outcome in any of        the variables tested although the majority  of        patients who were on HRT had undergone BSO Perhaps this is        because standard HRT may be insufficient to replace the        full hormonal milieu produced by the ovary for some women        and other endogenous hormones may play a part in the female        sexual response For example testosterone production        continues even in the postmenopausal ovary albeit at a        markedly reduced rate     A prospective randomized        study of TAHBSO patients showed that those receiving        combined testosterone and estrogen therapy had greater        sexual desire than women receiving estrogen alone                   Menopausal status could have been directly determined        from our questionnaire although it was found that the        majority  of patients greater than age  in the study        population underwent surgical menopause BSO and were        taking HRT at the time of questionnaire completion                    Conclusion        In summary we found that patients who underwent a TAH        experienced worse sexual outcome than SCH patients with        respect to frequency of intercourse frequency of orgasm        and overall sexual satisfaction Our results suggest that        type of hysterectomy does predict overall postoperative        sexual satisfaction Adding in the consideration of whether        a BSO was performed significantly enhances this prediction        Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings        and determine the clinical impact that cervical and ovarian        conservation may have for the patient                    Competing interests        None declared
