                i kind of like mysteries like Agatha Christie and that kind of stuff   oh Agatha Christie how about John D McDonald uh John D McDonald you ever read him   no id actually i plead my ignorance knowledge lack of knowledge im not familiar with him what is he is he an American novelist   oh yeah hes very he uh of course he hes dead now seems like most of the good ones are   uhhuh yeah i know they dont write anything like they used to the classics   but uh he he was he does quite involved mysteries John D McDonald   and have you been reading him a long time or   oh yes since well way back in high school   that long  we wont talk about that   oh yeah yeah thats  matter fact thats one of my favorite hobbies is uh reading   yeah im thats one of mine my husbands a little more inclined toward that but im not real uh interested in selfimprovement books at all i think everythings too topical nowadays   yep for when i read i read for enjoyment or escapism and i   yeah and i like a lot of things that are uh have to do with politics and uh history there was one a few years ago called the Public Palace about what goes on at the Pentagon   oh yeah   did you read are you do you interested in stuff like that or   well i have i have i have been in the military so im well aware of the Public Palace yes   oh okay then you probably know even more than i do   yeah it it was quite it was quite amusing i used to i was in Viet Nam for a couple of years plus extension   and i dont know have there been any good books books published on that i know World War two my dad was a uh paratrooper in airborne O hundred and one um but i dont think they have done anything good on Viet Nam   and uh umhum theyve got several out uh theres one called Embassy House by uh Profit thats quite good i was involved with the Phoenix program and stuff of that that nature   uhhuh and is it true i mean is it um   its fairly facts whoever he talked to knew what uh the had had been in the program uh  it was probably factual hes kind of overdone a lot of it but um but you have to do that to make the books   umhum umhum i i kind of one of my interests is um ive im interested in law and uh i just got a book for Christmas called Law and Order its the history of the justice system and tracks um the the history of uh crimes and of   um   things that have impacted just the the you know evolution of um how we punish people and why things are um judged the way they are   um i hadnt heard that one i hadnt uh got too heavy into law and order deal most of mine im afraid i go either mysteries or uh action adventure stuff   oh action adventure i probably youre not talking your Danielle Steele female by any means but on the other hand i wont uh i cant Sidney Sheldons does come off the shelf  for light reading     hes uh i read those uh actually i think my favorite author really right now is uh William Johnstone   umhum   he writes the uh  action series   umhum ive heard again im not familiar with reading him but ive heard of him   hes got about twelve out now and it starts out with uh you know after the big war and everythings blown up and he then hes kind of     a real positive   yeah its kind of it follows his his travels throughout the world   theres one a book i just got i got it as a gift and i just started its a little bit heavy but it was kind of interesting it um was on the best seller list for a while there its called The Closing of the American Mind a little bit heavy about political philosophy   oh yeah umhum those i those i can read for a while but i got to stop and go you know walk around something   thats kind of whats happened it kind of does happen yeah uh im trying to think of any selfimprovement books ive read   ive tried to do some of those but after after after after after i read them a while i thought maybe i dont need improvement that bad after all   yeah thats exactly right its kind of like all the talk shows i think i got to get   they kind of drag on did you read that one uh lets see uh that the Arab guy wrote that the Abdul is going to come uh   oh um no i didnt but i i i have it and i havent read it   yeah we got at TI to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the time they were doing it   thats exactly what happened to us we were living um in Minneapolis at the time and we were getting ready to come back to Texas um and i went i mean into a Waldons and stood in line for like six hours it seemed like but i havent read it there is a good one out though that weve had for a few years that ive actually read more than once its called The Kingdom of Sound   oh yeah okay   and it is really really good about the um Saudis and just tracking their families and the Arabian culture   ive read that i got uh i got the interested in when Saddam Hussein came to power i got interested in him and started reading some of his some of the books on him the mans   its well written actually and i think therere going to be more huh   oh yes the mans just probably totally insane     thats too bad thats not the topic i know selfimprovement i think is the only one i got something like that when i got id been out of school for quite a while i think um back when it was again real topical um     yeah   uh women my age about then were maybe having trouble with parents or mothers and a friend of mine bought me something called My Mother and Myself and i tried to read it and i went this is i did the same thing i went this isnt anything   have you read Tom Clancy   uh yeah yeah in fact i just started her a friend a friend of ours turned me on to that i always i always looked at spy novels and i went eh military stuff just never really did anything to me unless it was history   which one did you get   the um China the red the the i think it was the right author youll have to help me out here   Hunt Hunt for Red October   Hunt for Red October the one i went to see the movie for   yeah yeah that was good uh hes got   i was a little bit bored with it compared to some of the other stuff that ive heard hed done   hes uh thats one of the better ones uh ive got i think my favorite that hes done is is A Clear and Present Danger   uhhuh yes that one ive we actually have that one my husbands read that it that one seems like it might be a little more interesting   its pretty factual hes got one out im trying to remember what its called it has to do with with airplanes   uh boy   and i started in reading it a friend friend of mine whose a pilot gave it to me he said uh he said its a wonderful book youll love it i started reading it and he went of course he goes into such great detail   uhhu h thats what i i was impressed with how much documenting he does   you know and i and it lost me   how much how much um hes so much like Michener hes not as bad in terms of going into so much depth but he hes i like the way he writes and if its not something that moves with me in the first two or three chapters something like that i just wont keep it you know   i cant uh i cant stay with it too long either but that  that i i read about fifty pages and then i just said i cant take it   thats   i just i cant keep all these buttons you know knobs and dials and gauges that are supposed to mean anything i dont want to i cant understand them   and his action anecdotes werent very good at all he he had he jumps around he in that particular book i dont know how his other ones are but in that one he jumped around a little bit   umhum   in terms of subways and just just the general transition and i mean it i didnt you know i really you have to be interested in the subject too i think that was part of my problem   yeah oh yeah its there was just too much detail there for the for the neophyte   anything to be real interesting yeah well its good to talk to somebody i dont read as much as i used to um my husbands a TIer and im in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and its kind of um sad when you find out the you know i thought i would get more toward reading and im getting less   yeah its well theres so many authors out now though of course ive got several favorites that i collect uh Eric Van Lustbader Lustbader   any of all years umhum   hes got several out that i like and uh matter fact   and what line does he write under what title does he   hes got uh hes kind of um mystic oriental   oh   he has one called The Ninja   uhhuh   and then then Michael The Siren Black Heart then theres uh yeah i think uh i think youll enjoy him   oh that might be kind of interesting is it   uh The Ninja is of course The Ninja and the Michael are you know one and two of the volumes and then he went off and wrote uh The Gem Zero and The French Kiss and several others and The White Ninja has just hit paperback i understand   umhum and does he uh in terms of their in terms of their practices and and their culture i mean does he document it or is it strictly   oh yeah oh no he no hes hes heavy into Japanese culture   oh okay   hes heavy into Japanese culture uh along with uh the Ninja the arts of Ninja and all all the various uh martial arts   does he tell it in narrative form or in third person how does he present it   its uh it fluctuates you kind of get flashbacks uh you get some flashbacks but you can really tell its a flashback because the print goes to italic   uhhuh and then you still get information too   and then you get information too and its kind of in a flashback and it its told uh more or less third person singular   and whats his name again   Eric Van Lustbader   Van Lustbader okay   yeah spelled as you would expect   yeah   it its you know Van and then Lustbader B A D E R   Lustbader im going to write that one down yeah because   hes hes very interesting i think i think youll enjoy him   looking for something different yeah its you know you walk into a store and you just like you said youre overwhelmed by how much there is and you just i dont know if youre like me you you youre much more voracious in terms of how much reading youre doing obviously but i go in and i like   yeah   to me its like being in a bakery but then i just dont find anything i like i pick up like eighteen things and then im not sure so i walk out   do you like do you like kind of like the historical western or something of that nature   uh no thats more no thats not i do actually i like Asian cultures  that why i was thats funny that you mentioned that   uh youll then youll like OLeary hes hes hes quite good at it ive got into one that i didnt think i would its a im not its a kind of a historical Indian novel thing by Donald Colesmith   umhum umhum   called The Trail of the Spanish Bit and its called The Spanish Bit Saga   i thought that was uh do you like Michener at all   yeah   hes good did you ever read he wrote Texas a few years ago   yeah i read that one uhhuh   that was good and Poland yeah and ive done some of those yeah i like i like things that are those are a few of the ones i can take of his i like it when they actually are giving you information in a novel format i guess would be the   you might try Colesmith try and find his uh Spanish Bit Saga its called the its called The Trail of the Spanish Bit is the first yeah by by Donald Colesmith hes a hes a   Trail of the Spanish Bit okay yeah   professor of of English in Emporia Kansas and uh he hes been a doctor and a gunsmith and   umhum oh my   all kinds of stuff and uh he he writes its history from the Indians point of view starting back when they first got the horse when they first captured the Spaniards   umhum   and it just kind of follows forward and i got i got hooked on it and theres like about sixteen or eighteen
