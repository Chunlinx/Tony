                okay obviously the team that i support would be the Cowboys um   uhhuh   i say that i support them theres been just so much thats happened to that team since they got rid of Tom Landry that was just like you know blasphemy around here   well and uh we felt the same way he was an institution and how how could they do that   so yeah oh yeah i know i know i dont think ill ever forget when one of my friends called me and said youre not going to believe this because i had not heard it you know and they said they have fired Tom Landry its like  you know what slander how could they do such a thing so uh ever you know since that i used to be such a an avid fan you know it was ridiculous but now quite honestly i i think that i support the Oilers as much as anybody   um   you know just because it is a Texas team but i cannot stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry Jones   cant stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry well uh you know i was just trying i was just trying to think of uh who who our coaches of Houston Oilers you probably know   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah i really i dont even i dont know now   uh itll probably come to me but i was thinking of   yeah i just i think of Bum Bright you know but thats been many many many years ago   the yeah well Bum Bum Phillips   yeah Bum Phillips im sorry yeah   yeah well hes the one that we couldnt believe that they they let go and then we had Jerry Glanville who is guess is now in Atlanta and now we get the guy who was the University of Houston   yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh   head coach for many years itll come to me in a minute   yeah i cant i cant think   so we did pretty well uh   yeah how did you feel about having about Jerry Glanville   oh     you know people either hate him or they they like him quite a bit   well i didnt really hate him or anything but i think the image of the team as a whole just had a real dark image and he he wanted to make these you know the uh   yeah yeah   uh kind of like the Oakland Raiders used to be the real bad team and they were they were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really you just really get ticked off   right uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   when your team keeps getting these stupid penalties and they dont seem to you know i mean thats just terrible and       yeah yeah its its you know it aggravates me no end when youre talking about a really close game and then they do something stupid like start a fight or you know they have they have something like that called and then that is aggravating yeah   uhhuh or do something where where you know it puts the other team in a better advantage and you know just for some stupid things that we probably could have done better so   right yeah yeah   i feel like the image of the on the Oilers has really been cleaned up and like last year Warren Moon and and so many of the guys are doing some good things off the field   yeah uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   so it seems like though uh it seems like all my teams always you know that i that are local to me wherever i live from when my husband was in college   uhhuh   you know you just never on a given day they could do anything and then on another day but they the consistency just when it really gets down to the championship or or the really mean meaningful uh game   right uhhuh yeah uhhuh yeah it seems like they blow it   they dont come through course now Dallas did great for many years   oh yeah you know it was just like you were so spoiled it was such a novelty if they lost a game you know and they could lose one game out of you know the whole season and people would just be completely up in arms   uhhuh   and i really you know as far as future of the Cowboys i really hate to say it but i think theyre going to end up being a contender within the next couple of years i really feel like that will     think so well theyve been down for a while so it kind of runs in cycles i think   yeah yeah yeah and   so you have the teams that stay up on top for several years and then they start   yeah right i think and its a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money it you know money it always comes back to money everything does but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say theyre paying them i dont know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if theyre going to be paid the most so uh you know i dont know its interesting well just have to see but its just very very difficult for me to to support them its you know a lot of the guys i really like you know and and uh i loved Herschel Walker that just blew me away when they traded him you talking you were talking about somebody that was really involved in the community and did a lot of things for for kids and stuff like that he was extremely involved in that in that aspect   uhhuh   and i think thats why i i liked him so well but uh i dont know you know when i i watch it and then i start sort of seeing myself enjoying it im like youre just youre just doing this for the players you know dont think about Jerry Jones or Jimmy Johnson either one but you know itd just be so aggravating when they did win and then uh Jerry Jones would come out of the uh you know the press box i mean i would just go uh you know wild its like it ruined the whole game for me because i had to look at him you know   is he the owner   yeah hes the owner uhhuh and he and uh Jimmy Johnson went to uh college together they played football together in college   um   and so theyre like this is just like the buddy system you know and theyre of course theyre not from Texas so that riled everybody up you know  this is like Arkansas people   yeah     so uh that didnt go over well so well see as i said i really think that theyll eventually theyll eventually be a contender so   well this should be uh we did pretty well last year so im thinking this ought to this ought to be a good year for us well have have you been involved at all in this new World Football League i havent watched the first thing   yeah yeah its no i havent uh you know i find myself its just it seems like its so hard to uh i dont know why it is but its just so hard for me to get involved in it you know i love football   well it well yeah   but you know i feel like im not watching the NFL for some reason its like oh it really doesnt count you know and thats terrible but thats just sort of the way i feel about it   doesnt count but well i tend to tend to uh well when my son was still at home uh   uhhuh   course he watched everything sports and i was involved but i tend not to watch things so much now unless   right   uh if its my home team   uhhuh   or you know basically thats it or its or its some championship type games or something   yeah yeah yeah i mean you you see you can definitely get involved in it more when its somebody that youve supported all along and its someone local because youve got all the press you know you read more about them of course and and hear more about them on on television a nd and such but uh i you know as much as i love it i would think that i would sit down and watch it but it just as i said for some reason its like oh they you know theyre just out there playing around they dont uh they dont really they dont really count   who is the quarterback i dont even know who that your quarterback is   uh for Dallas uh my mind went blank i can picture his face   uhhuh   oh my word   has he been there couple three years   yeah hes uh hes been here for several years oh pooh oh well itll come to me as soon as we hang up i cant i cannot think of his name hes been injured theyve done hes had several surgeries hes a young like a young kid i mean you know hes   uhhuh   i dont know if hes even twenty five yet i dont think but uh he uh hes had as i said several surgeries on his hand and and uh hes making a fortune of course he didnt play that much uh last season he was out for maybe you know four or five games so   well Warren Moon broke his i think his was it his little finger or his thumb i forget toward the last couple of games of the season so he was out for the you know the last part so   you know yeah uhhuh yeah yeah   course hes not real young either hes   thats true he is hes considered an old timer i suppose   in his hes probably in his early thirties i would think at least uh   yeah yeah   you know if we dont do something with him at the helm you know then it may be downhill then for us for a while   yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it takes a it takes a strong leader in that position   because we had the guy the i forget the guys name the one who came in for him   uhhuh   and played in one game you know we made some playoffs or something toward the end it seems like and this guy came in and we won i mean the guy played beautifully and then then the next week which was a really important game   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   it didnt he it just fell apart didnt work but it but you talk about exciting when something you know we were just   yeah yeah oh yeah just so thrilled its true   right right when the seem like right before the Christmas holidays or somewhere seem like my mom was there from uh theyre from Alabama and my mom has never watched   yeah uhhuh   football hardly in her life and she sat there with me and i was explaining some of it to her and she was getting really excited and that was so neat yeah   uhhuh uhhuh really getting into it uhhuh yeah yeah its its its addictive i mean i come from a my i have several coaches in my family and   oh   you know my mom is just a freak about it you know she shes just as bad as anybody and my fiancee if its involved with ball he will watch it you know   right oh   so i was i was raised with all that stuff so you know its just like all of our holidays center on what time is the game start you know we have to hurry up and get all this food out of the way because   yeah yeah thats kind of kind of the way way weve been too but its it is fun i really enjoy it   yeah oh yeah yeah you know i would like to i i say i have i didnt want the Cowboys to win but sure id like to seem them you know end up end up doing better its just you know you you really miss it when you arent so intense you know as as we were when they were such a great team you know   yeah you kind of i dont know you know when theyre not doing well or they consistently do poorly just kind of kind of lose interest if you dont which is a shame but thats uh way people are   yeah yeah you know its like why uhhuh uhhuh its like why am i even watching this you know i it was seems like it was the height of the of the uh Cowboys empire so to speak when uh uh Earl Campbell was playing for the Oilers   uhhuh   and im a UT freak too i mean im a University of Texas fan so i followed Earl Campbell over to the Oilers and and uh you know i kept up with that as well and and i was i was just crazy about him so i   uhhuh
