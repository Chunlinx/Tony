                    Background        The use of hair assays in order to assess the presence        of ingested chemical materials has been used in a wide        variety of applications    Hair has been utilized        for example in determining the degree of exposure to heavy        metals in both         post mortem and living subjects          In recent years there has been considerable focus on the        recovery of illicit psychoactive substances and their        metabolites from hair     Others have reported on a        wide variety of substances that can be recovered from human        hair samples and can be quantitatively determined These        include nicotine and cotinine   caffeine          antipsychotics and antianxiety medications             various antibiotics      pesticides          digoxin   and steroids    There are        several advantages to hair as a sample for analysis but        the single most important attribute is undoubtedly the long        retrospective time frame to which analysis of a segment of        hair corresponds This permits an evaluation of a history        of exposure that is not possible with specimens such as        saliva or urine A threecentimeter length of hair        corresponds on average to approximately  days of past        time or history For compounds that are stable when        sequestered in hair this represents a very desirable        property        This enhanced temporal capacity lends itself to the        possibility that hair analysis can be utilized to evaluate        individual compliance for substances that are taken on a        regular basis such as anticlotting medications        antibiotics and antiepileptic drugs This can be an        important diagnostic and assessment aid in medical practice        and clinical evaluation of drug efficacy Williams for        example has advocated the use of hair analysis as a method        for assessing therapeutic compliance to antiseizure drug        regimens   It has been well demonstrated that the        major antiepileptic medications phenytoin PHT        carbamazepine CBZ and valproic acid VPA are readily        recovered and quantified from hair specimens                    Thus assessing the presence and        quantity of these substances in hair may be a reliable        marker for consumption and provide an additional source of        information to the physician who has historically relied        only on the patients selfreported compliance        Whether hair analysis can be an effective indication of        patient compliance is controversial however It is widely        accepted that the qualitative presence of these compounds        can be reliably demonstrated by hair analysis The        controversial aspect is primarily based on the issue of        whether the         quantitative value of the assay can        be a reliable indicator of dose That is is there a        reliable doseassay correlation Tracqui et al   for        example have argued that hair analysis has value for        qualitative evaluation of drug use but is worthless for        quantitative assessment of patient compliance Williams         however argues the opposite and presents data for        a controlled inpatient population taking CBZ which shows        remarkably good consistency between dose and assay outcome        Furthermore Williams suggests that compliance is best        measured by using patients as their own control This is        done by comparing any given assay outcome to a ground state        value So hair will show a relative change in        concentration It is generally accepted that specific        quantitative values related to a specific dose can not        applied across study subjects due to substantive individual        biovariability        One issue that is not clearly understood is the variety        of factors influencing the considerable biovariability that        appears between persons given identical dosages of these        drugs Clinicians general recognize that a very large        number of factors can influence the drug concentration in        any analytic matrix One potential advantage of hair        specimens is they may represent a relatively stable matrix        over a relatively long time frame Tracqui even in        rejecting the utility of quantitative compliance monitoring        in this context notes that a number of studies reported        significant strong correlation between dose and assay        outcomes for a number of different compounds with        Pearsons r ranging from  to  Another aspect of        this interpretation controversy concerns whether there are        systematic influences on drug concentration in hair because        of color variations differences in cosmetic treatment and        different intensities of hair hygiene Another part of the        controversy is problems related to the dependency on the        accuracy selfreported patient compliance which may or may        not be accurate and  in the case of illicit drugs  the        purity and actual contents of drugs reported as consumed        The attending physicians for these patients were queried on        the confidence they had on their patients compliance and        in general they rated the compliance as good with only a        small number of missed doses However we recognize that        there are reliable data to indicate that patient compliance        to antiseizure medication regimens may be weak and a        delimitation of this research is that there was not rigid        control of patient compliance        One of the general weaknesses characterizing much of the        analysis of hair assay data has been the inadequacy of the        statistical models used to assess the experimental        information Oftentimes claims or conclusions are derived        from experimental data that is not supported by statistical        analysis In some cases in fact analyses of the data show        that the conclusions reached are clearly incorrect          There has been in general a failure in the assessment of        experimental hair analysis data to use appropriate        available statistical procedures or to assess whether the        critical assumptions that underlay statistical procedures        are met by the data And almost without exception there        has been no utilization of more sophisticated and sensitive        statistical techniques that are available to examine        multivariate phenomena This is true even though there is a        general recognition that the relationship between dose and        assay are likely to mediated by a complex series of        intervening events and are particularly appropriate to this        analytic approach                    Materials and Methods        The analysis is based upon the concentrations obtained        from scalp hair collected by cutting hair from the        posterior vertex of the head Each sample consisted of        approximately  mg of hair Each sample was sectioned        into cm segments and each segment was analyzed by FPIA        and HPLC methods for CBZ and PHT and by FPIA for VPA The        number of segments for each patient varied since it was        dependent of length of hair available from each individual        Most patients have five segments and no patient provided        less than two segments The concentrations used for each        case are the mean values for all available segments for        that patient HPLC values are used in the analysis of CBZ        and PHT FPIA values are used in the analysis of VPA As        well serum assay values are provided for each patient The        serum assay typology varied including multiple methods to        assay serum for some drugs For CBZ serum was assayed by        both FPIA and GCMS for VPA by FPIA and for PHT by FPIA        and HPLC Bloods were drawn from patients in the morning by        their attending physician In a few cases there were        multiple bloods drawn In such cases the mean values for        the serum levels are represented in the tables Hair color        assignments were based upon observation by the attending        physician questioning of the patient and in cases of        ambiguity by consultation among the field research staff        the attending physician and the patient        Since this is a secondary analysis of data only a        synopsis of technical procedures is presented here Details        of the instrumentation including calibration and        standardization and elaboration of the analysis techniques        are described in detail elsewhere   and are not        repeated here The general approach was as follows hair        samples were dissolved in a strong base NaOH and the        dissolved material was subjected to solvent extraction        Hair samples were segmented in cm sections and  mg        of hair from each segment was added to  ml of  N NaOH        solution The solution was solvent extracted with diethyl        ether centrifuged and the supernatant evaporated The        remnant residue was dissolved in saline and subjected to        analysis                    Result and Discussion                  Carbamazepine CBZ                      General DoseAssay Relationship            The data for the dose assay relationship includes            concentration in the plasma serum which was determined            by both FPIA and GC and concentration in the hair            which was determined by both FPIA and HPLC For hair            assays the values are in micrograms per gram of hair            and for serum the values are in micrograms per            milliliter of plasma The findings show that there was            no significant doseassay relationship for the serum            specimens with either analytic technique and that            there was a significant doseassay relationship for            hair specimens by both analytic techniques The results            are shown in Table                                 Hair Color            It has been a source of controversy in the            interpretation of hair assays whether or not hair color            is a critical factor in the binding of materials in            hair It has previously reported that CBZ does not            appear to have a significant color effect ie that            darker hair shows significantly higher concentrations            of CBZ than light hair   We examine this finding            using the current data There are five color            categorizations of hair represented among the             subjects The distribution of hair color and the mean            concentration of CBZ for each color are shown in Table             The concentration values are in microgramsgram as            measured by HPLC            An analysis of variance for this table fails to show            a significant relationship between CBZ mean value and            hair color F   p  The Levene Test for            equality of error variances indicates that the            homogeneity of variance assumption is met Levene F              p   The KS and ShapiroWilk tests for            normality are consistent with a normal distribution and            a normal QQ plot of CBZ concentration in hair shows a            good approximation of normality                                Hair ColorDose Relationship            Another factor worth consideration is the possible            interaction effect between hair color and dose The            dose values and hair color categories can be a shown as            a matrix array as in Table             Table is a crosstabulation showing the distribution            of dosage values by hair color Review of the cell            distributions shows a concentration of higher dose            regimens to cluster towards the lower left indicating            the possibility that persons with black hair may more            likely to be on higher doses of CBZ and persons with            lighter hair may be more likely to receive lower doses            The GLM covariance model is based on the mean hair            assay outcomes HPLC The analysis of covariance            ANCOVA allows for the comparison of quantitative            dependent and qualitative independent variable while            simultaneously controlling for a number of quantitative            variables or covariates In this analysis the            dependent variable is the mean concentration for the            hair analysis the independent qualitative variable is            the hair color categorization and the covariates are            duration of dose in months dose in mgs per             hours and patient age in years The outcome of this            model is shown in Table             Table reveals that there is a relation between mean            hair concentration and dose F   p   eta              shaded row while the relationship between            hair assay result and color is not significant F              p   eta   Thus it is reasonable to            conclude that differential hair assay outcomes for CBZ            are not color dependent but are significantly related            to dose regimens                                    Valproic Acid VPA                      General DoseAssay Relationship            The data for the VPA dose assay relationship            includes concentration in the plasma serum which was            determined by FPIA and concentration in the hair            which was determined by FPIA For hair assays the            values are in micrograms per gram of hair and for            serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of            plasma The findings show that there was no significant            doseassay relationship for the VPA serum specimens            and that there was a significant correlation doseassay            relationship for VPA hair specimens The results are            shown in Table                                 Hair Color            As with CBZ we will examine the potential for a            color effect associated with the reported            concentrations of recovered VPA The color            categorizations are identical to those used for CBZ            Table reports the mean concentration of VPA by hair            color category There are no dyed specimens so four            color categories are used in this analysis            An analysis of variance for Table fails to show a            significant relationship between VPA mean values and            hair color F   p   The Levene Test for            equality of error variances indicates that the            homogeneity of variances assumptions is met Levene F              p   The KS test for normality is            consistent with a normal distribution and a normal QQ            plot of VPA concentration in hair shows a good            approximation of normality                                Hair Color Relationship            As with CBZ we now consider the possible            interaction of hair color dose and recovered VPA from            hair Table presents the frequency distribution of            dose by hair color            Visual inspection of the Table is consistent with            the impression that there may be a slight skewing of            higher dosage regimens towards darkhaired subjects We            subject this data to an ANCOVA As previously we treat            mean concentration as the dependent term color as the            independent qualitative term and dose duration            hour dose value and age as the covariates The            outcome for this model is reported in Table  The            Levene statistic shows the variance homogeneity            criteria are met and analysis of the normality of the            distribution of the mean hair values shows acceptable            conformity with normality assumptions            Table demonstrates that the relationships between            dose age and hair color are all significant shaded            rows while duration of dose regimen is not            Furthermore the eta values which are interpretable as            a measure of the percentage of the explainable            variance show similar contributions between color and            dose and a lesser contribution due to age Table            reports these contrasts using Bonferronis            criteria            The Bonferroni criteria contrasts indicate that            specific pair comparisons do not yield a significant            difference although the contrasts for blackgray and            blackblond are approaching significance Doing the            pairs comparisons using Sidak criteria yields the same            results Both of these confidence interval criteria are            conservative but the Bonferroni criteria are preferred            on the basis that there is a relatively small number of            comparison pairs            An additional issue of importance is the potential            complex interaction between dose age and color            categorization First the data demonstrate a            difference in mean dose value by age although those            differences are not significant for VPA the            correlation for dose and age is r   p              Furthermore the covariance model can be used to            generate model regressionderived mean estimates            adjusted for age and dose that can be compared to the            observed values Both the analytic values and the            estimated values are shown in Table             Comparison of the observed mean values and the            modelestimated mean values shows that the model is            relatively efficient for all color categorizations            except gray hair where the observed values are nearly            twice the value of the estimated values Since age and            gray hair are collinear in the data set Table  it is            possible that the agecolor account for this departure            Regression evaluation of the colorage collinearity for            either dose or mean concentration is consistent with            this effect eigenvalue age   eigenvalue color              Small eigenvalues are consistent with            collinearity between the covariate factors and thus            these values are indicative of an agecolor collinear            condition            To further examine this effect we produce a final            covariance model for VPA with color categorization as            the independent factor and dose as the covariate The            results of this model are presented in Table             The factor model dose and color presented in            Table are consistent with the conjecture that age and            color demonstrate some interactive or synergistic            effect since color alone fails to attain            significance            It is reasonable to surmise that the color effect            for VPA is at best weak and mostly likely collinear            with age However there is an effect for color that is            operating as a stronger effect than discerned in the            analysis of CBZ This effect appears to be dependent on            the stringency of the significance criteria used in the            analysis and the degree to which the analytic model            disaggregates the hypothesized variable relationships            Selecting less conservative criteria will produce a            weak generalized significant colorassay relationship            but application of either more conservative methods to            assess pairrelationships eg Bonferroni criteria            or use of more elaborate model specifications eg            stepwise ANCOVA fail to sustain significance One of            the more serious constraints on the VPA analysis            presented here is the very limited number of persons            with gray hair and the number of lighthaired persons            in general only  of the  subjects were not            classified as either black or brown hair A more            confident analysis would require a sample with larger            numbers                                    Phenytoin PHT                      General DoseAssay Relationship            The data for the dose assay relationship includes            concentration in the plasma serum which was determined            by HPLC and concentration in the hair which was            determined by both FPIA and HPLC For hair assays the            values are in micrograms per gram of hair and for            serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of            plasma            We note that in contrast to both CBZ and VPA Table            reveals that there is a significant bivariate            doseassay correlation for the serum specimens and for            the hair specimens by both analytic techniques                                Hair Color            Table reports the number of subjects for each of            four hair color categorizations the mean concentration            of PHT for that color category and the related            standard deviation Visual examination of the table            shows that both black and brown color had notably            higher concentrations than either blondhaired or            grayhaired subjects            A univariate ANOVA on the data in Table reveal            that there is a significant difference by hair color F              p   However the Levene Test indicates            that the homogeneity of variance assumption is not met            An alternative analysis using Tamhanes procedure            allowing an assessment of unequal variances            comparisons also indicates significance but allows            for posthoc contrasts for each specific color group            The individual comparisons are shown in Table             The ANOVA indicates that that there are significant            differences in concentration of PHT by hair color The            overall mean concentration values appear to cluster            with the blackbrown hair contrast showing no            significant difference and blondgray contrast showing            no significant difference However contrast of either            blond or gray hair to black or brown hair does show            significant difference The overall distribution of PHT            in the hair assays appears to meet the normality            assumptions well                                Hair ColorDose Relationship            In order to further assess the nature of the            hypothesized color effect it is important to assess            whether or not there is an interaction effect of color            and dose Is the effect a result of dosing values are            higher for darkhaired subjects Table reports the            relative frequency of daily dose regimens by hair color            group            Table indicates that the higher dose values appear            to cluster to some degree with black and brownhaired            subjects In order to assess this an ANCOVA model            including dose dose duration age and hair color is            assessed Results of that model are shown in Table                        Table indicates that age dose and color are            significant factors in the model values shaded gray            are significant while dose duration is not This is            identical to the model outcome for VPA Table shows            the Bonferroni criteria for all pairwise combinations            their means differences and their significance            outcomes            As with VPA the pairwise contrasts show that the            black and gray and brown and gray contrasts are            significant while the remaining pairs do not have            significant mean differences the same results is            obtained using Sidak criteria It suggests as with            VPA that there may be a coloragedose confounding            action involving either collinear or confounding            relationships between hair color dose and age In            order to assess this we first consider the observed            means and the estimates mean values from the ANCOVA            model This is presented in Table             Table reveals that the modelestimated means for            dark hair black and brown are lower than the observed            values and the estimates for light colored hair are            greater This is a departure from the VPA pattern and            is consistent across category with a            colorconcentration positive relationship            We can assess this effect by examining the ANCOVA            model retaining dose and hair color as the sole            covariates replicating the procedure applied to VPA            and examining the surviving significant relationship            The results of this model are shown in Table             Consistent with the approach applied to VPA we            delete age from the model in Table  Age is removed            from the model in this case to see if it diminishes the            color effect as was the case VPA Comparison of Tables            and show that the eta is diminished but is still            significant and makes a substantial contribution to the            explained variance Dose still has however the higher            eta value Further pairwise comparisons show that            there are significant mean value contrasts between the            light hair categories gray and blond and the dark            hair categories black and brown There are however            no significant contrasts within those groups ie no            significant mean differences between black and brown            hair or blond and gray hair                                      Conclusions        This assessment of the recovery of three compounds CBZ        VPA and PHT from hair samples identifies a variable        effect of hair color on assay concentration by drug type        The generalized hypothesis assessed is that darker        coloration of hair is associated with a greater        concentration of analyte in the hair For CBZ hair color        does not appear to exert a significant effect on the        quantity of the compound recovered from hair For VPA there        appears to be a very weak color effect but the number of        lighthaired subjects attenuates the strength of the        conclusion For all drugs there appears to be a significant        positive relationship between dose and hair concentration        We also suggest that for VPA there appears to be effects of        collinearity between age and hair color and possibly dose        and hair color Both of these phenomena could produce        confounding effects in trying to describe the doseassay        relationship The limitations of the data are that the        subjects are a clinical nonrandom population and the        range of dosages across all color grouping was not uniform        nor was dosage duration Furthermore the number of light        hair subjects was for certain drugs very small        Hair Color Dose Dose Duration HPLC and FPIA        Concentration per Segment
