                                  Morning in Japan            The winter of  was agrim one for the US economy After a nasty recession in  there had beena brief hopeful period of recoverybut by early  it was clear that asecond even worse recession was underway By late that year the unemploymentrate would rise above  percent for the first and so far only time since thes So bleak was the prospect that in February the New York TimesMagazine ran a long article by Benjamin Stein titled A Scenario for aDepression which suggested that the nation has arrived at a new spot on theeconomic map where the old remediesor what we thought were remedieshavelost their power and the economic wise men have lost their magic Stein andmany others worried that after nearly a decade of disappointing performancethe US economy might simply fail to respond to monetary and fiscal policiesthat a selfreinforcing downward spiral of pessimism and financial collapsemight already be out of control            Fortunately however itturned out that the old remedies were just as powerful the nostrums of theeconomic wise men just as magical as always The Federal Reserve Board whichhad been following a strict monetarist rule reversed course in midsummer andopened up the monetary taps Interest rates came down the stock market roseand by early  the economy was unmistakably on the mend Indeed as theworkers and factories left idle by the slump went back to work output soaredReal GDP grew almost  percent during  and in  Ronald Reagan wastriumphantly reelected under the slogan Its morning in America It wasntOnce the slack had been taken up growth slowed again and over the s as awhole the economy actually grew a bit less than it had in the s But thesurge in  was a spectacular demonstration of the way that a sufficientlyexpansionary monetary policy can reverse a depressed economys fortunes            The biggest single question now facing the world economy iswhether the same magic can work in todays Japan            In some important waysJapan today bears a strong resemblance to the United States in that frighteningsummer of  Like the United States then Japan has some serious longtermproblems a slowdown in productivity growth an ossified management culture atroubled financial sector Steins article talked at length about the loomingproblems of the savings and loan industry But overlaid on these longtermdifficulties is a severe recession Japans unemployment statistics notoriouslyunderstate the true extent of joblessness but even so the current  percentrate is the highest in the  years the number has been published Depending onwhose estimates you believe the economy is operating anywhere from  percentto more than  percent below its capacity That means that Japans outputgap is probably comparable to that of the United States  years ago So ifJapan can somehow persuade its consumers and business investors to startspending again there is room for several years of rapid growtheven if thestructural problems remain unsolved            There is however one big difference between America thenand Japan now Japan can no longer use conventional monetary and fiscalpolicies to get the economy moving Whereas US interest rates in early were in double digitsand could therefore be sharply reducedJapaneseshortterm interest rates have been below  percent for years apparentlyleaving little room for further cuts And Japans government is already deeplyin debt already running huge deficits The experience of the past few monthsin which the prospect that the government would have to sell vast quantitiesof bonds to finance its deficits temporarily led to a tripling of longterminterest rates suggests that any attempt to stimulate the economy with evenbigger deficit spending will do more harm than good So it might appear thatthere are no easy answers that nothing short of a total restructuring of theJapanese economy can turn it around            But over the past year agrowing chorus of Western economists has argued against this fatalistic viewOn one side they have worried that unless something dramatic is done toincrease demand Japan may go into a deflationary tailspin that the expectationof falling prices will make consumers and businesses even less willing tospend worsening the slump and driving prices down all the faster On the otherside they have argued that radical unconventional monetary policy canstill be effectivethat even if shortterm interest rates are near zeromassive monetary expansion can still push up demand Some economistsnamelyyours trulyhave even argued that Japan should try to get out of itsdeflationary trap by creating expectations of inflation             Until very recently these arguments seemed too outlandishto receive support from more than a handful of Japanese officials But theevents of the last few weeks suggest that there has been a sea change ofopinion inside the Bank of Japana change similar to but even more strikingthan the abandonment of monetarism at the Fed during  After years ofwarning about the risks of inflation and the importance of sound policy theBOJ has suddenly begun flooding the market with liquidity The overnight rateat which banks lend to each otherthe equivalent of our Fed funds ratehasbeen driven down literally to zero Banks now charge each other only for theadministrative costs of making the loan And still the expansion continuesIts still a bit hard to believe but it looks as if Japans central bank hasbeen radicalizedthat is it has finally seen the light has finallyunderstood that in Japans current state adhering to conventional notions ofmonetary prudence is actually dangerous folly and only monetary policy thatwould normally be regarded as irresponsible can save the economy            There are of course big risks in any such radicalpolicy departure My own view is that the biggest risk is that the new policywill not be radical enough for it is a characteristic of deflationfightingthat halfmeasures get you nowhere Suppose for example that the Bank ofJapan were to try to convince the public that the future will bring inflationnot deflation But that the target inflation rate is too low so that even ifeveryone believed that target would be achieved the Japanese economy wouldremain seriously depressed Then deflation would continueand the policy wouldignominiously fail            But if the BOJ is determined enoughand if peoplelike me have analyzed Japans plight correctlythen six months or a year fromnow Japan may be on the road to an economic recovery more dramatic than anyonewould now dare to forecast By sometime next year the Land of the Rising Sunmay at least for a while live up to its billing You heard it here
