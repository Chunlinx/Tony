                                 LongStemmed Neuroses            Growing up in a suburb thatwas as new as I was old I resented the short specimen saplings that dotted ourlawn and the neat rows of perky yellow daffodils that popped up from the woodchips in the kidneyshaped beds each spring This was nature Where were theancient groves with thick canopies and filtered light whose mysteries lured thechildren I read about in books I have always been drawn to the drama oflandscape of wild nature and grand cultivated gardens To be able to fashionbeauty from light scent earth flora and fauna and then to give it over tothe uncontrollable forces of time and decay seemed an endeavor noble andhumbling I wanted to make gardens But I moved to the city            Lastyear when I finally got my own piece of dirt and took a spade to it it landedwith a thud The act of gardening itself was joyousrising early smellingearth getting dirty getting scratches that I wore proudly making compostlugging digging and planting The result of all this was something elseentirely The garden I made was a meek little mess a structureless collectionof plants that never grew from the size at which they entered the ground Whilethe mistakes I made were not uncommon ones for a firsttime gardener I somehowbelieved that I was not a firsttime gardener Each weekend morning I would goout to toil anew and well after dark lit by headlights of the car I wouldrealize that pleasure had turned to despair I grew sullen and ashamed of mysurroundings I would be found out            While gardening is assumed to be so therapeutic that thereis even a field called horticultural therapy it wasnt designed to help thosewith horticultural problems I was left to selfanalyze My expectations hadbeen too high Worse I recognized a disparity between my idealized self and myactual self that I had last observed in the seventh grade when I was a gawkygirl with frizzy hair and no breasts and longed to be Laura Dessner a girlwith a perfect Farrah Fawcett hairdo            I waitedfor the relief that winter would bring To most gardeners winter is merely theanticipation of spring They take spring gardening catalogs with them into thetub where they plan their coming glories They start seeds in their basementsto get a jump on the season I was not ready to go there yet Instead quite byaccident I ended up gardening all winter happily and in private            It started last fall in the country when I wasinvited to join a bulb cluba selfconsciously prefeminist allgirl groupthat meets to buy bulbs in bulk at reduced rates and exchange bits of gardeningwisdom Seduced by the descriptions in the catalog I recklessly bought flowersthat I knew would become deer food if planted outside Fortunately the bulbladies showed me how to force them into bloom indoors in winter Just pot themthey explained Jam as many into the dirt as possible water them and thensecure them in a Ziploc bag before sending them off to the cold dark placerequired for dormancy After a couple of months having been deceived intothinking theyve just slept through the winter they can be brought inside andmade to behave as if spring has arrived            In earlyFebruary I brought the bulbs out slowly a few pots at a time gentlyacclimating them to their new surroundings before offering them the wintersunlight from a southfacing window I lived to watch the progress of these mydarlings I arranged them carefully watered them dutifully and checked theirprogress constantly recording their growth rates and bloom times As someonewho resents houseplants enormously for needing so much and giving so little Ithought at first that this might be hypocritical But these potted wonderschanged daily stretching and budding and turning toward the sun They did notjust sit there inert and accusatory the way houseplants do            Hungering for more flowers I moved on to the woodybranches of springflowering shrubs tricking them too Outside I went for longstems of forsythia Noticing that a willow tree cut down last year had resisteddeath sending up dozens of shoots from its stump I cut and forced those tooNear the house was a badlycoifed flowering quince that had only a handful oflovely flowers for a few days in May and one or two fruits clingingpathetically in late summer Removed from its body its limbs were elegant andstately            It went onfor weeks bulbs and branches rising from slumber into bloom I would changewater snip stems peel back bark arrange flowers arrange arrangements andstare at them From the woods I gathered crab apple winterberry and swampmaple that looked promising Anything with a hint of swollen bud became myprey I also salvaged large pieces of a broadleaved evergreen that had toppledin a storm and put them in a pitcher In came some mysterious blue berriesfrom the side of the road and the orange berries of an ugly pyracantha Eventhe irksome ivy by the front door looked good indoors At the supermarket Istared for a long time at the delectable dark green foliage and deep red stemand spine of Swiss chard I resisted            I was unstoppable though Rooms brimmed withbuckets filled with branches so large they scraped the ceiling and the walls asI dragged them to the sink for their changes of water Dinner came later andlater as the kitchen was covered in twigs branches and berries            As Iwrite the house is alive with flowers and foliage and it is starting to snowagain An arrangement of salmonpink quince blossoms is set against the graywall of the dining room On the dining table sit two terracotta pots ofdeeppink species tulips In the kitchen is a planter of yellow tulips withpalegreen markings engulfed by a mass of purple grape hyacinths Nearby is ablue pitcher bursting with sunyellow forsythia blooms On the window above thesink a small container is stuffed with bits of leftoversthe red berries ofbarberry small twigs of willow cuttings of hinoki cypress with its fruitsattached and the pendulous leathery seed pods of wisteria On the mantle anold iron urn holds cascading ivy and some fragrant winter honeysuckle Next tothat is a small black vase of cut miniature daffodils bought in the supermarketbecause I could not bear to harvest any of my own And on it goes            The end of winter is a nebulous time for gardenersit isnot quite one thing and not quite another There are clear days when you canskate on the pond and others when you can walk about without a coat Lookingaround for branches to bring home I see the beech trees still hanging on totheir frail colorless leaves and notice that the drooping shortlived flowersof the maple are about to open While others are just dreaming of theirgardens mine is blossoming in the house
