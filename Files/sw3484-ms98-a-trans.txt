        you feel about uh drug testing in the work place   well actually im all for it even though um  for instance like in the area that i work for you know theres no danger you know of someone getting hurt because of you know being on drugs or something but uh uh  i think because of ethics involved and uh things im just im in favor of it i i realize that thats putting a lot of  government control in effect or or control over people but uh   i think we need something in place to uh to solve the problems i certainly uh feel that it ought to be done in public safety situations you know airline pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses and taxi cabs   oh definitely well its just like uh i cant remember now where it was what two three months ago there was that there was that bad train wreck and uh one of the um engineers running the train was on drugs you know and people were killed in it and and yeah when it comes to safety and people being killed i definitely think it should be a requirement you know   umhum yeah umhum   youre uh you know to heck with their rights you know theyre interfering with peoples rights to live   yeah   you know if theyre in that type of position and have that much control over people   one of the issues that came up for me personally was that uh we see  ive gotten involved in uh foster care   uhhuh   and ive seen a lot of uh kids come into foster care as a result of their parents being on drugs   yes   and uh theres probably a lot out there that could probably stand public assistance or being rescued uh which arent identified and so uh     umhum   testing at the work place in uh in in general i think is probably a good idea to to save some of the kids   feeling like that if you know then you can look into a situation and in case there are children involved   yes   uhhuh yeah i can i can understand that i i think it is you know i think its so sad these these crack babies that are now coming into you know grade school elementary school you know that are so um   umhum   oh you know theyre so messed up themselves and you know in talking to teachers i have several uh friends that are teachers  they uh um you know theyre hard to control theyre hard to deal with and yeah i think that would be a good idea   umhum yeah   being im a contract person with Texas Instruments and before i could even go to work here i had to be drug tested you know and they do a random drug testing of their employees   umhum   uh but so far far um they dont require everyone to do it they just go through randomly and pick someone and you know and go do it and TI has an excellent um   yeah   assistance program if youre found you know found with drugs they actually give you i think um three tries   umhum   you know to to quit it or get off of it or or whatever before youre you know dismissed i mean they work with you and they they have a program uh uh that you can go to that the company picks up the tab for and also its really an excellent program i know it seems like the older ones here are in favor of it the younger ones you know course are still theyre either you know doing some marijuana  or something or theyre very idealistic you know and uh i dont know i think sometimes the older that you get i think the more ramifications you can see of so many things   yeah well our company uh testing when youre hired is a requirement   is it   and i think they have a policy of uh random testing but uh i dont know whether theyve ever done it or not i kind of wish they would   umhum umhum   um and we do have an employee assistance program thats uh good for uh drug abuse uh treatments and other psychological uh problems   uhhuh umhum   stress in the work place marital problems whatevers  bothering you   yeah this this program you know encompasses everything but you know i thought you know its not an instant dismissal if you are found to be taking drugs which i think you know is good and its good on TI TIs part as i said i think they give you three chances you know to come to grips with it before youre dismissed   what you know a lot of times i see problems here at work though uh i remember a few years back i had a uh schematic drawing that needed to be done and i was in a hurry to get it out   umhum   well i sent these drawing the rough draft over to drafting and i usually do a pretty decent drawing myself   uhhuh   when the drawing came back uh it was was apparent that it had been done by two people because the line work
