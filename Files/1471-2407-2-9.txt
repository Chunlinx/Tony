                    Background        Although a number of recently introduced        chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated significant        antitumor activity in advanced colorectal cancer                   standard therapy for patients with metastatic        disease remains fluorouracil FU  based chemotherapy           A vast series of preclinical and clinical studies        have suggested FU is a more active antitumor agent when        modulated by a host of compounds including leucovorin             methotrexate    folinic acid            NphosphonacetylLaspartic acid PALA                and recombinant interferon alfaa IFNaa            Protracted venous infusion PVI FU regimens have also        resulted in increased response rates in some studies but        only results in a modest benefit in median survival            Oral fluoropyrimidines and oral regimens using        prodrugs of FU or inhibitors of dihydropyrimidine        dehydrogenase DPD which pharmacologically simulate the        intravenous continuous infusion administration of FU are        currently under clinical evaluation Although these studies        are important and may demonstrate equivalency it is not        clear these oral compounds will result in a significant        improvement compared to the intravenous infusion of FU                  Potentiation of the antitumor activity of FU by        methotrexate MTX and leucovorin LV requires careful        scheduling to achieve the most favorable interactions        between these  drugs In vitro and in vivo studies have        both suggested a synergistic as well as antagonistic effect        when FU MTX and LV are used in combination               In this report two modulators of FU were used in        a sequential manner anticipating an enhancement of the        efficacy of FU before the development of FU resistance        and subsequent disease progression The order of        administration of the three agents was chosen to optimally        exploit the reported differing mechanisms of biochemical        modulation The objectives of this phase II study were to        determine the activity and toxicity of MTXLVFU in        patients with advanced colorectal cancer                    Patients and Methods                  Treatment Plan          Consistent with the traditional design of phase II          studies all patients received therapy as outlined in the          treatment schema in figure  Methotrexate was          administered at a dose of  mgm orally every  hours          on an empty stomach for  doses At hour  a  hour          intravenous infusion of leucovorin was administered at a          dose of  mgm  Midway through the leucovorin          infusion FU at a dose of  mgm was given as a           minute intravenous bolus infusion This represented a          course of therapy and was repeated every two weeks Dose          modifications for hematologic toxicity were made on the          basis of counts on the day of treatment For a white          blood count   cellsul or a platelet count            plateletsul  patients received full doses of          all three drugs as described above For a white blood          count between  and  cellsul and a platelet          count   plateletsul a  dose reduction of all          three drugs was performed For white blood counts less          than  cellsul and a platelet count            plateletsul  all therapy was held until the counts had          fully recovered white blood count   cellsul and a          platelet count   Patients experiencing a white          blood count   andor a platelet count   any          time during therapy subsequently received  of the          calculated dose even if the counts fully recovered          Weekly complete blood counts including platelet          counts and white blood count differentials were conducted          to determine the level of myelosuppresion Before every          other cycle of treatment q  weeks a chest xray and          complete chemistry panel including electrolytes and serum          creatinine were obtained All lesions were measured          bidimensionally and assessed for changes by either an          imaging study computed tomography chest xray          ultrasound or by clinical examination to determine          response to therapy Treatment was continued until          disease progression became evident or side effects became          intolerable                          Statistical Methods          This study was planned to recruit  evaluable          patients allowing us to estimate objective tumor          response to within   with  confidence          Additional patients were subsequently accrued to increase          the precision of our estimates of response and survival          The trial was conducted with one interim analysis after          nine evaluable patients If no patient had experienced an          objective tumor response the study would have been          terminated The twostage design used in this study was          first proposed by Ed Gehan in  Gehan EA The          determination of the number of patients required

was  or greater          Progressionfree survival was defined as the time from          study entry to the first observation of disease          progression or death as a result of any cancer Survival          was defined as the time of study entry until death as a          result of any cause These timetoevent parameters were          summarized using KaplanMeier productlimit estimates          Log rank tests were used to assess which factors were          univariately predictive of the time to progression and          survival and the Cox proportional hazards regression          model was used to assess which factors were jointly          predictive of these outcomes The statistical analysis          was performed using the SAS package version  SAS          Institute Cary NC                            Results                  Treatment and Response          A total of  cycles of treatment were delivered          during the trial median  cycles range  to  cycles          Table reflects the average percent of ideal dose given          at each selected cycle of treatment Even after  cycles          of therapy at least  of the ideal doses for all drugs          were being administered Ninetythree of the  eligible          patients enrolled onto the study were assessable for          toxicity Mucositis nauseavomiting and diarrhea were          the most commonly observed toxicities and are listed in          table  The hematologic toxicities are also shown in          table and in general were infrequently observed Overall          the regimen was well tolerated          Of the  patients evaluable for response ten          patients  demonstrated a complete response of their          disease median response duration  months          Remarkably  of the  patients

disease while  patients are alive and without disease          progression Table reflects the overall best response          for the entire patient cohort          The overall estimated median time to progression was           months The estimated progression free survival at           months was  standard error  The overall          estimated median survival time was  months The          estimated survival rate at  months was  standard          error  Table reflects overall survival for various          subgroups of patients The prognostic factors found to be          significant on univariate analysis were ECOG performance          score gender and number of metastatic sites Female          patients patients with fewer metastatic sites and          patients with an ECOG performance  had a statistically          significant improved survival Survival by metastatic          site is shown in Table  Those patients without lung          metastasis and those without intraabdominal metastasis          had longer survival times In the multivariate analysis          presence of lymph nodes lower LDH levels female sex          better performance status and fewer metastatic sites were          statistically predictive of longer survival Data not          shown                            Discussion        The rationale at least in part for this phase II study        comes from preclinical data suggesting MTX and LV        potentiate the antitumor activity of FU The cytotoxic        effects of FU are mediated through inhibition of DNA        andor RNA synthesis    DNA synthesis inhibition is        mediated by the binding of the active FU metabolite        fluorodeoxyuridine  monophosphate FdUMP to the        enzyme thymidylate synthetase TS This binding is        enhanced by high concentrations of reduced folate        cofactors    Although this ternary complex is        covalent it dissociates with a halflife of  hours in        the absence of excess  methylene tetrahydrofolate        Thus high levels of  methylene tetrahydrofolate        derived from LV not only allows optimum ternary complex        formation but also prevents subsequent breakdown of the        complex    Additional in vitro studies suggest cells        may need prolonged exposure to reduced folates in order to        obtain maximum inhibition of TS by FdUMP    A second        observed means of potentiating the cytotoxic effects of        FU is through the pretreatment of cells with MTX        MTXinduced enhancement of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate        PRPP pools with subsequent increased synthesis of FU        nucleotides and incorporation of fluoriuridine         triphosphate FUTP into RNA has been proposed as the        basis for this biochemical modulation             Subsequent in vivo studies using fluorine  magnetic        resonance spectroscopy confirmed a threefold increase in        fluoronucleotide FNuct the active FU metabolite        following the pretreatment of animals with MTX            These observed changes in FU catabolism resulted in a        greater antitumor activity than MTX given alone or MTX        given after FU Consistent with these preclinical        studies the design of this phase II trial involved a        fluorouracil infusion that was initiated one hour into the         hour high dose infusion of LV and  hours after the        initial methotrexate dosing        Our phase II study provides longterm efficacy and        safety data for sequential MTXLVFU chemotherapy        administered on a day cycle The  response rate and        median survival duration median  months observed in        this trial are slightly improved when compared to the        results reported for intravenous FU therapy Overall        treatment with sequential MTXLVFU was very        welltolerated Grade III diarrhea was seen in only  of        patients grade III and IV mucositis in  and  of        patients respectively and grade III and IV nauseavomiting        in  and  of patients respectively The most common        hematologic toxicity observed was grade II and III anemia        in  and  of patients respectively        Other similar studies have shown comparable results in        terms of the efficacy and safety of MTXLVFU for        patients with advanced colorectal cancer                In a meta analysis of eight randomized trials of FUMTX        versus FU alone the complete and partial response rates        for the FU patient cohort was  compared with  for        patients receiving MTXFU    In addition the median        survival was improved for patients receiving MTXFU         months versus  months for patients receiving FU alone                 p   Marsh et al in a        randomized trial reported a statistical improvement in        response time to progression  months versus         months and median survival  months versus         months when the interval between the MTX and FU infusion        was increased from  hour to  hours                    Conclusions        We suggest our results and the preclinical and clinical        data discussed indicate the sequence of administration of        FU with MTX and LV is important Future studies combining        FU with other cytotoxic  biologic compounds should        consider the mechanism of the interaction and incorporate        that
