            well lets see my husband does the majority of the um the uh gardening um taking care of the lawn and fertilizing but i um tend to all the planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um  any kind of decorating for the holidays you know ill fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas but basically he does all the heavy stuff and i do all the fun stuff   well we have it just opposite here my wife works in you know at at at the TI and shes uh sedentary all day long   uhhuh   so when she gets home she likes to mow   i say   and we have about ten acres and she tries to mow about half of it   wow wow thats a a big job   well yeah it keeps uh well its doing real well because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed   umhum   i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places   umhum   and now you know since weve been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit but thats just too much to water all at once but   oh sure   but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in weve reclaimed a lot of it   oh i bet its beautiful   yeah but we dont do much in the way of uh flowers we have one little flower garden that we that we work with the rest of it is just like wild flowers   umhum wild flowers   and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers   uhhuh   theyre about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand   umhum oh that sounds lovely   and of course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush   uhhuh oh the wild flowers are beautiful i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets so that just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty then you dont really have to have much maintenance involved   yeah well my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing   umhum   uh she enjoys mowing i cant believe it   uhhuh i know a lot of uhhuh a lot of women do uh um ive just never really you know maybe one of these days ill have to get out there and mow but   i mean i hate it   my husband takes  that and ill help rake up the grass and um sometimes ill help him edge um because we dont have that much property but were on a corner lot so theres a lot of edging to do and um   right yeah   uh thats whats nice about living more in the country you dont have to worry about any of that   we dont even have any concrete or asphalt   oh oh thats nice i this is different for us because the other the past weve had homes that havent had any side walks and um its been a little more country with the trees and we do miss that um if we had a chance to move i think wed move back to somewhere that it was little more countrified and a little less maintenance required   yeah but you know we do everything together this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the actually this fall what am i talking about two weeks ago   as as far as that goes umhum wow   we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people   uhhuh   and uh were in the process of of planting   wow thats a   and were building a stand uh just to the north and along the east uh property line   um   and i uh i think what were what were trying to do is create sort of a wind break   umhum   because ill tell you in winter time when that wind when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like youre not even there   right right   so on the other side of the house though thats where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers   well i took umhum   and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long   uhhuh oh oh that sounds so pretty   and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house   oh really do they dont do any damage though they just fly right back out if you have the     well yeah they dont like it in here because theres nothing to eat   i say   and when youre as busy as one of those babies you got to eat most of the time   i say   and weve got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders but   umhum   you know for the most part gardening for us is well we got asparagus and uh weve got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato   uhhuh   and some blackberries and strawberries man we get the best strawberries that you just cant believe   oh oh that sounds wonderful   yeah we just got our last tomatoes   oh i love home grown grown tomatoes theres nothing like them they just dont have the same ones in the supermarket   yeah well these are accidental tomatoes   what does that mean accidental tomatoes   well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes course youre gonna lose some that way     uhhuh   and the seeds go right through them   i say   and wherever they pooped
