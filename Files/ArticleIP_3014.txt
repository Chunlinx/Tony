                                 The Glass Is Not Half Full            Two broad traditionsencompass commentary about race relations in the United States One ispessimistic the other optimistic Thomas Jefferson a pessimist maintainedthat blacks and whites can never live in a state of equal freedom under thesame Government so insurmountable are the barriers which nature habit andopinion have established between them Despite the Civil War theReconstruction and the Civil Rights Revolution an appreciable number ofobservers continue to assert that the United States is and will remain awhite supremacist pigmentocracy Hence the despairing talk about thepermanence of racism the myth of black progress and the coming racewar            Theoptimistic tradition includes such figures as Frederick Douglass who in even before the destruction of slavery averred that one day the white andcolored people would be blended into a common nationality and enjoy together under the same flag the inestimable blessings of life liberty and thepursuit of happiness as neighborly citizens of a common country A centurylater Martin Luther King Jr affirmed that Americans would someday be able totransform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony ofbrotherhood            America in Black and White One Nation Indivisible byStephan and Abigail Thernstrom is a highly publicized contribution to theconversation on race relations that is in certain respects squarely withinthe optimistic tradition Stephan Thernstrom is professor of American historyat Harvard University and Abigail Thernstrom his wife a senior fellow at theManhattan Institute a think tank Their book offers a history of blackwhiterace relations since the late  th century discusses racialcontroversies in a wide array of contexts employment housing socialwelfareprograms electoral politics criminal justice and prescribes a frameworkwithin which to fashion policy            TheThernstroms conclude that the story of race relations since the s is one ofamazing and enormous change for the good America the Thernstroms claimis no longer separate much less unequal than it once was and by manymeasures less hostile The authors are critical of those who in their viewexaggerate the significance of white racism the significance of the blackunderclass and the extent to which blacks remain outsiders Instead theThernstroms stress the reduction in racial prejudice openly expressed bywhites the rise of the black middle class and the extent to which blackshave become major players in American politics            For the Thernstroms American racial politicstook a wrong turn when the imperative simply to end discrimination ceased togovern our policies That bare obligation they argue was superseded by adestructive insistence that racial minorities be included in substantialnumbers ideally in rough proportionality in all spheres of social lifeincluding the most competitive Throughout America in Black and White the Thernstroms attack almost any initiative that steps beyond simpleantidiscrimination affirmative action race norming in testing under whichblack examinees and white examinees are ranked and judged separatelymajorityminority electoral districts busing subsidies for purposes ofresidential racial integration and so on            TheThernstroms synthesize a tremendous amount of information cover a dauntingarray of topics and convey their findings and prescriptions in a vividaccessible style America in Black and White fails however to reachthe levels of insight and carefulness that its subject demands and theexpressed ambitions of its authors lead one to expect I say thisnotwithstanding my affinity for their optimism Indeed perhaps it is partlybecause I share this optimism that I am particularly disappointed by thisbooks rather substantial flaws            The authors try to place themselves at the vital center ofracial politics We quarrel with the leftits goingnowhere picture of blackAmerica and white racial attitudes but we also quarrel with the rightitsseenoevil view In actuality however they unremittingly berate the leftbut rarely challenge the settled understandings of conservative orneoconservative readers The Thernstroms say they recognize that racialdiscrimination though dramatically diminished continues to pose an obstacleto AfricanAmericans Yet they say little about the large extent to which keyantidiscrimination provisions remain underenforced Virtually the only sort ofcurrent racial discrimination that the Thernstroms treat at length is thatwhich is intended to help blacks and disadvantages certain whites in theprocess            Considerthe Thernstroms discussion of the controversy surrounding the Civil RightsRestoration Act of  The act involved essentially a congressionaloverride of several Supreme Court decisions that had narrowed in a number ofways the scope of earlier civilrights statutes The Thernstroms mainlydisapprove the one small bit of arguably good news about the act theywrite was that Congress outlawed race norming But was this really theonly good news Unmentioned in the Thernstroms account is the SupremeCourt decision on Patterson vs McLean Credit Union that proddedCongress to take action In Patterson  the Supreme Court held that theCivil Rights Act of  did not prohibit employers from racially harassingemployeeseg calling a black employee nigger In the act of Congress rectified this problem explicitly outlawing such racial harassment byemployers I am certain that the Thernstroms would view that aspect ofCongress action as good news But it seems that the Thernstroms were sopreoccupied with criticizing the legal system as overindulgent toward blacksthat they passed over entirely this key feature of the  legislationafeature that sought to correct the very sort of antiblack bias they take painsto underplay throughout their text            I am not criticizing the Thernstroms becausethey fervently oppose affirmative action I disapprove of most forms of publicaffirmative action myself on the premise that public authorities shouldnt bepermitted to allocate burdens and benefits on racial grounds in the absence ofan absolute emergency But there is something dreadfully wrong with a study ofrace relations in the United States that places affirmative action at thecenter of the drama The imbalance is especially notable given that othersignificant phenomenasuch as the lingering effects of racial oppression inthe recent past new eruptions of antiblack prejudice and socalledrational racial discrimination by which people without malevolent intentuse black skin as a negative cueare relegated to the far margins ofdiscussion            The only time the authorsattack passionately and in detail the privileging of whiteness is when suchpractices are located safely in the past But even then the Thernstromsequivocate They do not clearly condemn as racist the actions sometimesviolent that white ethnics in Chicago resorted to in the s to keep blacksfrom moving into their neighborhoods Rather the Thernstroms shift attentionto liberals who criticized these actions but didnt themselves live in thecontested neighborhoods I do not object to their empathy for the whiteethnics or to their point that affluent folk often have been able to escapethe harsh dilemmas posed by racial conflicts After the explaining is donehowever judgments must still be made It is striking and troubling howreluctant the Thernstroms are to condemn white bigotry especially in light oftheir clear consistent and negative assessment of black bigotry            Some commentators adopt astance of racial pessimism because they fear that making concessions to theoptimists will breed complacency and inhibit the efforts needed for stillfurther progress America in Black and White will nourish such fearsthrough its own embrace of laissez faire optimism The Thernstroms prescribelittle to end the harms wrought by past injustices or even to fight latentracismexcept stopping affirmative action and kindred policies This is toopassive a stance Affirmative action in its current guises is unlikely to bethe best or even a good way forward but the consequences of simply eliminatingsuch programs are sure to be mixed Whats more such reforms will leaveuntouched injustices that seed legitimate aggrievement on the part of blacksThrough intelligent selfconscious collective action we have changed muchfor the better in race relations But much remains to be done to create whatJefferson wrongly perceived as impossible an America with blacks andwhitesand others as wellliving in a state of equal freedom under the samegovernment
