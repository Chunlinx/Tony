                    Background        Cells of         Bacillus subtilis grown under        conditions where daughter cells fail to separate after each        cell cycle although the cytoplasm has been        compartmentalized by septum formation produce filaments        consisting of chains of cells linked end to end            Such filaments twist as they elongate writhe and        eventually touch themselves There follows a rapid winding        up of the filament into a doublestrand helix by a process        of supercoiling that is triggered by the impediment of the        twisting motions that accompany cell growth     The        cells in doublestrand helical structures also twist as        they grow Their motions cause the doublestrand structure        itself to twist Constraints on twisting again result in        writhing touching and supercoiling The product is a        strand helical structure      A mature macrofiber        arises by the repetition of the growth twisting and        supercoiling process The final structure is millimeters in        length and contains tens to hundreds of cell filament        strands twisted together into a coherent fiber with loops        at both ends The handedness of the initial doublestrand        helix is preserved throughout fiber morphogenesis        suggesting that each cycle of supercoiling is a result of        negative twist rather than simple over tightening of the        previous helical form into a positive supercoil            Macrofiber selfassembly ceases when structures become        too stiff to supercoil into a plectoneme as a result of the        number of cell filaments in the fiber shaft Cell growth        continues beyond this point however forcing the fiber shaft        to supercoil into a free standing helix that contracts into        a balllike form     Filaments that grow on the surface        of a ball can buckle and initiate the outgrowth of fibers        that remain anchored to the ball surface     These too        supercoil when they reach a critical length or when they        encounter an external impediment to their twisting In        either case supercoiling draws an outgrowing fiber back        onto the surface of the ball resulting in an expansion of        its diameter        Macrofiberproducing cells of         Bacillus subtilis are slightly denser        than the complex fluid growth medium TB in which fibers        are produced     Lacking functional flagella they        settle to the floor of the growth chamber and move as a        result of growth or convection currents in the fluid        Growth with twisting is the predominant cause of motions        that take place during macrofiber morphogenesis and the        production of the twodimensional patterns of larger        structures described in this paper Helixhand specific        pivoting motions of macrofibers and their walking over        glass and plastic surfaces using forces generated by cell        growth have been described previously      These        motions coupled with the joining of structures to one        another upon contact govern the spacing distances between        structures in a population situated on a solid surface        Unlike other spacing mechanisms found in procaryotes the        macrofiber system appears to be a ramification solely of        mechanics dictated by the organization of cells in        multicellular structures and their growth geometry                    Results        Timelapse video films of macrofiber populations grown        as static cultures in  mm diameter plastic petri dishes        containing  ml of TB medium were used to analyze the        locations where structures were positioned on the floor of        the petri dish and the factors responsible for the        patterns formed by them The cultures studied were        inoculated by sterile toothpick transfer from mature fibers        grown in the same medium A random number of fiber        fragments was generated by the transfer process each below        the resolution of the optical system used to produce the        films These grew and selfassembled into macrofibers that        could be seen distributed throughout the available surface        area of the petri dish floor When growth was allowed to        continue undisturbed beyond the fiber stage the final        populations contained  to  fold fewer multicellular        structures than the number of fibers that could be        visualized initially Figure illustrates that joining of        fibers to one another was responsible for the reduction in        their numbers for the large increased mass of the final        structures compared to the initial fibers and for the        eventual spatial pattern observed In Figure about         structures can be resolved at the earliest time shown        frame   minutes later frame  only two        multifiber structures remained in the same area        Additional file shows the source film from which these        frames were obtained The growth rate of fibers in this        culture measured by the rate of length increase was        approximately  minutes per generation A fold reduction        in the number of structures was achieved therefore in less        than two cell generations The results shown in Figure        suggest moreover that the scale of the final spatial        pattern must be governed by initial fiber density in the        population and the length to which fibers grow        The joining of macrofibers to one another is a        growthdependent process driven by twist and supercoiling        It requires fiberfiber contact that impedes the free        twisting of one or both structures Depending upon the        geometry of the two structures that make contact and        whether or not both ends of a given structure are prevented        from rotating contact results in either entwining of the        two or supercoiling that gives rise to a balllike form        consisting of both partners Figure illustrates the        joining of two fiber fragments by the formation of a        functional butt splice The fragments shown are typical of        those produced by toothpick transfer of a mature fiber into        fresh medium Individual cell filaments protruding from the        ends of both fragment shafts became entwined with        oneanother The newly spliced structure behaved as a        single mechanical entity in all its subsequent behavior        including an experimentally induced helix hand inversion        during which all the cell filaments in the fibers shaft        unwound then twisted back together in the opposite helix        hand Additional file shows the dynamics of splice        formation and helix hand inversion The maintenance of the        splice throughout inversion illustrates that joining by        entwining creates a strong linkage between the two        entities Joining by entwining also occurs when intact        mature macrofibers with loops at their ends meet            The resulting structures are irregular in diameter along        their length reflecting differences in the diameter andor        topology of the two initial partners Though irregular        joined structures of this sort are nevertheless        mechanically sound and capable of continued selfassembly        They progress to mature ballforms just as clonal fibers        grown in isolation do        Large and structurally complex macrofibers form        balllike structures rather than elongated ones as a result        of supercoiling Compare the geometry of forms in frames         and  of Figure  The balllike forms produced by joining        of large fibers are much more sedentary than their        precursors Figure illustrates this  large immobile        structures are shown The paths taken by precursor fibers        leading to their contact and joining reveal the distances        and directions travelled in the formation of each aggregate        structure For example several of the initial  fibers        that eventually became the one large ballform aggregate        shown on the upper left of Figure traversed a distance of         mm from their initial positions to their final location        in the aggregate structure They moved over this distance        either by walking over the plastic surface of the petri        dish    until they met oneanother or by being        dragged from one location to another as a result of        supercoiling     Structures too large to move        themselves by walking can still be dragged from one        location to another as shown in Figure provided they        acquire an extended fiber attached to their surface In the        case shown two structures too large to walk were drawn        together by the supercoiling of an extended fiber that        bridged between them To begin with the extended fiber had        one free end capable of rotating as it grew When rotation        of the free end was prevented by contact with the second        large ball structure supercoiling was induced The two        structures were then drawn together by the contraction in        length that accompanies supercoiling See Additional file        for an overview of the dragging process        The static fluid cultures used in the experiments        reported here always appear to develop internal fluid        motions even though the external environment is held at        constant temperature These convection currents can carry        macrofibers with them and can even move large balllike        structures Figure shows two frames taken from late stages        of pattern formation in the same culture superimposed upon        oneanother The structures in Figure were false colored        to permit identification of the earlier black and later        white time points A comparison of the two frames shows        numerous examples of neighboring black structures joining        to form a single white structure The directions of the        joining motions have no preferred orientation in the entire        population In contrast comparison of the direction single        black structures moved to their later white locations        reveals that many paths taken are parallel to one another        and in the same orientation Smaller structures moreover        moved over greater distances in the same time interval than        did larger structures Small structures of this sort are        found in many cultures They arise late in a cultures        history apparently from filaments shed from large mature        structures Film sequences from other cultures show small        latearising structures moving over great distances amongst        large structures that remain in place or move only very        slightly These observations indicate that convection        currents must        i contribute to the motions fibers undergo in the early        stages of pattern formation and thus enhance the chances        that fibers make contact with each other and        ii influence the final locations structures assume in        the patterns        The dimensional spatial patterns of ballform        structures have been characterized in three macrofiber        cultures designated   and  Two time points were        analysed from each culture an early time when fibers were        in the initial stages of ball formation but still capable        of selfgenerated translational motions caused by twisting        and supercoiling and a later time when large ball forms        were situated at or very close to their final positions        The six images analyzed are shown in Figure  In each pair        of frames the total number of structures present at the        later time is less than that present at the early time as a        result of fiber joining  structures are present in all        six images In order to determine whether structures are        uniformly randomly distributed in the space available for        each culture the observed distributions were compared to        those expected on the basis of a Poisson distribution A        grid was superimposed over each image Figure  and used        to obtain the frequency of squares within which there were           or  structures A Poisson distribution was used        to predict the expected frequency for similar randomly        distributed populations spaced uniformly in the same area        Both the observed and theoretical expected distributions        are shown in Table  There are significantly fewer        gridsquares that do not contain any structures in the        observed populations than would be the case if the pattern        was random Similarly there are more gridsquares that        contain a single structure in the observed populations than        would be anticipated if the structures were positioned        solely by chance in the population To validate the        significance of these differences we performed a        chisquared comparison of the two populations Table         They are significantly different and the  tests show that        the probability of the observed distribution being uniform        is very small        The distances separating structures from all their        nearest neighbors were determined in six populations The        results shown in Table were derived from a total of         structures consisting of  lengths measured between        neighboring pairs of structures called links The mean        distances separating neighbors ranged from  to  cm        in the five populations The overall mean for all pairwise        distances is  cm The variation in separation distances        within a given population can be examined by ordering all        the separation distances in the network from shortest to        longest and plotting them as a function of distance Curves        such as those shown in Figure are obtained The majority        of points fall on straight lines the slopes and intercepts        of which are given in Table  The separation distances        between pairs become more uniform in populations with        greater numbers of structures as seen by the correlation        between lower slopes and higher numbers of structures A        similar measurement of link lengths was carried out in        theoretical populations distributed at random in the same        space using a random number generator to assign x and y        coordinates for each structure Link lengths in these        random populations also become more uniform as a function        of object density in the population suggesting that        improved uniformity of spacing in denser populations is not        a ramification of the mechanism responsible for the        patterns found in macrofiber populations        The Yintercept values listed in Table represent the        shortest distances separating structures in the observed        populations These values have been used in a model that        predicts the observed distributions based upon the idea        that all structures initially located within an area        related to the Yintercept value coalesce into a single        structure The following assumptions are made        i the starting structures are uniformly randomly        distributed        ii a grid pattern with grid square size related to the        Yintercept value is superimposed upon the distribution of        structures these are termed capture squares        iii all starting structures within each capture square        coalesce resulting in only two categories of grid squares        those with  and those with  structure in them        For an initial average number of starting structures per        capture square         v  the proportion of capture squares        expected to contain  coalesced structures is Poisson e                 v  so that the proportion expected        to contain  coalesced structure is   e          v  Larger grid squares termed        measuring grid squares of any dimension can also be        superimposed upon the same pattern of structures and the        probabilities of finding r coalesced structures r           n in the measuring squares that are n times as large        as capture squares are assuming that events in each        capture square are independent of those in any other given        Binomial by        Pr  nC         r p r  p nr        where nC         r is the Binomial coefficient and p           e          v         The expected average value for this distribution is n         e          v  called  for simplicity Using        this average the probabilities for a measuring grid square         time larger than the capture square are        P             P              P               P              P            Using population  as an example the measured        average is  There are  structures and         measuring squares The expected and observed frequencies of        grid squares with  to  structures are as follows                The fit is clearly better than for a uniform        theoretical distribution but can be further improved by        choosing a better ratio of measuring square area to capture        square area Table  shows the expected frequencies        obtained when this model is applied to the six populations        described in Table with ratios either  or  No further        attempt is made to optimize the fit even so the         probabilities show it to be very good The ratios  and         correspond to the capture square sizes of  mm and  mm        respectively This range is almost exactly the same as that        for minimum link distances for the cases in question Table                Additional file         FJ macrofiber aggregate formation A macrofiber

    The work described here focuses on the organization of        multicellular bacterial forms in populations resting on a        solid surface beneath a fluid growth solution Although        individual cells in these populations have no conventional        mechanisms of motility their multicellular derivatives        become dispersed in the space available forming patterns of        unique scale and nonrandom character Neither chemotactic        processes nor directed growth appear to be at play        Instead the ultimate patterns achieved are derived from the        growth geometry of individual cells Using the same basic        mechanism that links cell growth geometry to macrofiber        selfassembly we interpret the production of dimensional        pattern as an outcome of motions derived from cell growth        operating at the level of a macrofiber and the joining of        individual macrofibers to form higher order aggregates that        have their own unique constraints Both stochastic and        determined events are involved Unlike other bacterial        populations in fluid cultures one ends up in the macrofiber        system with condensed multiclonal structures of high cell        density separated from one another according to rules based        upon the ramifications of twisting and supercoiling of        elastic filaments        In macrofibers there is an hierarchical relationship        between cell growth geometry the behavior of cell        filaments and bundles of filaments and the movement of        macrofibers over solid surfaces Individual cells and        consequently cell filaments also twist as they elongate        encounter constraints on their twisting and supercoiling is        an inevitable outcome The mechanics of twisting elastic        filaments assure selfassembly so long as the integrity of        the cell filament the backbone of cell wall peptidoglycan        and the electrostatic structure of the cell wall polymers        is maintained Fiber selfassembly has its limits however        set by both physiological and mechanical constraints There        is a time course therefore when fibers are formed mature        condense to balllike forms and ultimately decay        Populations of fibers go beyond this clonal scenario by        joining with one another and positioning the aggregate        forms in patterns Twisting and supercoiling are the key        mechanisms responsible for these processes as well In        other words joining and positioning also require cell        growth of a particular geometry        Twisting motions enable macrofibers to join either by        butt splicing or by parallel joining of two fiber shafts as        a result of entwining The case shown in Figure        illustrates that two different structures can join by        entwining at the level of individual cell filaments in a        manner similar to the early stages of clonal macrofiber        formation Supercoiling motions are responsible for        i fiber folding during morphogenesis           ii fiber movement over solid surfaces           iii the conversion of extended fibers into compact        ballform structures    and Figure         iv the dragging of individual structures together which        leads to their fusion into a aggregate multiclonal forms        Figure         The cell surfaces that are brought into contact with one        another by these processes show no signs of repulsion even        when tightly pressed together by twisting and supercoiling        yet they do not bond together in a manner that prevents        their sliding over one other during growth and movement No        obvious signs of attraction have been seen in many films        examined that show pattern formation in populations Nor is        there any evidence that directed growth plays a role in        bringing fibers close enough to each other for contact to        be made Rather it appears that random motions in high        density populations position structures so that contact is        inevitable as a result of growth motions Once contact is        made the laws of mechanics governing the behavior of        twisting elastic filaments come into play and eventually a        dimensional pattern emerges Figure         Two features of the ultimate or penultimate        dimensional patterns formed by the positioning of        ballform macrofiber aggregate structures have been        characterized here their nonuniform randomness and the        spacing distributions of nearest neighbors The former        appears to be a ramification of the surface area within        which fiber contacts can be made itself governed by fiber        length and fiber mobility In late stages of pattern        formation exclusion zones within which no other structures        may exist become established surrounding each large        structure Any extended fiber that protrudes from the        periphery of a large structure pivots about its anchor        point as it grows and makes contact with the floor of the        petri dish The path travelled by the peripheral fibers        is governed by its helix hand clockwise for righthanded        counterclockwise for lefthanded structures The motion        itself is caused by rolling andor walking over the floor        of the petri dish During its sweep around the anchoring        structure an extended peripheral fiber has the potential to        drag any other structure it encounters to the surface of        the anchoring structure thereby creating an exclusion zone        Exclusion zones are not perfect however Peripheral fibers        seldom sweep a full  degrees around a given structure        before they either encounter another structure and        supercoil pulling the two together or simply supercoil        themselves onto the ball surface Arcs may be left        therefore that have not been cleared of neighbors In        addition peripheral fibers cease to function as a culture        ages consequently a very late arising structure that        happens into an exclusion zone can develop there into a        mature structure This is a very infrequent process        however easily detected in the film sequences and did not        occur during formation of any of the patterns analyzed        here        A mathematical model has been developed that predicts        the two dimensional spatial distribution patterns of        objects in populations that behave as macrofibers do The        key assumption is that all objects located within a capture        zone join one another Using minimum link lengths found in        observed populations to scale the dimensions of the capture        zone the model was able to predict distributions that        closely match those found in the experimental populations        Table  These findings strengthen the contention that        the condensation of macrofibers confined spatially into        single aggregate structures is the essential mechanisms of        pattern formation in macrofiber populations        Finally mention must be made of the role convection        currents play in the establishment of dimensional        patterns in populations There is no question that        convection currents move small and even large structures        In early stages of pattern formation when structures are        very small and close to each other it is very likely that        fluid flows do result in contacts that lead to joining As        structures grow larger and become multiclonal they no        longer appear to be dominated by fluid currents and as        their density in the population decreases chance        positioning by convection becomes less likely Walking        selfassembly motions and supercoiling now dominate        movements leading to chance contacts Joining by dragging        becomes the dominant mode at the latest stages of        patterning Eventually the density of objects in the        population is at its lowest and the aggregate structures        are very large hence moved only slowly if at all by fluid        motions Once the culture reaches a stage where growth of        individual cells is no longer in the organized fiber form        bringing structures together by any means is unlikely to        result in their joining The natural limit in pattern        formation corresponds therefore to the time when there is        no longer organized multicellular growth in the        population                    Conclusions        Populations of bacterial macrofibers cultured in fluid        medium without agitation produce aggregate multicellular        structures distributed in dimensional patterns on the        floor of the growth chamber although the cells have no        flagellardriven motility The geometry of individual cell        growth is ultimately responsible for the observed patterns        Upon contact growing structures join one another using        forces associated with twisting and supercoiling The final        result is a population of large sedentary aggregate        structures separated from one another by surrounding zones        of fluid medium that are free of structures The scale of        the pattern is set by the lengths to which mature        macroflbers grow A mathematical model based upon the        coalescence of all structures initially located in        proximity to each other is able to accurately predict the        actual distributions found experimentally                    Materials and methods        Bacteria         Bacillus subtilis strain FJ has been        described previously     It may be grown as either        left or righthanded macroflbers with a range of twist        states depending upon imposed environmental conditions        Young fibers produced in the standard complex medium TB        were used as the starting material for all experiments        Media and growth conditions The complex medium TB        consisted of  g Bacto Tryptose Difco  g Bacto Beef        Extract Difco and  g NaCl per L deionized water            Static cultures were housed in standard  mm style        diameter plastic Petri dishes actual diameter of the floor          mm Righthanded fibers were produced by overnight        growth in ml TB containing  mM MgSO          at C A single fiber was disrupted        by toothpick transfer to fresh TB medium Cultures grown        for study at low magnification were placed on an elevated        glass plate suspended above a black surface that was housed        in a plexiglass chamber The temperature on top of the        glass plate was C Cultures used for higher        magnification studies were grown on the stage of an Olympus        SZTr stereo zoom microscope housed in the same plexiglass        chamber Lighting was indirect from below using a source        outside of the microscope to prevent temperatures from        rising above C The culture from which Figure was        obtained was grown in TB medium lacking additional        magnesium sulfate It was incubated on the stage of a Nikon        inverted phase contrast microscope and maintained at C        using an electrical heatingcooling device Cambion        Cambridge Thermionic Cambridge MA        Video film production and analysis Timelapse video        films were produced at low magnification showing an entire        Petri dish culture from above using a Cohu chargedcoupled        device camera fitted with a Fujinon TV zoom lens          mm to which Tiffen closeup lenses were added as        needed Higher magnification films were obtained using        either the stereo zoom microscope described above or a        Nikon inverted phase contrast microscope Films obtained        from the latter were initially recorded on  mm film using        a Bolex camera controlled by a timelapse system The films        were later transferred to VHS video format for analysis        All other films produced using Cohu cameras were recorded        either with a GYYR timelapse video VHS tape deck Odetics        or a JVC timelapse tape deck In either case date and time        stamps were written onto each frame by the tape deck        Images were transferred to a PC using Matrox software        Matrox Graphics Montreal and analyzed with Matrox and        Image Pro Plus Media Cybernetics programs The Adobe        Photoshop program Adobe Systems was used to assemble the        figures
