                            Jakob von Uexkll coined the term         Umwelt to describe the subjective world of animals The world that        animals perceive is not an objective veridical representation of the physical world he        argued but is instead a product of the particular sense organs that each species has        acquired in its evolutionary history  Many animals have sensory abilities that humans        dont such as a magnetic compass sense in birds  or sensitivity to electric fields in        fish  But even within sensory modalities shared by many animals such as vision        hearing and olfaction there are strong differences between species For example bees        but not humans can see UV light  and smell carbon dioxide  and bats can hear        ultrasound  But what exactly is the structure of the perceptual worlds proposed by von        Uexkll Can we draw them on paper in the form of maps allowing us to visualize a        particular animals subjective view of the world Will such maps allow us to predict the        similarity of two stimuli eg two colors or two scents by inspecting the distance        between the loci they produce in a perceptual space Does understanding the metrics of such        maps help us predict how stimulus mixtures will be perceived        Even though perceptual sensations may strike us as ethereal they must be based on        patterns of activity in neuronal hardwarethus we need to look into the brains of animals        to see how the neuronal circuitry processes the information from the sense organs The        study by Guerrieri et al  on odor space in honeybees in this issue is an excellent        example of how behavioral studies can be paired with neurobiological data to access the        perceptual space of an animal Here we contrast the complexity of scent perception with        two examples of simpler perceptual worlds vertebrate frequency perception and bee color        vision                    The Perception of Pitch in the Auditory System        Sound is a mechanical vibration whose most defining characteristic is neatly arranged        along one dimensionfrequency of waves with alternating high and low pressure The        mechanical structure of our inner ear tidily maps the frequency of sound onto different        positions of the basilar membrane in the snailshaped cochlea  The width and        flexibility of this membrane increases with distance from the oval window the point of        entry of sound The result is that when the frequency of sound is high it will produce a        peak of vibration near the oval window Figure A if the frequency is low the peak of        vibration will be nearer the far apical end of the cochlea  In this sense the        cochlea processes sound similarly to how a prism acts on white light  it decomposes        mixtures of sound frequencies into their components and maps them onto different spatial        positions within the cochlea The thousands of mechanoreceptors distributed along the        basilar membrane need not be tuned to different frequencies as in color vision where each        receptor type responds most strongly in a particular wavelength range It is the        mechanoreceptors position in the cochlea that determines which sound frequency will        maximally stimulate them  This structure is maintained on a higher processing        level fibers in the auditory cranial nerve send the information from the receptor cells to        the brain in parallel ie in a first approximation each receptor cell has its own        neuronal cable to the cochlear nuclei and beyond to the auditory cortex where we find        a complete topographical map of the audible frequency spectrum Figure B mirroring the        mapping of frequencies in the cochlea  The perception of pitch then is        arranged along one dimension as on a piano keyboard Because of the parallel processing of        receptor information from the cochlea we can hear mixtures of different frequencies and        analyze their components accurately unless mixtures are very complex We can identify the        tones that a chord is made up of  There are of course cases where mixtures have        unique properties eg in the case of the intensities of harmonic overtones integer        multiples of the fundamental frequency that distinguish a C tone produced by a guitar from        that of a flutebut we can still identify the fundamental whose perceived pitch is not        altered by the overtones We would never perceive a mixture of  Hz and  Hz as an        intermediate frequency eg  Hz                    Color Perception in Bees        While these observations are seemingly trivial in the world of sound the perception of        mixtures in color vision is fundamentally different If we mix yellow with red light we        will see orangenot only will we not be able to tell that the orange light has been        produced by mixing two lights but we will also be unable to distinguish the mixture from        monochromatic orange light  Similar mixture phenomena are well established in bees        for example orange light with a wavelength of  nm can be mixed with blue light         nm to produce a mixture that is indistinguishable from monochromatic bluegreen light         nm  In bees as in humans the perception of hues is arranged in a circular        fashion around achromatic white or gray  In this circular arrangement complementary        colors ie those opposite on a circle can be additively mixed to generate a neutral        stimulus eg UV light  nm mixed in the appropriate ratio with bluegreen light         nm will be perceived as white by bees  In the auditory system mixing only two        frequencies to produce the perception of white noise is inconceivable Finally the        circular arrangement of hues also implies that it is possible to mix two ends of the        perceptible spectrum to produce a sensation that is not contained in the spectrum for        humans mixing violet with red light will produce purple a sensation that has no        equivalent in the visual spectrum a similar unique percept can be produced by facing bees        with a mixture of UV and green light         We and other animals can only ever see one color in a point additive color mixtures        are perceived as intermediates of their generative sources and it is not possible to        identify the physical components of a mixture eg the perception of white can be        generated mixing any two complementary colors In contrast we can hear several        frequencies at once and identify the components of at least simple stimulus mixtures such        as triads  In color vision but not in hearing multiple combinations of physical        stimuli will generate identical sensations The reasons for these fundamental differences        between the visual and the auditory sensory modalities can be attributed in a        straightforward way to the structure of the sense organs as well as postreceptor neural        circuits        In color vision there arent thousands of receptor cells each responsible for receiving        a narrow range of wavelengths as there are in the auditory system with its technique of        frequency analysis Instead both humans and bees have only three color receptor types        each sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths Figure A Human color receptors are        typically termed blue green and red receptors while those in bees are most sensitive to        UV blue and green light  A single receptor cannot analyze the wavelength of the        light it receives it simply acts as a quantum counter but the information about the        wavelength identity of the quantum is lost on absorption Any single photoreceptor might        respond equally to a medium intensity light in the wavelength range of its peak        sensitivity and to a strong intensity light at the periphery of its sensitive rangehence        it cannot disentangle wavelength from intensity         This means that the visual system has to compare the signals from receptors differing in        spectral sensitivity In insects as well as in vertebrates it does this by means of color        opponent neurons Figure A  The minimum equipment for an animal with two color        receptor types is one type of opponent neuron receiving antagonistic inputs from the two        types of cells Using such an opponent mechanism the visual system can tell whether        there is a stronger signal from the short wavelength receptor or the long wavelength        receptorhence it can extract information about stimulus spectral quality Theoretically        an animal with n color receptor types needs         n minus  chromatic opponent mechanisms  Indeed behavioral        experiments with bees have shown that only two color opponent mechanisms are necessary to        explain color discrimination data  It is not clear which ones these        arephysiologists have found at least seven different types of color opponent neurons in        the bee optic lobes  and modeling has shown that almost any combination of two        color opponent neuron types is adequate for color coding         Nevertheless the twodimensional color opponent space whose axes correspond to        excitation patterns of color opponent mechanisms Figure B has proven extremely useful        distances in such a color space correlate well with behavioral color discrimination data        The color opponent space allows us to predict hue by assessing angular position and        saturation by measuring distance from the center and it can be used to predict the        perception of color mixtures which fall between the loci of the colors used to generate        the mixture  Because information about the actual receptor signals is discarded in the        very periphery of the sensory system perception is only based on derived color opponency        dimensions which measure differences in receptor signals rather than absolute signals                    Olfactory Perceptual Space in Bees        Making sense of scents is a considerably messier affair Odors are hardly presentable on        a physical continuum like the wavelength of light they are multidimensional entities        that can vary from small gaseous molecules to longchained hydrocarbons  Organic        compounds vary in carbon chain length and functional group ie the group of atoms that        give substances their characteristic properties eg alcohols aldehydes ketones or        alkanes At any moment the air around an animal may contain hundreds of different        airborne substances which fluctuate with wind humidity and multiple other factors                On the receptor level the olfactory system shows a complexity that is unparalleled in        any color vision system the receptor family discovered by s Nobel laureates L Buck        and R Axel comprises about  receptor proteins in mammals each of which only binds a        narrow range of airborne molecules  Only one of these proteins is expressed per        receptor cell so that there are indeed about  different odor receptor cell types in        the mammalian olfactory epithelium  In insects the diversity of such receptors is        lower but still impressive fruit flies appear to have  different odorant receptor genes         In honeybees the number of such genes will be accessible pending the publication of        the honeybee genome so far screens by H Robertson pers comm indicate a number         Some  olfactory receptor cells of a few dozen different types are        distributed along the honeybee antennae  Figure A How can the brain extract        biologically useful information from such multidimensional sensory input        The first neuronal center of olfactory information processing the antennal lobe or its        mammalian analogue the olfactory bulb achieves order in two ways First axons from like        receptor cells ie those that express the same receptor protein and therefore bind the        same odorants project to one or a few glomeruli ie globular anatomically distinct        subunits within the antennal lobe  The number of glomeruli ranges from a few dozen to        several hundred and corresponds roughly to the number of putative olfactory receptor types         The honeybees antennal lobe contains  glomeruli  Individual chemicals        reliably activate sets of identified glomeruli  These microrelays sum up the input        from same chemoreceptors tremendously increasing the signaltonoise ratio and thus        facilitating reliable odorant detection         A second and perhaps more remarkable feature of the antennal lobe is that glomeruli        coding for similar substances are located close together while those that code for        distinct scents are spatially segregated  Carbon chain length for example        is neatly represented in this glomerular map  How the brain achieves such chemical        mapping is something of a miracle how would the developing brain know which axons        belong to receptors that respond to chemically similar substances so that these can be        wired to neighboring glomeruli In mammals it was recently found that the receptor        proteins that bind odor molecules are also expressed in the axon terminals of the receptor        cells  If we assume that similar receptor molecules bind similar odorants then the        developing nervous system could use receptor molecule similarity in the receptor cells        axon terminals to wire up the neural map in the antennal lobe        But does this neuronal activity map indeed correspond to the olfactory perceptual space        Theoretically a perceptual space might have as many dimensions as there are distinct        receptor typesor it might have as many axes as there are glomeruli with distinct response        profiles Is it possible that olfactory space in bees then has several dozen dimensions        To evaluate the structure of olfactory perceptual space Guerrieri et al  trained        honeybees to memorize a wide variety of odors and then tested how well bees could        distinguish these odors from others They then asked how many axes must the olfactory        perceptual space have so that distances between odors can be used to predict how similar        they will appear to bees They found that the multidimensional receptor space might be        collapsed onto very few perceptual axes much of the similarity judgments between odors can        be explained by a three dimensional space Figure B The most important axis spreads out        scents according to carbon chain length whereas the other two axes separate the odors        according to functional group ie they separate primary and secondary alcohols        aldehydes and ketones Distances between odor loci in this threedimensional space        correlate well with the discriminability of the odors to bees They also correspond to the        similarity of activation patterns of the glomerular map  although the actual        mechanisms that evaluate this similarity remain to be identified There are a number of        complications however that indicate that the olfactory perceptual space is unlikely to        submit to the relatively simple rules of perception of color and pitch        Take mixtures of different stimuli for example If odor perception followed rules        similar to those of color perception and if it relied exclusively on derived parameters        such as carbon chain length then mixtures would be perceived as intermediates of their        components A mixture of two molecules differing only in carbon chain length would be        perceived as indistinguishable from a single odorant with an intermediate carbon chain        length This remains to be tested but we conjecture that this is unlikely to be the case        On the other hand are odor mixtures simply perceived as a compound entity with distinct        components like a triad in vertebrate pitch perception or are mixtures unique entities        that are perceived as fundamentally different from their elements like white in color        perception Honeybees appear to employ a combination of the two they can perceive the        components of a mixture and generalize to these components when faced with them        individually but also attach unique properties to the mixture  A further        complication is that Guerrieri et al  found intriguing asymmetries in the bees        assessments of odor similarities bees respond as if they find odor A more similar to        trained odor B than they find B to trained odor A It will be difficult to represent these        complex phenomena in a simple map        These phenomena indicate that odor perception cannot be as easily visualized in a        lowdimensionality space as other sensory modalities However for psychophysicists just        as for motorists navigating novel territory even a rough guidance map is better than no        map and so this olfactory space is undoubtedly a useful tool to predict the beesubjective        similarity of scents While the antennal lobe clearly structures the sensory input so as to        extract derived chemical properties the information about the input from individual        receptor types might not be discounted in the periphery of the nervous system as in visual        perception but relayed on to higher processing centers such as the mushroom bodies and        the protocerebrum  If both modulated and unmodulated sensory information is        available to the neuronal centers that ultimately decide on odor similarity and        especially if different individuals attend differently to different kinds of inputeg        because experience modifies interactions between glomeruli then the derivation of a        static perception space that can be applied to all individuals of a species may be quite        challenging                    Conclusion        Philosophers have correctly pointed out that we cannot actually imagine what it is like        to perceive the world through other animals sense organs  But studies such as those        by Guerrieri et al  show elegantly how to attach scales and numbers to the inner worlds        proposed by von Uexkll a century ago Mapping these worlds quantitatively will allow us to        compare them between related species operating in different environments to see how the        architecture of perceptual spaces is adapted to mirror biologically useful information from        the real world in each species  One of the most exciting future directions is to        explore the extent to which such perceptual worlds are not just speciesspecific but in        fact individualspecific In the honeybee learning alters the response patterns of the        glomerular map  If the antennal lobe has a dual function in creating the primary        dimensions of olfactory perception and storing olfactory memories then one prediction is        that individual experience will alter perception Similar phenomena have been predicted in        other sensory modalities  but remain to be shown directly by exposing different        individuals to different environments during development
