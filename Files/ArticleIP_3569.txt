        Fan of Uplift                        DearFan            There are many options You could say to your surgeon friend what Ivana Trump said Im very wellrested and I changed my makeup  You could tell your friend that you won DrFamous in a raffle  You could say you were in an auto accident and theambulance driver took you straight to Dr Famous office  You could betruthful and say your own version of I was overcome by curiosity about thismuch talked about doc and now I know his work is as good as yours            And thisis to give you fortitude Prudies close doctor friend tells her

   I cant believe Imwriting to an online lady for advice but things are rotten with my marriageMy wife who has the more important job is almost disdainful of me in front offriends and anything but friendly in private She is the master of thewithering remark and is hypercritical of nearly everything I do or say                                       To befair I want to pass on to you a complaint that I do find valid so you canbetter judge the situation She objects to a habit that is really part of mypersonality For whatever reason I am what you might call a backseat drivereven when were not in a car My instinct is to give her directions which wayto turn how to get places etc Her directional sense is average notterrible I fear where this is heading Have you any ideas                                       Hanging on in StLouis                        DearHang            From your outline of thingsit sounds to Prudie as though you are living in ballbuster hell and she ismarried to a shepherd Gut instinct tells me there are underlying problemsfestering that make her mean Prudie for example could use directions moreoften than not and coming from a loving partner they would cause noirritation Your herding her around suggests that you are compensating in thesense that you have found a way to assert control            You bothneed to get to the bottom of the serious troubles undermining your marriageWhether or not you two can do it alone or with a counselor is your call But dosomething and go forwardeither together or separately            Prudie certainly
