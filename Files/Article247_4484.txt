                                 The New World of Womens Sports                        Christine            Now youve got my mind racing             I love the story you told about Doug Fluties daughter Alexa looking atMichael Jordan and Mia Hamm in that Anything You Can Do I Can Do Bettercommercial and saying Whos the guy with Mia            Stories like that are one of the reasons Im unfailingly optimistic that theway the sports pages or TV networks are run today arent the way theyll stayThe traditional media isnt changing quickly enough for either of us But theyare going to change They have to The Internet is going to make traditionalmedia change because it allows readers to choose the content they wantcompletely bypassing the old SuperEditors who run traditional media now anddetermine the what we see Business reasonsnot just ethical argumentsaregoing to prevail on the media to rethink how we cover all sports not justwomens sports Because the sports landscape has already changed whether somelaggard sports editors fail to staff something like the World Cup games Ornot            I think part of the lag has to do with sexism of course But I also thinkthat newspapers and the like rarely start trends We report them only afterthey come alongand often quite a long long time afterward            But this absence of coverage doesnt mean change isnt happening all aroundus Only that its not being accurately or presciently reported Thats a hugedistinction            If theres any lesson that men should take from the history of women orwomens sports its thatlike the history of the civil rights movement orthe gay movement for that matterpeople tend to resemble their dreams longbefore the powerbrokers grant us permission or the court of public opinionever catches up            Fluties daughter is a great example Somehow she filtered out the avalancheof attention Jordan receives but felt a kinship with Hamm            And Alexa has a lot of imitators Despite those newspapers that dont coverwomens sports regularly the womens World Cup final at the Rose Bowl lastsummer still drew  peoplethe largest crowd ever to see a womens sportsevent One of the US players Tiffeny Milbrett was dead right when she saidlives were changed by World Cupand not just here in America but around theworld            Stupid as it sounds sitting as we are on the cusp of this new millenniumwomen still lead sharply circumscribed lives trimmed in by meanspiritednonsense thats meant to keep them down Last summer the World Cup team fromNigeria talked about being told soccer ruins a woman who wants to havechildren And the Brazilian players talked of being told that soccer isnt forwomen But they still played on They still showed up            Female athletes like them and Hamm have always had to shoulder the addedfreight of having to invent themselves Much like the US womens goldmedal Olympic hockey team the World Cup soccer players had no femalepredecessors When they began playing they never thought soccer careers wouldamount to anything like the monthlong World Cup extravaganza or womenssoccers debut at the  Atlanta Summer Olympics before that            You now could argue both events were watershed moments for female athletesbecause Americans simply love a spectacle But theres something more powerfulat work too I also really believe that what people were responding to duringthe World Cup was the spirit of those women And not the sport they play            In the increasingly cynical world of bigtime sportswhich are businessesthat try to pretend theyre just games peopled by too many phonies who getpassed off as heroesthe US women were precisely what they appeared to beAn authentic team Women whose deportment and pursuit of excellence are worthemulating            Theyre people who fell in love with something and became determined toexhaust that love to its potential And theyre not just pioneers that wordis too benign Theyre revolutionaries Theyre doing nothing less thanchanging the worlds ideas of what being a woman means That is a profoundthing to be able to say            Now you asked what bothers men so much about that And I think the answeris this simple            Men arent used to envisioning a world in which theyre not essential            Thats why some men hate the attention lavished on the womens World CupThats why they hate it when women make fun of the Super Bowl Womenssuccesses in nontraditional sports like soccer or ice hockey have underlinedhow womens sports are not merely spinoffs of games that men have been playingforever Womens sports are provinces unto themselvesdistinct places withtheir own heroes and rich histories their own character and ethos andculture            I cant stop thinking too that women like the US team force us to inventa new language to describe women And thats thrilling too If Hamm can scorefrom  yards out on a shot struck with either foot on a full gallop or tennisplayer Venus Williams can hit a serve  mphfaster than Andre Agassi wasserving at Wimbledon this yeardoesnt that force us to reconsider what itmeans to play like a girl            Suddenly its no longer a slur is it            Perhaps the best thing is as I said theres no turning back The World Cupwas about ideas and how women are changing their place in the world Now likea boulder rolling down a hill the process cant be stopped            The best thing to do is admire its gathering strength Or get the hell outof the way            Johnette
