                                 The Temptation of Bob Dole            Dole is sorely tempted toforget everything he knows about the s tax cuts Heres a reminder                            words pluslinks                                       By Jodie TAllen                        All his career Bob Dolehas stood for fiscal conservatism and balanced budgets Most famously he wasalmost alone among Republican leaders in his caustic skepticism about thesupplyside economics of the s Now political and economic advisers areurging the Republican presidential candidate to take off his green eyeshadepush aside that unappetizing bowl of budget cuts and scarf down a tasty doseof taxcut rejuvenator Just the tonic for anemic poll numbers And Dole istempted He reportedly will endorse some kind of broadbased tax cut inJuly            Like Dole the voters knowbetter But like Dole they are tempted too A persistent majority ofAmericans piously tells pollsters that budgetdeficit reduction is moreimportant than tax cuts Yet says Brookings Institution economist BarryBosworth the politicians clearly believe that people are lyingand theelection results tend to support the fact that they are lying When theyvote they want a tax cut            Of course nobody is outthere urging tax cuts instead of deficit reduction And certainly noenthusiast is presenting tax cuts as a deficit booster  On the otherhand few outside the Wall Street Journal editorial page are stillbrash enough to claim that tax cuts could actually raise tax revenues Manyold school supplyside economists such as Ronald Reagans first Council ofEconomic Advisers chairman Martin Feldstein never did endorse the socalledLaffer Curve that cocktailnapkin art purporting to show that big tax cutswould soon pay for themselves The loose talk of the supplyside extremistsgave fundamentally good policies a bad name Feldstein complained in             Nowthough Feldstein is reported to be among a group of wellknown economistsurging Dole to adopt a socalled progrowth tax strategy meaning substantialtax cuts How they are to be paid for is unclear The promise of painlessredemption is thereif not quite explicit But unlike the last time we hadthis argument in  there is the record of the s to show what happenswhen the supplysiders get their way            Sen Spencer Abraham RMich is an ardent advocate of apercent acrosstheboard cut in tax rates Can we reconcile the seeminglycontradictory notions of cutting tax rates and balancing the budget he askedin where else a Wall Street Journal article last month The answeris yes the senator revealed if only we ignore the claims of conventionalthinkers and focus instead on the fact that from  to  federalrevenues adjusted for inflation expanded by an average of  percent peryear despite a sharp reduction in tax rates            Abraham picked his yearswith care Shortly after passage of the supposedly rejuvenating Reagan tax cutof  the US economy plunged into the deepest economic downturn since theGreat Depression The years  through  cover the recovery period fromthe pit of that recession to the beginning of the next one If you believe thatReagans  tax cut was responsible for all those growth yearsthatotherwise we would have wallowed in stagnation for seven yearsAbrahamschoice may be fair enough If you doubt it you might prefer the traditionaleconomists method of measuring longterm trends from equivalent places in thebusiness cycle            Even so Abrahamstroughtopeak comparison does not support his point Official budget numbersdo show total federal revenue growing at an inflationadjusted rate of percent over the period reasonably close to Abrahams  But the componentsof that growth tell the real story Individual income taxeswhich bysupplyside theory should have spurted since rates were cutgrew at only apercent rate What boosted federal revenues most was the percentaverage growth in payroll taxes This was mainly the result of ratehikes not cutslegislated in the Social Security Reform act of            Corporate taxes also werecut substantially in  Corporatetax revenues took a nose dive in  and regained some ground with the economic recovery but then surgedfollowing passage of the  tax reformwhich deliberately raised taxes oncorporations to pay for tax breaks for individuals            Aconventional thinker might be forgiven for concluding from this record thatwhat raises revenues is raising taxes not cutting them            The campaign to convert Bob Dole and to prepare the publicfor his imminent conversion is resurrecting many goldenoldie rhetoricalpoints from circa  For example Abraham asserts that marginal tax ratesare what determine whether a worker works overtime or goes home for the day whether Americans save and invest their income or spend it No questiontaxes can affect behavior Reducing very high tax rates can at the very leastencourage less tax evasion and avoidance And restructuring taxes should atleast in theory encourage desirable types of economic behavior such as hardwork saving and investment            But cultural attitudesnot taxes or other government policies tend to swamp all other explanatoryvariables in international comparisons of savings and investment This isespecially so in the United States where tax rates are low by internationalstandards So how much do tax rates matter Not a whole lot if the Reaganeraexperience is any guide            Even by the supplysidersown calculations any offsetting behavioral response to the Reagan tax cuts wasswamped by the direct revenue loss to the Treasury For example at a Manhattan Institute meeting Lawrence B Lindsey a leading supplysideflagwaver in the Reagan Treasury Department now a governor of the FederalReserve whipped out a graph see abovebelow to show that tax revenues in were some  billion higher than would have been predicted by staticrevenue models used by the Congressional Budget Office during the  taxcutdebate Static is the supplysiders pejorative term for thinking thatdoesnt acknowledge sufficiently the explosive power of tax cuts What didntseem to attract Lindseys attention in his own graph was that actual revenueswere almost  billion lower in  than they would have been if the tax cut had not been passed NOTE JODIE HAS SUPPLIED this graph            As forpeople working harder because of lower tax rates the record of the s ismore complex than supplyside rhetoric predicted Studying the effects of stax policy Bosworth and his Brookings colleague Gary Burtless found that onlyone grouphighincome womensubstantially increased their hours of work inresponse to lower taxes The group whose work effort increased mostsharply was not the wellpaid whose tax rates declined most sharply It wasthe poorly paid whose marginal tax rates thanks to Social Security tax hikesactually went up For these workers higher taxes prompted harder work to makeup for the lost income            Even more damaging to the supplysiders case was thedisappointing performance of the nations savings behavior The Reagan programprovided numerous inducements not just marginal rate cuts on income butcapitalgains tax reductions a variety of new taxexempt investment vehiclesvast new opportunities for tax shelteringplus the Federal Reserves tightmoney policies which along with financial deregulation sent the interestrates available to savers soaring The more soberminded supplysiders figuredthat even if the tax cuts didnt pay for themselves the increased savings theygenerated would make the resulting deficits easy to finance Even todayFeldstein says he still believes that while its a tall order the right taxcuts can in some cases raise saving by more than they raise the budgetdeficit            But in the s savingsdid not cooperate The national savings rate which ran at close to  percentin the s and more than  percent in the s sank to only  percent inthe s The swelling government deficit which amounts to nationaldis saving did much to drag down the s figure But even privatesavings in the s ran well below their s level            Still more perverse wasthe behavior of business investment During the eight years of thebusinessfriendly Reagan administration businessequipment investment rose atan inflationadjusted annual rate of only  percent while corporatebeforetax profits grew at  percent By contrast during the presumablyhostile Clinton years business investment has grown at an annual real rate of percent while corporate pretax profits have climbed at a percentrate            Theoverall national economic growth rate has been about  percentage pointslower under Clinton than under Reagan But amusingly that difference istotally accounted for by the shrinking government While government spendinggrew by an average  percent annually under Reagan it hasshrunk at a percent rate under Clinton The way national economicgrowth is calculated the expansion of government under Reagan adds to hisgrowth total while the contraction of government under Clinton reduces hisgrowth total            In addition to supplyside arguments there are thetraditional demandside arguments that a tax cut stimulates the economy bypouring more money into it But this would be a very odd time for a demandsidetax cut As former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert Reischauernotes With unemployment well below the s average and considerably lowerlaborforce growth the economy seems to be operating near capacityor atleast the Federal Reserve thinks it is which is what counts Anydeficitincreasing tax cut would surely prompt the Fed to tighten the moneysupply curbing economic growth or even prompting a recession            Dole could as Abrahamcounsels offset part of the costs of a taxrate cut by dumping othertaxreform planssuch as the child tax credit once a key feature of the GOPsprofamily agenda What would the Christian Coalition think about that Orhe could propose to cut spending even more than his party has alreadypromisedbut that sounds like spinach and the GOP seems to have lost itsappetite for even the healthy serving it has promised to serve up over the nextseven years            Or of course Bob Dolecould resist temptation After all he really does know better
