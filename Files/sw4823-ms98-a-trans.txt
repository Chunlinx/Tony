        i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in       and uh im not sure were doing so with sufficient knowledge about the history of the area and um with what uh the people there expect i think were just getting ourselves into a barrel of trouble   yeah well i think we may have the knowledge knowledge of the history but certainly not any understanding of the history       uh       we seem to be you know doing the same weve done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesnt belong       and i think its you know motivated        you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region which is   oh clearly yes and um   of the you know used up in the next twenty to fifty years there wont any oil any oil left im sure   hum   well i feel that as far as US policys been concerned while i understand um a position in allied um friendship with Israel i think that weve applied a lot of double standards in the legion uh in the past as far as dealing with the Arabs versus dealing with the Israelis and the expectations that we put on the   um   uh Arab nations uh while basically succumbing to a very powerful Israeli lobby in this country   yeah   and i i think that the Palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region and i dont think that this countrys handled that well at all   yeah well  probably from there is that the same problem as anywhere else anytime you take something away from somebody and give it to somebody else   umhum   that you  didnt own in the first place theres you know going to be problems i mean thats basically whats happened i mean   yeah   basically a handful of nations took away from Palestinians what was their homeland and gave it to the Israelis you know to the Israelis       and you know its not the way to go about any kind of uh solution thats ever going to be workable you know i mean you neither party was consulted up front   yeah   yeah i kind of anticipate that because you know we set the stage and how weve dealt with that issue in such a poor manner by basically you know paying lip service to the Palestinians in the past   hum   uh i think thats up the stage for the end effect to for this uh uh revolution of Islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping definitely through North Africa and uh within parts of the Middle East as well something which terrifies the moderate Arab states   yeah   uh   well its pretty scary anybody if you think about i mean any any time you get fundamentalists you know whatever nature   yep   and in power anywhere i mean theyre theyre pure fanatics and theres that you know fundamentally no way to deal with a fanatic       and you cant argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis a fanatic will believe in X Y Z and youre never going to change that   yeah i i suspect yeah   you know so you might as well not even try   i suspect that well probably in uh with the demise of the Soviet Union formation of Russia whatever ends up coming out of that   umhum   that probably the biggest problems were going to have in foreign policy are going to have Middle East in the future i think that were going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area its been spawning for a long time the more moderate states uh even including Saudi Arabia which is a very religious country Islamic wise its not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control but uh i you know Tunisia and uh now we have problems with Sudan   umhum   and uh these places i think that you know were just in the beginning here of uh what will probably sweep through i mean Egypts suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now   yeah   the more nations that join with this kind of uh thinking in government the more stronger uh difficulty were going to have as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the Palestinians   yeah i think a lot of it is is just rejection of the current you know power structure and that power structure happens to be religiously aligned and aligned with uh you know a religious based monarchy in a lot of those countries       and that theyre basically rejecting that power structure in favor of another which is you know return to a fundamentalist thing i mean its not to unlike what happened in the United States       over the last ten years i mean basically people rejected you know theres  fundamentalist you know movement     yeah   wasnt quite as severe or as you know fanatically radical i mean because the uh the class structure is is you know less prolific here or less you know regionally defined here and uh the uh the differences arent so so strong as in say talking about like Saudi were youve got you know uh basically a ruling
