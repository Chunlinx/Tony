                    Background        Phorbol esters are often used as activators of protein        kinase C PKC to investigate the role of the kinase in        cellular functions     Pancreatic cells possess           and  PKC isotypes     and activation of PKC is        known to synergize with glucose stimulation in insulin        secretion       PKC via protein phosphorylation        seems to facilitate exocytosis of insulin granules              In glucosestimulated insulin secretion ATPsensitive        K channels K         ATP SUR Kir play a crucial role             ATP produced by the metabolism of glucose        inhibits K         ATP activity resulting in development        of depolarization responsible for opening of Ltype Ca        channels allowing Ca influx Elevation of        intracellular Ca Ca          i  accelerates exocytosis of insulin        granules The possibility that K         ATP activity is regulated by PKC has        long been studied In this respect however contradictory        results have been obtained For example in        insulinsecreting cell lines PKC was reported to        potentiate K         ATP activity      although        PKCdependent inhibition    or inhibition followed by        activation    has been also reported In primary        cells from the mouse activation of PKC by PMA did not        cause any change in membrane potential      although        in the same cell type PMA reduced the glucosestimulated        elevation of Ca          i depending on activation of PKC            On the other hand recent studies in myocytes suggest        that activation of PKC increases the opentime probability        of K         ATP SUR Kir by reducing the        sensitivity of K         ATP to ATP        Therefore        whether regulation of insulin secretion by PMA is mediated        through PKC or not is still obscure Recently we reported        that phorbol ester inhibited Ca influx through        PKCdependent and PKCindependent pathways     In the        present study we further evaluated the nonPKC mechanism        of PMA action on cell electrical excitation by using        patchclamp techniques The results indicate that in rat        pancreatic cells PMA modulates insulin secretion through        a mixed mechanism increases insulin secretion by        activation of PKC and meanwhile decrease insulin secretion        by impairing cell excitability in a PKCindependent        manner The enhancement of K         ATP activity by reducing sensitivity of        K         ATP to ATP seems to underlie the        PMAinduced impairment of cells electrical excitation in        response to glucose stimulation                    Results                  PMA inhibits electrical excitation of single rat          cells          With glucose at  mM in the extracellular solution          the membrane potential measured using the          nystatinperforation technique was stable             mV mean  SE n   Bathapplied  mM glucose          induced the action potential spikes superimposed on a          slow membrane depolarization Fig panel A When PMA           nM was applied to the cell during  mM glucose          stimulation both slow depolarization and action          potentials was abolished The effect of PMA was          reversible after removal of PMA Fig panel A This          inhibitory effect by PMA appeared to be independent of          PKC since addition of the PKC blocker BIM  M did not          prevent PMAinduced inhibition Fig panel B In two          experiments higher concentration  M of BIM failed          to prevent PMAinduced inhibition too data not shown          In the presence of  mM glucose  of tested cells           showed spontaneous action potentials superimposed          on a slow depolarizing potential and PMA  nM          inhibited these action potentials as well Fig panel          C                          PMA induces hyperpolarization of rat cells          In the presence of  mM glucose application of PMA           nM alone induced a slow reversible membrane          hyperpolarization Fig panel A The magnitude of the          hyperpolarization depended on the concentration of PMA          Fig panel C Pretreatment of cells with the PKC          inhibitor BIM  M for about  min did not prevent          PMAinduced hyperpolarization Fig panel B Figure          Csummarized that PMAinduced hyperpolarization was not          significantly different between BIMtreated and          BIMuntreated cells Fig panel C These results          indicate that PMAinduced hyperpolarization of pancreatic          cells is not mediated through PKC activation                          PMA increases K ATPactivity in cellattached single          channel recording          Since K           ATP plays a crucial role in          glucosestimulated insulin secretion PMAinduced          hyperpolarization could be mediated by changes in K           ATP activity To test this hypothesis          we examined the effect of PMA on single channel          activities of K           ATP  In the cellattached          configuration spontaneous single channel currents were          recorded at a pipette potential of  mV Fig  The          specific K           ATP blocker tolbutamide  mM          completely inhibited channel activity Fig           indicating that the recorded single channel currents are          passed through K           ATP channels Application of  nM PMA          to the bath solution significantly increased channel          activities Fig  Values of opentime probability for          K           ATP were    before          application of PMA and    during application of          PMA n   Mean  SEM P   This result          indicates that PMA indeed increases K           ATP activity                          PMA increases wholecell membrane current through K          ATP          In the wholecell configuration membrane currents in          response to repeatedly applied voltage ramp pulses from           to  mV were recorded Tolbutamide  mM          markedly reduced the size of the current and after          blockade of membrane current PMA failed to increase the          current Fig panel A suggesting that PMA increased          membrane currents through K           ATP  Application of PMA  nM          increased the magnitude of membrane current Fig panel          B and the magnitude of increased currents depended on          the concentrations of PMA Fig panel D In cells          treated with BIM  M PMA still increased membrane          current Fig panel C No significant differences were          observed between BIMuntreated and treated cells for          PMAinduced membrane current increase Fig panel D          suggesting that PMA increases K           ATP mediated currents in a          PKCindependent manner                          PDD mimics the effect of PMA on electrical          properties of rat cells          There are two ways to test the hypothesis that the          effect of PMA on electrical properties of rat cells is          independent of PKC activation One is to use specific PKC          blockers like BIM to examine whether the effect of PMA          can be prevented Fig    Another way is to employ          PMA analogs which do not stimulate PKC to see if they          can mimic the PMA effect PDD as a PKC          nonstimulating phorbol ester     provides a good          opportunity to test our hypothesis As shown in Fig          panel A PDD  M completely abolished action          potentials elicited by elevation of glucose concentration          from  to  mM just like the PMA effect in Fig          panel A In voltageclamp current recordings Fig          panel B PDD  M increased membrane current          evoked by ramp from  to  mV similar to the PMA          effect in figure panel B The similar results have also          been obtained by low concentration of PDD  nM n            for currentclamp data and n   for voltageclamp          data data not shown These results indicate that PDD          virtually mimics PMA effects and these data further          support the idea that the increase of K           ATP activity by PMA does not depend on          PKC activation                          Possible mechanism of PMA increases K          ATPactivity          How does PMA increase K           ATP activity Two possible          explanations might be addressed First PMA reduces the          sensitivity of K           ATP to ATP as reports using myocytes                 Second PMA may reduce ATP production To          assess the effects of PMA on K           ATP activity we performed two          experiments First using insideout recording          configuration spontaneous single channel activities were          more prominent when there was no ATP in bath solution          intracellular face and recorded currents were very          sensitive to bathapplied tolbutamide  mM Fig          panel A In the absence of ATP in the bath application          of PMA showed little effect on K           ATP activity Fig panel B Values          of the opentime probability for K           ATP were    n   without          and    n   with  nM PMA P   The          average single channel conductances were  pS without          and  pS with  nM PMA measured between  to  mV          Fig panel D Application of  M ATP to the bath          decreased the open probability of K           ATP  and under this condition PMA          restored K           ATP activity Fig panel C even in          the presence of  M BIM Fig panel E Values for ATP          concentration producing halfmaximal inhibition of K           ATP  taken from the          concentrationresponse relationships of ATP inhibition of          K           ATP activity were    M n            without and    M n   with  nM PMA P           Fig panel F Values of the Hill coefficient          were    without and    with PMA P            These results indicate that PMA increases K           ATP activity in the presence of          intracellular ATP which implies that PMA may reduce the          sensitivity of K           ATP to ATP Second the ATP content of          rat islets was measured during PMA treatment As shown in          Table  min loading of islets with extracellular          solution containing  nM PMA did not alter ATP content          of islets On the other hand loading cells with  mM          NaCN markedly reduced ATP content                          Effects of PMA on glucoseinduced insulin          secretion          The results presented such far indicate that PMA          decreases electrical excitation of cells and this          effect is independent on PKC activation According to          insulin secretion theory decrease of electrical          excitation of cells should reduce insulin secretion To          address this question we measured insulin secretion from          rat islets As shown in Fig  PMA  nM increase both          basal  mM glucose in the extracellular solution and          evoked  mM glucose in the extracellular solution          insulin secretion rates However as we expected in          BIMtreated islets PMA  nM decreased the rates of          insulin secretion Fig  These data indicate that PMA          regulates insulin secretion mediated by a mixed          mechanism a PKCdependent increase of insulin secretion          and a PKCindependent decrease of insulin secretion                            Discussion        Phorbol esters are often used as activators of PKC to        investigate the role of the kinase in cellular functions            Accumulating lines of evidence indicates that PMA        plays a complex role in regulation of cellular function        including PKCdependent      and PKCindependent        ways       In the present results PMA inhibited        slow membrane depolarization and action potentials in        response to glucose stimulation Fig  and caused a        membrane hyperpolarization in rat cells Fig  These        findings are consistent with the observation that        Otetradecanoylphorbol acetate lowers Ca          i at a stimulatory glucose concentration        in pancreatic islets from obesehyperglycaemic mice            Since PMA increased K         ATP activity Fig  it is obvious        that the hyperpolarization caused by PMA results from        activation of this channel type and PMA inhibition of        glucoseinduced electrical excitation of rat cells is        ascribable at least in part to hyperpolarization resulting        from an increase in K         ATP activity The activity of K         ATP can be regulated by changes in        intracellular concentration of ATP andor ATPADP ratio            In order to examine whether PMA decrease cell ATP        concentration we measured ATP content of rat islets and        results indicated that PMA did not change ATP levels in        islets Table  It is not clear at present whether ADP        concentrations are changed by the phorbol ester Under a        condition where ATP concentration in the cell was clamped        at a constant level PMA increased tolbutamidesensitive        currents in response to voltage ramps from  to  mV        Fig  Furthermore in insideout single channel        recordings PMA restored K         ATP activity which had been reduced by        the preceding application of ATP Figs panels C E        Together these findings support the idea that PMA        activation of K         ATP does not result from a change in ATP        concentration        In cardiac myocytes PMA is known to activate K         ATP through activation of PKC              In insulinsecreting cell lines as well PKC activation        by PMA was shown to potentiate K         ATP activity      In the present        study however the activation of K         ATP activity by PMA is independent on        activation of PKC for two reasons First the PKC        activation inhibitor BIM did not prevent either the        PMAinduced hyperpolarization Figs panels B  C or        augmentation of wholecell membrane currents Fig panels        C  D Second the nonPKCstimulating phorbol ester        PDD mimicked the effect of PMA Fig panel C        Pharmacological effects of PMA independent of activation        of PKC have been demonstrated in various tissues             Since the magnitude of hyperpolarization induced by PMA        Fig panel C and the effects of PMA on K         ATP activity Fig panel E were not        significantly different between cells treated or untreated        with BIM activation of PKC seems to show little effect on        K         ATP  at least in this cell type In        this regard the present findings support the idea derived        from previous findings on mouse    or        obesehyperglycaemic mouse cells     However        PMAinduced PKCindependent hyperpolarization of cells        was not previously reported      The reason for the        discrepancy is not clear at the moment The difference in        species rat in the present study and mouse in previous        studies could be one explanation In addition        hyperpolarization in response to PMA might be unnoticed        under some conditions with intracellular ATP at particular        concentrations because as shown in Fig panel F the        effect of PMA on K         ATP activity which produces        hyperpolarization varied as a function of intracellular        ATP concentration        There are two possible explanations for the        PKCindependent activation of K         ATP by phorbol esters  phorbol esters        may increase K         ATP activity in an intracellular        ATPindependent manner and  phorbol esters may reduce        sensitivity of K         ATP to ATP The first possibility can be        discounted because PMA does not affect K         ATP activity in the absence of ATP Fig        panel B On the other hand PMA restoration of K         ATP activity which had been reduced by        ATP Fig panels C E supports the conclusion that        phorbol esters decrease K         ATP sensitivity to ATP        In the present study application of PMA potentiated        insulin secretion from rat islets in response to elevation        of extracellular glucose concentration Fig  supporting        the hypothesis that activation of PKC synergizes secretory        process activated by the glucose stimulation              BIM is known to selectively inhibit  and  PKC isotypes            and rat pancreatic cells possess at least one PKC        isotype     In fact in this study the treatment of        islets with BIM reversed the PMA effect on insulin        secretion Fig  Therefore BIM can be used as a PKC        inhibitor in rat pancreatic cells as already shown in        other tissues including murine macrophages     rat        adrenal cortex     human melanocytes    and rabbit        vetricular myocytes            Recent reports with a truncated isoform of Kir have        revealed that an ATPinhibitory site lies on the Kir        subunit      In addition mutations of the        Cterminus of Kir showed that the amino acid sequence of        the Cterminus was responsible for regulation of ATP        sensitivity to K         ATP     It is not clear at present        whether phorbol ester effects reflection at the Cterminus        In addition other recent studies have shown that the        membrane phospholipid        phosohatidylinositolbisphosphate PIP           reduces sensitivity of K         ATP to ATP and therefore activates K         ATP       To our knowledge        this is the first report of regulation of K         ATP activity by phorbol ester in rat        cells The present findings provide new insight into        mechanisms of PMA regulation of insulin secretion by        PMA                    Conclusion        The major and important finding in this study is that        PMA impairs electrical excitation of rat pancreatic cells        through PKCindependent mechanism PMA increases K         ATP activity induces a membrane        hyperpolarization then reduces the electrical excitability        of pancreatic cells leading to a decrease of insulin        secretion Reduction of sensitivity of K         ATP to ATP seems to underlie the        PMAinduced impairment of cells electrical excitation in        response to glucose stimulation These results provide a        novel insight of modulation mechanism of insulin secretion        by PMA increases insulin secretion by activation of PKC        and meanwhile decrease insulin secretion by impairing        cell excitability in a PKCindependent manner in rat        pancreatic cells                    Materials and Methods                  Islet preparation and cell isolation          Isolation of rat islets was performed as previously          described      In short male adult rats Wistar          were anesthetized with

responses of the cells to  mM glucose or  mM          tolbutamide Sigma USA                          Patchclamp recordings          Cells were kept in a mm Petri dish and the dish          was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope IMT          Olympus Tokyo Japan Membrane potentials and membrane          currents were measured using a patchclamp amplifier          EPC List Electronic Darmstadt Germany The          nystatinperforation method    was used to measure          the membrane potential and the standard method was used          to measure wholecell currents     The resistance of          the electrode filled with the pipette solution ranged          from  to  M To measure the wholecell membrane          current voltage ramp pulses from  to  mV were          repeatedly applied using a ramp pulse generator          SET Nihon Kohden Tokyo Japan The membrane          capacitance ranged from  to  pF Series resistances          below  M were accepted Single

standard          extracellular solution After application of PMA at the          final concentration of  nM islet suspensions          containing  islets were transferred to reaction tubes          and the amount of emission was immediately measured using          a luminescence reader BLR Aloka Japan          Bioluminescence produced by the luciferinluciferase          reaction was amplified

      Measurement of insulin secretion          Isolated islets were handpicked under microscopy and          ten islets were distributed to each mm Petri dish with           ml of HBSS containing  mM
