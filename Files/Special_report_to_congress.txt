LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATIONSERVING THE CIVIL LEGAL NEEDS OF LOWINCOME AMERICANSA SPECIAL REPORT to CONGRESSAPRIL  I SummaryLegal Services Corporation LSC is a private nonmembershipnonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia The Board ofDirectors of LSC is composed of eleven voting members who areappointed by the President of the United States with the advice andconsent of the Senate By law the Board is bipartisan no morethan six members can be of the same political partyLSC plays a central role in providing lowincome Americans withaccess to legal assistance and information concerning criticalcivil legal problems Created in  LSC is charged by Congressto provide equal access to the system of justice in our Nation forindividuals who seek redress of grievances and to provide highquality legal assistance to those who would otherwise be unable toafford adequate legal counselFor  LSC grantees reported closing  million civillegal cases relating to issues such as domestic violence childcustody and visitation rights evictions access to health carebankruptcy unemployment and disability claims and many otherissues that millions of lowincome Americans face throughout theirlives Without the funding provided by LSC many of theseindividuals would have no other source of legal assistance forthese problemsII The National Legal Services ProgramLegal Services Corporation funds local legal services programsto serve clients in every state county and congressional districtin the United States as well as in Puerto Rico the Virgin IslandsGuam and Micronesia In addition special service areas are fundedfor two populations with special needs  Native Americans andmigrant workers Eligibility for services is determined on acasebycase basis pursuant to grantee eligibility criteriaestablished under parameters set forth in LSC regulations Eachgrantee establishes a maximum income eligibility level not toexceed  percent of the current official Federal Poverty IncomeGuidelinesIn  Congress implemented a number of new accountabilityrequirements including competitive bidding for Legal ServicesCorporation grants This system of competitive bidding eliminatedthe right of grantees to a hearing to contest a funding decisionawarding a grant to a competitor ensuring LSC can award grants tothe best applicants without unnecessary administrative barriersAdditionally new compliance monitoring procedures which useoutside auditors to monitor grantee compliance with regulations andto perform comprehensive yearly oversight of grantee activitieswere formulated Another new provision adopted in  prohibitsany local program that has been found to engage in a substantialviolation of the law or its grant conditions from being consideredfor an LSC grant in future competitionsAlso in  other new requirements were adopted governing whatlegal services programs can do and whom they can represent Thesenew guidelines have refocused the LSC delivery system on servingindividual clients with particular legal needs With the For a complete explanation of the number of cases closed for see Section V  Case Statisticsimplementation of these restrictions legal services attorneysare not permitted to initiate or participate in class actionlawsuits They may not challenge or engage in any activity toinfluence welfare reform They may not collect courtawardedattorneys fees Litigation on behalf of prisoners andrepresentation of undocumented and other categories of aliens isalso prohibited Other new requirements address redistrictingcases involving eviction from public housing of individuals chargedwith or convicted of drug violations and participation ingovernment rulemaking and solicitation Unlike past lawsrestricting the work of legal services these provisions apply toall the funds of a recipient with very few specifiedexceptionsAll local LSCfunded programs are administered by local boardsof directors or other governing bodies in certain instances amajority of whose members are appointed by local bar associationsand provide legal assistance to individuals pursuant to locallydetermined priorities that respond to community conditions andneeds Based on these priorities local programs hire staffcontact local attorneys and develop pro bono programs for thedirect delivery of legal assistance to eligible clients LSCrequires each legal services program to spend an amount equal to atleast  percent of its annualized grant to encourageparticipation by private attorneys in the provision of legalassistance to poor individualsThe legal services delivery system offers a model of efficientresolution of disputes and avoidance of unnecessary litigationOnly a very small percentage  in  of LSCfunded cases areresolved by the decision of a court and the majority of these arefamily law cases that require a court determinationRather than litigating cases legal services lawyersconsistently find other more efficient ways to solve problems fortheir clients Under tremendous pressure from the demand for theirservices they know they must use their limited resources wiselyAs in past years nearly threefourths of cases in  wereresolved through advice referral or brief services III The Case Statistics IssueLSC acknowledges that serious questions have been raisedconcerning the accuracy and validity of the Case Service ReportCSR data submitted annually by our grantees LSC is aware thatproblems exist in the statistical reports received and is takingsteps to identify and correct those problems The problemsidentified stem in part from a lack of clarity in some of LSCspast case reporting guidelines and more generally frominsufficient attention by grantees to the existing reporting anddocumentation requirementsIt should be kept in mind that the issue is largely one ofgrantee compliance with technical and administrative guidance onhow and when to report certain activities In no instance has LSCits Inspector General or the General Accounting Office identifiedany fraud or intentional misrepresentation by any of the granteesin their compilation and reporting of this data LSC willaggressively take steps to correct problems associated with the CSRsystem and will continue to make full and timely reports to theUS Congress and the public LSC views the issues concerning theCSR data to be akin to those encountered by many governmententities as they attempt to meet the goals envisioned by theGovernment Performance and Results Act GPRASelfinitiated Review of CSR DataLSCs review of its CSR data was an outgrowth of its ongoingoversight responsibilities and it has become integral to itsvoluntary strategic planning process Although not subject to theGovernment Performance and Results Act LSC shares the aspirationsof that law to rationalize the budget and appropriations processesby tying funding into objective measures of the agencysperformanceIn November  the LSC Board adopted its first Strategic Planfor FY  The strategic directions adopted by the Boardwill achieve LSCs vision by accomplishing two major strategicgoals  By  LSC will dramatically increase the provision oflegal services to eligible persons  By  LSC will ensurethat eligible clients are receiving appropriate and high qualitylegal assistance That plan is currently being revised  as arethe The conferees have concerns about the case service reportingand associated data reports submitted annually by the Corporationsgrantees and the case statistical reports submitted by theCorporation to the Congress and the conferees direct theCorporation to make improvement of the accuracy of thesesubmissions a top priority per directions in the House report Theconferees also direct the Corporation to submit its  annualcase service reports and associated data reports to Congress nolater than April   Departments of Commerce Justice andState the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of Pub L No   Stat  Twentyfive years ago our government made a pledge to helpensure that all persons have access to Americas civil justicesystem by enacting legislation that created Legal ServicesCorporation Over the past quarter century LSC has helped millionsof lowincome citizens solve important sometimes lifethreateninglegal problems Despite the success of LSC and its manycontributions to access to justice for lowincome Americans itsachievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in oursociety continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain accessto a lawyer for critical legal assistance Until all members of oursociety are afforded that access this promise of our governmentwill continue to be unfulfilled LSC is committed to promoting anew vision of legal services that will achieve the goal of bringinglegal services to those currently denied access to the justicesysteminitial plans submitted by many governmental entities Asrecently reported by GAO most federal agencies are far frommeeting the goals set by GPRA for performance data on which theAdministration and Congress can rely on in setting budget amountsand appropriations levelsNonetheless LSC having embarked on the path laid out by GPRArecognizes the need to assess the data currently available ongrantee activity for its accuracy and adequacy as a measure ofLSCs performance When the first Strategic Plan was published andadopted clients served as a performance measure the LSC InspectorGeneral decided there was a need to determine the accuracy of thegrantees reports on which the measure was based A series ofaudits of  data was conducted in  in anticipation of thefirst performance report due in  These audits examined theaccuracy of case statistical reports submitted by six grantees andthe causes of identified deficiencies rather than validating ortesting the accuracy of national or systemwide dataInitial FindingsWhat LSC found when it began the assessment of the CSR systemwas a yearold reporting structure the guidance for which hadnot been updated since  The reporting system rested on thedefinition of a case However clear and meaningful the definitionof a case may have been in the past it became evident thedefinition had not kept pace with the changes in the servicedelivery systems As the pace of the evolution of service deliverysystems and the reconfiguration of grantees accelerated followingthe funding cutbacks and program reforms in  and spurred on bythe technological revolution the reporting of grantee activitysolely on the basis of cases was becoming increasinglyinadequate This resulted in inconsistent and inaccurate reportingCritical legal services were now being provided inter aliathrough Internet web sites through tollfree telephone intake andbrief advice systems through pro se clinics and projects andthrough standalone kiosks An attorney representing a clientbefore judge and jury was no longer the norm of a case whendelivering critical legal services to lowincome individualsThe audits conducted by the General Accounting Office GAO andreported in June  confirmed the Inspector Generals findingsas to the factors causing systemic errors in grantee casereporting  The GAO visited five large programs Puerto Rico LegalServices Inc Legal Services for New York City Legal AidFoundation of Los Angeles Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicagoand Legal Aid Bureau Inc in Baltimore Maryland Overall the GAOdeemed questionable approximately  percent of both open andclosed cases reported by the five grantees in  The percentageof questionable cases for individual programs ranged from  percentto  percent A problem common to all programs was the untimelyclosure of cases although again the extent of the problem in anyparticular program varied from under  percent in one program toover  percent in another Overall the GAO questioned between percent of the cases reported because of the lack of adequatefinancial eligibility documentation and between  percent of thecases for lack of citizenship or alien status documentation Itshould GAOGGDR LSC Case Reporting Problemsbe noted that GAO concluded only that the case files failed tocontain the documentation necessary to confirm the eligibility orineligibility of any of these clientsLSCs Corrective ActionAs these concerns surfaced LSC decided as an initial step toreissue the  CSR Handbook in May  providing additionalguidance on particular areas that were considered to be most proneto error In general clearer guidance was provided to programs onreviewing their own reporting procedures and practices ensuringthey conformed to the Handbook and ensuring all branch offices wereaware of and were following these procedures LSC reiteratedguidance on not reporting financially or otherwise ineligibleclients referrals of ineligible cases or cases for which no legalwork was performed Recognizing this guidance would not affect the CSR data which had already been submitted by the granteesbut wanting to improve the accuracy of future CSR data LSC soughtto heighten the awareness of grantees to the CSR requirements andto focus their attention on potential problem areas As previouslyreported to Congress though a number of grantees did voluntarilysubmit corrections to their  CSR data during As the audit information became available during  and into LSC gained a fuller understanding of the extent of the CSRproblem and its complexities Even though quantifiable data waslacking during most of  LSC had sufficient information tobegin taking actions to address the problems As previously notedLSC reissued its CSR instructions to all grantees callingattention to problem areas known at that time Recognizing thatmore action was needed to improve the CSR system LSC providedadditional written guidance to the field including a substantialrevision to its CSR Handbook reissued in November  andconducted training sessions on that guidance In addition LSC hasrequired all grantees to perform a selfinspection of their CSRdata has followed up on grantees where corrective action was foundnecessary and has increased its onsite presence to test granteecompliance IV What Is A CaseA case is defined as the provision of permissible legalassistance to an eligible client with a legal problem or set ofclosely related legal problems accepted for assistance supportedby LSC or nonLSC funds in accordance with the requirements of theLSC Act regulations and other applicable law  The FY budget request includes  million in additionalfunds to provide  annual specialized onsite compliance reviewsThese onsite reviews will allow LSC management to identify programweaknesses engage in effective Corrective Actions Plans oversightand provide programspecific needed guidance and oversight Thereviews will allow LSC to more effectively execute its compliancefunction and ensure the accuracy of CSR reporting by itsgrantees Legal Services programs may record and report the provision oflegal assistance as a case only if a the client is financiallyand otherwise eligible to receive assistance under the LSC Actregulations and other applicable law the clients case is withinprogram priorities or is an emergency case accepted under theprograms emergency case acceptance procedures the legal servicesprogram has actually accepted the client for service through itsintake system or another established procedure for ensuring clienteligibility b the type of legal assistance provided to theclient is not prohibited by the LSC Act regulations or otherapplicable law eg a class action c the legalSince  LSC has significantly tightened its requirements forwhat constitutes a case A case that is eligible to be counted assuch must include some actual counsel and advice or other legalassistance provided to the client Thus analysis and referral of acase to another legal services provider cannot be counted nor canservice where the client is accepted and work is done but theclient withdraws or loses contact with the program before anyactual legal assistance is providedPrograms have been required to screen their submissions forduplicates A duplicate is not merely the submission of exactlythe same case twice by computer or other error but also anysituation in which the same client returns to the program with thesame legal problem in the same year The test as to how similar theissue in two separate requests for assistance has to be before itis counted as one case has presented significant borderlineproblems but there have been a large number of clear duplicateseliminated from the case reportsIt has also been clarified that if a case fails to meet anyrequired documentation financial eligibility citizenshipeligiblealien status within program priorities etc it may not bereported to LSC as a case Especially for  LSC hassubstantially strengthened the documentation requirements forreporting a case to LSC As a result numerous cases have beenexcluded from reporting even though the client received legalservice because the case was not documented according to LSCrequirements For many of these cases it was overwhelmingly likelythat the client and the service would have been eligible to becounted as a closed case but for the lack of properdocumentationPrograms however are allowed to count closed cases for theelderly and for battered women under the following specificprograms without financial eligibility information because theseFederal programs require that clients be accepted regardless offinancial circumstances Title XX Social Security Act Titles IIIand IV Older Americans Act and Violence Against Women ActV  Case StatisticsFor  LSC grantees reported closing  civil legalcases relating to issues such as domestic violence child custodyand visitation rights evictions access to health carebankruptcy unemployment and disability claims and many otherissues faced by millions of lowincome Americans The consequencesof such problems may be as serious as the loss of a familys onlysource of income or homelessness Left unresolved they can costsociety far more than the expense of providing legal services toaddress them Other case types frequently encountered includeforeclosures collections and repossessions child support andwage claims Without the federal funding provided by LSC to locallegal services programs many andproblems of a client are not of a type prohibited by the LSCAct regulations or other applicable law eg an abortioncase In  it is estimated that LSC grantees receivedapproximately  million in federal funds under the ViolenceAgainst Women Act VAWA for use in rendering assistance indomestic violence cases It is estimated that in the year  theywill receive approximately  million in VAWA fundingConsumerpossibly most of these individuals with these problems wouldhave no other source of legal assistanceDespite LSCs significant efforts to improve the data accuracythere may be occurrences of errors in documentation or substance inthis number In January of this year LSC instructed all programsto conduct a SelfInspection of a sample of closed cases prior tosubmitting  CSR data to LSC The purpose of the SelfInspectionprocess was to provide programs a means to verify by reviewing asample of cases that their  CSR data satisfies LSCs standardsfor accuracy In addition it provides LSC management usefulinsight into the current nature and extent of the CSR dataissueAlthough the SelfInspection was not constructed or executedto yield a statistically valid assessment of the accuracy of theclosed cases for  the SelfInspection did reveal LSCbelieves significant improvements in data accuracy from previousyears Again stressing this process did not produce an extensiveassessment LSC management submits that it is sufficient toreasonably estimate the population of reported cases contains anerror rate of  percentIn order to fulfill our pledge to the US Congress and to thegeneral public concerning our commitment to providing the mostaccurate and reliable data we adjusted the number of casesreported by LSC grantees  by the average estimated errorrate  Accordingly we submit a total of cases closed for of  For reasons that will be discussed in subsequentsections of this report we also highlight that this figurerepresents only a portion of the work conducted by LSC granteesNonetheless it represents the most reliable albeit conservative estimate of cases closed in  by LSC grantees The adjusted total of  is conservative because asome grantees did use SelfInspection data to excludeLeveraging Federal ResourcesFederal funding to Legal Services Corporation provides thenational infrastructure for theUS civil legal services delivery system But for the federalinvestment the overwhelming majority of cases reported by LSCgrantees would not have been possible In six states the federalinvestment represents almost the entire contribution for providingcivil legal services to lowincome individuals In another sixteenstates LSC funding represents over  of the total investment inthe civil legal services systemBeginning with  cases another significant change is therequirement for programs to report all cases eligible for LSCservices regardless of the funding source The prior rule mandatedthat each case had to be at least partially funded by LSC funds aswell as being LSCeligible This new change is intended to make casereporting more consistent among grantee programs as these programshave varying mixes of LSC and nonLSC funding and varyinglegitimate methods of allocating LSC and nonLSC funding amongtheir activities that produce case closuresAs noted above the LSC case count for  includes all casesthat meet LSC eligibility criteria regardless of the funding mixof any particular grantee LSC strongly encourages all its granteesto obtain other funding for the client community that Congress haslegislated is eligible for LSC funding The ability to leverageother funds to represent LSC eligible clients is a factor LSCconsiders in evaluating its grantees LSC believes that the totalnumber of LSC eligible clients served by LSC grantees is ofconsiderable relevanceIt has been suggested that this change may cause an artificialincrease in the number of cases reported through the CSR systemThe purpose of the change however was to achieve better accuracyand more consistency in the reporting of work made possible by LSCfunding Our grantees have successfully leveraged their federalfunding by attracting other private and public sources of fundingGrantees use their mix of funding in a variety of ways The formerCSR system did not consistently collect and identify much of thiseffort on behalf of eligible clients In fact because of thisinconsistency in reporting the old system often producedartificial variations in reported case statistics among similarprograms The revised reporting requirement will greatly enhancethe accuracy of the data on services to the eligible US lowincomepopulation and will produce more complete data on the work ofgrantees that can be reasonably attributable to LSC granteesfrom their submission to LSC approximately  of theinsufficiently supported cases that made up the  percent errorrate and b in the process of requiring more rigorousdocumentation of cases some cases that actually had sufficientdocumentation and many cases where the client was almost certainlyeligible were excluded resulting in a countervailingundercount Statewide civil legal services percentages of total

the public more reliableand accurate statistics on closed cases LSC is committed todeveloping and to implementing by January   a new reportingsystem to document and assess the work of LSC grantees LSC hascontracted with an independent research firm to develop andimplement a pilot project at six LSC grantees that will gather thenecessary information needed to create a reporting system thatcaptures all the work of LSC grantees not simply the traditionalclosed cases This reporting system will detail and describe thedelivery of services that are not cases services such as communityeducation information through Internet web sites selfhelp formsand kiosks The reporting system may also provide information onthe impact to the community and to the client by describingnoncase services in the following manner the type of innovative service provided  the number ofeligible clients receiving the service  the nature of the legalproblems addressed through the innovative service and  the impactof the innovative service on the legal problemsLSC also will develop systems for measuring the outcomes orbenefits of the assistance that the programs provide to eligibleclients Outcome measurement may include an assessment of the monetary impact of employment and benefits cases  theeffect on quality of life of health and housing cases  the impacton minor children of assistance in family cases and  thefinancial stability afforded in consumerfinance casesIn addition to establishing a more complete reporting systemLSC is committed to using economic analysis and performancemeasures to evaluate the impact of federal funding and individualgrantee performance Discussed below are two methods of analysiscurrently under review to accomplish these goals While LSC willimplement these performance measures on January   it willdiligently evaluate the chosen method of analysis prior toimplementation to ensure it provides useful and meaningful data By LSC will require grantees to provide information that allowsLSC to comparatively analyze the cost per case among similarlysituated programs and similar types of services ie brief adviceand referral LSC statistics for CY  will reflect the input ofall these performance measuresThe Cost per Case Model The first methodology LSC isdeveloping and evaluating to assess the work of grantees is acostpercase analysis Cost per case is a rough quantitativeoutput measure of the efficiency of LSC programs delivery of caseservices to eligible clients In the past it has been computed bydividing a programs annual LSC funding by its annual total casesclosed The calculation uses all of a programs LSC funding eventhough LSC programs provide services to eligible clients that donot meet the definition of a closed case as previously detailedWhile a costpercase analysis is limited in that it onlyaddresses quantity and not quality of services it does providesome useful quantitative information The raw cost per case figurecan be further analyzed to take into account the level of servicefrom brief advice and counsel up to a court caseCurrently LSC uses a costpercase analysis when it conductsonsite evaluations of grantees By comparing the cost per caseof a particular grantee over a period of time LSC may gain usefulinformation on the workload and performance of a program from yearto year LSC also uses a costpercase analysis to comparesimilarly situated grantees This measure does require LSC staff tounderstand how services differ from grantee to grantee so that thedifferences in levels of service can be adjusted to arrive atmeaningful costpercase figuresFor example grantee A receives  in LSC funds and serves clients at a costpercase ratio of  The majority ofthese cases involve the provision of advice and brief servicetraditionally not very timeconsuming or labor intensive Grantee Balso receives  in LSC funds but only serves  clients ata costper case ratio of  However grantee B primarily handlesclients facing domestic violence eviction from their residencesor issues involving access to health care Grantee Bs casesusually involve protracted negotiation or litigation Given thedifferences in the types of cases handled by these two grantees asimple costpercase analysis without further definition wouldyield meaningless data in terms of the comparative value ofservices provide by these two programsAnother caution that must be raised with this particularapproach is that all LSCfunded programs engage in a wide range ofvery important activities that do not fall within the definition ofcase which would thus not be included in valuing the programsservices LSCfunded programs use many means newsletterspamphlets speaking engagements and web sites to provide legalinformation to lowincome persons helping them avoid legalproblems or aiding them in learning to handle problems when theysurface Where appropriate LSC grantees refer lowincome personsto organizations that can help the clients with their problems either to alternate sources of legal assistance or to other sourcesof assistance such as charitable organizations and social servicesagencies Through the provision of legal information programs alsoassist individuals in preparing to represent themselves in courtResources expended in supporting efforts such as community legaleducation outreach state planning and resource development alsowould not be factored into the programs costpercaseLSC is carefully studying how to refine the costpercaseanalysis in order to use it effectively as a management toolToward this end LSC has recently initiated activities to developmore appropriate strategies and mechanisms to gather and toquantify data on all of the work  cases and matters regardlessof funding source  being performed by its granteesThe Cases Funded Exclusively with LSC Resources Model Thesecond methodology LSC is developing is a model to estimate thenumber of cases funded exclusively with LSC funds To arrive atthis estimate total cases reported by LSC grantees would beaugmented with an estimate of all cases handled by LSCfundedorganizations These are cases traditionally not reported to LSC either because documentation LSC requires is not present in thesecases or because they are expressly handled with funding thatallows financial eligibility standards that are more lax than LSCstandards This number would then be added to the total reported toLSC to produce a total caseload number and then reduced by thenational rate of funding of LSC programs by other sourcesThis process would yield an estimate for cases that are fundedexclusively with LSC resources In using such a number howeverseveral factors need to be kept in mindThis figure would only be an estimate We do not compilean actual count of the number of cases that are not within LSCsdefinition of a caseThe reportable and not reportable cases on average donot take the same amount of time Other funding sources may befunding a different mix of cases that may on average take more orless time than the average case for LSCeligibleclientsLSC will receive additional information on the ability ofgrantees to leverage federal dollars using an estimate of casesfunded exclusively with federal resources through thismethodology although it is a less than perfect method of analysisLSC routinely evaluates its grantees on their ability to leverageadditional dollars from alternative sources to expand their abilityto provide critical legal services to lowincome persons Forexample as noted above grantees often seek alternative funding toexpand services to women and children in potentially abusivesituations Further under its state planning initiative thatmandates all grantees within a particular state work together tocreate a comprehensive and integrated statewide delivery systemgrantees are required to address how they will work together toexpand the resources available within that state to support legalservicesVI The Need for Legal ServicesThe need for legal services is overwhelming Although we live ina time of great economic prosperity there are currently still million Americans living in households with an income below thepoverty level Some  million additional individuals withincomes between  and  percent of the poverty level are alsopotentially eligible for legal services This means that almost oneout of every five Americans is eligible for legal servicesassistance Americas children are particularly affected bypoverty Even though the poverty rate has slightly declined percent of children are still poor In order to ensure theseAmericans are not left out of the justice system a strong federalrole in supporting legal services is vitalA  study for the American Bar Association concluded thatapproximately  percent of poor Americans do not have theadvantage of an attorney when they are faced with serious situationwhere a lawyers advice and assistance would make a differenceSimilar conclusions have been reached by state legal needs studiesin a dozen states including Florida Georgia Hawaii IllinoisIndiana Kentucky Maryland Massachusetts Missouri Nevada NewYork and Virginia using a variety of methodologies for estimatingthe unmet legal needs of the poor US Census Bureau Poverty in the United States httpwwwcensusgovprodpubsppdf Center for Budget and Policy Priorities Analysis of Poverty and Income Data September Estimated Unmet Legal NeedEligible Clients unable to attain needed legal assistanceEligible Clients served by LSC Programs Because of limited resources local legal services programs areforced to turn away tens of thousands of people with critical legalproblems A survey of selected programs in the spring of  whenLSC funding was substantially higher than it is today revealedthat nearly half of all people who applied for assistance fromlocal programs were turned away because of a lack of programresources Most programs are forced to limit the cases they acceptto emergencies or other situations that threaten the safety andstability of the family or individual involved Recent studiesestimate that between one and four million American womenexperience an assault by an intimate partner each year and million children are exposed to violence by family members againsttheir mothers or female caretakers Client DemographicsLegal services clients are as diverse as our nationencompassing all races ethnic groups and ages They include theworking poor veterans family farmers people with disabilitiesand victims of natural disasters Many were formerly middle classand became poor because of age unemployment illness or thebreakup of a familyIn  as in the past nearly threefourths of LSC clientswere women most of them mothers with children Although the namedclient is usually an adult most LSC cases also involve and benefitchildren The legal problems faced by people living in poverty canresult in particularly serious longterm consequences forchildren According to an August  Bureau of Justice StatisticsSpecial Report Violence Against Women Estimates from theRedesigned Survey NCJ and a report by the AmericanPsychological Association Violence and the Family Report of theAmerican Psychological Association Presidential Task Force onViolence and the FamilyElderly people often require legal assistance because of theirspecial health income and social needs especially in coping withthe government administered benefits on which many depend forincome and health careEthnicityWhite  Not of Hispanic Origin Black  Not of Hispanic Origin AgeUnder   Over GenderVII ConclusionEstablished by Congress in  LSC plays a central role inproviding lowincome Americans with access to legal assistance andinformation critical to resolving their civil legal problems In for example LSC grantees reported closing  civillegal cases relating to issues such as domestic violence childcustody and visitation rights evictions access to health carebankruptcy unemployment and disability claims and many otherissues faced by millions of lowincome Americans Despite LSCssignificant efforts to improve data accuracy there may beoccurrences of errors in documentation or substanceIn order to fulfill our pledge to the US Congress and to thegeneral public concerning our commitment to providing the mostaccurate and reliable data we adjusted the number of casesreported by LSC grantees  by the average estimated errorrate  Accordingly we submit a total of cases closed for of  This number represents the most reliable albeitconservative estimate of cases closed in  by LSC granteesRecognizing that valid questions have been raised regarding theaccuracy and validity of the Case Service Reports CSR data thatLSCs grantees annually submit LSC has committed itself toensuring that reliable data is provided The decrease in thenumber of closed cases for  is in large measure the result ofLSCs new more stringent reporting guidelines For example it hasbeen clarified that if a case file fails to contain any requireddocumentation The Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law held anoversight hearing on Legal Services Corporation September  The hearing heightened awareness of some of the problems LSC wasencountering in attempting to provide accurate statistics relatingto services provided by LSC grantees Subcommittee Chairman RepGekas and Rep Chabot informed LSC of their expectation that thestatistics provided by LSC to Congress concerning their granteesactivities be accurate For example Mr Chabot stated Congresscertainly does look at the statistics that we are provided and weexpect those statistics to be accurate when we are determining whatprograms are going to be funded and at what levels so we expectthose numbers to be accurate and when theyre not it disturbs us agreat deal as it should Legal Services Corporation Oversighthearing before the Subcomm on Commercial and Admin Law of theHouse Comm on the Judiciary th Cong st Sess financial eligibility citizenshipeligible alien statuswithin program priorities etc it may not be reported to LSC as acase As a result numerous cases have been excluded fromreporting even though the client received legal service becausethe case lacked the required documentationUnfortunately the civil legal needs of all lowincome Americansare not being adequately met due to severe funding shortages at thefederal and state level In FY Congress appropriated million for grants to local legal services programs Assuminginflation remains at current rates through  almost million is required in FY to maintain the purchasing power andservices of the FY level Unless the federal investment forcivil legal services is substantially increased a large segment ofthe US population will continue to be without access to thejustice system LSCs Budget Request for FY includes a modestincrease of  million for grants to local programsLSC is committed to continuing to improve the accuracy of itscase statistics vigorously enforcing the Congressionalrestrictions enacted in  and creating new and more meaningfulways to evaluate the work of legal services programs receivingfederal funds We call on Congress the private bar and local andstate governments to support LSC in fulfilling its Congressionalmandate to provide lowincome individuals throughout America withreal meaningful access to our nations justice system
