        well uh down here in weve got um       trials by uh jury in criminal cases and the sentencing can be done by the jury normally although the judge can sometimes do it how do yall do it up there   um we usually do it uh the jury comes to the verdict and then the judge does the sentencing um i think the jury can recommend something but in  you know in some cases like uh murder in the first degree but i the ultimate decision is the is the decision of the judge once the verdict has been reached the jurys dismissed and theres a separate hearing for sentencing   weve got a lot of these uh in federal court they have a uniform sentencing guidelines that pretty well leave it up to the uh judge to assess the punishment in a certain range   umhum well i think its curious that  the sentences that are handed down are usually not served i think thats a big problem with the criminal justice system but   right here in the Dallas area if you are sentenced to ten years or less to incarceration in in the uh penitentiary you will never make it to the penitentiary and youll serve about a year in the county jail and then be released because of the jail overcrowding   yeah well i i understand the jail overcrowding issue but i i think in in in that case as as as in so many all they ever do is discuss the problems and they never do anything to solve them i think thats why this countrys in the shape its in now but i i dont really believe that a jury should do the sentencing i think   well the judge has a better idea of what is probable ranges for that particular type of offense where a jury is just doing it for one time   yeah i just dont believe that jurors have the the knowledge the scope and the knowledge  to to handle the sentencing whereas the judge does   well you know in in civil cases they can have uh as few as ten of the jurors agree on a verdict but criminal normally requires unanimous they might make a change on that and that might make for fewer mistrials   thats thats certainly true i just i i mean i dont agree with juries doing the sentencing but i do agree with trial  trial by jury i just think thats critical   course in civil cases trial by jury doesnt necessarily work if you have a big complex uh business type case where a jury could get totally lost in a lot of those cases people decide to just try the case before a judge and just not have a jury   right well i think that can that makes sense too because it looks like it would be awfully hard to pick jurors that could follow something as in in a civil case i mean that was really complicated and had a lot of technical issues in it but they  there are a lot of criminal cases a lot of murder cases and that  that are really very complicated and they seem to be able to get through those   and you had up there North Carolina that case of that lady who poisoning her various husbands what was it Blanchard or   Blanche Taylor Moore   Blanche yes   yeah   weve weve been reading about that   yeah we uh have you have you heard about  trial that weve got going on now with the uh the man thats accused of molesting twenty three children at a day care center   no i dont remember reading about that   well thats the uh thats probably one of the biggest child malestation cases in the in the nations history this man and his wife it its a trial by jury but its really going real ragged i dont understand how theyre doing it and they got they he had a hundred and seventy eight charges against him and his attorneys managed to get it reduced to ninety three but the jury in that case theyve just absolutely sequestered them nobody even unless you were paying attention at the very beginning you dont even know their names and they uh uh from what ive been reading in the paper they are the ones who are gonna do the sentencing in that   weve got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic now and the jury the case went to the jury today and the jurys deliberating right now   arsenic is uh this this Blanche Taylor Moore woman was very clever she did it very slowly over a large period a long period of time at least it was it was done very slowly over a large period of time and since the jury has found her guilty now the judge did the sentencing in that and shes appealing but im assuming that shes guilty because i really believe in the jury system   well the collective wisdom of the jury usually prevails   yeah hopefully theyre smart enough not to be hoodwinked by illegal ploys by lawyers and prosecutors
