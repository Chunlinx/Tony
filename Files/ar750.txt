                    Introduction        The association between smoking and rheumatoid arthritis        RA has been widely reported                               and was recently reviewed            The specific association between smoking and rheumatoid        factor RFpositive RA is well known and meets the        Bradford Hill criteria for causation     namely        strength consistency plausibility experimental evidence        coherence temporality and biologic gradient of        association                 The term interaction refers to a conditional        relationship between an independent variable and the        dependent variable An interaction exists when the        relationship between an independent variable         x and an outcome variable         y varies according to the value of        another covariate         z  The presence of a statistically        significant interaction would suggest the presence of an        underlying biologic effect modification and provide        epidemiologic clues to the etiology and pathogenesis                   Among women hormonal risk factors for RA include age at        menarche progestin use     oral contraceptive use            termination of pregnancy     lactation            and short fertile period     Epidemiologic studies do        not consistently show that smoking confers an increased        risk among women Indeed even a protective effect of        smoking on risk for developing RA has been described among        women     The smokingRA risk is more consistent        across studies on men Thus the risk for RA conferred by        smoking depends on the sex of the patient If reports of        this interaction effect were confirmed     then this        would suggest the presence of an underlying sexspecific        factor that modifies the association between smoking and        RA Therefore we conducted a populationbased casecontrol        study including  patients with RA identified in the        Central Finland RA Database and  control individuals        living in the same district                    Patients and method                  Cases and controls          Cases were patients drawn from the Central Finland RA          Database located at the Jyvskyl Central Hospital          which is the only rheumatology center in the Central          District of Finland population   in  All          patients were diagnosed to have RA by their physician          The Central Finland RA Database includes demographic          measures treatments and outcomes of all patients with          RA seen in the clinic since January  As of June           the database contained information on  RA          patients  of whom were still alive The control          group was a random sample drawn from the general          population To obtain a population sample the names and          addresses of  people living in the Central District          of Finland were obtained from the organization Statistics          of Finland with the permission from the Ministry of          Social Affairs and Health Finland Statistics of          Finland obtains the majority of its data from diverse          administrative registers and produces twothirds of all          Government statistics in Finland httpwwwstatfi The          Ethics Committee of Jyvskyl Central Hospital approved          the study                          Data collection          A questionnaire was mailed to  candidate patients          with RA and to  candidate control individuals in June           A reminder letter was sent  weeks later to          nonresponders The response rate for questionnaires          among candidate patients was             n   and that among candidate          control individuals was   Functional status in          activities of daily living was measured using the Finnish          version of the Health Assessment Questionnaire score          range      Pain and global status were assessed          on a mm visualanalog scale range  from best to          worst Data on date of birth height and weight sex          years of education and current and previous smoking          habits neverever were collected In addition clinical          features of patients were obtained from the database          Seropositivity for RF IgM was defined according to          laboratory references  kUl One of us TS          assessed radiographs of hands and feet according to the          Larsen method and the presence or absence of radiologic          erosions was recorded as a dichotomous variable                          Statistical analysis          Data were analyzed in two stages The initial stage          was to test the hypothesis that there is a primary          interaction between sex and smoking This was performed          by including a pairwise product term ie smokingsex          in addition to the individual variables in a logistic          regression model in which the dependent variable was case          versus control status The           P value calculated for the          interaction term in the logistic regression model was          used to determine statistical significance If this          showed the presence of a statistically significant          interaction then a second stage of analyses was          performed In the second stage parallel casecontrol          analyses were performed for men and women using          multivariable logistic regression The independent          variables in these models were age education body mass          index Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index          selfreports of pain and overall health assessments as          well as a smoking variable The last five covariates were          included in the model because these can potentially          confound the smokingRA relationship Separate regression          analyses were performed to assess the effect of both the          smoking variables current smoking and past smoking on          the risk for RA Forward or backward stepwise selections          were not used and all clinically important covariates          were included in the multivariable models We performed          Students           t test to compare differences in          mean values and Pearsons  test to compare differences          in proportions Analyses were performed using STATA          Version  software Stata Corporation College          Station TX USA                            Results        The mean age of the patients was  years range         years

      and  had erosions in their hand or feet radiographs        There were no statistically significant differences in the        proportion of seropositivity for RF  versus          P   frequency of

any        RA was the dependent variable of interest sex exhibited a        statistically significant interaction with currentpast        smoking all         P   Among women there was        significant interaction between age and past smoking          P   but not with current        smoking          P   Among men there were no        statistically significant interactions between age and        current smoking          P   and age and past smoking          P   Subsequent analyses were        performed separately for men and women        Table shows comparisons between patients and control        individuals by sex Among both sexes patients were older        less well educated more disabled and reported poorer        general health and increased functional disability and pain        in comparison with control individuals Female patients        were less likely to report past or current smoking than        were female control individuals Among men there was no        statistically significant difference in the proportion of        current smokers between patients and control individuals        but patients were more likely to have smoked in the past        than were control individuals Table         In the multivariable models we adjusted for age body        mass index level of education and indices of functional        disability pain and general health Parallel analyses        looking at the effect of smoking on the risk of RA were        performed in subgroups of patients defined by presence or        absence of RF as well as all patients with RA Tables and                Multivariable analyses for women Table  showed that        there was no significant association between current or        past smoking and RFpositive or RFnegative RA Although        not statistically significant the magnitude of risk was        consistently less than  in both RFpositive and        RFnegative patients with RA        For men Table  past smoking was consistently        associated with RFpositive RA odds ratio          confidence interval  Neither current nor past        smoking was associated with RFnegative RA Overall past        smoking odds ratio   confidence interval         but not current smoking odds ratio   confidence        interval  was associated with increased risk for        RA                    Discussion        In the present study we confirmed the earlier        observation that smoking is a risk factor for RA in men but        not in women      In addition we statistically        tested and confirmed the interaction between smoking and        sex thereby providing evidence in support of a biologic        interaction between smoking and RA        Smoking is known to be associated with production of RF              RF production in turn often precedes the        development of clinical disease      Furthermore it        appears to be independent of HLADR restricted immune        response     In our study we found that this paradigm        held well for men but not women Why could it be One of        the explanations for this could be that the immunologic        cascade triggered by smoking and leading to RF production        and subsequently to clinical RA is modulated differently in        men and in women The most obvious biologic difference        between men and women is the hormonal milieu although        other sexspecific factors cannot be ruled out In our        analyses we found a significant agesmoking interaction        among women  an observation that is not inconsistent with        this hypothesis        Although we were not able to test this hypothesis        directly in our data because the relevant reproductive        variables were not available a review of the literature        gives some clues In studies conducted in womenonly        cohorts the presence of association between smoking and RA        appeared to be dependent on menopausal status of study        participants In a populationbased study conducted in        Iowa USA which examined postmenopausal women only a        dosedependent effect of smoking was evident relative risk        for RA for current smokers versus never smokers             On the other hand data from the prospective Nurses        Health Study     which examined all primarily        menstruating women aged  years did not show a        statistically significant relationship between current or        past smoking and RA Furthermore in the Womens Health        Cohort Study     the effect size of smoking was        relatively modest relative risk  and  for all RA        and RFpositive RA respectively as compared with that in        the Iowa study Interpreting our findings of an interaction        between smoking and sex in the light of published data we        propose that being a menstruating woman acts as a biologic        effect modifier that blocks the smokingRFRA pathway We        did not have the information on menopausal status to test        this hypothesis directly Instead we conducted multiple        pairwise interaction tests between age and smoking for men        and women separately Interestingly we found that there        was a significant agesmoking interaction among women but        not among men This smokingsex effect modification        paradigm we propose not only might explain a lack of        increased risk for RA among women smokers but also        provides a theoretical basis for the observation that        smoking reduces the risk for RA in women            There are several areas of substantial strength in the        present study First the study participants were drawn        from a populationbased register of RA patients ie a        rheumatology clinic in which all patients with RA living in        the particular referral area are followed and the control        individuals were drawn from the same geographically        welldefined general population Second the participation        rates for patients and control individuals were good        Validated diagnoses and exposures were used The smoking        histories were also validated using hospital medical        records by comparing the questionnaire response with the        information from the standard clinical history and physical        examination Finally the numerical strength of this study        provided sufficient statistical power to quantitate the        risk of smoking on RFpositive and RFnegative RA        separately        The potential limitations of the study also must be        addressed By design the study was an unmatched        casecontrol study The control individuals were younger        than the cases Many control individuals were younger than         years This may lead to arguments that control        individuals were not old enough to have developed RA and        that an agematched design would have been more        appropriate However such a bias does not explain our        observations as the age differential was found in both men        and women In addition to performing tests of interaction        between age and smoking we adjusted for the effect of age        in multivariable models To address the concern that        successive birth cohorts are associated with lower        prevalence rates of smoking and leading to bias in our        findings analyses were repeated adjusting for the effect        of calendar year of birth We found that the results were        essentially the same We believe that matching by age would        have been overall disadvantageous to the study because        such an approach would not allow us to study important        interactions between age and other covariates        Unfortunately data on the temporal sequence of smoking and        RA as well as on any doseresponse association were not        available and could not be analyzed        The differences in the risk estimates for current        smoking and past smoking may appear counterintuitive The        explanation lies in the casecontrol design of the study        Both smoking and RA can independently increase the risk for        mortality the potential patients who are also continuing        smokers are more likely to have died than are smokers in        the general population thus never entering the study            This differential mortality could have resulted in an        underestimation of the association between current smoking        and RA However it is unlikely that there is a difference        in smokingrelated mortality between men and women of such        a magnitude as to cause the observed sex differential        Another equally plausible explanation would be that the        diagnosis of RA might have led to lifestyle changes        leading to cessation of smoking However there is little        evidence to suggest that onset of RA would affect smoking        behavior in men and women in a different manner ie there        is no published literature or rationale for supposing that        men and women tend to take up or quit smoking differently        when they develop RA                    Conclusion        Data presented in this report suggest that factors        related to the sex of an individual modify the effect of        smoking on the risk of RA Epidemiologic studies that do        not explore and account for the significant smokingsex        interaction are likely to show inaccurate and even biased        estimates of the association between smoking and RA Our        study also highlights the need for further research on        smoking RA and in addition their effect modification by        sexrelated factors like menopause
