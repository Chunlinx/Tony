           well what kind of music do you like Beverly   well i play piano and organ and have since i was a child and i sing in church choir and have done that since i was a child and still sing now   oh oh thats great   and uh i play cello in high school and college and occasionally play as an adult but i dont have a cello and i rarely ever practice so its like adult groups thats i teach school adult groups at school or something when they are in dire need of somebody   uhhuh uhhuh   so i still pick it up occasionally   yeah   but uh my son is a music major hes uh in performing French horn he was an all state French horn player all through high school and     uhhuh   so theres a lot of music in our family   well thats terrific i think its wonderful that you got that that you play an instrument that you passed it on to your children  i uh  um as as a child reluctantly took piano  for for uh       i guess three years  and you know  looking back im im really happy that i had that experience because certainly i i learned some basics about music that i wouldve been completely ignorant of had i not had those lessons   umhum   um i i wish now of course you know in  in hindsight that i had  uh uh uh kept it up but i didnt but nonetheless i i do have some uh rudimentary knowledge of uh the scales and the keys and the chords and et cetera   umhum  do you do anything with music nowadays   other than buy it  prerecorded   no  you you buy it and listen to it huh   exactly yeah and and uh what i i i am kind of ive got a real nice stereo system that ive invested too much money in and you know all the latest gadgets and but i do enjoy good music   umhum   and uh ive got quite a wide uh repertoire  i mean ive ive got everything from classical to jazz or rock and roll to blues i mean its just i i cover the whole gamut and it depends on the mood im in uh   umhum   and for instance Sunday mornings with coffee and the newspaper i  for some reason like to listen to classical music  and uh other times it you know just something completely different will strike me i i like almost everything except rap   i i do too i dont really care that much for rap  the only thing i ive liked   uh   with rap is is when the kids at school uh will take information and theyll learn it by making a rap out of it and then i think its useful otherwise i dont have any use for it   yeah well its  its the first time something that has come along that makes me feel  that you know i am obviously of another generation this is a theres gap between me and rap music  and  i guess     umhum umhum i understand   you know thats just i dont relate to it at all but then again im thats   umhum   it its definitely a a huge hit with the younger people   they seem to like it   they do   well my eldest son took piano for  oh about four years and lost interest but he learned enough that he can still sit down and play and enjoys doing that and has a keyboard   uhhuh   and then my daughter uh took piano for a while she also played bassoon and then she  has taken dance well she took dance from the time she was about five on up through first part of college and she got so involved in dance and that sort of thing that she let the instruments kind of slide behind   uhhuh   and but yet she still enjoys uh music and still enjoys dance and you know for exercise she wants aerobics to music and that you know that kind of thing   yeah yeah well you sound like youve got a very talented family   well they do have quite a bit of musical ability which is is nice uh we do enjoy good music and uh like  however uh with the kids going through college and we have two in college right now they are the ones that have the stereos we we dont seem to have much stereo one of these days we will   yeah uhhuh it yeah yeah really well um uh  uh what was i gonna ask i was there was a question thats on the tip of my oh yeah  as far as a voice did you ever have any uh uh voice coach either or lessons   the the only ones that i ever had were actually through the church where they had uh   or   a voice teacher uh offer lessons at sort of at a discount you might say for members of the choir who were interested so i did that a couple of times   right   but as far as as any other training no i just it was uh what i learned through singing in choirs and um  my other music piano and the organ and the cello   a friend of mine the reason i ask a friend of mine and her sister  both took voice for oh i guess three or four years  and they sing like angels they have the most they you know   umhum umhum   theyre just beautiful and i wonder how much of it is innate talent and how much of that is a a function of of how much theyve learned and and retained   umhum well there has to be some talent there there has to be some voice   something to work with   something to work with right i mean you can only overcome so much but there are tricks to make   right
