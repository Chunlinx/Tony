                                 Life on the Page and Off                                       The simple honest American believes in looking life straight in the TVand no nonsense There is less and less connection between what hes doing andseeing and being and Real Life because whats really happening is thelie                Dawn Powell             Dear Tim            Presumably we have now taken care of Who the Hell Is Dawn Powell Most ofthe countrys readers of literary fiction still dont know which is why thearticles and reviews all need to cover the identical groundrevealing how youheroically rescued her papers from the moldy basementthus making it possiblefor potential readers to weary of the Powell Phenomenon before they even get toher work And since her ideal readers are I suspect the people mostchurlishly resistant to hype I fear we may see the eensiest backlash soon            Let us admit that the Letters are not the best introduction toPowell Reading the letters of someone whose accomplishments you admire isvoyeuristic in the best sense as opposed to reading a strangers mail whichis a peepshow But for fans her letters are delicious Such wonderfulbalancing acts of literary bravura and homey friendship They made me rue thetriumph of emaila sugarrush with no nutritional value Hardly any of thewriters I know go to this much trouble online In fact Im not sure youcan            Right from the beginning from her first college letters home Powell seemedto be writing for posterity She made sure that each bulletin from the front ofher life was whole vivid shimmering and immediate a perfect vignette Ofcourse I dont know how much of that effect is due to your editing but Iassume that like a good hairdresser you wont tell Not too perfectthoughno grandstanding Though we dont have the other side we can tell thatshe listened The letters really make you feel as if youre settling down atthe bar with her and youre so excited to see each other that you start talkingright away before the drinks arrive before you even take off your coats            After reading her great letters to the critic Edmund Wilson I cracked outthe WilsonNabokov correspondence Compared with Dawn even Vladimir feelsdroning and nerdy Dear Bunny Nabokov wrote that was indeed funnyourwriting to each other on the same day and both referring to Pushkins atheismHar har Powell seemed to abhor pretension above practically anything I loveher mocking eggheads at jazz clubs I do enjoy the intelligentsias pretendingthey know a horn from a harp while the musicians pretend they know a book froma bookie I love her mocking the French I really dislike the pallidwateryeyed churchly oldwhore sentimentality of their limpid pastoralnovels            Theres gossip galore here but Im fascinated by how much she left out Youfeel these wells of mystery and secrecy in her Hardly a word of complaintabout her travails with her autistic son A heartbreaking story and I mustsay I bitch more about having to help my son with his homework than she doesabout narrowly saving her boy from an experimental lobotomy at Johns HopkinsHardly a word about her courtship with Joseph Goushathey meet offstage andzip theyre off to marryor about the nature of their subsequentdisagreements And then of course theres the Mystery of the Missing JackLawson the playwright with whom you claim she was hotandheavy and whom shebarely mentions even to herself in her diaries You suggest they destroyedall trace of the affair by mutual decision            Do I wish we still had Powells letters to Lawson Only partly Partly Iadmire that this woman seemed to really understand the difference betweenpublic and private life Despite the mountains of verbiage she had aprivate life Im thinking here of that line in the documentary aboutMadonna where Warren Beatty snipes at her If the camera isnt running doyou exist Powell most decidedly existed off the page as well as on And Ithink she perceivedahead of her timethe complicated ways in which mostpeople dont exist They turn into their own ad campaigns            Who the hell is Lawson anyhow and did he deserve this womans admirationIts fun that he has slunk back into history while she has risen up Theseletters remind us that although underappreciated in her own time Powell washardly slaving away in monkish anonymity She knew Hemingway Fitzgerald andDylan Thomas She drank with Sam Beckett in Paris She judged a Barnard fictioncompetition with Saul Bellow and at Yaddo when she had bad nosebleeds it wasJohn Cheever who came to her rescue During her Hollywood sojourn she narrowlymissed doing the screenplay work on The Wizard of Oz             It feels like a good life actually Far from perfect But not VanGogh either Not Proust in the corklined room I am not afraid she toldher diary of criticism or death or pain Thats what you feel most in her Ithink her fearlessness            I had the same peculiar aching feeling finishing this book of letters that Ido at the end of her novels That I dont want it to end That I miss her So Icant even imagine how you feel after shadowdancing with her for so long Anybiographer of course carries on a love affair with a ghost But you were socloseyou just missed her            YoursLisa
