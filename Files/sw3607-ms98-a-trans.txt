        so uh what kind of home repair work have you done     well um  done a little uh repair on the um shingles on the roof recently weve had a lot of wind around here   yall been pulling them up huh or just loosening them until the rain came in   yes uh it looks like im gonna have to get up there again because we may have a leak   are you in the section of Texas thats been getting so much rain   weve been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio but uh well im right uh Plano is just north of Dallas   oh okay   and uh there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas are under water right now i guess i saw on the news   yeah so youre probably what about halfway across the state from San Antonio though arent you   well were up uh were north in um   yeah   oh about uh i dont know uh eighty to a hundred miles uh south of the Oklahoma line i guess   yeah okay but youre still getting a good bit of the rain though   uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday so far we havent had any today and uh i suppose that means i should be uh getting up there to look at that uh shingle but uh i had something else planned today so i guess ill let it go awhile   yeah yeah is it asphalt shingles or or clay   theyre uh no theyre uh  uh wood shake   ooh that should be a lot of fun did did you put them up originally or you just uh uh going up  stopping leaks in them   yeah no i uh as a matter of fact weve never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and um uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so ive just recently had to start looking at it myself   yeah   so its a small problem so far but i guess you just have to keep on top of it what kind of roof do you have   uh we were in um uh campus apartment buildings with flat top uh   oh well then you dont have to do too much with   not too much theyre just tar and gravel uh treated flat top roofs have you got pretty low pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep   uhhuh oh its pretty steep um parts of it are steeper than others   well what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal   well uh  you wear uh shoes with good traction and  and and try to remember where you are at all times   yeah i imagine i imagine anyway   and remember to yell Geronimo if uh all else fails     yeah yeah that would be just too much of a fall for me um have you been uh visit was the house reasonably new or you been doing some remodeling work on it or   its actually just twelve years old now   thats pretty new house yet   yeah it um this part of the country actually they  they say that when the house is uh fifteen its already old but uh if you take good care of it   yeah   thing is weve um the main thing that weve had with this house recently has been some um uh squirming squirming i call it of the foundation were just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay and it um   yeah its settling unevenly   well it uh depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks and um course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer   yeah umhum   and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping and um   uhhuh   but anytime theres a change in the weather like the temperature uh drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors   well that sounds like a lot of fun   well usually what you do is just wait until you think its stopped and then you patch them up   hm what is it like uh stucco walls or   uh well this is all uh its all drywall   or wood all drywall   uh i think with um   wood framing   yeah right   okay   but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks i dont know quite how that works maybe it isnt drywall i dont really know   well if theyve plastered over drywall i remember my parents home is drywalled and then they uh almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall   yeah i think it is i expect thats what it is yeah   give it a textured sort of a look and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall   yeah i think thats the way this is done fortunately we havent had any real big holes in it yet so i   well thats good yeah well that would that would be in terribly terribly exasperating to have the a slab floor like that swelling and giving like that   yes well the uh previous owner had a major problem with it because um oh probably a variety of things uh his neighbor used to have
