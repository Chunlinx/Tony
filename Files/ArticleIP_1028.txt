                                 Balancing the Budget            In  the budget battlebetween President Clinton and the Republican Congress shut down the governmentIn  the Republicanswho got blamed for the shutdownmore or lesssurrendered to the president on budget specifics Clinton meanwhile hasembraced the principle of balancing the budget by the year  As he pointedout relentlessly during the campaign the deficit has shrunk by  percent inthe past four years He suggested in his Nov  interview with David Brinkleythat going the rest of the way will be easy The Republican leadership alsotalks as though it will be easy Will it            In facteliminating the deficit shouldnt be hardat least on paper The task iseasier partly because of legislative successes over the past two yearsAgriculture and welfare programs have been reformed in ways that will savemoney and discretionary spending was cut vigorously in fiscal  There werereverses after the Republican surrender of  but they were minor Thefailure to cut taxes also helps But Clinton and the Republicans are mainly thebeneficiaries of pure dumb luck            In January  the Congressional Budget Office projectedthe fiscal  deficit at  billion It came in at  billion Only asmall part of the improvement is the result of congressional deficitcuttingMost of it is the result of estimating errors by CBO Some might say Fire theestimators but believe it or not a  billion error is not very large ina  trillion economy CBO overestimated outlays by about  percent andunderestimated receipts by about  percent These may not be very accurateforecasts for a twoyear period but they are far from incompetent            The causesof the errors are not yet well understood Much of the revenue surge may havebeen capitalgainstax revenues associated with the surging stock marketandmany others besides CBO wish they had forecast that Outlays were down becauseof lowerthanexpected interest rates and a mysterious reduction in the growthof Medicaid spending But Medicaid spending has begun to surge again in recentmonths The good news was shortlived as it usually is for Medicaid            How hard it will be to come up with anagreedupon path to a balanced budget depends on how the CBO adjusts itsprojections for  The lesson of the huge  mistake might seem to be thatbudget projections are futilebut the CBO has no choice but to project andCongress has no choice but to accept that projection as gospel In any eventthe new CBO projections should make the budgetbalancing task easier for thepresident and Congress although we do not know how much easier            Given theintense budget struggles of the past why does balancing the budget now lookeasier First as noted earlier we have been nibbling away at the deficit Themuchmaligned budget deal of  fashioned by President Bush and Congresshelped a lot as did the equally maligned  deal constructed by PresidentClinton But more important the turn of the century should be a Golden Age forthe budget            With luck in  we should still be enjoying an enormouspeace dividend from the end of the Cold War Another longfuse blessing is thelow birth rate during the Great Depression Over half of the civiliannoninterest budget goes to people over  and that group will be growingslowly at the turn of the century Last CBO will have little choice but toassume the continuation of full employment There is no recession in sight andit would be foolish to try to forecast the timing of one more than a year inthe future            Given allthese favorable factors it might be possible to devise a crediblebalancedbudget plan that involves only minor cuts in Medicare Medicaid anddiscretionary spendingwere it not for the tax cuts desired by both thepresident and the Republicans The tax cuts may force them to put someimplausible spending cuts on paper If the final plan involves significantunspecified cuts in real discretionary spendingand if most of those cutsoccur in  and  when Bill Clinton will be a man of leisurewe shouldall be suspicious It will be very difficult to cut discretionary spending muchfurther Defense spending will soon be flattening out and domesticdiscretionary spending proved highly resilient at the end of the last Congressas members facing reelection became much more conservative            Arecession at any time in the next five yearsalso would add greatly to the difficulty In fact an economic downturn of anysignificant size would destroy efforts to balance the budget in  and couldpush the deficit back toward  billion            However the much moreserious budget problem involves what happens after  The good news aboutthe near future will be bad news for the long run if it leads the president andCongress to put forward a plausible balancedbudget plan without beginning thedramatic Medicare Medicaid and Social Security reforms that are required toavoid an economic catastrophe soon after  when baby boomers will retireAt that time without reform the deficit will soar to unimaginable levels Theprivate savings necessary to finance the deficit will plummet because therewill be net withdrawals from private pension funds The two forces will causeus to eat away at our capital and the economy will head rapidly downward            Clinton and the Republicansare right Balancing the budget by  will be relatively easy Itsafterward that the trouble starts
