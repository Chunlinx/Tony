the right to a week off every now andthen especially during the summer When                   Slate                began publishingtwo years ago we thought we were a weekly magazine more or less Butwe have evolved into something much more  more  well dynamic is theapproved term of Web selfhype Relentless is how our staff and perhaps evena few readers might prefer to describe it We now post new material at allhours seven days a week Last summer when Princess Dis fatal car crashoccurred the day after we shut down for a week we realized that a vital andunderrated press freedomthe freedom not to publishdoes not apply toWebzines or at least not to this one Many thanks to the readers who wrotein to thank us for not succumbing to DinDodi hysteria An undeservedcompliment is cherished all the more            What is left of our weeksoff is two weeks during the summer and one at Christmas when we publish lessmaterial than usual The first of those summer weeks is now upon us We haveposted a full weeks worth of material today post date July  and willresume our full publishing schedule a week from Monday Aug  In theinterim though we will continue to post and update Briefing features suchas The WeekThe Spin Todays Papers will continue now seven days a weekthe daily News Quiz will appear and features such as Chatterbox TheBreakfast Table and Dialogues will be updated often but irregularly asalways That should be enough to satisfy most people we hope And if you needmore theres two years worth of our archive The Compost to poke aroundin            Thanksfor cutting us a little slack

Weisberg                  Slate               s chief political correspondent looked around him a fewmonths ago and saw nothing but squalor This is not a reference to                  Slate               s New York bureau where Jacob hangs his laptop Thoseoffices actually are quite snazzy in an eversofaintly seedy downtown sort ofway inciting no small amount of envy in those of us who labor in the blandcorporate vineyards of Redmond Wash No what struck Jacob as oppressivelysqualid was the subject matter he was forced to contemplate week after weekfleeting ageinappropriate sexual liaisons in the Oval Office the seep ofmoney into every cranny of the political system Trent Lott Newt Gingrich Itwas more than a sensitive soul could bear            Where isbeauty Jacob wailed Where is art Man does not live by Social Securityprivatization alone And he pleaded to the editor Take me away from here toa realm of high thoughts and charmed vistas where I may contemplate mattersmore lovely than special prosecutors and nuclear proliferation Where aestheticconsiderations are paramount and base motives are unknown            And the editor heard Jacobs plea And he said AriseJacob and put aside politics for a few months Go forth and cover culture andthe arts There among the intellectuals and book people and artsyfartsiesgenerally you will find nothing but wholesomeness Beauty is in their heartsand beauty is on their minds Dwell among them and let their purity wash awaythe filth of politics with which you are encrusted after lo these many columnsand articles on the subject            But Jacob was pierced byshafts of doubt Are you sure he asked the editor that the world ofculture is actually so wonderful and that the people who dwell therein areactually so pure If so what will I write about Goodness and purity makethnot much of a column What will I impugn if not motives            Fear not Jacob the editorreplied You will think of something And come to think of it the world ofculture may not be as pure as all that after all There is squalor aplenty Butat least it will be a different kind of squalor And the editor decreed thatJacobs first culture column should be called The Browser And he decreedthat Jacobs firstBrowser column should post Thursday July             And it wasgood Or it had better be                           MusicalChairs                        Meanwhile though who would cover politics while Jacob dwelt in the land ofthe artsyfartsies Using several top executive search firms as well asexperimental talent sorting software from Nathan Myhrvolds research labs hereat Microsoft we scientifically ranked everyone in the entire world on thebasis of their qualifications to cover American politics for an onlinemagazine By a miraculous and moneysaving coincidence

days news that areconfusing or vague or seemingly contradictory or otherwise inadequatelyexplained by the conventional media But many of the questions he receives hesays are tendentious They dont really seek information or understandingQuestions such as Why is Rep John Kasich such a jerk are essentiallyunanswerable They begin from a debatable premise and go on to raise profoundmetaphysical questions that are beyond the scope of this                   Slate               feature Questions such as How big a jerk is Rep John Kasich are no betterThe answer is inherently subjective Many people believe in all sinceritythat he is a very small jerk Nor does the question allow for the possibilityhowever slight that he is not a jerk at all Why doesnt my computer workis another category of questions Explainer is not prepared to answer Questionsabout life and love should go to Dear Prudence But if theres something that truly puzzles youin the paper this morning Explainer is eager to
