goes so he goes Im putting your tires back         I will not rotate your tires         He said My manager said that was OK         And I said Fine fine fine         So I go back in the waiting room and Im like All right dude         Now they cant rotate my tires you know         Something about some lug nut         Now I didnt have this right then         He still had it in his hand         Ten minutes later I mean I was there for like an hour or so         He said oh I said How long is it going to take because I wanted to get my book out of the car if I need to take to read         Oh no not long at all         No one here no wait you know         So he comes back in he has this in his hand he says Here put this in your pocketbook         You take this to the dealership and you have then put it back on there         I will not do it anymore         I I tried and I tried and it will not go back in         And Im like                     Its broke                     Yeah no kidding         So Im like OK         So I put it in my pocketbook         Im like so Im just going to drive without a lug in my tire         Hes like You have five other ones youll be fine                  Just take it to the dealership         Im like All right fine         Just put my tires back on finish my oil change and let me you know get the hell out of here         So the guy that came in like  minutes after me is gone         They didnt rotate oh oh oh no no no no no no         So the guy comes back in and Im like If hes coming for me Im about to be really upset with these people         Im about to call my dad         And say I just cant handle this         So the guy comes in he takes the other guy out and says I need to talk to you                  He takes him out there he says he asked I could hear I mean its right outside the door         He goes How do the people that normally rotate your tires do it         How do they get the lugs off         He says Sir thats not my job         I dont watch them take the lugs out         I dont know how they do it         Thats why I bring it to people like you who are professionals with your big machines and things         Well I cannot do it         I cannot get them off         I cannot rotate your tires         So the guy was like Fine leave them on         He didnt want him to take them off and then not be able to get them back on         So he goes Fine leave my tires on dont take them off         So then hes getting his oil changed and he leaves         And then this other lady comes in and I warn her         Im like You might just want to back out now because you know this is major problems at this place         And so shes watching them and they come about two or three times         Youre low on transmission fluid and something squeaking here and                     Thats supposed to be part of an oil change Stephanie                     Yeah no kidding                  So she was like watching them like a hawk         Anyways he comes in and Im like Oh God here he comes again you know         Hes like Youre done         Im like Thank God you know         So I go over there and hes like Your total is  something or other         I went because normally inspections what like  dollars                                          See my dad well where I guess its because its our hometown but we normally pay  dollars                     I usually pay                      And it was          I go Howd on I said What did I just get charged for  some dollars         He goes The inspection was  then you got to pay for the sticker three dollars your wiper blades          Did he not say six dollars a wiper blade         Hmmm         Seventeen for the wiper blades which hes already put on I cant do anything about it         Twentyseven for the oil change         When I called I had it written down in my damn little thing         I pull this out I said So when I called the other day I said they told me  if you want the free tire rotation  if you dont you just get the oil change         I said First of all I said I wasnt going to get a free oil free tire rotation to begin with so I shouldnt have been charged and not even           I said I shouldnt have even been charged that to begin with         I said Then he didnt get my lug nut back on I said so I didnt get the tire rotation and I have a broken lug nut         I said And then youre still going to charge me          I said No way         I said What is going on here I dont you know         Im not happy with whats going on         You know Im getting mad         Hes like Fine we will change it to the other price         Hes like I guess they put it in wrong         So he gives me the receipt and its still not  its          Its a dollar but its still just annoying that theyre dollaring me here dollaring me there         So my total was  dollars total                     Oh my God                     And then I pull off and they didnt change my damn sticker for my next how many miles are you suppose to do                     Every three                     Three thousand         I was worried about that         I thought they put two less         So I pull I thought it was four thousand so I pull off and I see that they didnt do it         I was like Goddamn         I get in the car and I say Can I get a sticker for my next oil change please         And he goes Yeah sorry         They should have done that         I said Well they didnt         So he puts it back on there and he goes oh he said um Come come back and talk to your dad and visit us and well do your fan belt         I said Uhhuh thats OK thank you         Pulled off oh I called my dad         I was like You will not believe what I just                              What did your dad say                              He was livid          MH Is he going to call                     He was like I mean he aint going to call but he was like first off he was mad about the inspection being  dollars         He was like he said You shouldnt have yeah you shouldnt have done it         But they didnt tell me prices and he was like thats why thats why hed rather do it they take advantage of little girls like us coming in these places                     They do                     Uh I was mad and then they dont even
