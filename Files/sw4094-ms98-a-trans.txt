            yeah   uh uh uh capital punishment i understand means if somebody commits a serious enough crime we kill them   thats correct   is that your understanding of it   right uhhuh   well let me put it bluntly  theres not too many things that Arabs do right but one of the things they do is have a low crime rates they dont have too many repeat offenders   right   and they have uh very serious capital punishment over there   yes i i really think that um there is room for that i feel like if anybody has committed murder and they and they convict them that they definitely and theyre sentenced to life in prison then its not fair to have us to pay for them to stay there for life and then get paroled and go back out   humum humum humum   i believe that if theyre convicted and its um you know the only scary part i see in that is a crooked law system that would put people to death without enough evidence   yeah   to close the case do you know what i mean   yeah that shouldnt shouldnt happen but unfortunately it it can   right   uh i im in i think were pretty much in agreement uh in Texas this death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it i guess   well i dont think its too uh productive to put someone in prison for a life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of each other   yeah and then get out in what   right and um then theyre repeat offenders um i went to school with one of Ted Bundys attacked girls   um hm   she was um older than me she was three years older but she went to the same high school as i did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been under suspicion and everything at that point   he killed her   and i think he killed her definitely uhhum   oh my gosh well i was in the University of Texas years ago when one guy killed two girls in his room and hid the bodies in the field and every now that was in the sixties every now and then he comes up for parole it just scary that he could actually get back out   right um i think that in my belief i believe we uh i believe that if a person has killed       then there really isnt much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined what they came to earth to do you know what theyre here to do to try to make life um the best that they can   umhum what would you think about public executions   i definitely no i dont think so i dont think that thats something that we should try to get excited about watching like boxing or some sport i dont agree with that and i dont even think that they need to   televised   have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that its done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be but i dont believe in keeping all these prisoners what do you think   hm uh if if its death lets get it over and done with uh the appeal process should be speeded up quite quickly quite quickly they had this guy on the  news thats been around since seventy six and hes cost us over four million dollars so far   right   uh lets speed it up be sure its as close to being accurate as possible and get it over and done with on the other hand it may not be capital punishment if you committed armed robbery and get caught you shouldnt be out you shouldnt serve one day and get credit for five or or ten days uh that maybe off the subject but uh   oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody thats caught selling drugs     oh yeah   if that shouldnt be capital punishment but if theyre the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence theyre taking lives   umhum oh id i id go with the ones on the street corner   because people are thinking you know what am i going to get five years if im caught so whats the big deal     no yeah start at the bottom start pushing the ones on the street corner theyll run out of supplies   yep   im im cruel on that drugs have no place at all   no   um   and um so i i i think that it could go even farther than   umhum   i think that i dont know its hard you dont want to be so mean that youre youre doing away with people that have a chance to change but then i you look at the reports of people that are in prison and they act like theyre reformed and then they get out and they repeat repeat these offenses   right fairly quickly   so   fairly quickly i dont have uh you know  were in so much agreement i guess im try to play the devils advocate       uh   yeah   as a Christian i cant even be the devils advocate im a Christian and i still think theres an appropriate place for it   thats yeah im im a Christian also and thats why you get in the situation where um it says how i believe but if a persons committed murder thats an unpardonable sin   uh   and so why should we pardon something that we dont believe our our Lord uh God is pardoning do you know what i mean   um umhum yeah i can go along with that i just wish we could get  get uh debate going here to get some verbal usage for the computer uh       i have a brotherinlaw that is strictly opposed to it and uh he is a uh very liberal uh believer in uh probation uh and convicts not being sent to prison but being sent to uh halfway houses
