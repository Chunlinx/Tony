                oh i guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart since i am a uh am a healthy eater     well i I try to be as well   well im not uh i there really isnt any kind of particular food that i i dont dont like really and i like a good Italian restaurant or a good uh um   uhhuh   uh especially like good prime rib so if its uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and i live here in uh Rome New York and there are a lot of good restaurants around here   umhum oh youre in New York i was gonna theres a place if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib its called Lawrys like Lawrys seasoning salt and it is absolutely wonderful   uhhuh uhhuh really   and uh we were there a few months ago and it i mean its kind of pricey well from New York it probably doesnt matter but   well no i im in upstate New York and its actually very inexpensive i theres a theres a place um half a mile from me here that uh   oh is it okay   has uh fantastic prime rib for uh eleven dollars a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole whole nine yards so it   wow uhhuh yeah well i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen and it includes you know salad and rolls and oh some other stuff but it is absolutely wonderful its the best i have ever had   right yeah i was going to this place up the street from me is the best ive ever had so  ill have to go there when i get there get to Dallas   yeah well yeah well we like uh lots of people down here like Mexican food   uhhuh sure   so um thats i i think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites   uhhuh   but um im not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff   no no im not into the the dont do the the raw raw fish like that but i do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh   uhhuh   that they uh i go on im an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business so i uh find myself down in Melbourne Florida every about once once a month once every two months or so and uh   oh okay uhhuh   go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit uh i love that   oh yeah get fresh seafood down there   and um and uh Marylands great you get the crabs its like i cant go anywhere where i i where i dont enjoy myself so   uhhuh yeah yeah seafood seems to be a little a little bit more expensive than than other types of food   thats true but   but it sure is good and its supposed to be good for you   yeah well yeah its really strange that that that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality uh uh i say that the oceans have the greatest resource resource of food on the planet and yet we havent as human beings havent figured out a way to harvest it economically  so   right right   weve managed to uh figure out how to get at just about everything else but uh but not uh not seafood     uhhuh do you like uh spicy foods or   what yeah yeah i like yeah id make a a wicked chili and uh like around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings   oh uhhuh   and so uh  people they you know you go out to get the chicken wings and those are really hot and the hotter the better and   yeah yeah well we uh we like spicy food down here especially uh the hot sauce Picante sauce or salsa whatever yall call it and uh we we sure go through a lot of that   right sure yeah   but i like it hot but i dont like it real hot because then my nose starts running   uhhuh my my generally my my scalp will start i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot its like weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but uh         i dont know but uh yeah well there isnt isnt too much in the way of restaurants that i dont like things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine i i never been   yeah   really fond of that stuff you talk about spicy thatll thatll literally blow your head off its so hot  and i can handle just about any kind of food without uh um   uhhuh   well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances so     uhhuh     although i guess on this topic i  talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too thats one thing whats that yeah   oh yeah and and the price and the price make you wanna come back   well i find that lately that so many people are working you know theyre working waitressing jobs or waiter
