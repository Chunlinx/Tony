                 okay i guess thats it uh   yep   i was just thinking about what movies ive seen lately mostly uh  we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the dollar used to call the dollar movies   yeah   uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery and uh   yeah yeah sure   found it quite enjoyable myself uh uh had also seen the Hunt For Red October you know with him in that and   umhum God i dont have to say kind of caught me off im more of a   looks good in the paper commercials look great on TV um   umhum     uh i did see Red October   yeah     uh this is going to be ive seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um   yeah   man oh man i have to say uh Chevy Chase uh Christmas you know the Vacation Christmas   yeah   thing was one here recently we saw at Christmas time um God i havent been in a movie since         maybe Superman Batman maybe Batman might have been one yeah   well thats yeah yeah well well i didnt even see Batman so thats uh thats pretty good so   its been   or no lets see uh Dick Tracy i did we did see Dick Tracy so thats   i havent seen any of that stuff really   yeah so uh so you so then youre not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either   well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um   oh yeah yeah so so you watch a lot of videos   yeah   then uh   stop by and get them at you know for ninety nine cents and bring them home but   yeah thats right what uh what do you find uh that youre looking at most in those uh the i mean are they are they the comedies and uh that kind of stuff   comedies and the PGs and the no skin uh   umhum   were uh know like we saw Sally and uh well Billy Crystals in it we saw that one and which was video thats thats probably the last movie i went to see yeah thats probably the last one   yeah yeah uhhuh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know theyre uh theyre a dollar and a half what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now   quarter Promenade yeah   and uh at the Promenade yeah and uh you know we we find those pretty good theyre not uh its not so far you know from when they were first run that you dont enjoy them   sure   occasionally youll find one thats you know some of the friends will be talking about them that you wished that youd seen them  so you could talk about them sooner but uh   i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with two with a couples a little ridiculous   yeah thats thats a little bit too much so   yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red   but umhum   okay which is not that old but you know it was bounced around the VCR cabinet there and um   yeah yeah   but yeah we i used to really you know id just pick up the paper and wed go see a couple you know three or four movies a month but no we havent i havent been to a movie in its been four or five months   uhhuh yeah but uh yeah we we find even uh you know even looking at the dollar movies which are youd think those are the ones that uh are coming back around because they were good the first time   umhum   and we dont find a lot of those uh you know theyll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend   umhum   and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or three two out of three or three out of four there wont be anything that we want to go see   umhum   and uh so then when something comes up theyll usually stay on a while so we we still get a chance to see you know one of them that we want to see       but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldnt get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldnt get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out   umhum umhum umhum   we went to see Avalon and uh i really was not that impressed with Avalon it uh   really   you know its uh its one of these uh more i dont know melodramatic and and i dont know uh not satirical wasnt funny at all but it was   kind of drab   i dont know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh you know   ooh my its got to be something fun yeah you dont have to think yeah sure   yeah and uh right but uh i really enjoy uh the espionage type of movies the the uh   umhum   The Hunt For Red October and Russia House i had read uh the Russia House book before so i i i thought it was a real good movie um   is it a good movie great   i enjoyed the book quite a bit too so thats that made it made it more interesting to me   lets see   uh a lot of it the dialogue was uh a little difficult to understand because uh Michelle Pfeiffer had a was speaking with her Russian accent you know the the actress Russian accent so   umhum   it was part of that was a little hard to understand   probably overcompensated a little bit   right and uh so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book   umhum   but uh   and well i think the now its all coming back to me what was the one not The Deep but The Abyss     um yeah   the last year i think   yeah we didnt see that one im not uh i dont see dont go see too many in well i would but my wife doesnt like the the uh the science fiction semi horror type stuff you know   umhum   things that uh get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for her   yeah im not much of a Rotocop man Robocop you know myself   yeah   this one it wasnt heavy hisci you know hifi because it was a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had of course the breathing apparatus which was liquid and and then all a sudden you know when you actually met this thing and and that that was you know towards like the last third of the movie only really got strange but it was uh   umhum   you know it was cold in the theater and its wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didnt have to think a lot and and uh       and there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where you have to follow a hidden plot   yeah   and it  and then you leave the movie like with your brain you got a headache  trying to follow this damn movie   right well its its bad enough that you know if you got a little back problem or something have to sit in those seats and wiggle and squirm around and usually come out with your back hurting anyway so   yep specially those intermission movies yep   right   and course those those dollar dollar and quarter movies you might catch a spring too so   yeah thats right   got to be careful     well anyway uh i guess  if uh if youre dont have anything else to talk about i guess i we can hang up on this one   theyre great okay   okay i appreciate it thanks uhhuh   thank you sir bye
