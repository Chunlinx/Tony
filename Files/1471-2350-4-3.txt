                    Background        Common variable immunodeficiency CVID and selective        immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency IgGSD are        characterized by subnormal serum concentrations of total        IgG or by normal serum total IgG concentrations with        deficiency of one or more IgG subclasses respectively in        some cases IgA or IgM levels are also subnormal              Most persons are diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD because        they have increased frequency and severity of infections        due to bacteria and other microbial pathogens             Although a susceptibility locus for these disorders has not        been identified they often appear to be familial and to        segregate with markers on Chp              The purpose of the present work was to quantify and        analyze the frequencies of HLAA and B phenotypes and        haplotypes in index cases with CVID and IgGSD in central        Alabama who presented because they had increased frequency        or severity of infections and to compare the present        results to those of control subjects in this geographic        area We also evaluated the relationships of HLAA and B        phenotype frequencies and haplotypes with phenotypes        defined by serum immunoglobulin concentrations and we        estimated the combined frequency of CVID and IgGSD in        central Alabama based upon the occurrence of these        disorders in the spouses of the present index cases The        implications of the present results in determining the        hereditary basis and immunoglobulin phenotype expression of        CVID and IgGSD are discussed                    Methods                  Selection of Subjects                      General Criteria for Selection of Study            Subjects            The performance of this work was approved by the            Institutional Review Boards of Brookwood Medical Center            and the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the            Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving Human            Subjects promulgated by the World Medical Association            Declaration of Helsinki were followed All subjects            were adults   years of age who identified            themselves as Caucasians each resided in central            Alabama The first persons in respective families            diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD were designated as            index cases All index persons were diagnosed in            routine medical care in a single community medical            center none was diagnosed as a consequence of family            or population screening We included all evaluable            index patients diagnosed between November  and June                                            CVID and IgGSD Index Cases            Each patient was diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD            deficiency as an adult because heshe had frequent or            unusually severe infections Each patient had a single            severe or lifethreatening infection that required            hospitalization or four or more infections per year            that required antibiotic therapy for at least two            consecutive years None was known to have preexisting            isolated IgA deficiency or other abnormality of            immunity Diagnoses were based on demonstration of            persistent otherwise unexplained serum concentrations            of immunoglobulins   SD below the corresponding            mean levels     Criteria for the diagnosis of CVID            were  decreased total serum IgG concentration and             either decreased IgG subclasses decreased serum            IgA concentration or decreased serum IgM concentration                Criteria for the diagnosis of IgGSD were             normal total serum IgG concentration and  abnormally            low serum concentrations of one or more IgG subclasses            some patients with IgGSD also had decreased levels of            IgA or IgM levels                We excluded persons of African American descent            because  certain HLA types and haplotypes differ            significantly among Caucasians and African Americans in            central Alabama         in adults serum            concentrations of immunoglobulins are often greater in            persons of subSaharan African descent than in whites                 and  persons of subSaharan descent occur            infrequently in series of CVID or IgGSD patients                and such patients are uncommon in our experience We            also excluded persons who had isolated deficiencies of            IgA or IgM those with hypogammaglobulinemia            attributable to Bcell neoplasms              eg  Bchronic lymphocytic            leukemia plasma cell myeloma macroglobulinemia or            nonHodgkins lymphoma or those with markedly            increased immunoglobulin loss              eg  nephrotic syndrome or            proteinlosing enteropathy                                Control Subjects            Data from  apparently normal unrelated            Caucasian adult subjects from Alabama who had undergone            HLAA and B phenotype analysis as part of paternity            testing were used to estimate allele and gene            frequencies      HLAA and B haplotypes were            determined in  unrelated Caucasian subjects from            Alabama who had undergone testing to establish            paternity     Haplotypes were assessed from a            child and hisher mother or father and included in the            data set Preliminary data analysis revealed that            frequencies of the major HLAA and B haplotypes            observed in the present control subjects were similar            to those estimated to occur in Caucasians from a large            national bone marrow donor program                                    Family Members            We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD deficiency in some family            members using the same criteria defined herein for            index patients These persons presented themselves for            evaluation after an index case was diagnosed in their            respective kinships because they also had increased            frequency and severity of bacterial infections            Although other relatives of index cases were also            reported to have increased frequency and severity of            infections or to have some form of antibody deficiency            they were not included in the present study because we            did not evaluate them Screening or other systematic            testing of family members of the present index cases            was beyond the scope of the present study                                    Laboratory Methods          Serum concentrations of IgG IgA IgM and IgG          subclasses were measured using standard automated methods          before IgG replacement therapy was initiated Reference          ranges for serum immunoglobulin concentrations are total          IgG    mgdL IgG               mgdL IgG               mgdL IgG               mgdL IgG               mgdL total IgA             mgdL and IgM    mgdL The basis of these          reference ranges has been reported elsewhere              Deficiency of an immunoglobulin class or subclass was          defined by a serum concentration at diagnosis that was          less than the corresponding lower reference limit          Measurement of IgA subclasses IgD or IgE in serum was          not routinely performed          HLA A and B alleles were detected using          lowresolution DNAbased typing PCRsequencespecific          oligonucleotide probe in index cases     Control          subjects were tested using the microdroplet          lymphocytotoxicity test     subjects were evaluated          using antisera that detected allele assignments described          in the  thInternational Histocompatibility Workshop              Because the levels of resolution of the DNAbased and          serological typing methods we used are similar alleles          detected by these respective methods provide concordant          allele assignments with the exception of B and B          that were not detected by serological methods HLA typing          of family members was performed to permit assignment of          Chp haplotypes In each index patient in whom a single A          or B allele was detected by DNAbased typing we verified          the alleles and set phase to ascertain haplotypes of          the index patient using HLA analyses of appropriate          family members For the present analysis all haplotypes          were defined only by A and B alleles                          Statistical Considerations          A data set that included HLAA and B phenotypes in           index patients with either CVID or IgGSD and HLAA          and B haplotypes in  of these  index patients was          available Absolute or uncorrected values of A and B          phenotype frequencies in index cases A and B haplotype          frequencies and occurrence of twohaplotype combinations          were calculated after enumeration of the raw data To          correct for the possible occurrence of spurious HLA          antigen and haplotype associations due to multiple          comparisons we also computed values of           p using the Bonferroni inequality          method     Corrected values of           p are displayed in tabular form          along with uncorrected values A computer spreadsheet          Excel  Microsoft Corp Redmond WA and a          statistical program GBStat v   Dynamic          Microsystems Inc Silver Spring MD were used to          perform the present analyses Means were compared using a          student ttest twotail Frequency values were compared          using chisquare analysis or Fishers exact test          onetail as appropriate A value of           p   was defined as          significant Only significant values of           p are displayed and these are          expressed to four significant figures                            Results                  General Characteristics of CVID and IgGSD Index          Patients          There were approximately equal fractions of index          patients with CVID and IgGSD respectively Table           There was a preponderance of women in index patients in          both disorders The mean ages of patients in CVID and          IgGSD groups were similar In CVID the most frequent          pattern of IgG deficiency was that of IgG             IgG            subclasses In persons with IgGSD          isolated IgG            deficiency was the most frequent IgG          subclass deficiency phenotype Table  Eight of the          present index patients  CVID  IgGSD  men  women          also had hemochromatosis associated with homozygosity for                    HFE CY on Chp another man had          CVID and a hemochromatosis phenotype associated with the           HFE genotype CYHD                          Frequencies of HLAA and B Phenotypes          Sixteen A phenotypes were detected in  index cases          and control subjects Table  The most frequent A          phenotypes in index cases were A  A           and A  The most frequent A          phenotypes in controls were A  A           and A  The phenotype A occurred with          significantly greater frequency in index cases           index cases vs  controls           p   uncorrected and           p   corrected There          were no other significant differences in HLAA phenotype          frequencies between these groups Table           Thirtytwo B phenotypes were detected in  index          cases Table  Thirty B phenotypes were detected in          control subjects The most frequent B phenotypes in index          cases were B  B  and B           The most frequent B alleles in controls were          B  B  and B  The          frequencies of B B B B B and B          were significantly greater in index cases based on          uncorrected values of           p Table  The frequencies of          B and B were significantly greater in index cases          based on corrected values of           p Table  The frequencies of          B and B were significantly lower in index cases          based on uncorrected values of           p Table  The frequency of B          was significantly lower in index cases based on a          corrected value of           p Table                           Frequencies of HLAA and B Haplotypes          Data were available that permitted frequency          comparisons to be made between index cases and probands          for  haplotypes The most frequent haplotypes in index          cases were AB frequency  AB          frequency  and AB frequency           Table  Each of these haplotypes was significantly          more frequent in index cases than in control subjects          uncorrected values of           p    and           respectively Table  After performing the Bonferroni          corrections the frequency of AB alone was          significantly increased in probands            p   Table  Three          other haplotypes were also significantly more frequent in          index cases based on uncorrected values of           p  These were AB          AB and AB Table  The combined          frequencies of these three latter haplotypes were           in index patients and  in control subjects            p   uncorrected and           p   corrected Two          haplotypes were significantly more frequent in control          subjects based on uncorrected values of           p  These were AB and          AB Table  However these differences were no          longer significant after correction using the Bonferroni          method Homozygosity for these haplotypes was observed in          some index cases AB n   AB n            AB n   and AB n            Fiftytwo of  index patients  were          HLAhaploidentical with at least one other index case in          the present study Table  Fortyeight of these           index patients  had the haplotypes AB          AB or AB Altogether eighteen different          haplotypes defined by A and B typing were observed in          these  index cases Table                           Segregation of HLA Haplotypes with CVID or IgGSD in          Kinships          We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD in firstdegree or other          relatives of  of  index patients for whom HLAA and          B haplotypes had been ascertained These haplotypes          segregated with CVID or IgGSD in  of the  kinships          AB  kinships AB  kinship AB           kinships Fig  AB  kinship AB           kinship AB  kinship and AB           kinships In one of the two remaining kinships both          AB and AB segregated with CVID or IgGSD          Fig  In the other remaining kinship one index          patient and her sister had IgGSD but they were          HLAnonidentical However each of these women inherited          a haplotype significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD          index patient

Phenotype Frequencies            in CVID and IgGSD            The frequencies of A phenotypes were similar in the            CVID and IgGSD with the exceptions that HLAA which            occurred with significantly greater frequency in IgGSD            cases  vs  CVID             p    and that            HLAA was more frequent in CVID cases  vs             IgGSD             p   The frequencies of            HLAB phenotypes were similar in the two groups with            the exceptions that B and B occurred with            significantly greater frequencies in IgGSD cases             vs  CVID             p   and  vs              p   respectively and            that B occurred more frequently in CVID cases             vs  IgGSD             p                                  Comparison of Haplotype Frequencies in CVID and            IgGSD            The haplotype frequencies in CVID and IgGSD did not            differ significantly with two exceptions The            frequency of AB was significantly greater in            CVID patients than in IgGSD patients  vs             respectively             p   The frequency of            AB was greater in patients with IgGSD than in            patients with CVID  vs  respectively             p                                  Possible Dose Effect of Haplotype on Total Serum            Immunoglobulin Concentrations            Eleven haplotypes occurred with significantly            greater frequency in index patients with CVID and IgGSD            than in control subjects described above Mean values            of serum IgG IgA or IgM did not vary significantly            according to the inheritance of   or  of these            eleven haplotypes Table  Similarly some index            patients in each pattern of IgG subclass deficiency            were positive for one or two of these eleven            haplotypes with the exception of the sole index            patient with deficiencies of IgG               IgG               and IgG              who did not have any of these            twelve haplotypes                                Frequencies of Index Patients with HLA Haplotype            AB            Some reports suggest that IgA deficiency segregates            with a HLA haplotypes containing A B in some            families         Thus we analyzed the            frequencies of the haplotype AB in the present            index patients grouped according to presence of normal            or subnormal pretreatment serum concentrations of IgG            IgA and IgM respectively Although frequencies of            positivity for AB were slightly greater in index            patients who had deficiencies of IgG IgA or IgM            these differences were not significant Table  There            were insufficient numbers of index patients homozygous            for AB to estimate the effect of homozygosity            for this haplotype on serum immunoglobulin            concentrations                                Disparity of Immunoglobulin Phenotype in Family            Members with Same HLA Haplotype            In some kinships different immunoglobulin            deficiency phenotypes were observed among family            members with CVID or IgGSD who shared HLAA and B            haplotypes One representative pedigree demonstrating            these disparities between immunoglobulin phenotype            frequency of infections and HLA haplotype is displayed            in Figure  In a second kinship two different            haplotypes segregated with antibody deficiency            although the immunoglobulin deficiency pattern was            different in each of three affected family members            Fig  One pair of monozygotic twins was available            for evaluation The index patient had IgGSD IgG              subclass deficiency HLAA             B  and recurrent upper and lower respiratory            tract infections Her twin had normal serum            concentrations of total IgG IgG subclasses IgA and            IgM and did not report increased frequency or severity            of infections                                    Estimation of Population Frequency of CVID and          IgGSD          The occurrence of CVID and IgGSD in spouses of the          present index cases permitted us to estimate the combined          population frequency of CVID and IgGSD in adults At the          time of diagnosis  of the present  index cases had          spouses Of these  spouses we diagnosed CVID in one          and IgGSD in another because they also had increased          frequency and severity of bacterial infections          predominantly those of the upper and lower respiratory          tracts Thus a conservative estimate of the combined          frequencies of these disorders in adults in central          Alabama is                              Discussion        The present observations demonstrate that CVID and IgGSD        in Caucasian adults diagnosed in routine medical care        delivery are significantly associated with HLA haplotypes        on Chp More than twothirds of the present  index        patients who were evaluable for haplotyping inherited one        or two of the significantly associated haplotypes        AB AB AB AB AB and        AB This indicates that a susceptibility locus        loci for CVID and IgGSD occurs on multiple haplotypes        defined by HLAA and B typing Further this implies that        putative Chp alleles associated with CVID or IgGSD        susceptibility occur on many HLA haplotypes that are common        in Caucasians in central Alabama    and in Caucasians        from a large national bone marrow donor program            The present observations also confirm and extend the        reports of association of HLA haplotype AB or an        extended haplotype containing A and B with heritable        forms of immunoglobulin deficiency demonstrated in        familybased analyses          It is likely        that a candidate genes for CVID or IgGSD exists in the        HLA class II region          Because the        class II region is closer to the HLAB locus than to the        HLAA locus it is plausible that candidate genes for        CVID or IgGSD in the class II region are in greater linkage        disequilibrium with HLAB than HLAA This is consistent        with the aggregate observations on HLAA and B typing in        the present study        The present observations demonstrate that the        frequencies of HLAA and B phenotypes and haplotypes were        not significantly different in CVID and IgGSD index        patients with few exceptions These observations could be        explained by the occurrence of an HLAlinked allele that is        necessary to cause either CVID or IgGSD but is        insufficient to induce a specific immunoglobulin deficiency        phenotype Alternatively the variable immunoglobulin        deficiency phenotypes presently classified as CVID and        IgGSD are best explained by the coinheritance of multiple        alleles each of which has an independent effect on the        immunoglobulin deficiency phenotype Regardless the        variability we observed in IgG IgA and IgM phenotypes in        index patients and family members is best explained by the        coinheritance of multiple alleles that influence the        immunoglobulin phenotype This is consistent with evidence        for the occurrence on Chp of multiple distinct        susceptibility genes for patterns of immunoglobulin        deficiency some recessive and others dominant     For        example at least two putative alleles associated with        heritable IgA deficiency occur on Chp and each is        associated with a different major histocompatibility MHC        region haplotype      whereas a putative        susceptibility locus on chromosome  is not a major        contributor to selective IgA deficiency     Alleles        on chromosomes other than Chp may also influence the        phenotypic expression of CVID and IgGSD in adults The        inheritance of certain polymorphisms of the mannosebinding        lectin gene on Ch in persons with CVID are associated        with earlier age of onset of manifestations of antibody        deficiency and with increased risk of autoimmunity            Altogether these observations are consistent with the        hypothesis that many common heritable antibody deficiency        phenotypes collectively diagnosed as CVID or IgGSD are the        result of the inheritance of multiple diseasepredisposing        alleles on Chp and possibly other chromosomes        We have estimated that the prevalence of CVID and IgGSD        in adults in central Alabama is  This estimated        prevalence could be reasonably attributed to the fact that        many of the HLA haplotypes significantly associated with        CVID and IgGSD are also common in the general population        This could also explain a the inheritance of two        significantly associated HLA haplotypes in many of the        present index cases including most of the index patients        who were HLAhaploidentical with at least one other index        patient b the disparate immunoglobulin deficiency        phenotypes of multiple family members who inherited the        same HLA haplotype and c the occurrence of disparate        haplotypes in two sisters who had similar immunoglobulin        phenotypes        Some of the haplotypes significantly associated with        CVID and IgGSD in the present study also occur with        significantly increased frequencies in central Alabama        Caucasian hemochromatosis probands with homozygosity for         HFE CY on Chp     These        haplotypes are AB and AB      present        study These observations imply that susceptibility        alleles for CVID and IgGSD occur on haplotypes that        sometimes include the         HFE CY allele In addition the        haplotypes AB and AB significantly associated        with CVID and IgGSD in the present study are common in both        hemochromatosis probands homozygous for         HFE CY and control subjects in        Alabama      present study Taken together these        observations could explain the occurrence of CVID or IgGSD        and hemochromatosis due to         HFE CY homozygosity in some of the        present index patients    and account for the        occurrence of IgA deficiency and hemochromatosis in        different members of the same family                        Conclusions        CVID and IgGSD are significantly associated with the HLA        haplotypes AB AB AB AB        AB and AB Many of these haplotypes are also        common in the Alabama Caucasian population Immunoglobulin        phenotype variability demonstrated in index cases and in        family studies suggest that there are multiple genes on        Chp or other chromosomes that modify the immunoglobulin        phenotypes of CVID and IgGSD The estimated prevalence of        these disorders in central Alabama is  The estimated        prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama could be        reasonably attributed to the fact that many HLA haplotypes        significantly associated with these disorders are also        common in the general population                    Competing Interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        Author  JCB conceived the study and contributed
