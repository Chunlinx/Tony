            so you think uh the Soviet Unions a threat anymore to US   you know i was i was thinking about that while i was waiting for the connection i i think uh you know its uh uh a military threat certainly i dont feel like its like it was back in the the sixties whenever Kruschev said he was going to bury us   umhum   uh at the same time i i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that uh the situation over there is so unstable   yeah yeah   and and the especially the economics uh uh ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean theyre like a a quarter of the land mass of the earth   umhum umhum umhum   you know and and if things dont get straightened out over there it it will impact us one way or the other i think   right right i think im just afraid of uh what theyre going to do with their nuclear warheads that they already have right now that uh they said you know theyre open to uh anybody whos willing to pay the money i think uh Ukraine said that you know if youve got the money for it well give you the warheads   is that right i hadnt heard that   yeah and uh im just afraid you know some some guy like Sadaam Hussein   yeah or or any one of the other uh nuts that are running around yeah   oh yeah i mean you could get someone like you know  the guy who uh who negotiates arms you know you know he buys them out sticks them in his arsenal and starts selling them to everybody in the world   uhhuh yeah well its uh i dont know its its amazing to see uh the kind of changes thats happened just in the past uh you know not even ten years or even five years its just awesome   umhum yeah yeah well you know its i guess the break up its self was was uh kind of unusual and then now all of a sudden you know Gorbachev who was uh in the USs pocket pretty much   yeah   is now gone you know and now weve got Yeltsin uh Yeltsin who seems like hes a little bit of a hard ball typical   yeah   typical communist   yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than than you know previous Soviet leaders   oh yeah doesnt right right thats true   and uh you know its just uh uh you see this the uh you know on television the the uh shows uh on the news with the the people waiting in line   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   they had last night i think it was on ABC where some Soviet doctors had gone on strike because their uh   uhhuh   monthly salary was about enough money to buy them six pounds of sausage with you know the new increase in prices   right hm   which is you know of course doctors over there arent held in the same rare high esteem that they have here in the US   umhum umhum well   but   the other thing was uh like nuclear scientists over there were being uh taken in by you know other countries you know   yeah   because i mean like you said theyre not being paid very much over there and and whereas they can command salaries of you know twenty thousand dollars a month in uh you know these middle eastern countries that you know oil bearing countries you know and i saw that they uh Iraq and Iran had offered uh twenty thousand dollars a month to nuclear scientists i mean   huh   who wouldnt want that kind of money   yeah yeah you know i i would even consider moving to Iraq for that i mean   yeah       yeah really     well anyway its   but i mean and and these and these are guys that couldnt eat you know so   yeah yeah well as a matter of fact i know that uh you know they they were concerned about the Soviet brain drain because therere so many of their top people just uh like you say they they   so   you know are are being given offers elsewhere and some of them i think are even coming to the US if we can get them you know rather than let them uh go to one of those third world countries   right umhum umhum umhum well i think the US is eventually going to have to step in i mean youve got this you know big country thats now uh pretty much uh in chaos because uh i mean the all the things thats split up and theyve got the nuclear arsenal to you know pretty much eliminate the rest of the world and uh theyve asked for US support and i think the US is going to have to give in   well im all for them  providing as you know as much support as we can at the same time you know its time for us i think as a country to run us you know the rest of the world really is not our responsibility   because yeah umhum umhum   its good for us to look after our own best interests even in uh you know an international way but at the same time we i dont think that we have the resources to bale out the entire Soviet Union   umhum umhum umhum no i dont think as far as bail out goes im thinking more on the sense of uh um helping them take the infrastructure they have and putting it to use i mean theyve got a good infrastructure there i mean they at one time were you know they they were a threat to the US i mean they had the weapons ability they had the manufacturing capability   yeah   and i think its all kind of disorganized right now   you know the amazing thing about about it is how these people whove been operating for you know seventy generations under a uh uh you know the the protectorate protectorate of the the government over them that they really dont even have a concept of what capitalism is   right umhum yeah yeah   and and and as a matter of fact im not a guy with my company was in Moscow several weeks ago and i asked him what it was like and he said you know he said they start drinking vodka at ten oclock in the morning   uhhuh umhum yeah yeah       yeah i wish there was that kind of uh stuff over here itd be great       but uh anyway its uh uh i dont know there there just   yeah yeah   theyve got a really uh different outlook and a different mentality than uh uh people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living uh under any form of capitalism and its going to take quite a while for them to to realize that uh   umhum hm umhum yeah yeah
