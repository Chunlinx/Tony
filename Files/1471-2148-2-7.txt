                    Background        Traditionally the animal body cavity coelom has        played a major role in interpretations of metazoan        evolution from groups eg flatworms lacking a coelom        to those eg nematodes with a false coelom and finally        to the bulk of animal phyla having a true coelom        Coelomata      There has never been complete        agreement on animal phylogeny and classification but most        researchers have divided living coelomate animals into        deuterostomes echinoderms hemichordates urochordates        cephalochordates and vertebrates and protostomes        arthropods annelids mollusks and other phyla based on        differences in early embryonic development An analysis of        small subunit ribosomal RNA S rRNA sequences challenged        this arrangement by placing acoelomate and pseudocoelomate        phyla in more derived positions among the protostomes and        in further defining a clade Ecdysozoa of molting animals        that includes arthropods and nematodes     This        Ecdysozoa hypothesis has influenced diverse fields           and interpretations of developmental evolution in animals              Since its publication evidence has appeared both        for and against this hypothesis                   Knowing the branching order of the major animal lineages        especially those three with fully sequenced genomes is of        importance to diverse fields such as medical genetics        physiology neurobiology paleontology and astrobiology        With a genealogy of animals it will be easier to determine        the origins and inheritance of mutations genes gene        functions and structures        The three possible relationships of these animal phyla        are I arthropods  vertebrates II arthropods         nematodes and III nematodes  vertebrates The first        hypothesis corresponds to the traditional grouping        Coelomata and the second corresponds to Ecdysozoa            For convenience we will use these names in reference to        the two hypotheses while recognizing that this study by        necessity involves only a subset of all animal phyla The        third hypothesis will be referred to as hypothesis III        Fig  To test each hypothesis sequence alignments of        more than  nuclear proteins were assembled and subjected        to a series of analyses designed to reveal biases that        could result in an incorrect phylogeny                    Results and discussion        Analyses of the individual protein datasets using        neighborjoining    show that most  support        Coelomata while  support Ecdysozoa and  support        hypothesis III  Supplemental Table  fourtaxon        analysis Of the  proteins in which support for one of        the three hypotheses is significant   the results        are   proteins   and  respectively for        those ten proteins with a highly significant          topology the results are   proteins   and         respectively The four proteins showing significant        support  for a hypothesis other than Coelomata        were reanalyzed using maximum parsimony and maximum        likelihood bootstrap values were not significant using        other methods Such divided results are typical of        singlegene analyses because of limited information         amino acids necessitating combined analysis Coelomata        was supported significantly  bootstrap confidence        posterior probability   when the  fourtaxon        protein alignments were concatenated and analyzed using        neighborjoining maximum parsimony maximum likelihood        and Bayesian inference Fig A Using the        ShimodairaHasegawa SH test     this maximum        likelihood topology was significantly different from the        alternative hypotheses of Ecdysozoa          P   and Hypothesis III          P   These results agree        with earlier studies involving  nuclear proteins                     To test the stability of Coelomata to taxon sampling we        included new sequences of the planarian         Dugesia japonica Phylum        Platyhelminthes in  fivetaxon protein alignments         Supplemental Table  fivetaxon analysis The results        upon concatenation with this additional taxon were        unchanged Fig B Coelomata continued to be        significantly supported   bootstrap support posterior        probability   and the alternative hypotheses were both        rejected using the SH test          P   although the        relationships among the basal phyla Nematoda and        Platyhelminthes could not be resolved        Another potential bias is the specific taxa included in        an analysis For example the original support for        Ecdysozoa was obtained only with a particular genus of        nematode         Trichinella that had a short branch        in the S rRNA tree     To test this phylogenies were        constructed using different species of nematodes The        Coelomata hypothesis was significantly supported          bootstrap support posterior probabilities   Ecdysozoa        rejected by SH test         P   Hypothesis III rejected        by SH test         P   using either a genus in        a different order         Brugia  proteins or         Trichinella six proteins Fig C        D To further address the possibility that these results        could be biased by taxon sampling we included        representatives from all available phyla for each protein        The results indicate that an increase in the number of taxa        does not decrease singleprotein support for Coelomata in        fact the trend is the reverse Fig E Simulation        studies have shown that incomplete taxon sampling does not        increase topological errors and that most error is caused        by limited sequence data            In the initial study defining Ecdysozoa     rate        variation was considered to be the major bias affecting the        phylogenetic position of nematodes In the S rRNA gene        nematodes typically have long branches indicating an        increased rate of sequence change Other nuclear genes also        show this pattern but to a lesser degree             Phylogenetic methods can accommodate moderate amounts of        rate variation among lineages without producing an        incorrect phylogeny     However if the rate of change        is sufficiently large longer branches in a phylogeny will        sometimes attract one another     If that happens an        ingroup species with a long branch may move to a more basal        position in the tree In analyses of the S rRNA gene        nematodes typically appear basal to arthropods         vertebrates Because the use of a short branch nematode          Trichinella  resulted in a tree        whereby nematodes clustered with arthropods the basal        position of nematodes in typical S analyses has been        interpreted as longbranch attraction            If nematodes cluster basally because of longbranch        attraction then the strongest support for Ecdysozoa should        be obtained with the slowest evolving proteins This was        tested in an analysis of  nuclear proteins     but        the results were equivocal Therefore we tested this        suggestion with our fourtaxon data set of  proteins        ordered by rate of evolution Rate orders were determined        in two ways i nematode branch length and ii        vertebratearthropod pairwise distance The  proteins        were grouped into concatenations of  proteins and         proteins to increase statistical resolution The results        show support for Coelomata at all rate orders but the        support is significant with the slowest evolving proteins        regardless of rate measure or number of proteins combined        Fig  Concatenations of slow evolving proteins also        show compositional homogeneity pairwise disparity index        test         P       suggesting the        basal position of the nematode results from true        phylogenetic signal and not compositional bias Support for        Coelomata was weakest with the fastest evolving proteins        which also showed compositional heterogeneity indicating        that Ecdysozoa not Coelomata may be the result of a rate        bias compositional bias or other artifact        To ensure that this result was not affected by        mutational saturation in our data set the mean number of        variants per variable site was determined for each protein        and averaged for ten groups of proteins ordered by        evolutionary rate Fig A As predicted variable sites in        the faster evolving proteins showed a higher number of        variants than those in slowevolving proteins We also        examined the minimum number of nucleotide changes required        for sites where only the nematode sequence varied Fig B        Slowevolving proteins showed a smaller number of        nucleotide changes required to alter amino acid identity        while faster evolving proteins required more changes Thus        the nematode sequences in the slowevolving proteins do not        appear to be mutationally saturated        Finally the affect of lineagespecific rate variation        on support for Coelomata was tested with the use of        relative rate tests Presumably the selective elimination        of genes with long branches will increase statistical        support for the correct topology Individual proteins from        the fourtaxon data set were each subjected to two        different relative rate tests      Proteins        determined to be rateconstant at the typically applied        stringency level  significance and at two greater        stringency levels  and  significance were        concatenated and bootstrap support was determined using        neighbor joining The results of the two tests were        similar As stringency increased  of proteins were        rejected and the relative nematode branch length to the        arthropod and vertebrate branches dropped from  to         However in all cases Coelomata remained highly        significant Fig  Thus the suggestion that a basal        position of nematodes is the result of longbranch        attraction    can be rejected        Supplemental Table                 Proteins analyzed and bootstrap support for each        alternative hypothesis        TableSuppInfodoc        The importance of knowing the branching order of these        species is illustrated by the immediate and wide acceptance        of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis and its use in tracing patterns        of developmental evolution        However in the        initial analysis of S rRNA sequences     Ecdysozoa        was statistically significant only when a paralinear        distance method was used three other methods did not yield        significant bootstrap support In that study Ecdysozoa        also was not significant using any method when the        flatworm sequence was included     Subsequent analyses        of the S rRNA gene have been interpreted differently             but none has yielded statistically significant        results supporting Ecdysozoa Moreover the molting        cuticles of arthropods chitin and nematodes collagen        are not homologous     The significance of other        morphological characteristics bearing on the position of        nematodes continues to be debated            Besides the S rRNA evidence other genetic evidence        for the grouping of nematodes and arthropods has come from        qualitative interpretations of         Hox gene    and thymosin           evolution In the case of         Hox genes support comes from a        single posterior gene sequence YBA of the nematode         Caenorhabditis elegans argued to have        greater amino acid similarity with a posterior         Hox genes of         Drosophila and         Priapulus     Unfortunately the                Hox homeodomain is a short  amino        acid region with many sequence differences between these        taxa Definition of sequence signatures is qualitative        and has not been tested statistically In a subsequent        study of nematode posterior         Hox genes other researchers were        unable to determine if the simple nematode         Hox cluster of six genes is an        ancestral or a derived condition            In the case of thymosin a sequence signature also has        been argued to support a grouping of         Drosophila and         Caenorhabditis     However it        is a gene family known to have paralogs within animals the        position of introns differs between sequences from the two        species and only four other metazoan taxa were surveyed        In addition knowing the presence or absence of a gene can        be problematic without the complete genome sequence of an        organism in this case genomes were known only in         Drosophila and         Caenorhabditis  Thus although        suggestive it is too soon to judge the significance of        this sequence signature One difficulty with interpreting        such qualitative evidence including         Hox gene orthology is that almost        any pattern can be found in nature if one looks In other        words sequence signatures have not yet been surveyed        systematically and objectively In contrast sequence        evidence from randomly selected genes analyzed        phylogenetically provides a more unbiased database        amenable to statistical analysis                    Conclusions        Although it is possible that a basal position of        nematodes is the result of some unknown and widespread bias        not yet identified a simpler explanation is that the        grouping of nematodes with arthropods is an artifact that        arose from the analysis of a single gene S rRNA The        results presented here suggest caution in revising animal        phylogeny from analyses of one or a few genes or sequence        signatures Although many other aspects of animal phylogeny        remain unresolved our results indicate that insects        arthropods are genetically and evolutionarily closer to        humans vertebrates than to nematodes                    Materials and methods        DNA sequences from         Dugesia japonica    were used to        search the public protein database Entrez for orthologous        counterparts in         Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis        elegans Homo sapiens Arabidopsis thaliana Saccharomyces        cerevisiae and         Schizosaccharomyces pombe When        available sequences from other major animal phyla eg        Mollusca Echinodermata Annelida also were obtained In        addition the database was searched for all proteins from        two other nematodes         Brugia and         Trichinella with orthologs in         Drosophila Homo and         Arabidopsis Saccharomyces or         Schizosaccharomyces Arabidopsis was        used as the primary outgroup  out of  proteins in the        fourtaxon analysis  out of  proteins for the        fivetaxon analysis all proteins in         Brugia and         Trichinella analyses yeast was used        as the outgroup when         Arabidopsis sequences were        unavailable or paralogous This was because many more genes        were available for rooting with the plant than with the        fungus All three kingdoms are about equidistant from each        other in terms of branch lengths    and therefore a        plant serves about equally well for rooting an animal        phylogeny as does a fungus Orthology was assessed using        reciprocal BLAST searches of the public protein database        those sequences receiving high scores in each search were        also analyzed phylogenetically to ensure orthology Short
