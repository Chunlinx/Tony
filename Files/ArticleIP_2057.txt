                                 Dollars and Incense            I was prodded into thefreelancewriter business by the Oct   stockmarket crash Havingbeen employed as a writer at a major media conglomerate for many moons I hadcollected a substantial stake in the companys profitsharing plan So when theDow fell  points that day and my stake shrank by over  percent I washysterical But then I discovered something quite amazing about myprofitsharing plan Its rules stated that when you left the companys employyour share got paid out at the values in effect at the end of the precedingmonth  In other words if I retired by Oct   my payoff would be atSept  prices Dazzled by this magical opportunity to sell at precrashprices I negotiated a contract with my bosses to continue scribbling on afreelance basis and on Nov  I became a vendor of various editorialmaterials            The firstthing a fellow notices after attaining vendor status is that it is harder toget paid in a timely fashion As a writeremployee I had had my paychecksdeposited instantly and automatically in my bank account When I became acontract writer I got paid only after somebodyinitially it was a secretaryin the business departmentput in a requisition for my pay This seemed oddand unnecessarily complicated since my new contract called for me to receivethe same amount every month on the first of the month It seemed doubly oddwhen months came where the secretary forgot to put the requisition through Oralternatively where the secretary put the req through but then couldntremember whether the blessed event had taken place            To be fair there was only one didwepayyouthismonthcall But my diary shows endless fretting and nagging on my part as the sixthor the seventh or the  th of the month arrived and the check didnot The situation improved only marginally when the monthly requisitionsceased and my payment problems were essentially turned over to the corporateAccounts Payable department The payments were still generally late and oncenot having been paid as of the  th  I made the unsettling discoverythat I had somehow mysteriously dropped out of the AP payment programaltogether In the summer of  apparently responding to my endlesslamentations about late payments AP started paying me ahead of time ie afew days before the first of the month This was naturally fine with me until Irealized late in December that I was now in danger of getting a federal form showing  monthly payments and requiring more taxes sooner So Icomplained about this prospect and before long we were back to the defaultsituation chronic late payment I do not believeor at least cannotprovethat this signifies a cashmanagement playthefloat strategy by senioraccounting executives And yet there is this nagging question Would AccountsReceivable be as relaxed as Accounts Payable plainly is about money regularlychanging hands a week or more later than had been contractually specified            Speakingof form  I have still not decided what to do about the one I got someweeks back from Slate I had yearned to write for this online journal and wasdelighted last fall when editor Michael Kinsley gave me a shot at an articleIt was about the huge losses taken by the Nevada bookmakers on the HolyfieldTyson fightand I was delighted all over again when the article was posted Nov  onlyseven days after I had taken on the assignment How fast it all goes onlineWhat a marvelous contrast to the slowpoke print media Except for Microsoftspayment which arrived on Jan   in an envelope bearing a Dec  postmark The case law says plain as day that this is constructive receiptin  and the question I face is whether a sane person should fight touphold this principle after the Microsoft businessside characters havenonchalantly stuck him with a form  showing those earnings as income            Freelance writers must also deal with a lot ofpaperwork and printed forms plainly designed with other kinds of vendors inmind These other vendors are not guys sitting alone at home writing articlesThey are real companies with legal departments and humanresourcesdepartments And they are equipped to answer questions about the possibilitythat the enterprise is a small business concern as defined by Section  ofthe Small Business Actto mention only one of many thorny issues raised in afivepage form that landed on my desk several weeks ago            Leadingup to its arrival was a telephone query from an editor of a financial journalthat had recently published some of my thoughts on the stock market Did weever send you the paperwork we need so we can pay you Naively assuming thatthis would be a request for my mailing address and Social Security number Ivolunteered to provide this information right then and there on the phone Butno the publisher of the financial journalagain it was a huge Fortune companyneeded to know much much more about me A special toughie was therequest for my Dun  Bradstreet SIC number I assumed at first that thiswas some variant of the principal business or professional activity code thatfreelancers are required to enter on federal Schedule C where you reportbusiness profits            Like thousands of others in my line of work every year attax time I wrestle with the issue of which fourdigit number to write in onthis schedule the instructions for which mention a huge number ofselfemployment scenarios none of them envisioning a guy creating copy in hisden Generally I have ended up choosing No  meaning that I provideother business services which leaves me feeling somewhat marginalized butlooks as though it would at least be defensible in a showdown with the IRS Butthat was my fourdigit code The DB codes as I ascertained afterextensive cruising around on the Internet had eight or in some accounts ninedigits and provided much more detailed information about ones place in theeconomy But how to find out ones number Instructions that came with the formcounseled checking with your tax department oran even less realistic optionfor a fellow needing to get some work donethe local office of the SmallBusiness Administration In the end I brazenly sent the form back without anyDB code and one of these days I hope to get paid for my musings on themarket            As a New York City residentI get to pay city income taxes twice Its incredible and it works this wayThe s one garners during the year are of course cumulated and reported onfederal Schedule C then carried over to New York state form IT whichtakes you through the state and then the city incometax calculations Thecombined marginal rate for the state and city taxes was recently running around percent which is bad enough But when you have paid it all the New YorkCity Department of Taxation and Finance taps you on a figurative shoulderreminds you that the city also has an Unincorporated Business Tax and statesfirmly that freelance writers gotta pay this too The UBT covers the sameearned income paid to the city on form IT and this time around the billcomes to a flat  percent after  of deductions and exemptions            Not one employed journalistin  has even heard of this ghastly double dip or experienced the surge offury I felt when I called up the Authors League in  to ask why theywerent screaming about it The woman I spoke to coolly asked how much I madeas a writer judged the amount too high to warrant condolences and said Ishould be glad to pay my share She was obviously not a vendor
