                uh well uh the Cowboys are my favorite team thats pretty easy to say nowadays lot easier than it was a couple years ago       but they had a big win today uh did you get to watch it   no i didnt i uh have been at my computer all day so   oh are you a Cowboy fan     well i used to be a real big Cowboys fan and and uh im not at Jimmy Johnsons fan       being an Okie   right yeah   i just really dont care much uh its its kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan though   uhhuh   theyve always been you know my favorite   right   but uh and and i guess i still have a soft spot i just hate that thats the coach  thats leading them so now have they theyre in the playoffs right   yet   right right yeah they made it to the playoffs finally like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen they won like just one game and so its a pretty fast turn around but this year they made it to playoffs and today was their first game and they beat the Chicago Bears so everybodys really going crazy you know down here   ill bet they are   theyre going crazy so so they turned it around but yeah they have a lot of young exciting players now up i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired Tom Landry but you know now its like you know theyre doing good so everybodys forgotten about that   uh at football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world   uhhuh   hit a bad season and its you know the coachs fault lets lets dump him   right   first good season the coach can do no wrong   right   but theyve Dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and and both running   exactly you know umhum   running backs and and defense   right  yeah uh you know they have a young team its you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where its the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything so now its you know like a taste of something different theyre all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be now its like you know       tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited and     whos their competition gonna be   well its supposed to be the Redskins but you know we beat them already we beat them this year in in Washington so you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl but you know its just that we have to play every game away you know its gonna be tough but but every their competition is are teams that theyve already beat this year so i mean Atlanta theyre in it too and we beat them and uh see Detroit we play them next week but you know we should beat them everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so its  so everything is uh looking real good   course i think you know you cant really go by what happened earlier in the season   umhum   because teams jell together or theyve had injuries that heal and you know it can be a totally or injuries that uh have newly happened   right right right   and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one you played   yeah well the Cowboys are on a roll theyve won like i think six or seven in a row now so theyre supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the playoffs so   well well since you have a OU uh drop out  as a quarterback   uh right yeah Troy Aikman he got hurt at OU so he transferred to UCLA   well he he really didnt feel like hed be able to do a lot of passing at OU   right   OUs always been known for their running game more than   umhum theyre playing tonight in fact im watching them on TV right now   right   but theyre doing some stomping on Virginia   oh i tell you theyve theyve not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts   really well theyre doing good tonight   are they i havent been watching   yeah theyre winning theyre winning forty one to seven   well good for us  oh   yeah right but yeah and uh thats right Aikman did go to OU i forgot about that   yep they had then he went out to lets see Southern Cal is that where you went   yeah uh UCLA yeah   yeah so   but the Cowboys did good today i mean i was proud i thought i thought they would get beat today because i mean theyre so young you know playoffs
