                                 Proud Bear            MostRussian newspapers have been crowing about Russia stealing a march over NATO inKosovo though one or two have queried the wisdom of the move The dailySegodnya said Tuesday that the Russian masterminds of the Kosovocampaign clearly failed to consider the consequences of plonking  Russianparatroopers at Pristina airport before the allies got there The greatestdanger was not that they would be left without food and reinforcementsBulgaria and Hungary having refused to provide Russia with an air corridorinto Kosovo but that they could be subject to attacks by the Kosovo LiberationArmy which had already brought units into the Pristina suburbs KLA fighterswould target the Russian peacekeepers which would have to rely on NATO fortheir protection the paper said The Neue Zrcher Zeitung of Switzerland led Wednesday with Russiapressing for the immediate disarmament of the KLA The Kommersant Dailysaid the Russian soldiers had been lured into a trap because they would haveto hold out until at least the weekend when the G summit takes place inCologne Germany It is only then that the paratroopers will become Russiastrump card in a political game between the G leaders it said Otherwisethe thrust to Pristina will have been a spectacular but ineffectiveaction                           Izvestia  however believes that this act of bravado hasalready achieved a lot by showing the West that it cannot brush Russia asideWestern politicians who have got into the habit of confronting Russia withfaits accomplis will now know that the Kremlin too is capable ofgetting its coup in first the paper said Washingtons strategy of gettingRussia to win the peace for it and then after dividing Kosovo into five NATOzones casting it out has proven its futility Komsomolskaya Pravdamade the same point saying this is the first time in  years that Russia hasmanaged to score a point off Western diplomats and NATO brass MoskovskayaPravda said the coup means that NATO would not after all be able toimpose its authority on the Russian forces in Kosovo but the paper criticizedthe Kremlin for not going further When Pristina airport was under ourcontrol we should have landed a Russian contingent there immediately itsaid even though this would have meant cooler relations with the West andprobably a suspension of Russias negotiations with the International MonetaryFund            As toRussias claim that its paratroopers premature incursion had been a mistakethis was ruled out in Izvestia by the chairman of the Dumas ForeignRelations Committee Vladimir Lukin who said in an interview that onlyPresident Boris Yeltsin could have given the order for the troops to go inThe Russian generals did not act at all in opposition to the political will ofthe countrys leadership Lukin said He added that the move was in keepingwith the relevant UN Security Council resolution because instead of a UNoperation a NATO operation had got under way  The blitz march of ourtroops was an attempt to make matters develop in full compliance with the UNresolution Lukin added that the West should treat Russia as a partner not alackey but he ruled out any clashes between Russian and NATO troops in Kosovobecause the allied commanders realize perfectly well that Russia was rightlegally and morally            Coverage of Kosovo in Western European papers Wednesday focused mainly onhorrific new evidence of Serbian massacres and on anxieties about the KLAwhich the Sddeutsche Zeitung of Munich reported is occupyingstrategic positions in Kosovo and hampering the Serb retreat Both DieWelt of Germany and Corriere della Sera of Milan led on the Serbian OrthodoxChurch demanding the resignation of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic inthe interests of the people and his replacement by a government of nationalsalvation Describing the churchs influence as enormous Corrieresaid this was the first severe attack on the Serbian regime            TheArab press returned Tuesday to one of its favorite themes Will Washingtonafter dealing with Milosevic have another go at toppling Saddam Hussein Themost frequent answer was yes though an article last weekend in the PanArabalQuds alArabisaid Jordan was increasingly convinced that the United States has no plans toremove the Iraqi leader by force The article said that Jordan which bordersIraq has seen no signs of American military preparations and believes theUnited States may be deterred from fresh action by Iraqs intensivepreparations over the past nine months for a final showdown            But inthe PanArab alHayat Tuesday there were two articles predicting thatthe United States will adopt a much more aggressive Middle East policy afterKosovo The Jordanian commentator Salameh Nematt wrote that the defeat ofMilosevic was a resounding demonstration of Washingtons power and its abilityto foil attempts by radical rulers  to defy the New World Order which itleads So in a different way was the defeat at the ballot box of IsraeliPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who fell as a result of sustained politicalbombardment Nematt said Kosovo had given the United States greatercredibility in the Middle East and broader room for maneuver since a number ofstates that Washington classifies as radical such as Syria and Libya haveshown that they fully understand the rules of the game and have taken todealing with America much more intelligently and pragmatically than before Hesaid This may be Baghdads last chance to learn lessons from the developmentsof the past few months and appreciate the futility of entering into a freshstandoff with the US irrespective of the justice or injustice of USpolicy in the MidEast            Another alHayat article said that American shamelessness is set tomake a major comeback in the region as since Kosovo there is no prospectof persuading the policymakers in Washington that they are not alwaysrightjust as it was impossible to persuade Saddam that he did not win the Gulf War or Milosevic that it was his savagery which led to the latestbombing campaign and provided NATO with moral cover for its first dirty war We cannot expect US officials to change the way they think about theregion with all their arrogance highhandedness and ignorance ofrealities            The CocaCola scare inEurope led the front page of the Financial Times  which said the company is fighting torecover consumer confidence after about  Belgians fell ill after drinkingCoke The FT said it evoked memories of the  Perrier scare whentraces of benzene were found in the mineral water This is believed to havecost the French company around  million it said A story reported in mostBritish newspapers Wednesday concerned a banana skin found in a Tudor garbagedump near the Tower of London Giving this frontpage treatment theTimes of London said the banana dating from the s could have beennibbled by King Henry VIIIwhich is odd since bananas were previously thoughto have first arrived in England about  years later
