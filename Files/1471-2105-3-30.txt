                    Background        In higher eukaryotes many genes feature differential        spatialtemporal expression during development and        throughout the life cycle of the organism Their complex        transcription regulation is thought to be achieved by the        combinatorial action of multiple transcription factors        which bind to         cis regulatory DNA sequences Here        transcription factors are defined as proteins which        recognize and bind regulatory sites and have a potential to        modulate directly or indirectly through the recruitment of        cofactors the activity of the basal transcriptional        apparatus of proximal genes The number of transcription        factors is a substantial part of the total number of genes        in any organism for example about  out of  genes        in Drosophila            Although combinatorial action of transcription factors        has been studied throughout the life cycle of organisms            perhaps the most coherent picture has emerged in the        context of developmental processes      Here a great        number of experiments suggest that a major part of the gene        regulatory apparatus is organized in the form of separable         cis regulatory modules     A        given module defines specific aspects of the        spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression by the        combinatorial action of multiple transcription factors        which together define the rate of transcription Modules        thus integrate inputs from several genes and regulate        another gene to form developmental networks Modules seem        to share several architectural features     They are        typically only hundreds of nucleotides in length and        contain multiple binding sites for as many as  different        transcription factors The frequent occurence of multiple        copies of the same motif as well as the enrichment of        certain combinations of motifs in a module in comparison        with the genome at large provide the basis for our        computational strategies to predict genes which are part of        the same regulatory network Existing algorithms for        discovering modules      are based on counting the        number of matches of a certain minimal strength to known        motifs and thus require adhoc parameters for each motif        resulting in parameter dependent predictions These        algorithms are also bound to miss multiple weak binding        sites which are known to be present in many modules We        demonstrate a novel algorithm Ahab which overcomes these        problems        However the binding sites motifs which reside in        modules are often not known A recent paper    proposed        an algorithm for identfying these sites here we show that        a standard method is capable of identifying typically half        of the known binding sites in a module Its entire output        can then be used as input to Ahab Figure  Finally we        ask if the redundancy of sites inside modules is strong        enough to predict modules using only genomic sequence To        our knowledge our algorithm Argos is the first successful        attempt to do this for a metazoan genome        Our system of choice is the body patterning of the early        Drosophila embryo which is established by a multitiered        hierarchy of transcription factors     Broadly        distributed maternal factors trigger zygotic gap gene        expression in discrete domains along the anteriorposterior        axis of the embryo Maternal and gap gene factors together        trigger pair rule gene expression in  alternating stripes        which in turn regulate segment polarity and homeotic gene        expression in  stripes Many of these factors are known        their binding sites have been studied and more than         modules have been identified For this system we show by        comparing our predictions to literature results that we can        predict regulatory modules using different levels of input         binding sites regulatory sequence identified by        promoter bashingsufficiency tests and genomic sequence        itself Altogether we predict roughly  new modules and         new sequence motifs and we analyze and validate the        performance of each of the three algorithms        Figure summarizes the inputoutput levels and serves as        a reference for what follows                    Results                  Using known binding sites Ahab finds           significant new modules in the genome          There are a sufficient number of binding sites in the          literature see additional File and  for us to          construct frequency weight matrices for the maternal          transription factors Bicoid Bcd Caudal Cad and          Dorsal Dl as well as the zygotic gap gene factors          Hunchback Hb Kruppel Kr Knirps Kni and Tailless          Tll and the torso response element torRE With the          exception of giant which is too illdefined to model          these are all the maternalgap genes at the top of the          segmentation gene hierarchy          Modules can be located by scanning the genome in          windows counting the number of matches to each matrix          with a score better than some value and then combining          scores and ranking      We have designed an          algorithm Ahab which eliminates all parameters other          than a final rank and following the logic of the          mobydick algorithm     computes via maximum          likelihood the probability that the window sequence is          made up by sampling from the known weight matrices or          background Mobydick was designed to find overrepresented          words in noncoding DNA and applied to yeast However          in the genomes of higher eukaryotes binding sites are          much fuzzier than in yeast and simple motif models are          unlikely to yield meaningful results Therefore Ahab          generalizes the motif model to positional weightmatrices          Furthermore we introduce a           local background model to cut down          the number of false positives arising from local          variations in sequence composition and degeneracy of          motifs for example motifs that contain a poly A string          Finally the maximum likelihood fit has to be done          separately for each window and thus hundreds of millions          of times for the genomes of higher eukaryotes thus          requiring an efficient implementation of the numerical          procedures Ahab tallies all possible segmentations of          the sequence into binding sites also called parsings          Thus motif overlaps are allowed and weighted according to          how well they explain the data and multiple weak copies          of a factor are all counted      Our background          model is a Markov model fit to all triples of bases in          the window and accounts for local compositional variation          which could otherwise push up the representation of any          matrix that matched one of the high copy number base          triples eg hb matches poly A tracts          Additional file                     Click here for file          Additional file                     Click here for file

As a representativetypical example we          show the hairy locus Fig  a pairrule gene expressed          in  stripes Five modules driving individual stripes and          stripe pairs have been identified experimentally Ahab          predicts four of them stripes     only the          stripe  element is not recovered Note that two          modules stripes  and  were not used as training data          The support for each local maximum corresponds nicely to          the experimentally estimated sizes of the modules Ahab          also reports scores for putative binding sites in each          window as defined by  As an example we show the          evenskipped stripe  module one of the best studied          cases in the literature Fig  Most of the known sites          are recovered and some new ones predicted          Ahab finds  highly significant modules in the          genome most located in the nontranscribed regions           modules are inside introns only  overlap with exons It          recovers the  modules used to construct our weight          matrices and predicts  other known modules with          maternalgap gene input Thus  out of  known modules          see additional File  are found Three of the missing           modules kni snail sog are very high in score           rank  but lost when filtering for the presence          of at least three different factors Three modules are          lost because they contain only dorsal sites rho twist          zen and we do not have matrices for the other factors          known to bind such as snail and twist however          searching with only the dorsal weight matrix does recover          them The four remaining missing modules are low in score          rank   but Kruppel CD is recovered for a          window size of  the others are evidently low in          maternalgap gene binding sites          To determine whether any of the  novel module          predictions were correct we asked whether any of the          adjacent genes were patterned in the blastoderm For           modules patterned expression has been reported for one of          the adjacent genes the patterns are either gap or pair          rule like An additional  modules are suggestive since          they are clustered with another nonoverlapping          prediction Table  Interestingly two predicted          modules are in proximity to well studied segmentation          genes giant runt but still outside known regulatory          regions          We tested the stability of Ahab against unspecific          input weight matrices by eliminating the least specific          matrix in our list Tailless Tailless has           predicted sites in the  modules Table  twice as          much as any other factor However we found that roughly            of the predictions without using tailless but with          the same significance cutoff were also present in the          list of  Thus although Tailless is rather          unspecific it makes a contribution to the predictions          without dominating them          We also varied the window size to  bp and masked          out the repeats genome wide before running Ahab see          web site Our top  predictions now included  out of          the  known modules see additional File and           Lowering the cutoff value in the module score did not          help only one additional known module was recovered when          including ranks  Overall  modules or   of          the window  dataset are also among the top  of the          window  set and thus might be accorded more          significance Although some known modules disappeared          some very interesting new modules are predicted in          window  runs including modules for key genes in the          segmentation process such as caudal grainyhead odd          skipped odd and sloppy paired  slp see          additional File  Thus Ahab could be improved by          allowing for variable window lengths          We estimated the false positive rate by scrambling the          columns positions in the input frequency matrices The          new matrices are thus unlikely to be functional but          retain the same specificity Ahab found roughly half as          many modules for the same score cutoff as for the          original set ie a  false positive rate Note that this          is a conservative estimate because part of the consensus          motif recognized by hunchback and caudal is largely a          poly T motif and thus preserved by scrambling Moreover          only very few known patterned gene are predicted by the          scrambled matrices          Another perhaps more straightforward estimate of          statistical significance and our true positive rate is to          use the experimental result see footnote in     that          less than  of the genome or  genes are patterned          during the blastoderm Since we can not tell which of two          neighboring genes is regulated by each of the           intergenic modules we predict we are obliged to label           genes adding the  genes with intragenic modules          as potentially patterned For  random predictions one          expects  or five genes to be patterned and the          probability to get  or more genes see additional File           by chance pvalue is   It should be stressed          that the true success rate of Ahab will be much higher          since the number of genes for which blastoderm expression          is demonstrated is   or  of the total Thus          we expect an additional  genes in our set to be          patterned so a  overall positive rate for our module          predictions                          The Gibbs sampler finds binding sites within          experimentally characterized modules          Binding site information for most of the transcription          factors relevant to any developmental process is only          rarely available More common are modules obtained by          promoter bashing from several genes with similar          expression Thus it is natural to ask in view of the          site repetition within modules whether standard motif          finders are able to recover good weight matrices from          modules and if so can these be used as input to Ahab to          find genes with similar regulatory inputs          We have tailored the Gibbs algorithm see methods to          this problem by searching for only one site at a time          and then masking only the central  bases of each          sequence motif found before iterating The results were          thereby much more reproducible between runs Most          importantly motifs were allowed to overlap a very          common occurrance in modules and arguably important for          their function              To gain confidence in the capabilities of the Gibbs          algorithm we prepared two synthetic data sets          representative of the data we wanted to examine eg          several kb long  of the sequence covered by          motifs the remaining sequence random and  AT Data          set  was made by equally sampling our Hb Cad Kr and          Tll matrices Data set  was generated from four          synthetic frequency matrices of specificity equal to the          known ones The customized Gibbs virtually perfectly          recovers all the synthetic weight matrices from dataset           By contrast only half of the natural sites were          recovered from dataset  The sites overlapped and their          delineation was imperfect Thus Gibbs detects sequence          correlations among the factors we chose but probably          exaggerates them because it computes significance based          on single base frequencies          We then ran the Gibbs algorithm on several modules          with extensive binding site data Table  In accord with          experiment Gibbs predicts that about  of the          sequence is covered by motifs The specificity of the          Gibbs motifs is typically higher than for the          experimental ones presumably because a smaller number of          sites is sampled Even when the majority of the sequences          composing the Gibbs motif match a single factor there          are a few other strong factor matches generally in          different positions and perhaps the other orientation          Nevertheless the Gibbs motifs are largely reproducible          between runs Generally we recover about half the          factors known to influence the module and interestingly          predict several new motifs The lack of a           correspondence between the experimental motifs generally          composed from a wider range of data then presented to          Gibbs and those we find points to a real ambiguity we          believe in how to parse a sequence into binding          sites                          Using only three modules as input Ahab finds           significant modules in the genome          Next we tested whether Gibbs derived matrices can be          fed to Ahab for a genomewide search for modules As          samples we used three known modules that drive          expression of the pair rule gene hairy in stripes            and  which are known to receive input from Bcd Cad          Hb Kni Kr and Tll see additional File           Customized Gibbs finds  highly significant weight          matrices within the  kb composite module see additional          File  One matches the Kr weight matrix with high          quality another Kni and a third represents a mixture of          Hb and Cad whose matrices are indeed quite similar due          to a poly T motif The other three motifs are new Using          these  weight matrices as input Ahab finds  highly          significant modules genomewide Table  additional File                    The top four modules overlap with those used in the          Gibbs sampling In addition  new modules were          contiguous to genes that are known to be patterned in the          blastoderm and two fall close to a single gene of          unknown function One of the top scoring modules is the          hunchback central stripe module other particularly          interesting hits are in the intron of knirps and  kb          upstream of hairy outside the known regulatory region          and proximal to emc a known transcriptional          corepressor Compared to the Ahab predictions we find          more modules near homeotic genes AbdA abdB Ubx          hth due to the presence of the novel Gibbs motifs The          statistical significance of our predictions and the          inferred true positive rate are comparable to the          segmentation gene results                          Argos prediction of regulatory modules from raw          genomic sequence          As a final generalization we ask whether there is          enough repetition of sequence motifs within a module for          its discovery using no information other than the          noncoding sequence in the genome To determine whether a          given motif is locally overrepresented its frequency of          occurrence has to be scored against some statistical          model Both Ahab and Gibbs use counts of short strings          or single bases within the window of interest to compute          the significance of longer motifs We attempted running          Gibbs on successive windows of sequence and scoring the          resulting motifs with Ahab but were not able to          discriminate the known modules from the remainder of the          upstream region          We therefore devised an alternative strategy that uses          the information available in all the noncoding sequence          and thus extrinsic to the window of interest We          enumerate all motifs in a class a consensus of length           and  mutations worked best and use their frequency to          assign a probability for observing an overrepresentation          of any one of them in the window of interest The actual          binding motifs may be longer we only need to capture the          most significant region Typically several hundred motifs          are significant for each window They heavily overlap so          the individual motif scores can not be simply added for          an overall score Although we tried using Ahab to          eliminate redundant motifs we got better results with a          greedy algorithm that looks only at the motifs without          placing them on the sequence The greedy algorithm          winnows the list of motifs down by starting with the          highest scoring one and eliminates any motif related to          it under shifts and a limited number of mutations The          next remaining motif is retained and overlaps with it are          eliminated until  quasi independent motifs are          obtained whose scores can be added details in additional          File           We evaluated the results of Argos for the the modules          in additional File  Log probability scores   were          taken as significant since they are found very rarely          using randomized noncoding sequence  With this          threshold and at least l bp overlap half of the          modules were recovered indicating a  false negative          rate The number of false positives is difficult to          assess because the code looks for           any regulatory module However for          several well studied segmentation genes specifically          evenskipped giant hairy hunchback knirps Kruppel          and tailless with  known modules we squarely hit           when looking over the entire  kb upstream of          translation start gt kni Kr KrCD eve eve          autoregulatory element h Fig  but only three          predictions are outside of known modules one for          tailless and two for hunchback This indicates a low          false positive rate Genome wide we are predicting about          one module per  kb of noncoding sequence averaged over          the genome with a strong bias for noncoding vs coding          which corresponds to roughly one module per gene                            Discussion        We have demonstrated algorithms that exploit three very        different levels of prior information and lead to        statistically highly significant predictions for early        developmental modules in the fly The Ahab algorithm is        perhaps closest to the calculation actually performed by        the cell The weight matrix match is a surrogate for the        energetic preference of a transcription factor for a        particular sequence and Ahab models the competition of        several factors and their binding energies for a stretch of        DNA a module Ahab ignores distances between binding        sites and the actual factor concentrations Thus the        success of Ahab suggests that just modeling the binding        energies is already predictive It will be interesting to        see how well Ahab performs in situations where the        concerted binding of cofactors constrains the spacing of        binding sites             Finding overrepresented weight matrices is a well        studied problem for which Gibbs sampling constitutes a        reasonable solution if the data consists of distinct motifs        separated by random bases The difficulty we have        encountered with this algorithm in dissecting regulatory        modules for binding sites is not rare or diffuse motifs but        rather too much signal namely the overlay of motifs of        different sizes and specificities The Gibbs statistical        model is not strictly correct for our data A more adequate        algorithm would allow competition among motifs of different        lengths     Irrespective of technical problems the        discovery of binding motifs by site repetition is        qualitatively a more difficult task than their recognition        by transcription factors     Thus our ability to        recover plausible motifs for about half the known factors        was not obvious in advance and is another manifestation of        the redundancy in module design        Reference    describes another approach to locating        modules from clusters of known weight matrices They count        the number of matches of each weight matrix in an interval        with a score above some empirically defined cutoff and        then score a  bp window as significant when the total        number of matches for all factors is large enough        Information about the background is implicitly encoded in        their choice of threshold We do not have factor specific        cutoffs and use a locally defined background model which        renders our algorithm more automatic and less sensitive to        local variation in sequence composition eg poly A        runs        Although we are predicting many more modules than in            the positive hit rates are comparable between the two        methods  vs  positives out of  predictions            A more detailed comparison of both data sets reveals        however that the  modules predicted by     with the        exception of the giant one do not overlap with any of the        top  modules predicted by Ahab although there are         genes in common to our sets More strikingly the         modules for which experimental results in    suggest        functionality based on blastoderm expression of a        neighboring gene fall below  in our ranking with        exception of giant and one of the hairy derived modules for        nub Table  Presumably due to the difference in        background model their modules are dominated by Hb sites        while ours are not which contributes considerably to the        divergence of the predictions Clearly only direct        experimental validation of predicted modules through        reporter gene fusions will help to compare the different        methods In this fashion we plan to test a number of the        new modules predicted for key genes in the segmentation        system such as h run gt odd prd slpl and cad        In order to understand regulatory networks of genes it        is useful to generalize from a few genes or modules with        common functions to new candidates When control is        combinatoric a purely experimental approach tends to be        more tedious than screening a modest list of candidates        Thus a potentially important aspect of our work is the        combination of motif discovery from modules via Gibbs        sampling and generalization to the entire genome with Ahab        We have demonstrated the feasibility of this procedure when        we worked from the hairy stripe  modules Interestingly        the candidate list of similar modules genome wide was quite        small but had little overlap with the top scoring modules        predicted from the full set of gap gene weight matrices        Hopefully some of the new motifs discovered by Gibbs        sampling are real perhaps they are binding sites for        corepressors Clearly the first step is to confirm a        striped expression for some of the genes in Table         Our algorithm Argos for predicting enhancers from raw        genomic sequence works astonishingly well It will be most        interesting to use this approach together in conjunction        with the customized Gibbs sampler and Ahab in situations        where nothing is known experimentally about the        transcriptional regulation of genes of interest to identify        coregulated genes Namely following the hierarchical        structure in Figure  Argos could be used to predict        modules then the customized Gibbs sampler to predict        binding sites weight matrices and finally Ahab to        predict genome wide genes in the same regulatory        network        Several recent papers      as well as ours have        taken only the very first steps in applying computational        approaches to the the elucidation of         cis regulatory modules For body        patterning in the fly it is very encouraging that such        limited information as we have used works so well It        remains to be seen if the same approaches work on systems        where a single master regulatory gene initiates a        developmental cascade or where integration of        developmental cues occurs partly at the level of signal        transduction                    Conclusions        Predicting and understanding transcriptional regulation        is a fundamental problem in biology We have designed new        algorithms for the detection of         cis regulatory modules in the        genomes of higher eukaryotes which is a first step in        unraveling transcriptional regulatory networks We have        demonstrated in the case of body patterning in the         Drosophila embryo that our        algorithms allow the genomewide identification of        regulatory modules when the motifs for the transcription        factors are known algorithm Ahab or when only related        modules are known customized Gibbs sampler in conjunction        with Ahab or when only genomic sequence is analyzed with        Argos We believe that Ahab overcomes many problems of        recent studies and we estimated the false positive rate to        be about  Argos is the first successful attempt to        predict regulatory modules using only the genome without        training data All our results and module predictions        across the         Drosophila genome

using a map provided by David          Emmert private communication Since our algorithms are          based on searching for clusters of common sites          microsatellites can score high but tend not to be          functional for an exception see     We used the          Tandem Repeat Remover    to mask microsatellites          with scoring parameters                 respectively match

microsatellites in random          sequences With these settings  of all non coding          sequences are masked          We collected from the experimental literature modules          that drive blastoderm specific expression of a reporter          gene in response to several of the factors in our list          In many cases the module was shown to be the minimal          element The modules mapped to chromosomal coordinates          are reported in the additional File           We collected a total of  experimentally          characterized sites for the factors bicoid  sites

fitting multiple weightmatrices to          sequence          Ahab computes an optimal probabilistic segmentation of          a sequence           S into binding sites and background          for a fixed set           W of sequence motifs modelled by          weight matrices Ahab is related to the mobydick          algorithm     but has several novel key features          described in detail in the results section and the          additional File  It fits the probabilities           p                       w            of the fixed matrices           w and background           p                       B             so as to maximize the likelihood of generating           S under a certain explicit model          Namely select a weight matrix or background according to          its probability           p                       w                       p                       B             sample according to the predetermined frequencies          and add the resulting bases to the sequence under          construction The fit of the model to           S is accomplished by defining the          probability of a particular segmentation T of           S as                    where           k              N            T  labels the weight matrices or          background which were used in segmentation           T  The quality of the match          between the weight matrix           w                       k            and the subsequence           s             n                       n                       l             is incorporated in           m            s            w                       k               where           f                       j                       n            w                       k             are the normalized frequencies of nucleotide           n at position           j for weight matrix           w                       k                      An important consequence of equation  is that          multiple binding sites with weak matches to the weight          matrix for the same factor  large           m            s            w                       k             small may make an important contribution to           P            T  In many cases these redundant          sites with low weight matrix scores have been observed in          experimentally known modules Any algorithm that would          just count matches of sequences to a weight matrix above          a certain threshold would have to use adhoc measures to          incorporate these sites into the score Note also that          the weight matrix only captures the sequence dependent          part of the binding energy so weak binding could          equally well be termed nonspecific We know too little          about the physical binding energies of transcription          factors and their cofactors and protein concentrations          in vivo to calculate whether any modules are actually          occupied by factors          Ahab uses a           local Markov model of order           q for background sequence that is          a single base           n at site           j is segmented with probability           p                       B                      f                       j                       n            B  where                        n                      f                       j                       n            B    and           f                       j                       n            B  is contingent on the           q preceding bases following the          usual Markov model definitions The           f                       j            are computed by enumerating all           q   tuples of bases in           S which has the effect of          suppressing the number of copies of any           w which match frequent triples of          bases eg poly A tracts we typically use           q            The likelihood           Z to observe           S is then                    Dynamic programming allows the calculation of           Z            S  in a time proportional to the          sequence length and the number of weight matrices The          maximization of           Z            S  then determines           p                       wB            see additional File  The likelihood           Z                       B            that           S comes from background only ie           p                       B              is trivially computed from the Markov model          The score           R that           S is a regulatory module is then in          logodds units                    At each position           i              L in           S the probability           P                       i                       w            S  to observe the start of weight          matrix           w of length           l                       w            is computed by standard posterior decoding Let           Z            i j  denote the likelihood for          the sequence           S from position           i up to           j The symbol           Z            S  used above is just           Z            L                     using the optimized           p                       w            s The sum of equation  over all positions is          the average copy number of           w in the data Summing over all          segmentations  naturally allows for overlapping sites          and the profile  quantifies the competition between          different factors for the same bases          It takes a modern LINUX workstation about  days to          run Ahab over the entire genome with a  bp window          moved in  bp steps fitting the gap gene weight          matrices we collected We enumerated all local maxima in          the score           R larger than  and eliminated          those within  bp of a higher scoring peak and obtained           disjoint regions If we insist that at least           different factors contribute to the module with          individual average copy numbers of at least  the number          of modules reduces to  and eliminating all candidates          with  or more basepairs masked by the Tandem Repeat          Remover gave a final list of  modules Predictions          with more than  bases overlap with a known module or          with an overlap of at least  of the length of the          known module were considered to be a recovered known          module                          Determination of motifs from modules          We ran locally the Gibbs sampler algorithm provided by          C Lawrences group at          httpwwwwadsworthorgresnresbioinfo as described          in Results We generally used a motif length of  bp and          allowed the algorithm to vary this by  if the data          warranted and took a prior copy number of  when fitting           kb of data again the algorithm will adjust this          number Other parameters were taken as default and          under these conditions typically  distinct motifs were          fit          To decide whether Gibbs derived motifs matched known          ones we ran the known weight matrices in both          orientations over the individual sequences composing the          motif plus five flanking bases and computed the position          that maximized the information score The Gibbs motif was          deemed to match a known factor if           a single known matrix was the top match to a          majority of the sequences           the optimal match occurred at the same position          with some variability allowed for factors such as hb          with polyA regions           the information score of the match was comparable          to the score of the sequences which define the matrix to          the matrix itself and not dominated by the flanking          bases           the preceding conditions were met in two          independent runs with typically  runs done for each          data set
