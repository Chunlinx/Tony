                                 ER vs HRC                        Dear Chris            To begin with the end of your last entry I find I have to give you someground on Cooks reflexive leftism It is wrong to equate anticommunismwith opposition to all public improvements and Cook does tend to caricatureall anticommunism under the rubric Red Scare I cant see Cooks puttingfreedom in quotes as anything but a perfectly respectable rhetorical devicethough Are you the same Chris Caldwell whose excellent recent Standardreport on Hillarys Senate campaign included the observation that most of theneighbors  rustled up for her initial appearance were in fact Democraticactivists            Im asking myself why I so easily read past all such lefty rhetoric in thisbio I pretty much took it as a givenlike the local weather as you so nicelyput itand at least felt that Cook took no pains to conceal her point of viewI suspect myself of an endofhistory mellowness about it Which I raisebecause it seems to speak to the question of why I come down on the side ofadmiring Eleanor but really cant bring myself to like Hillary Clinton            Your theory that Eleanors dogoodism is distinguished from Hillarys by itsreactive nature doesnt quite work for me Even though Eleanor had amiserable childhood I dont buy it as the complete explanation for her empathytoward the downtrodden I was as least equally interested inand impressedbyCooks awareness of how much Eleanor came to savor power I think itsmore about circumstance When ER talked about the excitement of forming a newsocial order well she had a point Her husbands administration was in themidst of saving capitalism from itself And ER was talking about the redress ofsome of the more shameful circumstances of prewar life lynching child labortotal segregation pervasive poverty Whats not to reorder            When Hillary came along and spoke at a similar rhetorical pitch she wastalking to a generation of contented fellow boomers in an era of prosperityat a time when social norms have shifted hugelyto the goodin a moreprogressive direction No the heaven of racial harmony has not been achievedand yes of course any number of social pathologies persist But Hillary hasalways seemed to chide us as if we were all mossback fat cats of the s whowere getting ready to go down to the TransLux and boo Roosevelt isnt thathow that other great cartoon of the times went            That note in her voice of the unreconstructed left is the same one Ipretty much tuned out in reading Cooks bio I suspect the world is dividedbetween people who tune it out and people who are driven crazy by it with asmall remaining percentage who agree with it These are the same people whoheld rallies to support Clinton during his impeachment and called the Housemanagers ayatollahs Hillarys success in driving some people crazy with itis whats made her so darned successful at attracting the right enemies atleast But it leaves meand polls suggest the vast majority of my fellowAmericanswishing a pox on all their houses            Still the parallels between Hillary and Eleanor are irresistibly strikingA bright intense young woman marries a profligately charming man who takes herhome to his disapproving mother She is dashed by his flirtations and morewith other women but flowers when he runs for office and she discovers her ownskills as a political wife The higher he rises the more she uses the role ofspouse and some apparent sense within the marriage that he owes her tobring her own agenda to the fore He needs her to organize him hes alwayslate and always talks too long to any gathering and also to bring in money forthe family the few years he spends out of office the practice of law boreshim silly She gradually finds that her marriage to him allows her to exercisepower in his name that she was never able to claim in her own right            But of course the other circumstance that makes the two women different isthat Eleanor really had no initial way of claiming power for herself whereasHillary could have launched her own political career decades ago instead ofoffering us that unnerving twoforthepriceofone arrangement This is a bigreason why people mistrust Hillary whereas it made a lot of sense to peoplein the s that ER should be a kind of shapeshifting adjunct to her husbandNot as indicated above that ER was innocent of personal ambition How Ihate doing these things and then they say someday Ill run for an office shecomplained Well Id have to be chloroformed first Sure sure             But Ive saved the most important thing for last How could you say that ERwas not a force for good Do you think she was the opposite or not a force ofany kind            BestMarjorie
