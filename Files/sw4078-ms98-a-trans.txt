        what do you do there in Lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned     well you know they actually started and i assumed it was TI wide um uh they theyve started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper   uhhuh   uh ive you know either computer paper or different types of paper ive had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um   umhum   less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in   oh yeah what what would be more efficient about it what what   um well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or  a lot of people arent going to get up walk out of their offices and go there   uhhuh uhhuh   you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes thats just what we called them   uhhuh   and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning services time and effort and money that were paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step   oh   kind of type thing so   i see yeah i i i i uh i was gonna say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if   right but   if i have a if i i printed up something that i dont need it just chunk it in the in the paper   right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box its already bundled its already done for you   thats true hm certainly thats a good idea   so youre saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and   yeah   i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think its feasible   uhhuh   so um what else do they do in the Dallas area   well um as far as TIs concerned im not sure um and uh ive heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and ive heard in residential situations uh like in Plano   uhhuh   um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up   hm   where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper  uh and uh aluminum and um the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesnt cost the patron anything doesnt really cost the uh department   anything extra   right they dont pay they dont pay for the recycled items   that sounds good theres i ive been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um   umhum   so i ive not done that but thats kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know thats probably the one we use most   umhum   uh but   well what what what kind of uh services do you have there in Lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i i lived in Abilene for a uh i went to school there at Abilene Christian and i it was so hard to uh     find a place   you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible   well um uh they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town   hm umhum   um i dont know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that   umhum umhum umhum   um but i i dont know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments   umhum   so   well thats good   i do that i think people are becoming more aware   yeah   you know of of the waste and you know i i like to see you know you you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it   uhhuh   you know like maybe its making an impact   do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesnt do would you tend to chose the one that does or   im not as good about searching something out like that but if im there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product   umhum hm umhum   so you know thats just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way   sure yeah   so um you know theyre getting away from the styrofoam
