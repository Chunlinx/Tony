                                 Hams in Winter            The Alexandre Dumasinspiredswashbuckler The Man in the Iron Mask is thoroughly secondratewhichis to say that it waddles when it ought to whiz clanks when it strives forcornball poetry and transforms its august stars into something akin to a manicdinnertheater troupe Nevertheless armed with a tub of popcorn a ThreeMusketeers bar and an industrialsize Diet Coke with free refills I likedit better than the other more artful pictures I saw this week Heres anexample of why In Twilight  aging gumshoe Paul Newman regards glamorousmovie queen Susan Sarandon with anguished eyes his longing for her at war withhis loyalty to her cancerridden husband Gene Hackman Its terribly tastefuland grownup but not half as compelling as musketeer Gabriel Byrnes ferviddeclaration to foxy Queen Mother Anne Parillaud in The Man in the IronMask  To love you is a treason against Francenot to love you a treasonagainst my heart To love a line like that is a treason against my highaestheticsnot to love it a treason against my even higher propensity forflorid kitsch                           TheMan in the Iron Mask features Leonardo DiCaprio LEO LEO IS DA BOMB ILOVE YOU LEO LEO OH GOD PLEASE READ THIS LEO IS GAY LEO IS NOT GAY YOUREJEALOUS LEO IS A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING WHO LOVES WOMEN LEO PLEASE MARRYME in the dual role of the overweening  th century boy kingLouis of France and his twin brother Philippe who was first spirited away atbirth by a father fearful of internecine struggles and subsequently locked inthe bowels of the Bastille his features concealed by the eponymous ironmask            That would have been all folks were Louis not a completeschmuck who capriciously drains the kingdoms coffers with foreign warsstarves a lot of smudgy faced extras who hurl rotten fruit at his guards andfalls on whatever beauteous wench strikes his royal fancy When he royallyfancies the lady love Judith Godrche of the son Peter Sarsgaard of formermusketeer Athos John Malkovich and orders the young man shipped off tobattle its time for the aging Three MusketeersAthos Aramis Jeremy Ironsand Porthos Grard Depardieuto haul their uniforms out of mothballs andprove once again that theyre more than the stuff of chocolate bars            This isthe first feature directed by Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart in which Mel Gibson manages to bellow FREEDOM shortly before hisupper and lower halves are cleft in twainthereby liberating Scotland fromhordes of slumming Royal Shakespeare Co actors Wallace has a thing for menwho die with their boots on This is the death I have always wanted gaspsone fellow in this pictures lachrymose climax He also digs resplendentbrocades alarums male choirs and handsome men on horseback saying thingslike Then God be with you For we shall not He apparently has no taste forpacing his actors who are left to police their own histrionic impulseswhichis like leaving our president to police his libidinous ones            Byrne as DArtagnan the fourth musketeertorn between his loyalty to the king and to his allforoneoneforallcompatriots has the most complicated role and carries it off with real dignityand discernment which means of course that hes just a teeny bitdull Depardieu meanwhile demonstrates that Gallic ham is fattier than itsAnglo counterpart Irons and Malkovich bring to the picture two distinct stylesof prissiness Irons is the upperclass English poet priss locking liquid eyeson his costars and gravely overenunciating Malkovitch is the American Methodpriss feyly dragging out his words and democratically abolishing allpunctuation As his son Sarsgaard does a brilliantandrespectfulMalkovitch impersonation thats maybe the best thing in themovie            At firstit seems that DiCaprio LEO DESERVED A NOMINATION will be anothercontestant in the American juvenile falling on his face doing period Europeandrama contest The reigning champion is Keanu Reeves Playing the swinishking his performance begins badly and the long hair doesnt flatter his widedoughy face and compressed brow But once the nice twin enters the movieDiCaprio can use his expressive eyes LEO READ THIS and his haltingsweetness to win us back into his good graces OH MY GOD LEO IS THE GREATESTAHHHHH            It isnt nice to beat up on senior citizens which must bewhy Robert Bentons Twilight has received such respectful reviews Athirdrate mystery tricked out with a great cast and some tony cinematographythe movie unspools like an elderly directors swan songa bitterlateRomantic threnody for the lost integrity of an American archetypecoopted by the evils of a shabbily materialistic culture            Bentonisnt an old manhe only directs like one This is essentially a twilit remakeof his wonderful  thriller The Late Show  in which a senior citizenshamus Art Carney wrestles with both a brutal murder and the innumerablehumiliations of aging theyre connected happily assisted by a New Age flakeLily Tomlin in her most exuberant screen performance Twilight isThe Late Show without the spitfire and it succumbs to the paralysis itmeans to portray As the hero Newman lets his voice go raspy to expressworldweariness His mournful performance ennobles Bentons conception withoutenlivening it For Benton aging evidently means forgetting everything you onceknew about drama            More enlivening by far is Love and Death onLong Island  in which another aging protagonist John Hurt a clubbyEnglish novelist poignantly out of touch with modern society goes on anothersoulful quest developing an obsession with a beautiful teen idol JasonPriestley whom he accidentally sees onscreen in a film called Hot PantsCollege   Firsttime director Richard Kwietniowski has fun with thecollision of high and low culture and he does elegant work But his mistake isthe opposite of Bentons in Twilight  Where Benton couldnt distancehimself enough from his protagonist to generate a comic perspectiveKwietniowski cant keep from satirizing his heros passion Emotionally thepicture plays it safe hugging the shore            Hurts face is so deeplylined that he now resembles Boris Karloffs mummynot flesh and blood butflakes and embalming fluid But if Hurt has the kind of visage we normallyassociate with dissipation few actors are able to combine such bleariness withsuch oxymoronic concentration This is a gentle tour de force by one of ourgreatest comic miniaturists
