A Brief HistoryWhen Christopher Columbus disembarked on eastern Cuba on  October  he quickly penned a note exclaiming that the land was the most lovely that eyes have ever seen Indian tribes including the Siboney from Central and South America had lived on the island since at least  bcIn  Diego de Velzquez sailed from neighboring Hispaniola with some  conquistadores conquerors Baracoa became the first of seven settlements across Cuba Velzquez and his followers enslaved the native peoples and in the process exposed them to European diseases Whole villages committed suicide and by the mids the Indian population had declined from over  to Piracy and TradeUntil the end of the th century Cuba remained a fairly insignificant Spanish colony The port cities Havana and Santiago de Cuba were heavily fortified to defend against French and English pirate raids Considerable contraband trade originated from bases around the islandIn  British forces captured Havana They held it for only a year before returning it to Spain in exchange for Florida but during this period trade was opened up to additional markets notably the North American colonies A lucrative tobacco industry had taken hold in Cuba and after  the sugarcane business skyrocketed Though settlers brought the first African slaves to Cuba in the early s hundreds of thousands of African laborers were imported in the late th century to meet the demands of the sugar industryBy the middle of the th century Cuba produced a third of the worlds sugar and was considered one of the most valuable colonies in the world Half a million slavesnearly half the populationworked the plantations and at least  trading ships visited Cuba annuallyThe Road to IndependenceSpaniards born and raised in Cuba known as criollos creoles managed the sugarcane plantations but were not involved in the running of the country During the th century some criollos particularly in Oriente the islands poorer eastern region became increasingly disenchanted and desired greater autonomyOn  October  Carlos Manuel de Cspedes a criollo plantation owner who had already had a brief role in uprisings in Spain issued a call for independence and liberated slaves from his estate La Demajagua During the subsequent Ten Years War   Cubansincluding Cspedesand more than  Spanish lost their lives Cuba remained a colony of Spain but the war contributed to the abolition of slavery on the island in  and planted the seeds of a national consciousnessIn  Jos Mart Cubas most venerated patriot who now has a street square or building named after him in every town led the next and most important uprising against Spain Born in  and exiled at  for his political views Mart became a journalist and poet From exile in the United States he argued for Cuban independence Mart was killed in an ambush during the War of Independence which began in  and in which some  Cubans diedThroughout the th century the United States keenly interested in the islands strategic significance and its sugar market had become increasingly involved in Cuban affairs A US purchase of the island from Spain had long been on the agenda even though Mart had warned of becoming a satellite of the United States I know the Monster because I have lived in its lair he wroteIn February  the USS Maine was sunk in Havanas harbor killing all  crew members Although Spanish responsibility was never incontrovertibly established the United States used the sinking as a pretext to declare war US victory came swiftly with Spain surrendering claim to the island by the end of the same year A provisional military government lasted to  when Cuba became an independent republicFalse IndependenceFor the next five decades the United States the largest importer of Cuban sugar dominated the islands economy and largely controlled its political processes The period was rife with political corruption violence and terrorism After  Fulgencio Batista though only a sergeant orchestrated the strings of power through a series of puppet presidents before winning the presidency outright in  He retired in  but returned by staging a military coup in  His venal dictatorship made it possible for him to invest some  million abroad by Since the s disillusionment with the nascent republicwith its clear dependence on the United States and its lack of political probity or social equalityhad grown steadily Although Cuba had the secondhighest per capita income in Latin America prosperity did not filter down from the upper classes In fact the World Bank in  declared as many as  percent of Cubans undernourished In Havana there was a greater concentration of millionaires than anywhere else in Central or South America and the capital was dubbed an offshore Las Vegas for its brothels casinos and gangstersThe Road to RevolutionOn  July  rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks the countrys second most important military base in Santiago de Cuba The assault was a failure but it thrust into the limelight its young leader Fidel Castro Castro was imprisoned and put on trial his legendary twohour defense speech later published as History Will Absolve Me became a revolutionary manifesto Castro was incarcerated on the Isle of Pines now called the Isla de la Juventud until May  when Batista granted an amnesty to political prisonersCastro then fled to Mexico The following year he returned to southeastern Cuba with a force of  guerrillas including Che Guevara crammed onto a small yacht the Granma Only  reached the Sierra Maestra mountains safely Incredibly from such inauspicious beginnings the socalled  of July Movement grew into a serious guerrilla army aided in no small part by local peasants who were promised land reformFollowing a disastrous offensive by government troops on the rebels mountain strongholds in  on  January  Batista fled the country for the Dominican Republic The barbudos the bearded ones triumphantly entered Santiago then marched into Havana one week laterCastros CubaCastros fledgling government immediately ordered rents reduced new wage levels set and estates limited in size to  hectares  acres A comprehensive nationalization program followed and the government expropriated factories utilities and more land The foundations were set for nearuniversal state employment At the same time the new government instituted sweeping enlightened programs to eradicate illiteracy and provide free universal schooling and health careA centralized allpowerful state didnt please all Cubans The media were soon placed under state control promised elections were never held and Committees for the Defense of the Revolution CDRs were established to keep tabs on dissenters In the early years of the revolution tens of thousands of people suspected of being unsympathetic to its goals were detained imprisoned or sent to labor camps along with such other undesirables as homosexuals and priestsBetween  and  approximately  Cubans primarily professionals and affluent landowners fled the country Expatriate Cubans settled in nearby Florida establishing a colony that would steadily gain in political and economic power Another  abandoned Cuba as part of the Freedom Flights Program between  and  and a good number of whom were said to be criminalsfollowed in  when Castro lifted travel restrictions from the port of Mariel west of HavanaAccording to official Washington estimates US businesses lost  billion as a result of Cubas state appropriations and seizing of assets In retaliation the US government launched a trade embargo in  against Cuba that continues to this day In  CIAtrained Cuban exiles attempted an overthrow of Castros regime resulting in the Bay of Pigs fiascoWashington remained fundamentally opposed to Cubas political evolution and sought to isolate Castro in Latin America Soon after the Bay of Pigs Castro declared himself a MarxistLeninist Castro had not displayed any Communist inclinations in the s and some suggest that US aggression pushed him to ingratiate himself with the powerful Soviet Union and its Eastern block of potential trading partners By the end of the s more than  percent of Cuban trade was with the USSR which also provided Cuba with a subsidy of state support worth an estimated US billion annuallyIn  Soviet president Nikita Khrushchev installed  mediumrange nuclear missiles in Cuba US president John F Kennedy imposed a naval blockade on the island to ensure no more missiles arrived and insisted that the existing ones be removed After six days of eyeballtoeyeball challenge now known in the US as the Cuban Missile Crisis the potential nuclear disaster was averted when Khrushchev backed down in return for a US promise never to invade CubaThe Special PeriodUntil the end of the s Soviet trade and subsidies were crucial factors in propping up Cubas heavily centralized and often badly planned economy But the subsequent dismantling of the Soviet Union suddenly left Cuba bereft of food oil and hard currencyThe Cuban government announced the start of a peacetime Special Period in  introducing new austerity measures Though rationing had existed since the early s it was increased to cover many more basic items It became virtually impossible for Cubans to live on rations alone To make matters worse in  the Cuba Democracy Act extended the US embargo to cover a ban on trade with Cuba for foreign subsidiaries of US companiesWith its economy in disarray the government introduced a limited number of capitalist measures while maintaining a firm political grip Foreign investment in the form of joint ventures in the fields of tourism and mineral and oil exploration was keenly encouragedThe dangers of exposure to foreign opinion and moral corruption from the rapidly expanding tourism industry is now viewed as a necessary evil The adoption of measures such as the legalization of the dollar and smallscale private enterprises in  and the introduction of private farmers markets in  have improved the welfare of some Cubans The situation for others with no access to dollars has turned increasingly desperateNo doubt many Cubans would emigrate if allowed to do so In August  Castro suddenly lifted restrictions on those wishing to leave coastal patrols usually force potential migrs to return More than  Cubans tried to cross sharkinfested waters to Florida on improvised rafts Facing a dramatic influx of Cubans President Clinton abolished the US policy of automatic asylum to Cuban refugees placing them in a makeshift tent settlement in Guantnamo Bay Naval BaseIn the opinion of many Cuba is an isolated socialist dinosaur Yet itand its aging leadersoldier on against all odds The US embargo denounced by an everincreasing majority in the United Nations is spurred on by vehement antiCastro lobbying by Cubans in southern Florida Still changes in the status quo seem likely But nearly four decades after the Cuban missile crisis the world continues to wait wondering whether a lifting of US trade and tourism sanctions or a change in leadership in Cuba will arrive first
