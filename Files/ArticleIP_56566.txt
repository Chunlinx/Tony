                                 National Missile Defense            The Clinton administration is bound by law todecide by mid whether or not to begin deployment of a limited defenseagainst longrange missiles What is the history of missile defense Could amissile system protect the United States Which nations pose the greatestthreat to this country And what are the diplomatic repercussions of buildingsuch a system            In  the Johnson administration proposed theSentinel missile defense network to defend against Chinese missile attackTwo years later President Richard Nixon touted an even more limitedSafeguard system to defend the United States missile silos As permitted bythe ABM Treaty inked with Moscow in  the Ford administration unveiled an billion missile site in North Dakota in  That site was closed onlya few months later as a waste of money China meanwhile did not produce amissile that could hit North America until             President Ronald Reagans  Star Wars speechresurrected the missile defense debate Ten years and  billion later nothinghad been built Instead President George Bush started plumping for a billion spacebased Brilliant Pebbles defense system Its mission was toknock out  missiles carrying Russian warheads fired by accident or Chineseweapons fired by hubris            The technology wasntthere for Brilliant Pebbles and in  the Clinton administration announcedthe end of the Star Wars era Missile defense spending puttered along inresearch mode until July  when a US study warned of the potential formissile mayhem by such rogue nations as Iran Iraq and North Korea A monthlater North Korea fired a threestage rocket over Japan The rocket failed toorbit its satellite but demonstrated Pyongyangs unsuspected ballistic prowessThen last July the GOP Congress maneuvered Clinton into signing a lawpledging action as soon as possiblewhich means building a running missiledefense system by             Current plans envision spending  billion through to deploy perhaps  highspeed interceptor missiles in Alaska that could dealonly with a handful of incoming warheads US radars around the world would beupgraded to service this site which could eventually be bolstered by otherground ship and aircraftbased antimissile weapons            Strategically few dispute the merits of perfectingtheater defenses such as the upgraded Patriot missile to swat downlowflying shorterrange missiles on overseas battlefields but the genuineoperational need for a missile defense system for the US homeland remains amuchgnawed bone of contention            Over  billion incurrent dollars has been spent on missile defense since the early s but thetask of hitting a hypersonic bullet with a bullet remains a ticklish one Evenif the feat could be pulled off under laboratory conditions realworldattackers would load their missiles with decoy warheads to foil or complicateinterdiction Critics insist that relatively cheap countermeasures will alwaystrump costly missile defenses            After numerous highly publicized failures the Pentagonthis year successfully tested both its mediumrange Theater HighAltitude AreaDefense antimissile and a prototype of the longrange highspeed GroundBasedInterceptor slated for the Alaska site But only four of  planned interceptortests will be completed by the time Clinton must make his go or nogo decisionto deploy next year An independent study funded by the Pentagon warned inmidNovember that hasty deployment of the system could undermine its eventualsuccess            In a recentlydeclassified estimate the CIA projected that over the next  years the UnitedStates will face missile threats from Russia China and North Korea probablyfrom Iran and possibly from Iraq Russia today is struggling to maintain some warheads mounted on about  missiles Washington has long abandonedthoughts of defending against a full Russian onslaughteven a launchunauthorized by Moscow would easily swamp the proposed US defenses In anyevent the CIA terms an accidental Russian firing highly unlikely so long ascurrent technical and procedural safeguards are in place            China today boasts some  missiles that could hit theUnited States and is working to supplement that force with more survivablemobile launchers China could never trump the warhead blizzard Washington wouldsend in retaliation against any atomic attack though the country would beloath to cede to US missile defenses the deterrence afforded by its handfulsof warheads Beijings opposition seems to be driven more by apprehension thatWashington might provide theater missile defenses to Taiwan which China viewsas a renegade province Also the recently declassified CIA assessment assumesthat the rogue states are likely to view their few ICBMs more as weapons ofdeterrence and coercive diplomacy than as weapons of war            The crux of the strategiccontroversy is whether an imperfect homeland defense could eliminate thedeterrent and coercive impact of small rogue missile forces Any nationdetermined to explode a nuclear bomb in Uncle Sams front yard would have to beinsane to deliver the insult by missileit might as well affix a returnaddress to the weapon before firing Detonating a smuggled warhead in the holdof a ship docked in say New York harbor would make much more sense whileavoiding the huge expense and trouble of building complex intercontinentalrockets If this logic holds missile defense is a job for US Customs notthe Pentagon            Yet the prospect of an atomic apocalypse is so terriblethat few can argue against spending tens of billions of dollars for insuranceagainst remote possibilities Heres where the debate enters the diplomaticarena Could this antimissile insurance policy reawaken a Cold Warconfrontation thought dead lo these past  years            The  ABM Treatypermits the United States and Russia to deploy  interceptors to defendeither a missile field or the national capital The Russians chose to guardMoscow with their  antimissiles Even the initial  antimissiles slatedfor Alaska would violate this pact due to their nationwide coverage If Clintonblinks the green light next summer Washington would be in breach of the treatyby mid if it hopes to meet the  deadline            The State Department has asked Moscow to amend the ABMTreatywhich most missile defense proponents view as an outdated Cold Wardinosaur anyway Against the backdrop of the US bombing campaign againstSerbia tension over the civil war in Chechnya and Congress failure to ratifya treaty banning nuclear tests a Russian political establishment driftingtoward intransigence seems unlikely to give the United States a free pass onmissile defenses The Russians might respond to a breached ABM Treaty byabandoning other treaties designed to further reduce the current stock of USand Russian warheads Thus the construction of a limited shield against NorthKorea might spark a renewed nuclear arms race with Russia and ultimately reduceUS security            The missile defense debate has been as much aboutfaith and ideological fervor as about logic and rational calculation If thepast is any guide Clintons National Missile Defense will probably be stymiedby the same technical diplomatic and financial factors that doomed JohnsonsSentinel Nixons Safeguard Reagans Star Wars and Bushs BrilliantPebbles
