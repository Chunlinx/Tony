                                 Sen Symbol RPa            Rick Santorum thepudgyfaced freshman senator from Pennsylvania is a hero among socialconservatives this week for producing a big majority vote in favor of hisproposed ban on partialbirth abortions Even prochoice pundits have declaredthemselves impressed that Santorum got five more votes than he did the lasttime his bill came up and that this years converts included Minority LeaderTom Daschle of South Dakota who emitted a stream of gobbledygook when asked toexplain his flipflop            But itmay be worth noting that thanks to his victory Santorum will be responsiblefor more not fewer abortions in the United States Heres why As the debateheated up last week Daschle offered a compromise that the White House wasapparently willing to support Daschles alternative would have gone far beyondwhat Santorum has proposed banning abortions by any method once a fetus isviable The point of viability is now as early as  weeks into a pregnancyand seems likely to be stalled there absent some huge scientificbreakthroughsee Slates Gist But Santorum rejected Daschles proposal in favor of hisown narrower ban            Why would a believing Catholic like Santorum attach ahigher priority to prohibiting a grotesqueseeming but relatively rare practicethan to curtailingperhaps significantlythe number of abortions performednationally Santorum himself has contended that partialbirth abortions arenever necessaryfrom the patients point of view If his partialbirth banbecomes law women could still get a lateterm abortion using a differentmethod But under Daschles proposal lateterm abortions of all types wouldbecome illegal except in cases where there was a dire threat to the mothershealth Whats more Clinton indicated that he would have signed the Daschlealternative which would have made it the law of the land Clinton has pledgedto veto Santorums bill In other words Santorum preferred having an issuewith which to beat Democrats to achieving a genuine victory He hinted at thisreasoning at the press conference he held Tuesday after the vote Weve gotmembers up for reelection he told reporters I wouldnt want to be homedefending this vote anywhere in the country            Thatchoice is the essence of Rick Santorum All politicians draw upon symbols andsymbolic issues like partialbirth abortion which often have little realworldconsequences Few though can match Santorum in the pursuit of politicalsymbolism to the detriment of substance In his quest for wedge issuesSantorum has managed in his short time in the Senate to make Trent Lott looklike a man of principle John Warner like a deep thinker and Newt Gingrichlike Miss Manners            Like many on the right who decry the role ofgovernment Santorum is largely a product of it In Martinsburg W Va wherehe lived until the age of  both his parents worked at the VeteransAdministration Hospital With the help of student loans young Rick attendedPenn State then got an MBA from the University of Pittsburgh and a law degreefrom Dickinson He bought his first house with the help of a Pennsylvanialowincomehousing assistance program His only exposure to life in the privatesector was a brief stint as a lawyer and lobbyist where his clients includedthe World Wrestling Federation Nonetheless Santorum can sound like a militiamember when he gets busy denouncing big government Ive read the BibleNowhere in the Bible does it say that America will be here  years from nowhe said at a rally in  We can blow this This country can fail Thisgovernment can take your freedom I know you feel safe for now  but dontgive up your freedoms Dont give up your freedom In the article in whichthese comments were quoted his tone of voice was described as an impassionedwhisper            After hewas elected to the House in  Santorum became the leader of the socalledGroup of Seven a clique that prefigured the Gingrich class of  Hisgangs chief issue was the House Bank scandal and their goal to force fulldisclosure of the number of checks bounced by various members Theirsecondbiggest issue was opposition to congressional pay raises While he triedto incite the public about these totemic reform issues Santorum immersedhimself in the far more subversive legal corruption of the campaignfinancesystem His biggest supporters were the pharmaceutical and medicalinsuranceindustries impressed with his implacable resistance to healthcare reform Inboth the House and the Senate he has remained firm in his doctrinaireopposition to any kind of meaningful campaignfinance reform            Hepped up on Gingrichs candidatetraining tapes Santorumannounced his plans to run against incumbent Harris Wofford in  Thewinning campaign Santorum ran was notable for its uncalledfor personalnastiness Responding to Woffords support for national service Santorumsmirked Someones going to pick up trash in a park and sing Kumbayah arounda campfire and youre going to give them  percent of the benefits of the GIBill Santorum fictitiously claimed that those enrolled in AmeriCorps received a year then accused Wofford of being dishonest I have never seenanother candidate in my life who would stand up in front of the voters and telllies absolute lies the way he does he fulminated            At Santorum became the youngest member of the Senate and made a name for treatingfainthearted older members of his own party with the same boorishness andarrogance he had displayed toward Wofford Shortly after being elected heattacked Mark Hatfield the senior senator from Oregon for refusing to providethe margin of victory in a Senate vote on the balancedbudget amendmentSantorum proposed punishing Hatfield by stripping him of his chairmanship ofthe Appropriations Committee That Santorum reasoned was how things worked inthe House The effort was roundly defeated in the Republican Caucus            Santorums personal unpleasantness and affinityfor injecting religion into politics have led many liberals to cast him as asort of Jesse Helms of the North In fact Santorums voting record on manyissues is more in line with the moderate profile of Pennsylvanias othersenator Arlen Specter Santorum is rarely on the losing side of any  votein the Senate Though he is no friend to the environmental movement he isrelatively prounion He supported Bill Clintons proposed ban on permanentreplacement of strikers and voted for an increase in the minimum wage            One looks in vain howeverfor any thread of consistent belief Santorum is prolife but supports thedeath penalty he opposed NAFTA but favored GATT he wants to balance thebudget while providing more pork for Pennsylvania Unlike some of his class of comrades in the House who are principled in their bullheaded way he nevermet a principle he wouldnt swap for a few more votes As he cultivates theimpression that he is standing on his convictions in the partialbirth abortionfight Rick Santorum is in reality doing just the opposite
