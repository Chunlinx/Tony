                                 The Historicist Keats            John Keats life was anaccelerated grimace In his short flurry he tasted what he called a thousandbitters By his  th birthday in  he had lost both parents abrother and two uncles At Guys Hospital where he trained as a surgeon hesaw how unprotectedly people die and when a few years later he was dyingrawly of tuberculosis in Rome he knew what was ahead He asked his bedsidecompanion Joseph Severn if he had ever seen anyone die No came the replyWell then said Keats I pity youpoor Severn what trouble and danger youhave got into for me He died at the age of  years and four months            LikeChekhov Keats was thrust by early family experiences into a viciousindividualism that forever strained his metaphysics While only a teenager hebecame responsible as the eldest son for his siblings He struggled betweenguilty duty and his growing desire to be a poet Like Chekhov he lost hisChristianity as swiftly as he lost his own childhood in favor of anunillusioned and medical humanism For Keats inside every happiness wastrapped a little death While we are laughing the seed of some trouble is putinto the wide arable land of events he wrote in  His greatest poemsmost of them written in that same year are elegies wrapped as odes Theydisguise mourning as celebration they celebrate whatever is going or goneThe nightingale Keats heard in a garden in May  was not the music ofpoetry but the sound of death a siren call to suicide            Since modernism Keatsians have felt a need to toughen histextures That puffy lyricism that gorgeous hysteria of escape From silkenSamarcand to cedard Lebanon that fattened medievalism that quality ofoutShakespearing Shakespeare has been hammered by contemporary criticism intoharder shape The imagination has political responsibilities goes the lectureand Keats acknowledges this in those poems that most seek to escape into theimagination Andrew Motions biography which is well written and oftenrevelatory is a product of this apology for the lyric Using recentscholarship in particular historicism and cultural materialism Motionplaces Keats within the context of the radical liberal politics of the early th century            There ismuch to be said for this and Motion succeeds in recasting our idea of Keatspolitical background Unlike most of the writers he befriended Keats was ofhumble origin his father managed an inn and a stable He did not go to one ofthe great boarding schools but to a quirky dissenting establishment inEnfield just north of London Motion gives more attention than any predecessorto the capillaries of radical politics in London and to Keats place in aloose group of agitating writers that included Leigh Hunt Hazlitt andShelley It is undeniable that Keats made conservative enemies All thenegative reviews of his poems were from rightwing magazines and were full ofpartisan bristles            But conservatives seem to have largelydisapproved of the company he kept It is difficult to leap from this toMotions settled opinion that Keats interpreted writing as a humanitarianmission or that he is always engaged with the Liberal side of theQuestion even when sinking most deeply into the imagination This beliefleads Motion into many forced readings The essential difficulty is thegridlike nature of the historicism that he apparently espouses From thisperspective a poem is seen as a criminal whose alibi is too convincing to bebelievable A poem says historicist criticism will always be riven by thehistorical contradictions that surround it Being a poem it will want toescape these contradictionsto ignore them to smooth them into plausibleresolution or otherwise to smother the scandal of its roots in real historyThe critics task is to interrogate the poem to bully it into confession Thecritic then praises the poem not only for confessing but also for having hadall along that confession as its real if buried subject The criticgoes off and has a drink high on selfflattery the poem is led off in goldenchains            Motion isclearly a true liberal and a critic of acuity In Britain he is known as alyric poet of considerable power and this books style bears the impress ofthat talent But the historicist grid is unrelenting One quickly wearies ofit For instance Motion tells the story of Keats creation of his first greatpoem On First Looking Into Chapmans Homer Keats all of  had returnedto his dingy lodgings near the Thames It was late he was tired but he beganto write quickly Much have I travelld in the realms of gold  Themanuscript shows that he wrote the poem straight out with one alteration Thatmorning he dispatched it It was on the breakfast table of his mentor CharlesCowden Clarke by  am Motion tells this thrillingly with a fellowpoetshot consanguinity But the critique that follows is icy We are warned that thepoem admits to a sense of being challenged or even edged aside by history itdoes no such thing and that the title On First Looking IntoChapmans Homer registers that Keats felt he had come late to high cultureBut that word first stamps the poem with a lovely air of aroused virginitynot one of suspicious belatedness When Keats likens himself in this poem tostout Cortez who discovered the Pacific is he implying that Cortez somehowresented the Pacific for existing before he discovered it Motions zeal as ahistoricist makes him neglect his duty as a biographer which is to remind usthat Keats was a young man and hence a delighted first reader            Too often one has to pick ones way through this book likesomeone playing the white keys on the pianosurrendering to the biographicalnarration Motions telling of Keats final months is superb and ignoring thereadings of poems These readings climax in Motions discussion of To AutumnIn that famous poem Keats rubs autumn with the balm of his moistened languageSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness Close bosomfriend of the maturingsun  Keats celebrates an autumn so deliciously warm that the bees have beenfooled into thinking it is still summer Until they think warm days will nevercease For Summer has oerbrimmed their clammy cells            But forhistoricism this is a poem that in Motions words is ambitious to transmuteor escape history And history always seeps back in Keats pastoral idealismsecretly acknowledges that no such ideal exists Those bees for instanceDont they represent unseen yet discreetly acknowledged labour the bees havebeen persuaded into working overtime A page later this has hardened into acertainty that the bees are a reminder of the miserable facts of labor thatKeats had condemned during his walking tour in Scotland  But Keatsdescribes the bees labor as a gentle delusion they think warm days willnever cease In Motions reading To Autumn is really about the inequitiesof agricultural labor The shame is not so much the obvious absurdity as thatsuch a reading clutching at alien abstractions finds no place to observe theperfect specificity of describing honeycombs as clammy cells            In fact there is a toughness to Keatsbut it is a metaphysical toughness rather than a political one Historicismworks on a moral hierarchy in which political suffering is more important thanmetaphysical suffering or simply incorporates it and in which history ismore important than time or life But in his long moving letterjournal ofearly  Keats explicitly raises metaphysical suffering over political ormaterial travails Materially says Keats we are always wanting But that isnot the burden And if he improves by degrees his bodily accommodations andcomfortsat each stage at each accent there are waiting for him a fresh setof annoyanceshe is mortal and there is still a heaven with its stars abovehis head After politics there are the gods to deal with            What moves us in Keats isprecisely this checkered metaphysicsthe haunting apprehension that the seedplanted in the wide arable land of events might be the seed of death notlife Keats is famous for his odes which are taken to be celebrations butthey are not When Keats looks at the painted figures and trees on the Grecianurn in Ode on a Grecian Urn he is not just happy that these apparitionswill never fade because they are art and thus permanent he is happy thatthey have never had to live that they are not suffering Ah happy happyboughs that cannot shed Your leaves nor ever bid the Spring adieu  ToAutumn is not just disturbed by a sense that autumn will inevitably pass intowinter it is an elegy for lost summer Even the small gnats mourn thispassing And Ode to a Nightingale which meditates on suicide is an elegyfor himself Now more than ever seems it rich to die To cease upon themidnight with no pain            Yes in Keats poems lifehas a dreamy qualitybut this is not a gorgeous swoon so much as the sensethat somewhere out of sight we have already lived our actual lives and thatthe life we are forced to feel through now is a posthumous remembrance of thatearlier life full of pain and loss Do I wake or sleep asks Keats at theend of Ode to a Nightingale It is one of the most cherished questions inRomantic poetry But there is nothing benign in this question it is an echo ofTo be or not to be It is a selfchallenge not a soft quibble Less thantwo years later on his deathbed terribly ill and desirous of death Keatsasked just the same question in one of his last letters Is there anotherlife Shall I awake and find all this a dream There must be we cannot becreated for this sort of suffering
