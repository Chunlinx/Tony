                    Background        An extensive collection of         Salmonella typhimurium auxotrophic        mutants accumulated by Miloslav Demerec and associates in        the  and  decades was used primarily to develop        intra and intergenic maps of the         S typhimurium LT chromosome             Over  of these original sealed agar stab cultures         mlagar stab vial together with the original        stockbooks are now curated at the Cancer Research Center        The isolates were all descendants of a common parental        strain    that was lyophilized around the same time that        the original stab cultures were banked The original        mutants were very stable as indicated by low rates of        reversion to prototrophy        In previous reports we noted extensive diversity among        descendants of the parental strain including diversity in        RpoS and catalase synthesis     and diversity in genome        size protein content and reversion from auxotrophy to        prototrophy            Funchain         et al    reported that Biolog        Phenotype Microarray ES plates test for loss of         gene functions The ES Biolog plates that they used were        designed to distinguish         E coli from         Salmonella sp Since their report        Biolog Phenotype Microarray PM and PM plates became        available specifically for catabolism of carbon and        nitrogen substrates respectively Use of these plates        extends potential scoring of loss of nonessential genes to        perhaps  of the entire genome        To increase our knowledge of diversity among these        archival strains we scored for metabolic changes using        Biolog Phenotype Microarray plates ES PM and PM        followed by plating on MacConkey agar base supplemented        with a variety of sugars The ES and PM test panel provided        a standardized microtiter method using  biochemical tests        for each of the three well plates to characterize andor        identify different metabolic profiles among microorganisms        Initially  archival strains were tested on ES plates        the only Biolog plates available at that time data not        shown When PM and PM plates became available we        selected  strains that previously showed diversity from        ES tests for further testing Data from the MacConkey        plates verified the changes in carbohydrate metabolism        observed in the Biolog system                    Results        As noted experiments were started with ES plates        designed as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between         E coli and         Salmonella sp When PM and PM        plates became available we chose  archival strains from        the ES list to score for differences in catabolism of         different substrates with Biolog PM and PM plates Nine        additional nonarchival strains were tested including the        sequenced         S typhimurium our strain  for        comparison Table contains information on the background        of the strains used for this study as well as other strains        used for comparison and as controls Table also lists the        number of differences between the sequenced reference        strain  and archival strains Thus out of the         total carbon and nitrogen substrates archival strain         differed from  in   of the tests On the other        hand strain  stored for approximately the same length        of time differed from  in only  substrate        utilizations less than         In Panel B of Table  three nonarchival strains are        included Note that Pasteurella         multocida differed from strain         in substrate utilization for  out of  an indicator        of the validity of the Biolog system The two nonarchival                S typhimurium strains also displayed        some differences from the sequenced strain an indication        that the Biolog PM and PM system might be useful in        epidemiology and evolutionary studies        Table  see Additional file  lists the  carbon        substrates PM plate catabolized by the sequenced strain         and the number of archival strains out of  that        also catabolized these substrates Thus Dgalacturonic        acid was most easily dispensable  followed closely        by adonitol  sucrose  alphaDlactose         and glyoxylic acid         Additional file                 Click here for file        Table lists the nine carbon substrates PM plate that        were not metabolized by the sequenced  strain However        some archival strains did catabolize seven of these        substrates perhaps indicating alternative pathways see        DISCUSSION below        Table  see Additional file  lists the  nitrogen        substrates PM plate catabolized by the sequenced strain         and the number of archival strains out of  that        also catabolized these substrates Thus hydroxylamine and        DLalphaaminocaprylic acid were the most easily        dispensable  for each followed closely by        DaminoNvaleric acid  and aminoNvaleric acid                Additional file                 Click here for file        Table lists the  nitrogen substrates PM plate that        were not metabolized by the sequenced  strain However        several archival strains did catabolize these         substrates perhaps indicating alternative pathways see        DISCUSSION below        It is of interest that there are amino acids in both the        carbon PM and the nitrogen PM plates For example the        oxidation reaction for serine in PM identified carbon        catabolism while the ammonia moiety of serine was one        enzyme into a central pathway that can feed all other        carbon pathways Sometimes but not always the enzymes are        the same but induction of the enzymes under carbon or        nitrogen starvation may be different      and Bochner        personal communication                    Discussion        Bochner         et al    emphasize that the PM        plates may be used to analyze the linkage between genotype        and phenotype They point out that scoring of catabolic        loss is identified in the PM tests Amino acids can be        used as nitrogen sources since in many cases they only need        a single enzyme such as a transaminase or deaminase to        liberate the ammonia Some amino acids can also be used as        a carbon source when their carbon skeletons are converted        usually by more than one substrate and can reveal the loss        of shared transport functions or shared catabolic enzymes        The use of PM plates have several major benefits to the        analysis of our strains  color change is easy to monitor        and quantitate  color change is very sensitive and        highly reproducible and  cellular respiration can occur        independent of cell growth and in some cases can measure        phenotypes that do not lead to growth     Other        researchers have used the Biolog System to explore other        phenotypic changes in various mutated strains of bacteria                   In these archival cultures it is assumed that the        initial nutritional components were gradually depleted        however some new molecules became available upon        decomposition of dead cells Mutant offspring that were        best able to utilize the sparse nutritional residues would        survive Our longterm focus has been to characterize        genetic differences between survivors and the putative        parent the sequenced         S typhimurium LT strain A goal is        to develop gradients of preference from mosttoleast        dispensable gene functions As may be seen in Tables  and         we observed a hierarchy of substrate utilization losses        among strains        The additional observation that some archival strains        gained metabolic capabilities is consistent with the        reports that environmental pressures may induce changes in        metabolic pathways           Entire        metabolic pathways could be deactivated by the loss of a        critical enzyme     Bochner         et al    noted that when a        mutation is inserted to inactivate a xylose catabolic gene                 xylA  metabolism of maltose and        maltotriose were also lost in addition to xylose Some of        the primary energy sources in these archival cultures were        likely to be exhausted and thus cells might be expected to        utilize secondary pathways as noted by Groat         et al    and Wright     DNA        from dead cells might serve as a source of energy for        bacterial cells Finkel and Kolter    observed that        cells that were able to utilize DNA have a significant gain        in fitness over competing cells that could not eat DNA        Five wells in the PM plate and seven in the PM plate        contained nucleic acid components and mutants were able to        utilize these both as carbon and nitrogen sources        Koch    emphasized that certain genes could be        eliminated without losing colonyforming ability Among        excess baggage genes Koch stated that DNA fragments        might include duplicated genes or fragments fragments of        ancestral genes that are no longer needed as the species        evolved and temperate viruses and insertion sequences        Although constitutive pathways might be needed to utilize        the meager remaining nutrients there would be less need        for induction processes Ochman and associates              Papadopoulos         et al    and Arber    have        presented interesting evidence of such genomic losses        Mutation under nutrient deprivation has been of interest        from the dawn of bacterial genetics        Decades ago Novick and Atwood     both reported        that starvation serves as a selective condition for mutants        with survival capabilities over the parental strain In        examining whether there was any priority in discarding of        excess baggage in the population of cells in these vials        certain features would be obvious without any sophisticated        analysis An indication of this in the greater than        expected reversion from auxotrophy to prototrophy and in        the PFGE data                        Conclusions        It is premature to build a model as to precise genetic        changes during decades of storage in this restricted        environment However our results support the view that         Gene functions are lost or rearranged in almost all if not        all of the archival strains tested  There may be a        hierarchy from mostdispensabletoleast dispensable        substrate utilization for both carbon and nitrogen        molecules  Since some food components would be greatly        diminished under starvation conditions selected mutants in        populations may discover secondary pathways                    Methods                  Phenotype microarrays          Cultures were taken from storage at minus C and          incubated in LuriaBertani Broth at C with aeration          overnight After incubation cultures were centrifuged          for  minutes at  g Following centrifugation the          supernatant was decanted and inoculating fluid from          Biolog was added to adjust the turbidity of the cell          suspension to an absorbency of  For analysis of          Biolog PM plates  l ferric citrate was also added          to each tube of inoculating fluid All necessary          nutrients and biochemicals were prefilled and dried into           wells of the plates plus a water control Tetrazolium          violet was used as a redox dye to colorimetrically          indicate the utilization of the carbon and nitrogen          sources          The microtiter plates were prewarmed at C before          each well was inoculated with  l of cell suspension          In wells containing a substrate that is oxidizable a          burst of respiration occurred and the cells reduced the          tetrazolium dye forming a purple color Other wells          remained colorless as an indicator of loss of function          in a catabolic step as did the reference well          containing water The PM and PM plates were incubated          at C for  and  hours respectively Following          incubation the metabolism of the various carbon and          nitrogen sources was measured spectrophotometrically at           nm using a microtiter plate reader and visually by          scoring purple reactions in individual wells as a          colorless negative control The sequenced reference          strain  was included with each experimental group          as a control The biochemical reactions resulting in          tetrazolium color changes have been described by Bochner           et al                              Archival strains          The archival cultures were originally stocked          beginning in the late s for the purpose of intra and          intergenic mapping Each strain was auxotrophic for an          amino acid vitamin or nucleotide The isolates were          stored in quintuplicate in small glass vials filled with          nutrient agar and then sealed with paraffin The          collection has been stored at room temperature for over           years While many of the tubes have dried out all          tubes in which agar was not dried out yielded an average          of   colonyforming units Details of the strains          used can be found in Table with additional detailed          information at          httpwwwcancerresearchcenterorgtablehtml                          Reference strain          Our reference strain  is assumed to be the          parent of the LT archival strains It was lyophilized at          about the same time that the archival collection was          being stored in agar stabs The same strain was used for          sequencing of the           S typhimurium genome completed at          Washington University sequencing center A paper          detaining the sequence information    is now available          at httpgenomewustledu Also a detailed tabulation          by Gutnick           et al    in  of compounds          of carbon and nitrogen for           S typhimurium LT gave us an          additional basis of comparison of our results with a          strain studied decades ago                          MacConkey Agar          Single colony suspensions were added to a MacConkey          Agar Base Difco Detroit MI supplemented with           different sugars Onepercent sugar wv was added to          each sector of a fourquadrant
