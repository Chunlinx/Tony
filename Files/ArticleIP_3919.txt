is all but dead and gone Then he goeson to describe the resurrection of Americas industrial base But I wouldnever have made such an ignorant statement What I did say is that the glitterof instant

did not make In pointing to the way WallStreet now values industrial companies and other traditional businesses I wastrying to show that in fact investors at least have a great deal of respectfor the manufacture of useful goods and vital services and not the glitterof instant wealth Internet fever aside Unlike the s when the economysleading figures often seemed to be people like Michael Milken and BoonePickens who were speculators in that classic populist sense of the word thepeople who get the most attention and respect today are almost all businessmenwho spend their time making things not playing with other peoples money BillGates Michael Dell or whoever In that sense the stock market boom isfounded firmly on the steadier achievements to which Kazin refers

                     HardLabor                        I am writing to complimentJames Surowiecki on his simultaneously rigorous and humanistic analysis of theGeneral Motors strike Moneybox June  He has pegged the contradictions facingAmerican labor with a precision sorely lacking in the mainstream coverage ofthis episode The negative stereotypes defining labor in the mainstream pressare easily invoked but rarely is the positive rationale behind organizationdefined beyond worker dissatisfaction Labor in the United States is by nomeans perfect and dealing with intransigent unions can be a byzantineharrowing and expensive process In many ways labor can be characterized asdecadent in its victory over the truly horrible conditions of the early th century and many of us wish to believe that the Americanworker has been given too much and should be slapped back into line with therealities of the global marketplace            Surowiecki points out the shaky rationale for this particular strike but doesnot end there reminding us that the control we have over our workplaces andthe responsive nature of American management in abiding by the bulk of theserules or by factoring labor unrest into their longterm calculations can bedirectly attributed to the efforts of the American labor movement regardlessof whether or not onetrick pony Ronald Radosh wishes to brand them all assubversives Compliments also for his reminder that those efforts are personaland carry consequences for those who are willing to take the risk ofconfrontation             StuartTurner Washington DC

extremely close relationship to his children and a preference forstudying history and writing which Plotz admits he does very well Ho humOne wonders what Plotz considers remarkable That a man could have such a longacting career in and around Hollywood display none of his professionscharacteristic egotism and selfabsorption and maintain close intimate familyrelationships including a  year marriage strikes me as remarkable indeedHestons political involvement is summed up as the dabblings of a dilettanteThe examples of his rhetoric provided are labeled as nasty whilemanymyself
