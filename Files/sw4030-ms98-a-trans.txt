        well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the Mid East what do you what do you think     well yeah i uh and im im sure theres things going on that that uh we dont know about but but uh it a year a year ago now when the the war Desert Storm was finishing up seems like things were uh going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all   yeah it that that happens a lot doesnt it   umhum   wars dont usually settle things  much   yeah right   um um and i i guess i i feel like we we keep getting into places without really understanding what were doing   right   uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like weve got experts and weve got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if theyre really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if theyd only known such and such we wouldnt have done this you know   yeah and and i i think theres a   and would   yeah i i i i have very much doubt that that theres a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of whats going on   uhhuh   in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend   yes   and that that Saddam Hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against Iran   uhhuh   and uh Iran was our bigger enemy and then  when it turns out that uh Saddam Hussein   yeah but Iran of course used to be our friend   right       right   i mean we cant its a little hard to keep it straight isnt it   and right oh yes yes and when we decided Saddam Hussein was our enemy then the uh uh   oh   oh whats his name in uh Syria uh   yeah um   uh Hafaia Susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh   right on hit our really bad list   you know and   and i i i keep reading about Jordans King Hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is   right right right and and uh i think were trying to were trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being so definitely tied to to the Israeli side in terms of all of that Israeli versus Arab   right yes yes right right   and uh i havent seen uh solid evidence yet that were doing a really good job of that  yeah yeah so   of doing that either no  no i i i i just get a sense of our walking in over and over and over again in places where we werent well versed or something   right right   didnt didnt know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or   right and   something and and if we could its not wise that i guess im still looking for a statesman   yes   you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what theyre doing and did this wise thing every once in a while and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera itll have this effect but   yeah well it it from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh Iraq in particular was that it seemed to me that George Bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that Saddam Hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war   oh absolutely yes   and that uh   i mean which which was uh in the line of business that im in which is mediation   uh oh boy   every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like um   oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fascinating fascinating watching   yes it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because its sort of like   yes   golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting   yeah right   i mean uh ah didnt you ever see that with children i mean dont   right yes yes   i i saw did see one of the peace rallies where they just said  i cant remember the exact thing it was something like George and Saddam Saddam go home
