        its recycling     well uh i think its a really good thing because um of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that its just a complete waste uh you know make them and then throw them away and bury them out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them   exactly i agree   and uh theres a i mean theres so many products that are like that its just too bad that they cant find more that we could recycle   well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that theyll be   yeah youre right there but then theres things like the uh newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one will   theres not a market for it right   yeah or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so   yeah  well uh do you have a recycling program where you live   oh yeah uh i go to Indiana University here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials   uhhuh  do you have plastics and that kind of kind of stuff   yeah and also the uh well the Universitys really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can uh recycle the most stuff and   uhhuh so this is like in within the school   yeah within the school and also the city here has uh   do they have curbside recycling   yeah monthly curbside recycling   that is nice see we dont have that here its going that direction but it hasnt come yet at least to my area and uh and im really anxious to uh   uhhuh right   get that because i mean its terrible its really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all your lug all that stuff you know dirty   right   you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door   right but then you do dont you get paid when you take your own uh   well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some others others wont   uhhuh   so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have   right sounds like you are an avid recycler   im on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible   are you uhhuh   but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper   right yeah we do that at work too   but we dont do you know we dont do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle   right   and some of those numbers in there mean that these products arent really recyclable   uhhuh   so thats kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you cant recycle it   right well arent there pop cans that are like that also   yeah exactly   because they have mixed metals or something   umhum yep well anything else   well no not really   well reduce reuse and recycle right   right  words to live by   thats right i try to remember them i guess weve covered it     okay   it was nice talking to you byebye now   you too byebye
