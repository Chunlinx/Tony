quoted on BBC radio described the two newleaders as making all the right noises                            Makingall the right noises  The phrase has proliferated over a period of littlemore than two decadesperhaps in part because it itself makes all the rightnoises It signals that the noisemaker under discussion may be no more than agoldentongued hypocrite even as it suggests that a reporter having seen itall could not possibly be taken in by the noisemakers blandishments It alsoleaves open the unlikely possibility that the actions will indeed live up tothe noises            Making all the right noises carrying the connotation justdescribed seems to have surfaced mainly in British publications in the lates and early s It surely evolved from earlier use in more literalstraightforward contexts for instance to describe the sound of an automobileengine or a musical performance and ultimately from the longestablished andnonjudgmental phrase to make noises that is to express oneself aboutsomething a construction that happily accommodates all manner of adjectivalprefixes All the right noises  with its stance of jaded cynicismquickly spread from British organs the Economist  the Guardian the Financial                Times  into most parts of the farflung Anglophonecirculatory system Today it is applied in a wide range of circumstancesespecially when the noises being talked of invite a presumption of hollownesssanctimony or hypocrisy            Here is New YorksNewsday earlier this year analyzing the economic situation in SouthKorea Kim Jong Pil in line to become Kim Dae

presidency so far Clinton has made all theright noises  but has done nothing while playing the same old games toraise vast sums            Given someof the tendencies of Scripture translation in recent decades it would hardlybe surprising to see Matthew the passage in which Peter promises toremain a loyal disciple scant hours before turning disloyalrewritten andembellished to render the response from Jesus as follows Truly you makeall the right noises  But this night you will deny me three times            Among the reasons why an expression such asmaking all the right noises achieves wide usage quickly is this simpleone The phenomenon of empty talk is so prevalent that new ways of describingitespecially ones that possess a modest elegance and formalityare alwayswelcome As it happens many wonderful terms for empty or hypocritical talk areby now quaint and archaic  humbuggery  Pharisaism Tartuffery  and some of the most common terms are simply vulgar bullshit             Lipservice as in the phrase to pay lip service from the act of raisingones voice publicly in prayer or song while inwardly harboring contraryconvictionsis probably the most widespread and durable formulation Thusthe New York Democrats currently vying for the nomination to run for the Senatethis fall recently accused the Republican incumbent Alfonse DAmato ofpaying lip service to gay issues Similarly lip salve isinsincere flattery though it may be enjoyed by the recipient nonetheless as aform of ear candy  Lip  with its satisfying mouthfeel touse the jargon of the foodservice industry and its stillobvious link to anelemental root the IndoEuropean leb  with the connotation  hasformed numerous slang combinations whose meanings touch all the compass pointsof verbal intention To shoot from the lip is to speak rashly To zipyour lip is to shut up To invite someone to read your lips is toemphasize your sincerity To lipsync is to move ones lips insynchronization with a prerecorded soundand metaphorically to mouth someoneelses sentiments            Like paying lip service  making all the rightnoises possesses just enough color to be memorable and yet not so muchcolor as to cloy It may be in for a long run In contrast one has to wonderabout the longevity of its main rival in the linguistic marketplace right nowtalking the talk but not walking the walk a vivid expression fromblack English that seems lately to have become a mandatory part of therepertoire of white politicians corporate executives consultantsmotivational speakers newscasters and sportswriters A person who talksthe talk and walks the walk is one who acts naturally and stylishly whosewords and behavior are of a piece a person who talks the talk withoutwalking the walk  therefore is one who is dissembling ineffectual orinsincere The incorporation of walk the walk and talk the talk intowhitebread English often by people whose jus folks colloquialism is a posemay not bode well One need only remember how the appropriation of the verbsdig  rap  and groove by grownups during the late sand early s proved to be a kiss of death            The extent to which theexpression has found favor was brought home a few weeks ago when ArchbishopHarry Flynn of St Paul and Minneapolis traveled to Rome to ordain aMinnesotabound candidate for the priesthood There in a chapel at the NorthAmerican College on the slopes of the Janiculum Hill during a serviceotherwise conducted entirely in Latin Flynn delivered a sermon that includedthis injunction to the young man When you teach be sure you receive the wordinto your heart before the word forms on your lips Walk the walk and talkthe talk Dont preach one thing and turn around and do somethingelse            One canassume that the new priest in response made all the right noises
