                                 Take Two Tabloids and Call Me in the Morning                        Dave            Oddly in midtown its a balmy  degrees You really ought to come up herefor a visit its lovely            OK so its actually freezing cold herecolder than the mayors heart asNew Yorkers like to say Or as I like to imagine they like to say            Since there seems to be no earthshattering news in todays papers lets goright to my favorite story the yearold doorman retiring from the PlazaHotel What I like about this story is that its a perfect tabloid storyahearttugging humaninterest piece with lots of celebrity namesand sinceboth tabloids were clearly tipped off to it it provides an ideal opportunityto compare and contrast the New York Post and the Daily               News  As it happens their coverage confirms a longheld belief of mineYou dont mess with Gersh Kuntzman Kuntzman is as best I can tellresponsible for something like half of the text that appears in the Posteach day You can find his byline all through a typical days paper usuallyappended to a few news items and at least one humaninterest story writtenwith all the toughguywithaheartofgold panache you expect from thetabloids but so rarely get I like to imagine him as the sort of newspaperreporter youd see in movies from the s pounding the street from dawn todusk picking up tips from shoeshine boys and calling his boss Chief            For an object lesson in the magic of Gersh Kuntzman compare thePlazadoorman stories in the News and the Post  Both papers do afine job of hitting the guys career highlights the Beatles Jackie GleasonLana Turner But the News glosses over the reason for his retirementSzorentini decided that yesterday would be his last day  Gershhowever gets the scoop I wouldnt be leaving this job if it werent for myheart  I feel like Ive lost everything Szorentini said crying Advantage Post             This actually ties in with my earlier thought on Monday about the divisionof labor between the citys papers Its actually far more finely nuanced thanI initially said Its not just that the Times handles the serious newsand the News and Post handle the fun frivolous stuff There arealso subdivisions among the tabloids The Post has better gossip morecelebrity coverage and of course Gersh Kuntzman The News has betterTV coverage better citynews coverage and Doonesbury You really have tobuy all three papers if you want to make one whole oneand the Wall StreetJournal  if youd like a business section plus lifestyle pieces on how tospend  in a hurry            As for the character issue it seems to me to be a convenient canard todistract attention from the fact that the candidates real differences run thegamut from A to well pretty much A Its not so much that theyre allsaying the same thingthere are some substantive differences in theirapproaches to policyas it is that the public has by now picked up the sensethat those differences wont necessarily result in substantially differentoutcomes in the long run The president is not after all kinghe hasCongress to contend with and even once a law has been passed it doesntnecessarily mean that itll be enforced The barriers between a candidatesrhetoric and his achievable results mean that the two bear the same relationthat an original document does to its  th photocopy So like Isaid the character thing is a canard Which means duck Perhaps instead offocusing on the character issue each character should groom a duck to be hisrepresentative and we could all grade them on grooming behavior ability todo tricks and the like Id like that            Tim
