observation that people forbetter or for worse grow into their appearance coming to look on the outsideas they feel on the inside            Imagineif Rush Limbaugh said something like that regarding say Hillary             Jim Howard                                       TrippTrapped                        It seemsthat most people view Linda Tripp Linda Tripp Victimized or Vicious as some kind of wickedstepmother and that is unfortunate Tripp is justified in worrying that herjob and reputation were being threatened after Clintons lawyer identified heras someone who is not to be believed It would be very easy for me to saypiously that I would have sacrificed my job rather than make the recordingsbut I am a single yearold without children and I can afford to take a moreprincipled stance Tripp has not only herself to think about when it comes toprotecting her job and reputation but also the wellbeing of her children andher ability to support them What would people think of a mother who sacrificedher own children in order to protect the president and Monica             Damian MSchloming                                       Tapingfor Trouble                        Please ask Jonah GoldbergLinda TrippVictimized or Vicious to explain why he thinks if all Tripp wanted to dowas to protect her good name she continued to tape Lewinsky long after shewould have had enough evidence for this purpose As Carlson says A seekerof the truth as Tripp refers to herself might at best need to tape oneconversation and hold it in reserve for that dark moment when her veracity waschallenged Instead she taped  hours worth and offered them upgratuitously to get the ball which wasnt moving much rolling            WhyJonah             AngusMaitland                                       YatesYikes                        As one of the constituents ofSidney Yates the topic of Jacob Weisbergs July  StrangeBedfellow I can tell you that he has been a distant and ineffectivecongressman for decades I say this despite the fact that I agree with Yates onmost political issues Not surprisingly Weisberg admits his personalrelationships with Yates and his staff            Yates has done little for theeconomic development of our district While I admire his championship of thearts and the environment these do little concrete for the vast majority ofconstituents Yates is the only congressman in the Illinois delegation whorefuses to set up an email link for constituents How does this sit with aMicrosoft enterprise Yates refused to step aside when he became obviouslyphysically infirm He misses more votes than all but a handful ofcongressmen            Yates maintains littlecontact with his district and made only token campaign appearances He refusedto debate his campaign opponents Emperor Sid treated those Democrats who daredto oppose him as traitors and thought of himself as congressman by divineright            Our district will now bevastly better off by his replacement by a person  years his junior Yates haspersonally enriched himself at the expense of his constituents and hisretirement is welcome to many            Ironically one of the biggest news splashes made by Yates in the last decadewas when one of his staffers invoked Sids clout and attempted to set updogwalking runs in Rock Creek Park When this hit the newspapers

member of thatclandestine group of German wine lovers that Fareed Zakaria describes in hisJune  Wines World I feel obliged to clarify the place in the pantheonof winedom of one of the figures mentioned in Zakarias hymn            I speak of course ofHegel Whatever the merits of the rather severe idiom in which Hegel chose tocouch his ideas he was nonetheless a member in good standing in the winelovers circle He grew up in a wine drinking area Wrttemberg and he did astint as a house tutor at Frankfurts most distinguished wine merchant Infact in an effort to lure him into taking the job his friend Hlderlin evenpromised him you will drink very good Rhine wine or French wine at thetable When he was writing his Phenomenology of Spirit despite his verymeager income at the time he was ordering shipments of Mdoc and PontakHautBrion See where his priorities lay When he became famous in Berlinhis tastes shifted slightly to Mosels loved them Rhine wines and Cahorslots of it He especially loved the  vintage of comet wines and he andSchleiermacher even stopped quarreling for a while after Schleiermacher gaveHegel the address of a good Bordeaux merchant            Worldlyin his heart he was also not averse to the Italians drinking and praisingLacrima Christi red as he was writing a Latin oration on the AugsburgConfession When he was visiting Saxon Dresden at the height of the Prussianreaction in the s he surprised his students sitting at the table with himby ordering the most expensive champagne in Europe Chteau Sillery With noneof the students quite understanding just what called for such a lavish outlayon the old fellows part he astonished them even more by raising his glass andtoasting July  and the storming of the Bastille So on July  instead ofchampagne a crisp Riesling might be the way for us German wine lovers to toastthat venerated French holiday We can celebrate Hegel and the revolution at thesame time And indulge our secret taste

time to time he gets thefacts just plain wrong Usually its in the last paragraph and its usuallysome flippant remark that would be witty if it were only true            In theJuly  Todays Papers Shuger wrote                        Clinton told familiesthere that home ownership is an investment in society the bedrock ofmiddleclass life Wonder if the Times had trouble resisting theobservation that its an investment Clintons never made a bedrock hes neverstood on            I quotefrom Page  of Meredith Oakleys biography On the Make The Rise of BillClinton             Hillary three months shyof her twentyeighth birthday returned to Fayetteville  inclined to acceptthe twentynineyearold Clintons marriage proposal Any remaining reluctancewas dashed when he greeted her return with the news that he had purchased asmall brick and stonework house she had admired            Thisoftreported account of Clintons marriage proposal is well known Too badShuger felt the need to be wittybut wrong

     TheDelicate Art of Profanity                        I was just reading thisfascinating and wellwritten article Flame PosiesJuly  about the New York Times and the Washington Post andadmiring the balls of a publication that ran the headline Who gives a fabout the yen last week and had already used the phrase holy shit upward offive times in the opening paragraphs when I happened upon this sentenceLater that year the paper spread its legs for the theory that TWA Flight was downed by foul play based on the discovery of PETN residues in thewreckage            I am personally a big fanof the wellchosen offcolor remark Screw you kiss my ass fuckmethese are all phrases that have levels of meaning that have nothing to dowith the physical acts they describe See Donnie Brasco andfuggedaboudit I have recently deliberately begun to use variations of kickass and bites X in the ass because they are colorful evocative phrasesbecause thanks to South Park  ass references are newly familiar andhilarious and because they dont evoke particularly vivid mental images ofasses any longer Or at least less than they used to            What I am very gently tryingto get at is I dont think the phrase spread its legs has quite entered theoffcolor oversoul I think like up the ass it is just a smidgen too vividfor the average reader Then again we have seen the rise of suck in itsmany forms so perhaps Ill be proved wrong So when you write spreads itslegs thats exactly what I think of and for me there is somethinginherently unpleasant in having my genders chief sexual activity thrown up onthe electronic page as an analogy for submissiveness Human reproduction prettymuch hinges on legspreading and hence one would think this act would besynonymous with  well something better than the Times beingsluttishly seduced into an illsupported TWA theory            Bottomline You dont have so much as a Saturday Night Live sketch to point toas an example of how the phrase spread its legs has become so prevalent as tohave mostly lost its primary meaning I think sex deserves better than to becompared to bad reporting and Im not especially keen on seeing my gendersrole during sex interpreted as one of whorish submission             Kate Powers                                       SchoolPrinciples                        David Brooks chides BillMcKibben in the July  Breakfast Table for having one child arguing that it is symbolicpolitics taken to an extreme If only one couple does it it will have littleeffect on the situation Maybe if everybody followed McKibbens lead it wouldmake a difference In the next paragraph he says its OK for Bill andHillary Clinton to send their kid to a private school while opposing schoolchoice because you should be able to rise above principle to send your kids toprivate school            Am I the only one who noticesthe faulty logic The problem is that the Clintons arent an isolated exampleMany of the opponents of school choice send their kids to private school evenwhile professing steadfast belief in public schools This is like McKibbenhaving  children making his wifesignificant other take fertility drugs andthen telling everyone we are running out of resources and everyoneelse should have one child            If therewere only one white affluent couple sending its child to private schools whiledecrying school choice for others that would be one thing For an entirepolitical class to engage in this behavior is a national disaster Perhaps thatis why as Brooks says public schools are crappy in threefourths of thecountry             BillJones Pasadena Calif                           The AFICannon                        I followed Charles PaulFreunds argument in the July  High Concept about the AFI  greatest films list and thedecline of cultural gatekeeping right up to the point when he began discussingthe actual movies on the list But his offhand comment that Bonnie andClyde presents criminality in soft focus is so offthebeam it taints hisentire analysis Exactly what is soft focus about the bank teller who getsshot full in the face or Gene Hackmans agonizing death throes or Bonnie andClyde s final staccato dance of death            Freunds take on theGodfather pictures as a daydream of limitless wealth and power is evenloonier Has he even seen The Godfather Part II  which charts thecomplete moral decay of Pacinos Michael in minute psychological detail Freundis right that in many ways the Godfather pictures especially PartII  are the opposite of the traditional gangster movie but hes preciselywrong in his reasons why In fact its the older gangster pictures thatromanticize the charismatic crooks portrayed by Bogart Cagney Robinson etal Theres nothing romantic about the criminal violence depicted in theGodfather movies or the way the blood seems to drain out of Pacinoscharacter over the course of the epic            Given thevolumes that have been written about these movies Freunds blatant misreadingsare stupefying Maybe a little more cultural gatekeeping on the part of                  Slate                editors is in order

everbeen part of a team developing a OO plan for a software project Have you everdiagramed a relational database for a critique from your colleagues Most ofthe white boards youve seen were spied while

miles west ofIndianapolis home of the University of Illinois and no professionalprogrammer I know has this verbal mannerism            Mypersonal opinion would be that people give so many technical
