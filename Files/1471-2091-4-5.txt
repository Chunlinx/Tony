                    Background        Plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI is a serine        proteinase inhibitor in the serpin superfamily              This  kDa glycoprotein is apparently the most important        physiological inhibitor of tissuetype plasminogen        activator tPA and of urokinase plasminogen activator        uPA    It was shown to play a crucial role in the        regulation of vascular thrombosis tumor invasion        neovascularization inflammation and wound healing            Increased plasma levels of PAI were found to be        correlated with an increased risk for cardiovascular        diseases      The essential function of PAI in the        fibrinolytic system has been confirmed by studies with        transgenic animals            PAI shares a  homology with  other serpins           The Xray structure of active PAI     consists of        three sheets AC nine helices ai and a reactive        center loop RCL The RCL contains the residues Ser to        Arg PP and within it there is a peptide loop        Glu  to Pro  PP which is defined as the        distal hinge Table  It should be noted that the        placement and conformation of the RCL in active PAI is        quite different from that of latent PAI    The        movement of the distal hinge and the insertion of the RCL        into sheet A as strand A sA should take place during        the transition from the active into the latent form of        PAI        The catalytic center of tPA interacts with the reactive        site of PAI with concominant formation of  molar        SDSstable complex The P Arg residue in the RCL of        PAI is an essential determinant for its target        specificity and inhibitory activity     Since many        serpins with identical amino acid residue at P position        display different specificities it is unlikely that the P        residue is the sole determinant for target protease        specificity other regions of PAI may also affect its        specificity toward target proteases The variable region in        serine proteases domain determines their specificity for        PAI Alignment of variable region  of the serine        proteases shows a remarkable correlation between the        composition of this area and their susceptibility to        inhibition by PAI as shown in Table     Both tPA        and uPA the target proteases of PAI contain a        relatively extensive variable region  consisting of four        to five positively charged amino acid residues present at        identical position Plasmin and thrombin with moderate        reactivity toward PAI have relatively short variable        regions which contain only two to three positively charged        residues For example positively charged amino acids in        the variable region of tPA uPA and thrombin play dominant        roles in the specific interaction with PAI             Furthermore Glu P of PAI has been shown to        mediate the interactions with tPA           In this study By producing wtPAI and several single        site mutations in the distal hinge of PAI in a        baculovirus expression system we were able to find out the        role of the distal hinge in conformational transition of        PAI and to elucidate the role of Glu in PAI for        serine protease specificities                    Results                  Characterization of wtPAI          To confirm the validity of recombinant PAI as a          model to study the native inhibitor secreted from human          fibrosarcoma cells we compared the recombinant PAI and          the fibrosarcoma PAI first by SDSPAGE and immunoblot          with antiPAI monoclonal antibodies The molecular          weight of wtPAI was found to be lower than native PAI           kDa Fig B We assumed that this is due to a          lower probably different extent of glycosylation in the          baculovirus expression system Indeed when both proteins          were deglycosylated with Nglycanase they were found to          have an essentially identical MW  kDa and to          crossreact immunochemically Fig B Furthermore when          this wtPAI was chromatographed on heparinSepharose it          was found to be   pure by silver staining of the          gel Fig Alane           Interestingly the specific inhibitory activity of          wtPAI was    Uug just after purification and was          increased to    Uug after denatured by  M GdnHCl          and refolded in  mM sodium acetate pH  at C In          contrast the specific activity of the fibrosarcoma PAI          was only    Uug before activation and was only          increased to    Ug after denaturing and refolding          The high specific inhibitory activity of wtPAI could          be due to the fact that it was secreted from insect          High cells cultured at C while the fibrosarcoma          preparation of PAI was obtained from the medium of          fibrosarcoma cells cultured at C     Exposure to          the higher temperature could accelerate the conversion of          the inhibitor into its latent form          The functional stability of wtPAI and the          fibrosarcoma PAI in the absence or in presence of          vitronectin are illustrated in Figure C wtPAI lost          its inhibitory activity at the same pace as the          fibrosarcoma PAI indicating that its functional half          life as an inhibitor and its ability to be stabilized by          vitronectin are similar to those of the fibrosarcoma          PAI          The secondorder rate constants in M s units of          the fibrosarcoma PAI and the wtPAI towards tPA were               and       and towards uPA          were      and       respectively          These results show that the wtPAI could inhibit tPA or          uPA at the same rate as the fibrosarcoma PAI In          addition it is known that PAI inhibits either tPA or          uPA by forming a  SDS stable complex     wtPAI          indeed could form SDS stable complex with tPA or uPA          Fig A just as fibrosarcoma PAI                          Single site mutations within the distal hinge of          PAI          Since a proline occurs not only in position  of          PAI but also in the corresponding position of several          other serpins Table  we attempted to find out how does          a mutation of P affect the inhibitory activity of          PAI Mutant of ProGly blocked the inhibitory          activity of PAI Fig A Similarly a mutation into          proline of either Asp or Arg also inactivated the          inhibitor It should be noted that all these mutants          could be activated to a similar extent by  M GndHCl           inhibitory activity of the wtPAI activated under          the same conditions These results suggest that a single          site mutation at either one of the positions   or           significantly inactivates PAI          To elucidate the mechanism through which such          mutations affect the activity of PAI we determined          their effect on the functional stability of PAI and on          its ability to form an SDS stable complex with either tPA          or uPA As seen in Fig B the rate of the spontaneous          inactivation of the inhibitor was significantly increased          upon mutation the functional half life of the mutants          AspPro ArgPro and ProGly was    min             min and    min respectively while          that of wtPAI was    min Interestingly there          was no significant difference between the mutants tested          and the wtPAI in their ability to inactivate either tPA          or uPA Table  They could also form SDSstable          complexes with tPA or uPA just as well as wtPAI Fig          A          An interesting structural similarity among several          serpins is known to occur at the position corresponding          to  in PAI While in PAI this position          accommodates a negatively charged aspartic acid residue          in other serpins it sometimes accommodates its non          charged analog asparagine Table  AspHis          AspLys AspGlu AspGln and AspAsn were          prepared and used to show that the negatively charged          aspartic acid in PAI is essential though not          sufficient for its inhibitory activity Mutation of          Asp by asparagine the non charged analog of aspartic          acid or by histidine or lysine that have a positively          charged side chain or by alanine neutral inactivated          PAI Replacement of this aspartic acid residue even by          the negatively charged glutamic acid a very close analog          of aspartic acid did not significantly suffice to          restore a full inhibitory activity of PAI Fig B          After activation with  M GndHCl each of the six          mutants exhibited a relatively high inhibitory activity          but their specific activities were still much lower than          that of wtPAI Fig B Among them AspLys             Uug had the lowest specific activity while the          AspAsn    Ug had the highest specific          activity Fig B Although they had lower specific          activities all of the mutants mentioned above could          still form SDSstable complexes with tPA or uPA just as          the wtPAI data not shown          Two additional mutations ArgAla and ArgGlu          were prepared to further elucidate the role of Arg          The specific inhibitory activity of ArgAla was             Ug while ArgGlu exhibited essentially no          inhibitory activity This specific activity was increased          to    Uug for ArgAla and    Ug for          ArgGlu after denature and refolding Just like          ARGPro ArgAla and ArgGlu were much more labile          than wtPAI These results suggest that the role of the          AspPro segment is to stabilize the inhibitory          conformation of PAI                          Specific activity functional stability and complex          formation of GluAla and GluArg          The specific inhibitory activities of wtPAI          GluAla and GluArg were assessed with uPA and          S As shown in Fg A the specificity of wtPAI          GluAla and GluArg after denatured by  M GdnHCl          and dialyzed against  mM sodium acetate pH  was                and    Uug respectively GluAla          had a higher and GluArg lower specific activity than          wtPAI The specific activities of PAIs determined          immediately after purification displayed similar pattern          as that of inhibitors reactivated There was about           increase after reactivation compared to each untreated          protein itself As shown in Fig B the two mutants also          spontaneously lost their inhibitory activityconvert to          latency as wtPAI but at different rates The          functional stability of wtPAI GluAla GluArg was          about       and    minutes respectively It          suggested that the specific activities measured above to          some extent proportionally represent the functional          stability More importantly amount complexes formed by          tPA and PAIs remained after incubation at C Fig          C were proportionally concordant with the results          obtained from enzymatic stability assay Fig B This          proves that results from enzymatic assay are valid The          result of functional stability suggests that Glu is          indeed involved in the conformational transition of          PAI                          Inhibition of thrombin by PAIs and Neutralization          of PAIs by Thrombin          Both mutants inhibited thrombin more efficiently than          wtPAI more importantly GluAla was better than          GluArg in inhibiting thrombin Fig A Inhibition of          thrombin by GluArg was almost as same as by GluAla          in presence of vitronectin Fig B which facilitated          the thrombin inhibition by both mutants When excess          equal amount of thrombin was incubated with equal amount          of PAIs in term of inhibitory activity against uPA          mutant inhibitors were neutralized faster by thrombin          than wtPAI and vitronectin also facilitated the          neutralization of GluAla or GluArg by thrombin          just similar to the wtPAI Fig C                          Inhibition of plasmin by PAIs          When plasmin was incubated with increased amount of          equal active PAIs in absence or in presence of          vitronectin it was inhibited faster by mutants than by          wtPAI Fig upper panel and both of mutant also          displayed improved inhibition toward plasmin in presence          of vitronectin Fig lower panel                          Kinetic analysis          The rate constants of tPA for wtPAI GluAla and          GluArg were similar Table  however The rate          constants of inhibition toward uPA by GluAla and          GluArg were  and fold higher than by wtPAI          respectively Moreover The rate constants of GluAla          and GluArg for thrombin inhibition were  to  folds          higher than that of wtPAI and rate constants of          GluAla and GluArg to plasmin were  fold higher          than that of wtPAI This indicates that Glu is not          essential for the interaction with tPA but it is an very          important determinant for the optimal interaction with          uPA thrombin and plasmin                            Disscusion                  Cognate protease specificity          Improvements in specificity of mutants for uPA          indicates that Glu involve in the interaction with          uPA To the best of our knowledge this is the first time          that the specificity of PAI toward uPA is partially          mediated by the negatively charged residue located in the          Cterminal of cleavage site in PAI The interaction of          Glu with uPA is much more important than that of          Glu with tPA which is demonstrated by improved          reactivity of Glu mutants toward uPA but not toward          tPA showing that tPA is not directly interact with          Glu of PAI whereas Glu is necessary for the          optimal interaction with uPA Our results are concordant          with previous study    which suggests that serpin          bodyprotease body interactions play significant roles in          determining serpin inhibitory activity against target          proteases                          Noncognate protease          Substitution of Glu also altered the specificity          toward noncognate proteases plasmin and thrombin Glu          at  may provide steric hindrance that slows the rate          of thrombin or plasmin inhibition Mutations at Glu          may decrease the original repulsive interactions with          variable region of thrombin which may slow the rate of          thrombin inhibition or results in favorable interactions          that may not exist when wtPAI react with thrombin So          both GluArg and GluArg are better thrombin          inhibitors than wtPAI Similar results were observed          for plasmin With single mutation at position Glu we          improved reactivity of PAI to thrombin and plasmin          without significantly affecting its specificity to tPA          This substantiates previous mutagenesis studies which          demonstrated that repulsive interactions andor lack of          productive electrostatic interactions between Glu and          Glu of thrombin and PAI are responsible for the slow          reaction of thrombin with this serpin             Furthermore the rapid inhibition of plasmin requires a          noncovalent interaction between an aminoterminal site          of plasmin and a carboxylterminal on antiplasmin and a          second site outside the RCL of PAI contributes to its          specific interaction with proteases     The          specificity of the two mutants toward thrombin and          plasmin implicates that Glu of PAI is involved in          its specificity toward thrombin and plasmin                            Conclusion        Single site mutations within the segment        AspArgPro of PAI yield GdnHCl activatable        inhibitors that can still form SDS stable complexes with        plasminogen activators with second order inhibition        constants that are similar to the native inhibitor        Interestingly the conversion of these mutants to latent        forms was  fold faster than wtPAI suggesting that        the AspPro segment is involved in maintaining the        inhibitory conformation of PAI Glu contributes to the        optimal functional stability of PAI and participates its        conformational stability More importantly Glu of PAI        is a specificity determinant for uPA thrombin and plasmin        but not for tPA                    Methods                  General DNA techniques          Plasmid DNA was purified using either Promega or          QIAGEN miniprep kits The DNA was sequenced using the          dideoxy chain termination reaction method using an ABI           DNA sequencer Oligonucleotides were synthesized          using a  B DNA synthesizer ABI model DNA          manipulation techniques were carried out according to          standard procedures                              Construction of wtPAI and its mutants          The pPAIAI was digested with EcoRI and BglII to          release a  basepair bp PAI coding sequence which          was isolated purified and ligated into EcoRI and BglII          digested pVL The resultant pVLPAI was          analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing The          mutants at EA ER D R and P of PAI          were generated by PCR The occurrence of the resulting          mutations DA DE DH DK DN DP          DQ RP PG as well as EA and ER in pRSET          was confirmed by sequencing The PAI sequence          containing the desired mutations was digested with EcoR          and BglII and then subcloned into pVL The          recombinant baculoviruses containing either wtPAI or          one of the above mutants was obtained as deccribed by          Kjoller et al                             Expression and purification of wtPAI and its          mutants          High  cells grown at C in SF serumfree          medium were infected with hightiter virus stocks             ml The medium was collected  hrs after the          infection found to be the optimal harvesting time for          wtPAI and then centrifuged for  minutes   g          The supernatents  ml were collected and sodium          chloride final concentration  M was added They          were then applied on a heparinSepharose column bed          volume  ml that was equilibrated and run flow rate           mlh with a buffer consisted of  mM sodium acetate pH           containing  M NaCl and  Tween The          columns were washed and the PAIs were eluted with a           ml gradient of    M NaCl in the same buffer                          SDSPAGE immunoblotting and deglycosylation of          PAI          The medium of the infected cells and the elutent from          heparinSepharose were separated on  SDSPAGE and          monitored by silver staining Fibrosarcoma PAI and          wtPAI were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper and          the proteins were revealed with antihuman PAI          monoclonal antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase          HRP conjugated rabbit antimouse antibody and enhanced          chemiluminescence ECL  ug of Fibrosarcoma PAI or          wtPAI was denatured by boiling for  min in a buffer          consisted of  SDS  mM mercaptoethanol and  mM          TrisHCl pH  They were then digested  hr at          C with  units of recombinant Nglycanase in the          presence of  NP and subjected to SDSPAGE and          silver staining Protein concentrations were determined          by the BioRad protein assay reagent                          Functional stability of fibrosarcoma PAI wtPAI          and its mutants          The inhibitory activities of fibrosarcoma PAI          wtPAI and its mutants were measured by a direct          chromogenic assay using uPA  Uug and its substrate          S in a microtiter plate as described earlier              Briefly fibrosarcoma PAI wtPAI or its mutants          were diluted  in the activity measuring assay buffer           uM TrisHCl pH  containing  M NaCl and           ugml BSA The PAI samples were incubated in the          absence or in the presence of a two molar excess of          vitronectin the fibrosarcoma PAI and the wtPAI were          incubated with vitronectin at C At the times          indicated aliquots were removed and analyzed immediately          for their inhibitory activity One unit of PAI activity          is defined as the amount that completely neutralizes  U          of uPA The specific activity obtained at time zero was          assigned a value of                           Activation of PAI and kinetic analysis          Fibrosarcoma PAI wtPAI or its mutants were          denatured with  M guanidinehydrochloride GdnHCl           min at C followed by dialysis  hours at C          against  mM sodium acetate pH  containing  M          NaCl and  Tween This process which PAI          regained its activity is called activation by GdnHCl          The inhibitory activity of each of the PAIs was assayed          immediately The secondorder rate constants for the          interaction of the fibrosarcoma PAI wtPAI or the          indicated mutants with singlechain tPA or uPA were          determined in a singlestep assay as previously          described                             Specific activity functional stability and complex          formation of PAIs          The inhibitory activities of wtPAI and mutants were          measured by a direct chromogenic assay using uPA           Ug and substrate S    Briefly serially          diluted wtPAI or mutants were incubated with equal          volume of uPA  l  Uml for  min at C          followed by addition of  l  mM S Residual          uPA activity was quantitated by measuring the change in          absorbance at  nm with ELISA reader The specific          activity of PAI was calculated based on the amount of          uPA inhibited by PAI The assay for PAI inhibitory          activity toward twochain tPA was the same for uPA except          that the samples were incubated with tPA and S          PAI inhibitory activity is expressed as the number of          international units of PAs inhibited by PAI Specific          activity of uPA and twochain tPA are  Ug and           Ug respectively For the functional stability          wtPAI or mutants were incubated at C Aliquots were          taken out at times indicated and analyzed immediately as          described above The specific activity obtained at time          zero was assigned a value of  To provide the          evidence to support the conclusion obtained from enzyme          assay certain amount of wtPAI ER and EA were          incubated with equal amount of tPA at C for  minutes          before put on ice at same time these PAIs were          incubated in PBS at C for  hours respectively          before the PAIs were incubated with same amount of tPA          at C for  minutes then the protein samples prepared          at two time points were subjected to SDSPAGE and western          blot as described before                          Inhibition of thrombin and plasmin by PAIs          Thrombin  U or plasmin  gml was          incubated at C for  min with same amount of wtPAI          EA and ER in term of inhibitory activity toward uPA           U in the concentration range of  gml in          absence or presence of vitronectin  gml Linear          increase of absorbance at  nm were recorded after          adding S final concentration  mM for thrombin          or NpTosylGlyProLyspNitroanilide final          concentration  mM for plasmin Thrombin or plasmin          activity without PAI was taken as                           Neutralization of PAIs by Thrombin          wtPAI and mutants were incubated with four molar          excess of thrombin  nM in the absence or presence of          vitronectin  nM Control experiments were carried out          in the absence of thrombin After  min at C the          activity of thrombin was quenched by the addition of          hirudin final concentration  units ml resulting in          inhibition of more than  of the amidolytic activity of          thrombin Subsequently the residual PAI inhibitory          activity was determined by titration of aliquots on uPA          using S as substrate The increase of the optical          density at  nm in the samples was corrected for the          values measured with hirudininactivated thrombin          alone since the amidolytic activity of thrombin on S          was not completely blocked by hirudin                          Complex formation of PAIs with tPA or uPA          Complex formation of the fibrosarcoma PAI wtPAI          or its mutants with singlechain tPA or uPA were          performed as described earlier     Samples of PAIs           U were incubated in the absence or in the presence of          a fold excess of uPA or tPA in the activity assay          buffer Following a  min incubation at room          temperature the samples were subjected to a  SDSPAGE          and immunoblotting as described above                            Abbreviations        tPA tissuetype plasminogen activator uPA        urokinasetype plasminogen activator PAI plasminogen        activator
