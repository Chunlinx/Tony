                    Background        Recombinant inbred RI strains have been used        extensively to map a wide range of Mendelian and        quantitative traits   They offer compelling advantages        for mapping complex genetic traits particularly those that        have modest heritabilities Each recombinant genome is        replicated in the form of an entire isogenic line              and variance associated with environmental factors        and technical errors can be suppressed to low levels This        raises heritability and improves the prospects of mapping        underlying quantitative trait loci QTLs We have recently        used RI strains to map QTLs that generate variation in the        architecture of the mouse centralnervous system CNS                 The main advantage in this        context is that the complex genetic and epigenetic        correlations between interconnected parts of the brain can        be explored using complementary molecular developmental        structural pharmacological and behavioral techniques Gene        effects can also be tested under a spectrum of        environmental perturbations and experimental conditions RI        strains can be exploited to expose geneenvironment        interactions and gene pleiotropy These important facets of        genetics can only be explored with difficulty using        conventional mapping populations in which each genome is        unique        A third advantage of RI strains is that genotypes        generated by different groups using a variety of methods        can be pooled to generate highdensity linkage maps As a        result loci that segregate in RI sets can often be mapped        with impressive precision without genotyping This        attribute was a significant advantage before the advent of        efficient and easy PCR genotyping methods          Unfortunately over the past decade databases of RI        genotypes have accumulated many typing errors Each error        expands distances between marker loci and degrades linkage        inevitably blurring associations between genotypes and        phenotypes and making it difficult to map traits whether        they are Mendelian or quantitative in nature The        accumulation of false recombinations has become extreme in        common RI sets For example the map of chromosome  in the        complete BXD data set   is based on  linked marker        loci and is an astonishing  cM long This map is        approximately  times the length of an F map of        chromosome  and just over three times the length expected        of an RI map of chromosome  The accumulation of typing        errors has led to efforts to reconstitute maps using        curated subsets of markers for which genotypes can be        adequately and independently verified Sampson and        colleagues   assembled maps for the AXB and BXA strains        that improved the utility of this set Similarly Taylor        and colleagues   assembled comparable highquality maps        for the complete set of  BXD strains that are based        almost entirely on easily typed and verified microsatellite        markers        Our aims complement this previous work Our first aim        has been to generate reliable highresolution genetic maps        for each of five widely used sets of RI strains AXB BXA        BXD BXH and CXB These RI sets all share CBL alleles        and they can be assembled into a BXN superset consisting of        just over  lines The introduction of the RI intercross        RIX by Threadgill and colleagues    provides an        impetus to precisely define recombination breakpoints in RI        strains RIX progeny are isogenic F hybrids made between        pairs of RI strains One hundred and one wellmapped RI        strains could in principle be used to generate         welldefined isogenic and noninbred RIX genometypes        Our second aim has been to describe the recombination        characteristics of typical RI strains and their chromosomes        in a more theoretical context We have empirically tested        the HaldaneWaddington equation of map expansion in        sibmated RI strains We have also tested relatedness among        RI lines and measured deviations from HardyWeinberg        equilibrium associated with  years of inbreeding        genetic drift mutation and selection        Our third aim has been to help resolve a serious but        unrecognized problem in QTL mapping that arises from        nonsyntenic genetic correlations within mapping panels        Genetic correlations between intervals on different        chromosomes can be high in RI sets and this can result in        spurious results and falsepositive QTLs We provide        detailed correlation matrices that can be used to detect        and control for nonsyntenic association        Many of the files that form part of the analysis        reported in this paper are available as Additional data        files                    Results                  RI consensus maps of mouse chromosomes                      Undiscovered recombinations and SDPs            The number of recombinations in RI sets still            significantly exceeds the number of SDPs that have been            unequivocally defined On the basis of current marker            density we estimate that we have defined from             AXBBXA to  CXB of the total set of SDPs Table             The entire BXN set contains approximately             known recombination breakpoints Tables   There            are likely to be another  breakpoints that we have            not yet detected To discover   of the             SDPs in the BXD set required  selected markers            Recovering the majority of the remaining SDPs could            require an additional  to  well placed marker            loci The density of informative microsatellite markers            is not yet sufficient to define many more SDPs in the            BXN set but once SNP and microsatellite maps have been            fully integrated into chromosome sequence databases it            will be straightforward to generate additional markers            and use these to define all  SDPs in the BXN            set see   for integrated MIT and Roche SNP data            files                                Error checking            To minimize genotyping errors we retyped many            markers particularly those that were associated with            unusually large numbers of recombination events We            were particularly interested in minimizing the number            of genotypes that appeared to be associated with two            closely located recombination events  what are            sometimes referred to as doublerecombinant haplotypes            These haplotypes appear to be the result of two            separate crossover events one of which is just            proximal to a particular marker and the other just            distal to the same marker For example the haplotype            of a short chromosome interval              BBBNBBB  is associated with two            recombinations that flank the central marker with the             N genotype Because of            interference the occurrence of two recombinations            within  cM is highly improbable in an F intercross            and consequently double recombinants are often used as            a measure of genotyping error or incorrect marker            order In RI strains however recombination events            accumulate over many generations and two or more            recombinations can therefore be extremely close to each            other and can produce true doublerecombinant            haplotypes It is therefore necessary to verify rather            than discard all apparent double recombinants in RI            strains We checked our own marker genotypes and the            majority of microsatellite markers typed by other            investigators for whether they were associated with            double recombination events in one or more RI strains            When two or more strains contributed to double            recombinants we usually retyped all strains            Approximately  doublerecombinant haplotypes and             false recombinations were eliminated in the            process of error checking Our genotypes therefore            differ from those of many microsatellites reported in            original publications and listed in the Mouse Genome            Informatics Release    In a few instances our            revisions have generated new but verified            doublerecombinant haplotypes            We discovered unexpected polymorphisms at several            loci in a few lines and all were scored as unknown U            Table  The clustering of aberrant products in AXB            and AXB is consistent with the common origin of these            strains from a partly inbred progenitor line However            the genotypes of the other three sets of strains for            example AXB and AXB are generally completely            independent            PCR primer pairs in several intervals gave two bands            consistent with a genuine heterozygous genotype            Heterozygous loci are rare among fully inbred RI            strains but they are fairly common among new BXH            strains that were genotyped at the th to th            generation of inbreeding In scoring recombination            frequency we treated all heterozygous loci and            intervals as if they had not been typed Mutations in            microsatellite loci may be responsible for some            heterozygosity                                  Changed locus order            The order of loci of the BXN consensus maps            generally conforms to that of the chromosome committee            reports CCR and the MITWhitehead genetic maps            Figure  In about  instances we have changed the            order of loci over short intervals For example             DMit and             DMit on proximal chromosome             do not recombine in the MIT F cross but in the BXN            set there is a single recombination between these            markers in BXA that is most consistent with a            reversal of order relative to the CCR compare the            columns labeled CCRcM MITcM and BXNcM in Figure             The only nontrivial discrepancy was on proximal            chromosome  We reordered approximately  loci on            chromosome  to improve linkage statistics We have            not attempted to integrate the BXN data with numerous            other mapping panels and it is likely that original            CCR order will often be well supported by other large            mapping panels or rapidly improving physical maps Full            sequence data will soon resolve these minor            inconsistencies                                Reassigned microsatellite loci            A number of microsatellite loci were reassigned to            locations on chromosomes other than those expected on            the basis of their original assignments Table             Mapping data in one or more of the RI sets is            consistent with a reassignment of  microsatellite            loci to different chromosomes All of these            reassignments are provisional particularly those with            LOD scores of less than  In several cases for            example             DNds  we have reassigned            microsatellite loci typed by other investigators that            now are linked to new and firmly mapped markers All            primers used to amplify these microsatellites except             DNds  were resynthesized to            confirm that they are identical to those originally            specified by Dietrich and colleagues              Individual maps are based on genotypes of as few as             markers chromosome X to as many as  makers            chromosome  per chromosome Table  The mean            separation between markers is approximately  cM             cM using CCR maps as a reference and  cM using the            RI maps themselves When the  markers that do not            have unique SDPs are excluded from the analysis the            average separation increases to  cM using CCR maps            and  cM using the RI data Typical resolution of the            BXN set for mapping a Mendelian trait is  cM            Approximately  of the mouse genome is currently less            than  cM from a typed microsatellite marker in the RI            set The asymptotic resolution of the set of BXN            strains given infinitely dense maps in which every            possible SDP has been characterized would average about             cM There are currently  poorly typed            regions These regions are operationally defined as            intervals of  to  cM between adjacent markers            Figure  The largest is on proximal chromosome             between  and  cM Figure                                 Strain independence            Several RI strains share common haplotypes and            recombination breakpoints This nonindependence of RI            lines will distort genetic maps To systematically            search for and eliminate partial duplicate RI lines we            constructed a genotype similarity matrix for all            strains using the QTL analysis program Qgene               An example of a small part of this matrix is            illustrated in Table for the CXB set            As already noted by Sampson             et al   three sets of AXB            and BXA strains show high genetic similarity and            genotypes of four strains should be excluded from most            genomewide mapping panels Phenotype data obtained            from members of the three groups listed below should            often be collapsed and treated as a single strain            Group  consists of BXA and BXA which have             genetic identity Only two markers are known to be            polymorphic             DMit and             DMit  The polymorphism at             DMit has been verified using            independent DNA samples from these two strains BXA            is actually a direct derivative of BXA separated in               Any divergence in genotypes or            phenotypes is due to the recent generation and fixation            of new mutations in these two separately maintained            lines Group  comprises AXB AXB and AXB There            is  to  identity among any of the three pairs            Group  comprises AXB and AXB which have             identity These three sets of strains were treated as            three single strains when analyzing recombination            frequencies            The mean allele similarity of the remaining strains            averages almost exactly  The distribution of values            is symmetrical about the mean Figure  with the great            majority of strain pairs falling in the range of             similarity The highest remaining similarities within            RI sets are between BXD and BXD  AXB and            AXB  BXHB and BXH  AXB and AXB             BXD and BXD  BXD and BXD  and            AXB and AXB  These values are not            significantly higher than the similarity scores            typically noted across RI sets                                Residual heterozygosity            In theory a set of  genotypes generated            across the genome of  RI strains should detect only            a single residual heterozygous loci at generation F            of inbreeding Figure  lowest line the inbreeding            coefficient at F is  DNA from most lines            was extracted in the s at F generations between F            and F see Materials and methods We detected a            total of  strains that were still heterozygous BXA            from             DMit to             DMit  AXB from             DMit to             DMit  AXB at             DMit  BXA at             DMit  AXB and BXA at             DMit  BXA from             DMit to             DMit  BXD at             DMit  BXD at             DMit  BXD at             DMit  BXH at             DMit  BXH at             DMit  CXB from             DMit to             DMit  DNA samples were            taken from single animals of each strain and for this            reason these estimates of residual heterozygosity            underestimate the total heterozygosity about            twofold            The central part of chromosome  is interesting            because it is heterozygous in three strains BXD            BXH and BXA There is also an interval of            approximately  cM that is apparently maintained in            heterozygosity in AXB on chromosome  Such            maintenance should be accompanied by reduced fecundity            in this line if homozygotes are lethal or sublethal            This would account for poor breeding performance It is            also possible that the heterozygosity is the result of            a mutation but if this were the case we would expect            novel length polymorphisms and the two alleles were            usually the expected parental lengths                                    Structure of RI genomes                      RI mean map lengths            The mean frequency of recombinations             C             RI  between two linked markers in            an RI strain generated by breeding siblings is            approximately              c                c  where             c is the recombination fraction            per meiosis    An infinitely dense RI map            should average four times the length of the            conventional onegeneration F map Most expansion is            achieved in the first few generations and by F the            genetic map is approximately three times the length of            an F map Figure  The expectation is that a map            based on loci that are spaced at intervals of  cM              c   in an intercross will            be expanded approximately fold Similarly a            lowdensity map based on markers that are spaced at             cM intervals will be expanded twofold F and N maps            generated using uniform typing procedures typically            have a cumulative length of  to  cM Five            conventional crosses that we generated four Fs and            one N each genotyped at  to  loci average               standard error of the meancM in length In            comparison the fully errorchecked native BXN map is            approximately  to fold longer or a total of             cM The expansion averages approximately fold            when the comparison is made to the CCR consensus maps            Figure  Table  The expansion between common            proximal and distal markers ranges from  in            chromosome  to  in chromosome  In general the            expansion estimate of fold agrees well with the            HaldaneWaddington expectation given a mean spacing            between neighboring markers of  cM The X chromosome            only recombines with half the frequency of the            autosomes and for this reason its expansion is only            fold                                Comparison with other maps            The summed length of all chromosomes is            approximately  cM when values are converted from            RI recombination frequencies to those expected of            typical singlegeneration meiotic maps The            corresponding CCR maps have a cumulative length of             cM between the same markers The MITWhitehead            microsatellite maps have a cumulative length of            approximately  cM The agreement is excellent                                Recombination density per RI strain            Individual RI strains contain an average of             recombinations with a range that typically lies between             and  Figure  The  CXB strains are associated            with a total of  recombinations an average of             per strain The BXD strains are associated with            approximately  recombinations an average of about             per strain and approximately one recombination per            centimorgan on a standard genetic map Tables              There is considerable variation in the total load of            recombinations and map expansion per strain from a low            expansion of  in BXD the RI strain with the            fewest recombinations to a high expansion of about             in BXH Figure  These estimates are systematically            deflated by a failure to discover recombinations in            sparsely mapped regions regions where the            recombination fraction             c is as high as  but are            inflated by residual typing errors and errors of marker            order                                Recombination density per chromosome            Single chromosomes in RI strains accumulate as many            as  recombinations but across the whole set the            recombination density averages about  recombinations            per chromosome The mean extends from             recombinations for chromosome  to  for chromosome             A Poisson model fits the distribution of            recombination events per chromosome reasonably well and            most chromosomes have insignificant chisquare              values Figure  High  for individual chromosomes            are generally due to a small number of apparently            highly recombinant chromosomes in particular strains            These highly recombinant chromosomes are probably            associated with residual typing errors or incorrect            marker order                                Segregation distortion and HardyWeinberg

each marker A             statistic can be used to assess whether the            segregation ratio of a particular marker differs            significantly from expectation Only the  intervals            listed in Table have  values that are significant at            the  level Eight of  intervals are biased in            favor of             B alleles This is most extreme            on chromosomes   and X where there are about twice            as many strains with             B alleles as             N alleles The opposite pattern            is seen on chromosomes   and  Given the large            number of comparisons many instances of segregation            distortion may be typeI statistical errors In            collaboration with the Mammalian Genotyping Service              we recently genotyped a tenthgeneration advanced            intercross between CBLJ and DBAJ genotype data            for this cross is available at   It is therefore            possible to test whether similar segregation distortion            patterns are present in this related multigeneration            cross The short answer is that the segregation            distortions noted in the BXN RI strains are replicated            in  of  intervals The correlation between ratios of            alleles logarithm of             B              N  in these intervals was            positive              r   It is therefore likely            that several of the intervals marked in Table with            asterisks represent regions that harbor loci that            affect fitness                                Nonsyntenic associations            One important issue in using RI strains for mapping            complex traits is that intervals on different            chromosomes can become tightly associated in a            statistical sense This nonsyntenic association can            arise either as a result of random fixation of alleles            on different chromosomes during the production of RI            strains or can arise as a result of selection for            particular combinations of alleles on different            chromosomes Similar patterns of nonsyntenic            disequilibrium are common in recently admixed human            populations and often lead to falsepositive signals            when mapping complex traits In mice even a modest            selection coefficient expressed over ten generations of            inbreeding can generate positive and negative            nonsyntenic disequilibrium throughout the genome For            example if the combination of             B alleles on distal chromosome             and             B alleles on proximal chromosome             is favorable for fitness then these two intervals            will effectively be in linkage disequilibrium in the            final RI set Disequilibrium can also take the form of            strong negative correlations and             B alleles may be associated            strongly with the group of             N alleles            We searched for marked deviations from the expected            HardyWeinberg twolocus equilibrium by making a series            of large correlation matrices of SDPs of marker pairs            see   for a variety of correlation matrices This            was done for the entire BXN set and for the constituent            RI sets Figure summarizes the most extreme positive            and negative correlations among the composite set of             independent BXN RI strains Whether due to chance            fixation selection or epistasis nonsyntenic            associations of the sort illustrated in Figure are a            major source of both falsepositive and            falsenegativeresults in using RI sets for mapping It            is helpful to examine the correlation matrix once a set            of QTLs has been provisionally mapped to see how summed            effects of single or multiple QTLs might produce            spurious QTLs in regions not actually associated with            trait variance                                Controlling for nonsyntenic association            Nonsyntenic associations among loci and intervals            can be computed in advance of QTL mapping It is            therefore possible to statistically control for genetic            correlations that are built into different RI sets For            example in Figure the genotypes at marker             DMit can be partly predicted            by genotypes at markers on chromosome  and chromosome             If the genotype at             DMit is treated statistically            as a dependent variable and markers on chromosomes             and  are used as predictors then one can compute the            residual genotype or independent contribution of             DMit and any other marker or            interval to the quantitative trait Unlike composite            interval mapping the set of controlled loci will            necessarily vary for each marker and interval This            procedure will reduce type I error but will produce a            regional loss of statistical power The correction will            introduce blind spots in a genome scan In extreme            cases usually small RI sets intervals that can be            perfectly predicted by small numbers of other            nonsyntenic intervals will effectively be eliminated            from a mapping study and QTLs in those intervals will            be missed For this reason it is essential to perform            each a genomewide scan both with and without control            for nonsyntenic association Single QTLs may            occasionally be assigned to two or more physically            unlinked intervals                                      Discussion                  Information content of RI strain sets          Despite the accumulation of genotypes in RI strains          these genetic resources have often not been typed with          sufficient density to accurately define the frequency and          positions of recombination breakpoints For example in          the venerable set of  CXB strains only  unique SDPs          had been assigned to chromosome  before our work With a          more dense map of chromosome  that is now based on          approximately  markers we have recovered a total of           recombinations on this chromosome  approximately three          recombinations per strain The positions of these          recombinations have been defined with a precision that          ranges from  to  cM  cM average as referenced          to standard CCR maps Twentyone of the  SDPs are          represented by one or more marker but at least  SDPs          remain to be defined and these SDPs unfortunately cannot          be predicted unambiguously For example if two adjacent          markers           P and           D have genotypes           BBCCC and           CCCCC  then there must be at least          one unrecovered SDP between           P and           D  Until we actually type markers          in the           PD interval we do not know          whether the intercalated SDP is           BCCCC or           CBCCC  To discover the undefined          SDP could require considerable effort especially if          available polymorphic markers on the           PD interval have been exhausted          All unrecovered SDPs lower the information content of an          RI set Their absence can significantly reduce linkage of          both Mendelian and quantitative traits that are unlucky          enough to be controlled by loci in the intervals with          ambiguous SDPs          How dense should a marker map be to define more than           of the total number of SDPs With  markers we          were able to define approximately  of all likely SDPs          among the  CXB strains In the collected set of BXN RI          strains approximately  of the estimated           possible SDPs have been confidently defined with MIT          microsatellites We can estimate the density of the          marker map that would be necessary to define  of all          SDPs For example for the BXD set if one assumes a          random and independent distribution of breakpoints across          strains and a random distribution of markers it would          take a map with about  markers to define  of the           SDPs                          Use of the BXN set          Most mapping software applications used by mouse          geneticists are adapted for diallele crosses of various          types The BXN data set was therefore formatted in a way          that collapses all nonB alleles into a single           N class The collected set of just          over  strains can be used without complication with          software such a Map Manager QTX    This procedure          was used largely as a convenience to integrate RI genetic          maps There are selfevident limitations that follow from          the collapse of all non           B alleles AJ DBAJ CHHeJ and          BALBcByJ into a single category Geneticists using the          BXN set should therefore begin virtually all studies by          mapping with the individual component RI sets AXBBXA          BXD BXH and CXB to detect possible levels of allele          effects an allelic series The           B allele is a common feature and          may be a useful reference point for estimating          hierarchies among the five parental alleles This          separate setbyset analysis prevents the           N alleles from averaging out as          they might in a cumulative analysis the           N alleles will often have effects          that are both higher and lower than that of the           B allele Because the BXN set          includes  common marker loci and a consistent          alignment and integration of the component RI maps it is          now much easier to combine linkage likelihood ratios from          the component RI sets A simple method based on Fishers          method is described by Williams and colleagues   in a          study that pooled data from BXD and BXH sets More          sophisticated methods for automatically extracting and          combining linkage statistics from the multiallele BXN          sets will require modification of mapping application          programs Pooling data in this way will require judicious          and well justified statistical procedures Combining data          across the BXN sets can easily degrade a linkage          analysis The statistical exploration of different          combinations of RI sets provides new degrees of freedom          which may generate falsepositive results but which may          also generate interesting hypotheses regarding QTL          action          The BXN map could be refined further by interpolating          genotypes of other markers and genes that have been          mapped independently by many investigators in single RI          sets Our BXD database includes only microsatellite loci          for example and excludes hundreds of potentially          informative polymorphic loci many in interesting genes          We regret having to use this procrustean approach but          because of the difficulty of verifying genotypes and          because numerous loci introduce improbable          doublerecombinant haplotypes we have used exclusive          criteria to ensure highquality maps Investigators          interested in recovering some of this lost data should          refer to the comprehensive lists of genotypes maintained          by the Mouse Genome Database   However genotypes of          any marker and strain that introduce new          doublerecombinants into the BXN map should be regarded          with a high level of suspicion                          Power and precision of RI strains          A set of  conventional RI strains will have twice          the genetic variance of a matched set of  F progeny          and four times that of  backcross progeny This          increased genetic variance comes at some cost  F          animals represent  meioses and contain almost           unique haplotypes per chromosome the nonrecombinant          chromosomes reduce this number somewhat RI strains are          fully inbred and  lines represent almost  unique          haplotypes per chromosome A set of  RI strains          therefore has approximately twice the load of          recombinations as  Fs For a semidominant Mendelian          trait  RI strains therefore provide roughly twice the          precision of  F progeny and four times that of  N          progeny When both genetic variance and recombination          load are considered together a set of  RI strains          should be approximately four times as effective precise          for mapping complex traits as an F and eight times as          effective as a backcross This estimate assumes that only          a single RI animal is sampled per line a strategy that          is appropriate for mapping SNPs microsatellites and          other Mendelian loci          The gain for mapping quantitative traits will be          greater and will depend strongly on the heritability and          to a lesser extent on the degree of dominance at each          locus Belknap   has compared the relative power of RI          strains and F intercrosses under several models and          assuming different levels of heritability For          morphometric traits such as brain weight with narrow          sense heritabilities of around   RI strains will          provide a level of precision and power that is          conservatively equivalent to that of  F          intercross progeny The advantage shifts further in favor          of RI strains for traits with lower heritability Power          is one key issue in QTL mapping but at present          precision  the ability to finemap QTLs to          subcentimorgan intervals suitable for candidate gene          analysis  is the hurdle and one that would be less          imposing with improved RI resources                            Making better RI resources          The usefulness of RI strains for mapping is largely a          function of the number of known recombination breakpoints          and useful polymorphisms that they harbor All current          mouse RI sets are small and consequently the most common          criticisms leveled at QTL mapping with RI strains is that          the precision and power are poor and that only those QTLs          with unusually large effects can be detected reliably          The BXN set provides only a partial solution to this          problem by expanding the set of RI strains that can be          treated statistically as a complex cross A much better          longterm solution is to generate larger sets of RI          strains for highprecision complex trait analysis RI          sets consisting of  to  lines could provide very          impressive power and subcentimorgan precision The LXS          set  strains and the enlarged BXD set           strains mentioned above will soon provide practical          demonstrations Generating large sets is an undertaking          but the effort is dwarfed by ongoing mutagenesis and          sequencing efforts Generating maintaining and storing           RI lines could be a well justified expense given          the longterm utility of large RI sets in tackling          otherwise intractable problems in functional genomics           gene pleiotropy genetic correlations epistasis and          reactionnorm genetics  in a mammal          Several other factors make this idea significantly          more attractive First an RI set can be produced using          more than two inbred strains Four to eight strains could          in principle be combined to make RI sets that segregate          for a greater variety of polymorphisms This addresses          the concern that a single conventional diallele RI set          may not be useful for studying particular traits because          of a paucity of relevant polymorphisms Such multiway RI          lines buck the reductionist trend of eliminating genetic          complexity by isolating gene variants on inbred          backgrounds but such complexity has its advantages and          these strains would provide welcome models for exploring          genetic background effects that plague much of the          current work on transgenic and knockout mice            Second by genotyping and selectively breeding the most          highly recombinant animals it should be possible to          generate RI strain sets with map expansions that          significantly exceed that predicted by the          HaldaneWaddington equation an equation that assumes          random mating of sibs A six to eightfold expansion          should be attainable particularly if recombinations are          tracked before and during the inbreeding process Figure                    Recombination density could be further increased by          starting RI strains from either advanced intercross          progeny   or heterogeneous stock Figure  as was          done in making the new set of  BXD strains mentioned          above Third the power of RI sets can now be amplified          significantly by use of RI intercross RIX and RI          backcross RIB designs    Finally large RI sets          will largely eliminate the problem of nonsyntenic          association          A second well justified objection to using RI strains          to map quantitative traits is that fully inbred strains          may not provide representative phenotypes precisely          because they are inbred and subject to often severe          inbreeding depression The abnormal genetic architecture          of inbred strains and the fixation of multiple alleles          that affect fitness will almost inevitably produce          unusual pleiotropic and epistatic effects on a range of          complex traits Outliers are common on these and other          inbred lines Can the strain means be trusted          RIX progeny provide a surprisingly simple solution to          this problem    RIX progeny made among members of          a single diallele RI set will be similar to an F          intercross with an inbreeding coefficient of  Crosses          between members of completely different RI sets for          example AXB crossed to LXS will have an inbreeding          coefficient close to zero In this respect they will be          more appropriate models of human genetic variation but          with the remarkable advantages of completely defined          genometypes and the option of generating large numbers of          isogenic individuals                          Using the BXN and their RIX progeny                      Mapping modifiers of dominant alleles using RI            backcrosses            Knowing the precise location of breakpoints in RI            lines also makes it possible to map modifier loci of            mutations by making and phenotyping a set of different            F crosses made between inbred carrier stock for            example a knockout carried on a CBL background            and fully typed RI lines A set of these RI backcrosses            RIB has a genetic structure similar to a conventional            N backcross but there is no need to genotype any of            the RIB progeny and they have the major advantage that            isogenic progeny can be typed to obtain much more            reliable trait scores This method does depend on            either a dominant or semidominant mutant allele since            the phenotype must be detectable on a significant            fraction of the RIB progeny Provided that this            condition is met the costs and logistics of this type            of screen may be more modest than a typical screen for            modifier loci The analysis can be carried out without            genotyping and using replicated genomes to test for            environmental modulators                                    BXN and sequencing efforts          Five of the widely used sets of RI strains that we          have typed and analyzed share CBL as a parental          strain The genome of CBLJ is currently being          sequenced as part of a public effort   and for this          reason the utility of the BXN set for converting QTLs to          strong candidate genes will increase significantly in the          next few years   It will become far easier to          generate complete lists of positional candidate genes and          then to obtain data on gene and protein expression          patterns The two other major strains incorporated into          the BXN set  AJ and DBAJ  are also being sequence by          Celera Genomics and in principle it will be possible to          compare sequences of these three major strains to          generate lists of possible allelic variants in positional          candidate genes The recent cloning of the           Sac locus that controls sugar and          saccharin preference on distal chromosome  provides a          good example of the increased power of candidate gene          analysis This locus was initially mapped using  BXD          stains    In the absence of highresolution          mapping but with astute analysis of human and mouse          sequence data           Sac was identified almost          simultaneously by several groups as the gene for the TR          receptor         In a few years          the identification of genes associated with QTLs will          probably be no more of a special exception than the          cloning of Mendelian genes was in the mids                            Materials and methods                  Strains and DNA          Genomic DNA from most recombinant inbred and parental          strains was purchased from the Jackson Laboratory Bar          Harbor USA DNA was obtained from  of  AXB and BXA          strains and  of  BXD strains  CXB strains and           BXH strains   strains total For visual clarity in          this paper we have dropped hyphens and substrain          designations from RI strain names For example strain          BXDTy is referred to as BXD Databases and          webaccessible data tables at the Informatics Center for          Mouse Neurogenetics   also use this simplified          nomenclature          All DNA from the Jackson Laboratory Mouse DNA Resource          was extracted from individual male mice The RI animals          that we genotyped were with a few exceptions the          progeny of more than  serial matings between siblings          Data on the particular generation that we used for          genotyping and the current generation of RI animals is          available at   DNA from seven new BXH strains          generated by Linda Siracusa Thomas Jefferson Medical          College Philadelphia USA was extracted from the spleen          using a highsalt procedure   The new BXH strains          were generated by crossing CBLJ cJcJalbino males          with CHHeJ females and their production and genotyping          will be described in detail elsewhere L Siracusa and          RWW unpublished data Three of the new BXH albino          strains are no longer available C D and E We          genotyped  RI strains Several sets of strains share          haplotypes Table  We deleted redundant strains          AXB ABX and BXA          Strains BXHD BXHE and BXHE were backcrossed to          CBLJ for one generation before sibmatings were begun          There is therefore a pronounced increase in the number of          chromosomal segments inherited from CBLJ These          Nderived RI strains were dropped from most aspects of          the analysis of RI genome structure BXD has been          extinct for several years and was never completely          inbred Although we have DNA for this strain our sample          is from a F generation male We did not genotype BXD          in this study          We refer to the collected RI set as the BXN set          because each of the strains includes CBL B or B as          one of the parental strains

were typed using a modified version          of the protocol of Love and colleagues   and Dietrich          and colleagues   described in detail at   A          total of  primer pairs MapPairs that selectively          amplify polymorphic MIT microsatellite loci were          purchased from Research Genetics Each  l PCR reaction          mixture contained   PCR buffer  mM MgCl              units Taq DNA polymerase           mM of each deoxynucleotide  nM of the primers and           ng genomic DNA Reactions were set up using a channel          pipetting station A loading dye  sucrose  mM          cresol red was added to the reaction before the PCR            PCRs were carried out in well microtiter plates          We used a highstringency touchdown protocol in which the          annealing temperature was lowered progressively from C          to C in C steps over the first six cycles            After  cycles PCR products were run on cooled           Metaphor agarose gels FMC Inc Rockland ME stained          with ethidium bromide and photographed Gel photographs          were scored and directly entered into relational database          files          Eighteen primer pairs were resynthesized at our          request by Research Genetics using the original sequence          data WhiteheadMIT SSLP Database Release    to          verify that our chromosome reassignments of          microsatellite loci were not due to the use of incorrect          primer sequences                          Common markers          When we began this work fewer than  MIT markers had          been typed on each of the four major RI sets We were          able to increase this to  markers We relied on these          loci to assemble consensus RI maps The additional           MIT markers were typed by us and other groups in at least          one set of RI strains The BXN genotype database includes           markers Any pair of RI sets share between  and           fully genotyped markers For example the two largest          RI sets  AXBBXA and BXD  have been typed at  common          microsatellite markers                          Databases          Relational database files were assembled from the           chromosome committee reports the Portable          Dictionary of the Mouse Genome   and the          MITWhitehead SSLP database Release    These files          contain a summary of information on chromosomal positions          of  MIT microsatellite markers and information on an          additional  genes and markers We have included          Nuffield Department of Surgery Nds microsatellite          markers for which primer sequences are available          Additional databases devoted to each RI set were          assembled from text files downloaded from the
