                yes um how how do you feel about uh way the US has reacted in the Middle East   well i i i was uh it was favorable i i just uh i think the sanctions would have worked uh but it would have taken longer and uh now with all this stuff coming out with Woodwards book and everything uh and then i saw a Nightline program last night about all the uh funding of uh Hussein uh back as early as eighty nineteen eighty six so uh has there been a different turn and then i dont think we projected what was going to happen uh after the war well it got over so fast so uh   umhum what is the Woodward book you are referring to   well it uh just came out uh i guess yesterday its called the Commanders and its uh it says um big story in the paper about it today Bush trying to comment on it that uh Colin Powell was uh was against uh an early uh he he was for sanctions   umhum   and so it seems like theres you know always somebody digging things like that but im not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation so uh   umhum umhum   we we were so uh fast to get over the Vietnam whatever the Vietnam syndrome is that i im afraid now weve tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time   right that was thats my feeling i was i was very against our involvement so so quickly and um uh   i yeah i just think the i think if we had been very i i mean if he had that good of a correlation through the United Nations then they could have uh they they could have made sanctions work im pretty sure uh with that much support you would have just penalized any nation that uh broke the embargo   umhum umhum right i think were very naive as far as that part of the worlds concerned   we are we are i think uh you know in in uh weve just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bed with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure or next thing down the road and uh then we can and we dont seem to read Israel correctly so uh i dont know it should be a mess its uh not going to be anything were going to get out of very soon   right right in spite of all the promises   so right that they they can talk a good game but uh being a historian its uh you know you read all that  clear back at least to the turn of the century with all of the mess after first world war   umhum umhum   and we just uh were still very i i uh youre youre absolutely right too naive um we just if we do find socalled experts to in in any area of the world we dont listen to them so   umhum umhum   um i dont know be be interesting to keep watching i guess but im just afraid its going its going to break us   umhum and im im not sure were sensitive to to other cultures   so not very much uh in in our colleges were trying were i happen to teach at college with tremendous number of international students and and cultural diversity is just something we really dont understand and its uh it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades with our school systems in such disarray i dont know if that it doesnt look terribly hopeful   umhum umhum but im not sure its something you can teach i mean   well you can at least uh give give uh uh give them the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um at at least you know let them know what   awareness maybe   that that other people do things differently than than than maybe in their own neighborhood   umhum umhum   so and and when when when those people are around if they if you can get them to meet then were all pretty much alike   umhum thats true thats true   so uh   yeah   but its uh its something as you know as i said wont go away so uh itll be a good topic for me in the class for a long time since i teach history so     right and um what about the whole situation with with the refugees the Kurds   well i would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to um uh somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a a homeland they were promised that nineteen uh nineteen and that   um but what about the Palestinians then   well thats the same thing they uh they havent been waiting quite as long even though theyve been waiting since forty eight uh that   right   that that becomes a different matter simply because youre dealing with Israel and and they seem to be more intractable than ever   umhum umhum   uh that Shamir cant cant retain his leadership if he if he backs down the slightest bit so uh i just dont see us uh you know i dont think theres anybody of of major stature on the scene of like some of the great statesman of the past   umhum   or at least we thought they were im not for sure that they were they they seem to have gotten us into some of these messes but   umhum well do you think the US should even be involved i mean as as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve the issues or should we have just stayed out of it   well well i wish we could stay out of it but but the oils not going to allow us to we absolutely need that oil thats the major thing if we didnt need the oil and and if we didnt have the ties with the Israelis we could probably stay out of it   umhum umhum um right right   but im not for sure that were were not destined at least for the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the the worlds leader   umhum um   so i Bush is probably if if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and and and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money um they may just have to i dont know what type pressure they can put on uh all the nations there too because now that the wars over the societies have gone back just about to their own   umhum umhum   uh cold selves and uh i wouldnt have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis they uh theyre nobody likes them in that part of the world uh but its its just such a   umhum umhum   such a volatile uh area i mean theres just no stability there period thats whats   right but but in a sense i dont know that i i that i would say its good but in im sense in a sense im glad that Saudi wasnt more changed by by the situation because i mean we really dont   umhum   i mean i dont think its our role to westernize the whole world so the fact that that Saudi could just sort of pull back and and and remain you know culturally sort of clean is is interesting   absolutely not no yeah i think youre right i its not our uh role to make everybody like us   umhum   uh yeah but its just uh for those who who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world uh that are up in the age i am its going eliminate that for awhile i just dont think its going to be too dangerous to be any place in there   right right well you know i mean i i actually lived in Beirut from sixty eight to seventy to eighty four and so i mean its its been dangerous for sometime im not sure that it and its you know changed that much   oh did you yes yeah well uh i i i i havent been to Beirut but ive heard what a wonderful city thats just totally gone to uh ruin   well see thats it it really hasnt but but exactly it depends whether your talking whether one talks physical or or sort of um cultural culturally i mean it obviously changed a lot   it hasnt well see thats what we get from umhum   uh because its more a survival city but but the buildings are still intact its still beautiful you know theres there was garbage on the corners when i got there and theres garbage when i left but i mean this is just a different uh cultural aspect i mean the trucks dont come daily and and you really dont want the garb age in your house so   oh okay sure yeah   and i mean i traveled extensly extensively in the area too and um so that you know many of the countries Turkey and Syria are still the same as they were before for traveling   right okay okay   um   right i thats one part of the world ive ive been to north Africa a lot but not um i havent been to Beirut or or Syria or Israel or uh Baghdad i would love to go there   yeah i was never able to go to Baghdad it was i never could get a visa so even before i mean even when things were good in the Middle East Americans werent really given visas to Baghdad   yeah right   and um but its its a very beautiful part very interesting historically of course which was my interest is art history   right sure oh yeah   so um   yeah   well i think weve done them a good job today then       for this little project theyre doing   right right   in fact i just talked to the director awhile ago so uh he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because ive been so busy with this presidential search i havent had a chance to really do any calling myself   uhhuh i see i see well great and um you know have a good business trip   so uh anyway thank you and you continue your fine trip byebye   okay thank byebye
