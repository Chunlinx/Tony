                                 Drawing the Line            Fashion columnists have beensuggesting that the chic womans skirt will fall below the knee next fallMeanwhile Parisian store windows are full of columnar skirts meant to grazethe shoe tops and women in the street adhere in great numbers to theminiskirtthat is anything  inches or more above the knee The movablehemline goes on being a key visual element in the theater of female appearanceWherever the line is drawn a suggestive point is being made about femalelegsabout their provocative relationship to the pelvis and to the eagerglance of the beholder Pants just cant offer anything quite like it            Popularfashion history claims that the Modern Woman was created when women gave upcorsets But that moment never quite occurred at least not as it has beenportrayed Women have been shaping their bodies to suit shifting ideas offeminine beauty not only for centuries before modernity but ever since Thetemporary abandonment of tight little waists represented no more than a changein method The most important moment in the modernization of female dress waswhen women cut off their skirts for good            That was just before World War I about a decade before thesecond most important moment when they cut off their hair for good These tworadical acts made irreversible transformations in female appearance Theycreated a new shape for women dynamic and changeableand yet somehow sopermanent that the little female logo on the womens restroom can doubtlesskeep her kneelength skirt and chinlength hair forever No matter how low orhigh womens hemlines become or how much their hair length varies the point ofall such changesincluding those in store for us next fallis to show thatwomen have the choice to lift their skirts and crop their hair Before the th century they didnt            Longskirts like long hair had been required for women by religious law andgeneral custom since time immemorial During the  years when fashiondeveloped its own history both skirts and hair were considered immutable evenwhen fashion went to extremes There were moments of deviationthe bloomercostume for example with full trousers showing below short skirtsbut theynever lasted long The arrival of womens legs in the first quarter of thiscentury was a genuine shock            Womens legs were known to be there but theywere meant to be seen and judged privately Womens legs obey mechanical lawsof course and move apart while they are being used Watching them do that hasalways been a volatile matter for the male viewer Throughout all those heavilyskirted centuries men paid good money to watch womens legs prancing kickingand leaping on the stage since on the street the shift of weight was aboutall that could be discerned            Themythology of the feminine had a lot to do with the veiling of a womans lowerhalf The thick floorlength skirt produced the sense of complex secrettreasures difficult and perhaps unwise to discover Its not surprising thatat the beginning of this century women who wished to declare a new parity withmen to escape feminine mystery and enter female reality should shun malegear It was too frivolous and perverse Instead they remodeled the skirt Ifa skirt could be shorter and simpler female legs and feet could be seen atwork the normal action of knees and thighs would be apparent under its neatshape and a woman could at last be seen to make strides Her brains and herfeet could be seen to connect and she would become a normal human being            Skirts had risen above the ankle by  went up nearly tothe knee during the war in  and had a steep postwar drop back down tothe ankle in  a steep rise to midknee in  another drop in  andso on Once off the ground the skirts exact length became a burning issuefirst about hellfire itself since a woman with visible legs was seen by manyto be walking toward her damnation Then a range of personal worries about theexact level of the hem came into play Shorter might be too silly or toodaring longer too staid or too sultry either choice might be too modish ortoo tawdry Such uncertainties stirred up everready fashion hatred and madethe hemline into a derogatory synonym for fashionable change Legs turned outto be problematic The freeswinging or upsliding hem invited not only the eyebut the hand It soon became clear that dispelling mystery involved more thancompelling ordinary respect            With theminiskirt of  the public received another shock Pants gave skirts freedomto be outrageous and up they went to within an inch of the crotch And theremany of them stay with all the other lengths proposed in the  thcentury including back down to the floor and even trailing            The miniskirt was a truly revolutionarydeparture The heavy threat of the ancient long skirt was longforgottenthats not what miniskirts rebelled against The miniskirt arrivednot only as a separate garment but also as the bottom of a little dress wornwith big teasedout hair and big blunttoed shoes Suddenly everybody beganto look like Shirley Temple in her singing childstar daysall bouncy hair andwiggly legs with a tiny dress in the middleno waist no breasts no hipsand pale lipstick went with it The look was a bid to be a little girl againwith all a little girls irresponsible eroticism Adult female reality wasproving too hard perhaps            All reallittle girls dresses from the s to the s had been crotchlength Inthose years no adult skirts ever rose that high except maybe on the icetinyskirts were conventionally part of the innocence of childhood But as soon asthe miniskirt became part of the adult erotic arsenal little girls dressessank below the knee right where they had been in midVictorian times and wherethey still are guarding traditional female decorum as their elders skirts nolonger do The sexiness of children has lately been thoroughly acknowledgedwhich may be why their tasty little legs are now conventionally covered            The original miniskirt had another revolutionary sideitwas another theft by women from men only disguised Pants were an old storyand they were no longer strictly male but the s shorttunicandtightscostume especially when worn with high boots cropped hair and a hiplevelbelt seemed to put girls into the clothes of Renaissance youths so theylooked like Carpaccio dandies or Ghirlandaio toughs Daggers were not addedbut the effect of privileged male freedom was very tellingmaybe with a touchof Joan of Arc Girls in such androgynous gear looked ready for anyadventure            All suchRobin Hood allusions have long since been extinguished There followed theepoch of leg warmers and other mutations into the aerobics class lookMiniskirts withdrew from such sweaty connotations emphasizing instead theirharmony with classic jackets These days most miniskirts stop quite a fewinches below the crotch They have mainstream acceptance and no shock valueand are worn by young career women and old grandmothers alike            Though many girls still wear their skirts veryvery short novelty has lately required increasing their length not theirbrevityand many new long skirts are resembling South Sea wraparounds oftengauzy to suggest more exotic freedoms newer ways for longer skirts to seduceOnce everybody goes in for length lets give it about three yearsthe sameperiod as between  and  sayand then expect another rise with otherconnotations The fashion business sees to it that interest in shifting skirtlengths is never exhausted            But perhaps after a hundredyears of skirts that liberate and expose women will again feel the desire forfullness drag and bulk in their skirts for the chance to swish trail andsweep to swing heavy fabric from the hips maybe even to lift heavy folds infront of the bellyor simply to have another way of muffling unsatisfactorylegs with something that isnt pants The couture ball dress and the standardwedding dress do after all keep suggesting the possibility and MadonnasOscar outfit this year suggests that full gowns have even attained the statusof something avantgarde
