        um what kind of house do you live in   uh we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the the standard Texas uh Fox and Jacobs   oh yeah       with with a yard and fence   how about you guys are you in a house apartment or a house   im in an apartment in uh Plano   well they say that those are easy to find or difficult to find   yeah they are if uh kind of depends on what youre looking for mines just a one bedroom place thats uh   how are rents doing i havent looked at rents in a long time   uh its hard for me to tell because i havent rented in uh probably twenty twenty five years   uhhuh   and uh just im getting back into apartment life and its   whats a whats a one bedroom are you in a um well Plano most most complexes in Plano are pretty nice so youre probably in a you know   yeah but well they vary from from place to place its hard to tell you know how well theyve been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and uh   umhum   theyre almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place   ooh that does get high yeah i mean   yeah it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that   yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty   yeah   so thats really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually theyre near Plano in North Dallas too but i couldnt believe it but you know   wow thats a lot for a townhouse but thats what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know theyre going to get it   yeah and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean weve been in ours for about ten years but uh theres no investment in it you know   yeah   all it allows you to do is itemize   yeah thats true you just take off your mortgage interest and thats about it   on your on your taxes yeah thats really about it its uh have you ever owned your own home   yeah oh yeah ive owned uh several and built several uh   so you know what its like yeah its like when you first this is our third one its not um and its not that exciting after a while   well well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs and   yeah suburban track yeah we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back and uh we lived in a smaller city and now we say gee Dallas really is big and polluted   isnt it i can remember ive only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas   uhhuh   and now theres this brown haze over it and its moving north   yeah its really its really sad because theyre theyre not doing anything well were getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean theyre not doing anything about pollution theyre not doing anything about its going to look like Houston have you ever been to Houston   oh yeah   you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know   yeah yeah it does how how long have you been in this house   weve been in here ten years   ten years   yeah so weve got you know weve got some investment in it but you really dont get anything out of it   no you really dont were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than than Dallas area   yeah smaller we were up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania   how were the how were the house prices up there   my home town um the prices actually a lot better because Pittsburgh is about the size im trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size   yeah   and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty   wow   yeah its really and we didnt think it was that clean but then after youre gone for a while it looks cleaner you know   hum oh yeah   um   well you know a lot of these people that ive talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back East especially from JC Penney   yeah Saint Louis whatever   uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here and theyve wind up getting better houses here than they had there   really   so in a way i guess it works both ways you know   i guess its yeah but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know here once people like i know a lot of people that work for JC Penney in marketing   yeah   and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what youre talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it   thats a fact   but but they love it i mean they they they think that theyre getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell   i guess thats true and they dont have to worry about yard upkeep because they dont hardly have any   yeah yeah and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there and they dont miss in public relations and they dont miss having a basement to run up and down to you know   thats true theres not too many basements in Texas   and i said you havent heard about tornados  how about bugs you know     yeah gosh i remember when i was little uh we didnt have a i lived grew up in southern Oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar and we we never did   uhhuh   and its just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three oclock four oclock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and wed go into the cellar and i   yep   to this day i dont care if i go or not you know if its going to get me its get me   thats exactly uh growing i grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so its funny to hear that word because i never hear it you know its like the back porch used to be a stoop you know   yeah yeah   but uh um the housing is just we like the older homes and i dont know if were going to stay here or not depends you know i mean   you ever thought about building a house   pardon me   you ever thought about building a house   yeah actually when we were up north um but some family things changed so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husbands work but um we really would like to but we dont know if were going to do it unless we stay here you know it   yeah thats true especially well well TI is like anybody else you never know how long youre going to be here or be in one place you know     yeah it its real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know its um pardon me   yeah do you work do you work   yes i do   so how do you handle do you got any kids   uh no we dont   so you got hes working and youre working and you got this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those   uh how do i take care of the house well i dont have a Mexican i dont i shouldnt say that i dont have an ethnic maid  i dont have we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road and they have like a four thousand square foot home and shes got a uh     yeah   a live out nanny um but any rate i dont have any of that um i dont know its really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know   you basically can take care of everything yourself   we have a yeah we have a dog and were pretty i mean were not fanatically neat but um we keep things up you know its not like where theres three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring   yeah yeah what about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or   um no were pretty much um we weve been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together   wow you too   and things like that um we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything thats not a um i mean i know how to fix a running toilet     yeah yeah oh yeah   he does what he needs to but mostly if its something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that   yeah sounds like you youve already got the makings for being a general contractor   yeah no thanks i   yeah   if you dont wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together   have you ever done that i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time   yeah i built three houses in my life and   and howd that go   oh they the the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things   uhhuh getting to agree to things that im sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older   yeah   you start um the dollar value on things   you bet   i you know i think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic   oh you bet   i know im supposed to talk about homes but people that own the people that own them are the home homes themselves and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesnt   oh yeah well to some of them i guess it doesnt matter you know that maybe theyve got enough coming in to to take care of it but   yeah thats i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from New York with Exxon or JC Penney and its just a hoot to watch them   hum umhum oh yeah they as far as theyre concerned theyve come to the promised land you know theyve got it made already   right right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house   oh yeah because youre combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house house and i had room for everything   oh my goodness yeah   in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i dont know its its seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill available available space but   uhhuh yeah   uh   well in a way you can travel light   yeah you can yeah you know you learn you adjust you figure out   how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that   its not as bad as i thought it was   uhhuh   uh its not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be     yes i do   uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know theres kids all around and theres theres traffic and theres people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh   everybody pretty much keep keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak   yeah pretty much and uh theres never really any any oh i remember in school theres just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you dont run into that up here i think i think because theres so many uh professional people if you want to call them that   yeah uhhuh   uh that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet   yeah relax and try to go to sleep really yeah   yeah yeah  you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging or doing this and that and uh theyre trying to to unwind   and i think Plano in general is getting a little more well its gotten so big its almost a town in its own right   oh yeah its a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that   isnt that something yeah the price of home now we paid oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and   yeah   id say they appraised it its gone up you now maybe like five percent   oh yeah   so its an investment but its something that you know when youre first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really its just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize   oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh   yeah exactly we   youre always paying for something you know   yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but um it was an older home but then you buy an older home and youre always fixing things up   umhum oh you are constantly theres always something going wrong   so you know
