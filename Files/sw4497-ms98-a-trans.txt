                well all right um i i guess ill start um by mentioning that um being twenty four years old i had a greatgrandmother whos still alive at this point who was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my greatgrandfather and it was a real problem  in doing that because uh she has Alzheimers   umhum umhum   and uh she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and uh we were very concerned about uh her longterm care my greatgrandfather after he was found out he was going to go into a nursing home uh actually gave up the ghost more or less   hm   and passed on only only about a week after that   well my um my my grandmother is um had Alzheimers and through the process we had to remove we tried to keep her at home at our we had to remove her from her home because she was getting paranoiac and tried to keep her at our home and did that as long as we could but again the process is very difficult even even you know i think that my parents did a good job at it when when they went through but its not an easy thing when theyve got Alzheimers but my other grandparents um signed up for a retirement type thing in Pennsylvania um already my fathers much older than my mother so well no i guess it anyway my grandparents my other grandparents are much younger and um they what they did is they sold their house and bought a house figuratively speaking in this retirement complex and they live in that house and there there theres minimal because they you know they bought it um theyve kind of bought into the whole system and theres theres care given for the lawn and stuff   umhum     and um as they get older more care can be given and theres some minimal fees that theyll always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already taken care of and when they get too old they can move into an apartment instead its like a duplex they have now   yeah well   they can move into an apartment and then later nursing   we had yeah we had up here when they got into uh when my grandmother came over my greatgrandmother came over here she actually spent sometime with us and we had to have a nurse come in   umhum   because we simply we couldnt handle it she kind of shed lost all bearings as to where she was and she would actually wander around uh we were afraid she would wander herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or uh you know it was incredible because my greatgrandfather had taken care of her and she demanded absolute twenty four hour care she had to be watched she had to be cleaned   yeah   everything you know it was a demeaning process for my for my grandfather greatgrandfather we had never realized how much um how bad she had deteriorated over the uh years i mean i she would forget my name and she would forget you know how to cook or how to take care of herself but we didnt realize the extent until after my greatgrandfather had a bad stroke and um um  we had her here and we had to take care of her and it even kind of drove the nurse a little crazy   yeah thats what happened to my other my grandmother my grandfather had died and she wanted to stay on and then she got Alzheimers and it was a really hard thing for the whole family im much more appreciative of what my     yeah   my other set of grandparents has done and my parents have already um kind of like gone on a waiting list cause its such a long thing because it preserves the dignity of the you know the whole situation and its a decision that my parents have made and it wont be a drain on our resources because itll mean just   yeah   um you know sell selling their house now and buying into that at the same time and its familiar   yeah my my greatgrandfather my greatgrandfather had found uh my greatgrandfather was was was around during the depression so he had actually hidden a lot of money in the house over there and of course you know the moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything   umhum   and and it was it was terrible and very demeaning he didnt wanna lose the independence and   yeah   uh that was the biggest problem because we didnt really catch it as early as you seem to have as far as you know planning you know of longterm   well we didnt catch it for my first grandmother my first set of grandparents but my other grandparents had apparently its like a retirement community and they knew a lot of friends who had done the same thing and when they got there   yeah
