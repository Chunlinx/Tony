              um  so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in peoples individual  uh lives   well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named Milton Friedman   um yeah hes a commentator isnt he   yeah well no no he actually wasnt he hes an he was uh hes an anti government type uh fellow hes not really a commentator i dont i dont believe   uhhuh uhhuh   uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh and im a Milton kind of a Milton Friedman fan and hes anti big government and thats thats my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um   uhhuh     that theres just a tremendous amount of waste im im a CPA and i can i see the way they uh butcher people as far as im concerned and uh   uhhuh uhhuh   in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they   and so do you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view   take money from them you bet i do yep     uhhuh   something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i i cant believe how   uhhuh   tax you you know  our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how   uhhuh   tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue   yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point   uhhuh   i think you know as far at least as far as our deficits concerned   uhhuh   you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you now have this bread and circuses policy of you know well give you a dollar a day if you vote for us you know   thats thats right   yeah  yeah i mean your kids wont be happy but     uhhuh   youll be able to buy that that extra six pack of beer at the end of the week     right the deficit the countrys in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i dont know if this is wrong or right   uhhuh   but for every man woman and child in the United States theyre in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt   uhhuh   id be done id be sunk   uhhuh   you know i just i theres no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt i dont know what the heck our governments going to do one time um i i really personally think were going to have to collapse just like the Soviet Union did or uh i i dont know how how how can we     it really wouldnt surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years   yeah right i dont see it in the near future but uh   um and we we are still considered the best credit risk in the world   yeah because we write off debts we loaned the Mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them   supposedly uhhuh   thats the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was Turkey We wanted to use their air strips during the Persian Gulf   uhhuh   so we just went over there and said gee guys you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and well just forgive it   uhhuh   thats ridiculous   uhhuh   and and i dont know if thats really the case you know im talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what ive heard uh from other from from other some of my other associates but that wouldnt surprise   yeah maybe i would we weve been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things i uh um     what do you think about the Japanese and the comments theyve made recently about the American people im not sure thats uh actually a political issue but uh   well it in it um i think if anyone but the Japanese had made it if if if an American had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them   thats true       and im not so sure theyre all that wrong   oh yeah yeah yeah um you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy   uhhuh   um in management um you know our we you know we we you know you know the trend of over consumption since World War Two um you know theory being that thats what what what would be required to make our economy to thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that just moved for better and better standards of living and where a bunch of other factors i think you know is just you know its its uh were were unable to keep on increasing that you know when when you know when you combine with the mismanagement that a lot of American companies have had and yeah i think that you know thats really when he says that they were lazy i think lazy probably wasnt the best term to use       but i think you know you know unwilling unwilling you know unwilling the American workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other countrys workers are   right
