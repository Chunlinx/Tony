                    Background        Follicle stimulating hormone FSH regulates        spermatogenesis through the somatic Sertoli cells of the        testis     Sertoli cells act as nursing cells and        supplies germ cells with energy and controls the        biochemical environment in which they develop     Among        the FSHregulated functions are increased glucose uptake        and oxidation In response to glucose transcription of        several glycolytic and lipogenic genes are activated        through the glucosecarbohydrateinsulin response element        GIRE ChoRE or IRE      Upstream stimulatory factors        USF  and  are characterized by a basichelix loop        helixleucine zipper domain responsible for dimerization        and DNA binding and are major components of the GIRE        complex               The main USF isoforms USF  kDa and USF  kDa        are ubiquitously expressed and encoded by separate genes              In addition more isoforms of USF are produced        due to alternative splicing and utilization of different        translation start sites      USF factors exist as        homo and heterodimers and the heterodimer of USFUSFa        seems to dominate although there are celltype specific        variations     USF and USF show different        transactivating potential and USF appears to be the        functional transactivator of the GIRE complex although        both USF and USF are important for sustained        dietaryinduced expression of the fatty acid synthase gene        in liver            USF isoforms are important for expression of several        genes involved in Sertoli cell growth and differentiation        Among genes that are stimulated by FSHcAMP during the        period of maturation of Sertoli cells  to  days of age        in rats are several subunits of cAMPdependent protein        kinase PKA the serinethreonine kinase mainly        responsible for the downstream effects of FSH            Expression of the RII regulatory subunit of cAMPdependent        protein kinase is highly induced fold at the mRNA        level in primary cultures of rat Sertoli cells as a late        response to cAMP peaking at  hours     We have        demonstrated that expression of CAATEnhancer binding        protein  CEBP is induced by cAMP with rapid kinetics        in Sertoli cells and that CEBP is responsible for        induction of late response genes like the RIIgene            The RII promoter contains a conserved EboxHLH element        in the basal promoter localized at  to  relative to        the functional ATG     This element is shown to be        important for cAMPresponsiveness in granulosa cells and        it has been shown to bind both USF and Myc in CHO and NBa        cells      In this work we show that USF isoforms        may regulate cAMP responsiveness of the RII promoter by        modulating the effect of CEBP and that the formation of        USF isoforms may be regulated by cAMP in Sertoli cells                    Results                  USF complexes are formed on the RII          promoter          A specific complex that formed a Dnase I footprint           to  in the cAMPresponsive region of the RII          promoter in granulosa cells     covers a consensus          Ebox CACGTG known to bind helixloophelix bHLH          transcription factors Electrophoretic mobility shift          assay EMSA with extracts from Sertoli cells          demonstrated specific binding to the conserved element          using the footprinted region as probe     When          incubated with proteins from Sertoli cell nuclear          extracts at least five complexes were formed Fig           complex I to V We found that USF antibody shifted          complex I and III Fig lanes  and  whereas complex          II and IV were completely shifted with USF antibody          suggesting that the USF complexes contained homodimers          Complex V was not shifted by antibodies directed against          Nterminal parts of USF or USF but with antibodies          directed against the Cterminal DNAbinding region of          USF Fig lane  Thus this complex contained          truncated USF A small shift in mobility of this complex          was observed in extracts prepared from Sertoli cells          treated with CPTcAMP for  h data not shown          Experiments using various protease inhibitors indicated          that the changes in complex mobility were due to          inhibitory effects of PKA on the protease calpain The          truncated USF complexes forming complexes III to IV were          abolished in the presence of calpain inhibitor I ALLN          unpublished results                          A kDa USF isoform is induced by cAMP          In order to study the existence of different variants          of USF expressed under stimulated and basal conditions          we performed immunoblotting experiments with antibodies          against Cterminal regions of USF and USF For USF we          observed that a new immunoreactive protein of about           kDa was formed only in nuclear extracts from          cAMPstimulated Sertoli cells Fig A This isoform was          not soluble but associated with a  Triton extractable          fraction not shown In contrast we found no          significant changes in USF protein levels or mobility          following stimulation by cAMP Fig B Other truncated          USF or USF isoforms could not be detected in this          assay which may indicate that the levels of isoforms          forming complex V Fig  are very low relative to the          fulllength protein We were not able to relate the          appearance of the novel  kDa USF isoform to changes in          USF complex formation in EMSA Formation of the truncated          USF isoform in cAMPtreated cells was not affected by          addition of calpain inhibitor unpublished results                          USF inhibits cAMPmediated induction of the RII          promoter          We investigated the function of USF isoforms in          regulation of the RII promoter using a CAT reporter          containing the basal RII promoter including the          consensus Ebox Fig A and expression vectors for          USF USFa and USFb isoforms We found that none of the          USF isoforms affected basal transcription from the RII          promoter not shown whereas both splice variants of USF          a and b reduced cAMPstimulated levels of reporter          expression to  USF however had no inhibitory          effect on the cAMPmediated induction of RII Fig          Bshows a dosedependent reduction of cAMP responsiveness          with increasing amounts of USFa expression vector with a           reduction in reporter activity at  ng of USFa          vector and a  inhibition at  ng of USFa          vector                          USF inhibits CEBPmediated induction of the RII          promoter          We have previously reported that some of the late          induction of RII by cAMP depends on the rapid          cAMPmediated increase in CEBP expression     To          test the effect of different USF isoforms on          CEBPmediated induction of the RII promoter we          transfected combinations of the transcription factors          Fig  As previously reported the fulllength          LAPform of CEBP induced the RII promoter fold          whereas the CEBP LIPform lacking the transactivating          region had no effect Cotransfecting USF had no          significant effect on CEBPmediated induction but          USFa  USFaCEBP expression vectors reduced          induction by  indicating that USFa may interrupt the          ability of CEBP to transactivate the RII promoter                            Discussion        The promoters of several genes induced by FSH in Sertoli        cells and granulosa cells including cFos transferrin        follicle stimulating hormone receptor SF genes and the        RII gene contain functional Ebox elements               We found that several USF complexes containing        fulllength USF and USF as well as truncated versions        are formed at the consensus EboxHLHbinding element in        the RII promoter in Sertoli cell nuclear extracts        USF and USF display identical dimerization and DNA        binding domains but the transactivating regions differ            USF and USF obviously serve different yet        overlapping functions and regulating the relative        USFUSF levels may be decisive for the pattern of        USFmediated gene expression which has been shown in        studies of USF knockout mice The USF  mouse has        obvious growth defects and reduced fertility            whereas the USFdeficient mice are viable and fertile with        minor behavioural disturbances A severe delay in        glucosemediated regulation of the GIREcontaining fatty        acid synthase FAS gene is found in both USFdeficient        mice although insulin response was unaltered indicating        that the USFUSF heterodimer is implicated in FAS        expression            We have previously shown that CEBP functions as a        secondary effector of cAMP signaling on slow response genes        in Sertoli cells including RII     Both CEBP and        the RII Ebox is shown be involved in cAMP responsiveness        of the RII gene             Our present results indicate that USF disturbs this        CEBPmediated transactivation of RII No consensus        CEBP binding site is found in the promoter construct        responsive to cAMP and CEBP but a possibility exists        that CEBP attach to the RII promoter through        proteinprotein interactions with USF or other members of        the transcriptional unit formed at the Ebox CEBP is        previously reported to be an important accessory factor for        transactivation by several other transcription factors            CEBP was shown to transactivate the acid        glycoprotein gene promoter even when mutated in the        DNAbinding domain and this activation appeared to depend        on proteinprotein interaction with glucocorticoid receptor        through the leucine zipper region     Recently a        conserved domain in CEBP and CEBP was shown to mediate        cAMP responsiveness strengthening the fact that CEBP may        be characterized as a cAMPresponsive nuclear regulator             On the COX promoter in granulosa cells        cAMPmediated regulation was shown to be mediated primarily        by an Ebox that bind USF and USF isoforms in a manner        resembling the RII Ebox in Sertoli cells            Transactivation of the COX gene in skin carcinoma cells        is highly dependent on this Ebox together with a CEBP        binding site that bind CEBP and CEBP     These        data strengthens a model of formation of a cAMPresponsive        unit CRU containing USF and CEBP We propose a model of        interaction between USF and CEBP by which USF inhibits        the cAMP responsiveness of CEBP either through        interacting with the domain mediating the cAMP        responsiveness or by competing with USF        The cAMPregulated formation of a kDa USF isoform        may also play a role in formation of the RII CRU This        truncated USF isoform may result from proteolytic cleavage        or may be a novel splice variant In granulosa cells it        has previously been shown that the level of Nterminally        truncated USF is regulated by cAMP Binding of truncated        USF to a HLH element in the prostaglandin GH synthase         PGHS promoter was abolished in extracts from cells        stimulated by human chorionic gonadotrophin hCG which        signals through cAMP            Other reports have suggested a role for USF in        inhibition of transcriptional activation mediated by other        transcription factors An inhibitory effect of USF on        Mycmediated cellular proliferation has been demonstrated        in HeLa cells     and a noncanonical HLH element        inhibits expression of the fibroblast growth factor binding        protein FGFBP in several carcinoma cells            Furthermore USF inhibits binding of hypoxiainducible        factor HIF to the plasminogen activator inhibitor         PAI gene in hepatocytes in order to disturb        transcriptional activation     Our results add        CEBPmediated activation of RII to the mechanisms        inhibited by USF An opposite role of USF and CEBP could        also be explained by the counteracting effects these        transcription factors have on glucose metabolism Whereas        USF induces expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis        CEBP regulates gluconeogenesis mainly by activating        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PEPCK             It has recently been reported that USF is implicated in        transcriptional activation of the a promoter of the RI        gene in skeletal muscle cells     Regulating the        relative levels of RI versus RII is physiologically        important eg in lipid metabolism      and a        possible function of USF in tuning RIRII ratio by        activating RI transcription and inhibiting RII        transcription is an interesting target of further        investigation                    Conclusions         USF and USF as well as truncated USF isoforms        bind to a consensus Ebox in the RII promoter in Sertoli        cells         Cyclic AMP induces expression of a novel kDa USF        isoform         Overexpression of USF but not USF inhibits        cAMPmediated and CEBPmediated induction of the RII        promoter                    Materials and methods                  Antibodies          USF
