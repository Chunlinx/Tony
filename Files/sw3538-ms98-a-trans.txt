                well um i kind of like the ers     San Francisco   right how about you   be im a im a a die hard Dallas fan   oh great   i was born and raised here so i i have to back my team   well yes i guess that thats understandable um   why are you a ers fan   well they have a couple players they have had and they do now that that um played here in Utah at BYU before they went down there um Steve Young was from BYU and uh Jim McMahon was hes not hes not one of my favorite players personality or otherwise but  he did play here so that you know provides a little bit of interest um how about you what are who are some of your favorite players   well theres a lot of them theres uh Michael Irwin thats uh making making a real real good name for himself this year   uhhuh oh   Troy Aikman   uhhuh   i dont know if you ever heard of him   no i havent   well do you watch football   well not too much i i follow mostly you know the college the college ones around here rather than the the professional   not too much oh really right   so you know youll  well who do you thinks going to go far this year   i dont know its its its pretty its pretty tough im im i dont follow the other divisions that that much its i have a hard enough time just keeping up with Dallas and   umhum right   the uh conference theyre in right now   uhhuh   but i think Dallas will do pretty good i dont i dont know if theyll go all the way   oh good uhhuh   theyre probably they they they may be another year away from going all the way   oh   but theyll theyll be in the playoffs and i think theyll do real good   well good what do you think about how much the football players make   thats a   professional football players   well uh thats i wouldnt mind wouldnt mind getting some of their salaries     all right do you do you think they they should be paid that much   yeah   do you   i think they earn it i think they earn it i mean i i mean i youd have to pay me that much to get out there on the field to uh   you think   you know get the crap knocked out of me so   uhhuh yeah well what about um yeah i guess the risk of injury that they go through i mean they get injured its pretty much for life in that that kind of a thing do you play football do you   i did i i just i just coach coach my son right now so   oh i thats what i was would do you let your sons play   yeah i do i mean i i let them do whatever they want to do i dont i dont hold them back i mean if they want to try it and uh do it thats fine if they dont want to do it thats fine i mean i i leave them leave it up to them   as dangerous as it is uhhuh uhhuh have oh thats good   because i dont want to hold them back from trying anything i mean they may be may be good at it   uhhuh thats right they might be they might be making one of those salaries one of these days  huh okay well um   thats right   lets see what else do you have any other teams that you follow at all besides Dallas or   no not really not really   that keeps you keeps you going   yeah that keeps me busy enough right there do you think San how do you think San hows San Francisco doing this year   do you well oh theyre doing soso they they uh their main quarterback was hurt and so um Steve Youngs been uh you know in there taking his place but i think i think the main ones getting better so he you know they can get back in the   is McMahon the head quarterback lead quarterback   um   isnt he playing for San Francisco   yeah he is i think he is yeah he is and then um Steve Young was and and he hurt his knee McMahon hurt his knee and so the first couple of games   yeah   Steve Young went in for him   yeah i thought i   but i think hes back in there now   yeah i thought at first Steve Young started out as a lead quarterback and then he got himself hurt and McMahon came in in one of the games and uh ended up just uh winning the game coming from behind   umhum i dont   and they just let him keep starting because he was doing so good and kept winning   well he yeah so he was better because i think he was here at the first of the season and then yeah that that probably happened so do you watch it Monday nights is that what you do on Monday nights is watch the football games   uh sometimes it depends yeah it depends on what it what alls going on sometimes i sometimes i get a chance to sometimes i dont   sometimes and who uhhuh oh so well when you coached your sons team did you enjoy that   yeah enjoyed it a lot i mean this this is my first first year as a coach   oh thats great uhhuh   his first year of playing my first year as a coach so it was a it was a learning experience on both ends   oh boy ill say yeah how old how old do they let them play   uh one thats hes just getting ready to turn ten   oh   another ones getting ready to turn six and one thats three so   oh are they all boys   all boys   oh yeah you probably have a few years of football ahead of you  okay well is there any other comments you wanted to make or   yeah i think so not that i can think of   okay all right well thank you   thanks i enjoyed talking with you   umhum bye   byebye
