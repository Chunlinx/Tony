                                 The Unhappy Warrior            LastThursday in a speech at the National Defense University President Clintonpassionately disavowed the theory that ethnic slaughter is an incurable Balkandisease If people make decisions to do these kinds of things other peoplecan make decisions to stop them he asserted If the resources are properlyarrayed it can be done But five days later when asked why the United Stateswas refusing to send Apache helicopters and ground troops into Kosovo Clintoncited prudence objective difficulties and the risk to American soldiersThe military leaders will make their decisions about when and under whatcircumstances to use the Apaches said Clinton It is not a politicaldecision in any way            Thesetwo statementsone ambitious and imperative the other cautious anddetachedunderscore a paradox in the war over Kosovo In foreign policy thereare two rival schools of thoughtrealism and idealismand Clinton as usualis trying to have it both ways Each school has its values virtues and spinsIdealists emphasize free will realists emphasize determinism Idealistsbelieve in subjective resolve realists believe in objective constraintsIdealists preach responsibility and courage which realists dismiss as hubrisand folly Realists preach humility and prudence which idealists dismiss ascomplacency and selfishness Idealists tell us what we can do realists tell uswhat we cant do Idealists tend to be liberal realists tend to beconservative            On thefundamental question of whether to intervene in the Balkans Clinton is anidealist Thursday in what many deemed a slap atand arguably anoversimplification ofthe theories of Balkans scholar Robert D Kaplan andHolocaust scholar Daniel Jonah Goldhagen Clinton repudiated those who justifylooking away from this kind of slaughter  by saying that these people aresimply incapable of civilized behavior The president asked Do you think theGermans would have perpetrated the Holocaust on their own without Hitler Wasthere something in the history of the German race that made them do this No This is something political leaders do Yugoslavias Balkanneighbors Clinton argued show that there is another path  that discord isnot inevitable that there is not some Balkan disease  Serbs simply mustfree themselves of the notion that their neighbors must be their enemies            Realists regard Serbian resistance to NATO as a fact of life an immovableconstraint on American ambitions in the Balkans The bombing has not made muchdifference and has strengthened the resolve of the Serbian people HouseMajority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas alleged Sunday on Meet the Press Likewise realists view American lack of resolve as an objective limiton the wars prosecution As long as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic iswilling to withstand airstrikes there is no real end in sight formerSecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger cautioned this weekend Former JointChiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell agreed It is up to Mr Milosevic  todecide when he has had enough And that makes it difficult for us SenRichard Shelby RAla concluded Im not sure we have the will to win            Idealists regard such helplessness as selfdelusion In their view our willto win is something to be mustered not dispassionately assessed While it maybe difficult to outlast Milosevic they posit that we can and must do soIts because hes determined that we have to be determined aswell NATO spokesman Jamie Shea argued on Late Edition  On Face theNation  host Bob Schieffer skeptically asked Defense Secretary WilliamCohen How long are you prepared to do this As long as it takes Cohenreplied Crystallizing the idealists credo Clinton declared Friday Wecannot fundamentally alter human nature but we can alter the rules by whichall of us let our nature play out and we can call forth our betterselves            Onthis view just as we are free to persist in the war the Serbs are free toback down Here idealists divide into two camps Moderate idealists claimmerely that we dont have to accept the way things arethat we canfight on and the Serbs might not prevail Radical idealists posit thatwe can dictate the way things arethat we will fight on and Miloseviccannot prevail Clinton and his allies are taking or at least mouthingthe radical position Milosevic faces an unwinnable conflict Clintonasserted Thursday NATO actions will not stop until the conditions I havedescribed for peace are met Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and herBritish counterpart Robin Cook took the same hard line in a SundayWashington Post oped We will carry on attacking Milosevics militarymachine until he yields  His people are ignoring his call to fight in aconflict they do not want and know they cannot win            Allthis sounds stirring until you hear Clintons lessthanidealistic excuses forthe wars shortcomings When asked this weekend why the United States waswithholding helicopters Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Hugh Shelton and NATOspokesman Shea answered with mumbo jumbo about training operationalmatters procedural matters and the moving parts of a complexoperation Clinton like Shelton mentioned the risk to American pilotsdepicting this as a military judgment rather than a political decision Butfrom an idealists perspective the decision to let Kosovars die rather thanrisk American lives is indeed politicaland the purpose of Clintons allusionsto judgment strategy and circumstances is as with all such realistlanguage to obscure our indifference and cowardice            Pressed about their cautious conduct of the war Clintons putative idealistsinvoke the classic realist alibi impossibility Why havent we halted Serbianatrocities You cannot through air power stop individual soldiersoppressing murdering and burning the homes of individual AlbaniansUndersecretary of State Thomas Pickering pleaded Sunday Then why havent wesent in ground troops When you start with a coalition you have to hold thatcoalition together said Cohen There is no consensus within the alliance fora ground force A true idealist would lobby the coalition hard for groundtroops as British Prime Minister Tony Blair has done or would jettison thecoalition and send in his own ground troops anyway Instead the Clinton teamaccepts the coalitions reluctance and tells us this is just the way thingsare            Andwhat about the hundreds of civilians killed by errant NATO bombs It is simplynot possible to avoid casualties of noncombatants in this sort of encounterClinton pleaded Thursday Albright and Cook agreed Some people argue as ifMilosevic can be opposed militarily through a campaign of immaculatecoercion in which no mistakes are made and no innocent casualties occur Butthat is not the nature of conflict they wrote in the Post  borrowingevery realist buzzword in the book Perfection is unattainable theycounseled and it is impossible to eliminate such casualties            Onother questions as well US officials use fatalism and objective language tominimize American responsibility and rule out options Have we antagonizedRussia and China Yes conceded Pickering but only because nationalism isendemic in both of those countries Are we backing the Kosovo Liberation ArmyNo said Cohen but Milosevic is going to find that his military forces aresystematically being diminished at a time when the KLA will come back sinceit is getting money and support and some arms from other countries no doubtCould we curb Milosevics aggression through diplomacy rather than bombingImpossible argued Albright and Cook He will not stop until he is forced todo so            Behindthese explanations lies a coldly realistic assessment of Americas characterIf our soldiers are killed the public will turn against the war and if thepublic turns against the war Clinton will have to withdraw our forces Thisassessment rules out idealistic scenarios that the public might accept thesacrifice and continue to support the war or that Clinton might persist andtry to win back public confidence rather than bail out Based on thisassessment NATO has kept ground forces out of Kosovo allowing atrocities tocontinue and has kept its planes high above Serbian antiaircraft batterieslimiting our pilots ability to distinguish refugees from Serb forces on theground            Noneof this proves that realism is corrupt Realism tempers the romanticism ofidealists with a sense of tragedy Its not our job to police the wholeworld  says the realist Even if it were we couldnt afford it Even ifwe could afford it we dont have the will to do it Even if we had the will todo it we couldnt stop killings everywhere Even if we stopped killingseverywhere we couldnt do so without killing people ourselves Even if weavoided killing people we couldnt repair every wartorn region Nor isClintons blend of realism and idealism necessarily corrupt Perhaps weshould be idealistic about intervention in general but realistic in howwe go about it            Butthe realistidealist distinction does clarify two puzzles about the war One iswhy almost nobody wholly supports it Idealists dont like the way its beingfought realists think we shouldnt have started it in the first place Theother puzzle is the incoherence of Clintons critics punctuated by DeLaysbizarre complaint that Clinton has  hollowed out our forces while hesrunning around having these adventures all over the world and  fallen shortof victory in Kosovo by using excessive rhetoric supported by underwhelmingforce in a conflict involving no strategic interest of the United StatesYou can fault Clintons piety and recklessness from a realistic standpoint Youcan fault his cowardice and cynicism from an idealistic standpoint But theonly way to combine piety cowardice cynicism and recklessness is to hit himfrom both sides                           Photograph of BillClinton on the Slate Table of Contents by KevinLamarqueReuters
