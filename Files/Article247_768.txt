                                 Market Bull            The Dows big day leads at USA Today  the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times  and is the righthand leader at theWall Street Journal  The Washington Post offleads the story in deference to theopening of bidding on DCs beloved Redskins            The DJIA starts today at a record high and the papers consensus is thatthis is due to the three Federal Reserve interest rate cuts increased mergerand acquisition activities and a general sense that the global economic crisisis on its way to being handled The LAT throws in Bill Clintons renewedhold on his office and says the list of causes are the right reasons butnever says why they are right or what would make for wrong ones The NYTadds some more technical reasons to this list the growth of the M moneysupply what weve got in checking accounts savings accounts and money marketfunds and investors closing of short positions buying stocks now to closeout past sales of borrowed stocks that were bets the market was going southThe LAT and the WSJ note the quickness with which the market cameback from its recent twenty percent drop the LAT saying that it wasthe shortest bear market in history            The Times and Journal say yesterdays events are a kind ofsalute to raging bull quotemachine Abby Joseph Cohen In these papers Cohenredirects any suggestion of personal brilliance back to a cool professionalassessment of market conditions But in the WP s Cohen coverage we seeanother side there she is said to gush that her predictions come true            The LAT says that an overlooked theme of the market rebound is thatmost individual investors never lost their nerve The same point is made onthe NYT editorial page by Floyd Norris who says that investors werentdissuaded by the overseas financial crisis nor the losses suffered byhighrollers in hedge funds But the LAT goes on to say that investorsare much more brave because among other things the Fed has cut rates andCongress has funded the IMF and Japan has apparently advanced a good bankingplan Its hard to reconcile these two points of view Either investors careabout such highfalutin matters or they dont right            Similarly the WSJ  the LAT and WP refer to a warningmade two years by Alan Greenspan about the dangers of investors irrationalexuberance But its not clear from any of these stories whether the marketsgain of nearly  points this upswing is noted by the LAT  sincethen is confirmation or refutation of Greenspans fears And its hard to seewhat would make it clear which is why these daily market move stories aredifferent from many news stories Daily market moves are radicallyunderdetermined And hence the papers shouldnt spend so much space on theirmeaning They really dont have one            The USAT front brings startling news for parents of infants thegovernments Consumer Product Safety Commission is recalling nearly ten millionfoldable playpens because their raised rivets can strangle toddlers by catchingon their clothes or pacifiers This has already happened to eight childrensince  Its not clear from the story why the recall is being done now            The NYT and LAT fronts report on the jurys acquittal on allcharges yesterday of Susan McDougal in her California fraud and embezzlementtrial Although Whitewater and Ken Starr were banned topics in the courtroomits apparent that some jurors thought the state case was an attempt topressure McDougal to cooperate in that matter According to the LAT jurors never seriously contemplated guilty verdicts on any of the ninecounts            The USAT offlead reports that the Georgia Supreme Court has thrownout the states antisodomy law which was once upheld by the US SupremeCourt The story is carried inside at the NYT  The decision is beingheralded by gay activists But since both papers point out that the caseprompting this decision was one involving heterosexual contact and that thereare plenty of other states that still likewise ban oral and anal contactbetween opposite sexes its not clear why this isnt a big deal to the generalpopulation too Perhaps because such statutes arent often used to arrestheterosexuals The stories dont say            The NYT provides some facts from a recent survey conducted last weekby Le Figaro  Only  percent of French people bathe daily only percent change their underwear daily and  percent never wash their handsAlthough Todays Papers once came to the same conclusions one July day on theMetro this story cries out for context How do Americans come out in a similarsurvey            The last vehicle for truly unconstrained opinion in a newspaper is thephotograph If you doubt this go get last Sundays NYT and turn to page of the Week in Review There accompanying a story about politiciansspeaking their minds about other countries youll find a looming picture of AlGore cropped so close that none of his hair is visible and you can see thesweat thats bubbling out of every giant pore in his face Note that the verbalequivalent Gore looking like a crazed criminal with something to hidesaid would never pass muster What did Gore ever do to deserve this
