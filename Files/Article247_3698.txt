                                 McCain Takes the Plunge            Mount Pleasant S CThe usual insurgent candidates strategy which hasnot actually worked in  years in the GOP is to score upsets in Iowa and NewHampshire John McCain has a slightly different idea Because of hislongstanding opposition to ethanol subsidies he is simply bypassing the Iowacaucuses Instead hes running in New Hampshire and South Carolina whichholds the next primary after New Hampshire            South Carolina is promising for McCain for two reasons The first is thatits a state filled with conservative Republicansfor whom McCain hopes toemerge as the only viable alternative to George W Bush The second reason isthat it is rich in military retirees and veterans who regard McCain as one oftheir own just as they did Bob Dole in             Hence the setting for his South Carolina announcement a podium dressed withblack POWMIA flags with the carrier USS Yorktown as a backdrop Theship was once part of the World War II fleet commanded by McCainsgrandfathera connection noted by McCain On the deck was an A Skyhawk thetype of plane McCain was flying when he was shot down over Hanoianassociation noted by Larry Grooms the South Carolina state senator whointroduced him While some were out dodging the draft John McCain wasvolunteering for active service in Vietnam Grooms reminded theaudiencewhich was sprinkled with purple and orangehaired teenagers as wellas vets Whether the reference was to Clinton or Bush or both wasunclear            McCains speech was a version of the one he gave yesterday in New Hampshireculminating in his refrain I am not afraid McCains speeches are extremelywell written thanks to his gifted ghost Mark Salter who helped write his bookFaith of My Fathers  They are not terribly well delivered by thecandidate who stumbles more in one speech than Bill Clinton does in a yearsworth of them But both the prose and the delivery have the appeal ofdirectness and sincerity            The most interesting thing about todays announcement was what was left outat the last minute An earlier version of the prepared speech included asemidirect attack on George W Bushs education proposal A preliminary draftof his speech passed out in advance read There are those who would insteadpropose a larger role for the federal government One of my opponents wants toallow the Department of Education to cut off money to underprivileged childrenif those children do not improve their test scores over a threeyearperiod            But McCain did not deliver this criticism of Bush Instead he cut straightto the next paragraph which draws an implicit distinction instead of anexplicit one While I applaud the effort to hold schools accountable for themoney they receive I would strongly oppose any program that would give powerover the lives of children to a federal bureaucrat McCain will certainlyattack Bushhe has to But he may have decided that it makes sense toestablish a positive message before going negative on the Republicanfrontrunner            Its interesting to compare the two education plans Where Bushs plan is afederally directed quasivoucher scheme McCains is a federally funded voucherexperiment that emphasizes local control McCains plan is more honest thanBushs in some respects For one thing McCain is willing to spend newmoney billion over three years And hes explicit about where hed getitby cutting corporate welfare specifically federal subsidies for sugaroil and ethanol suggesting that hes intending to write off Texas and Hawaiias well as Iowa            McCains vouchers would be worth more than Bushs vs  Theproblem is that thats still not enough to determine whether vouchers work would pay tuition only at some Catholic parochial schools This raisesConstitutional questions but beyond that its not enough to create genuinecompetitive pressure on bad public schools which is the point ofvouchersunless you think the goal is to replace public education with privateeducation            That said McCain has some great lines about education Theres no reasonon earth that a good teacher should be paid less than a bad senator hesays            And this one even better Some people just arent meant to be teachersand we should help them find another line of work he says This draws wildapplause from the school kids at the front of the stage who may think McCainis promising to fire their teachers
