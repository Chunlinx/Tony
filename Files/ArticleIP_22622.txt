                                                            EasyAnswers                        It is often said that there are no easy answersbut in fact there are In a former life I used to interrogate politicians ontelevision and in six years there was never a subject on which they wereunable to come up with an easy answer Not necessarily a correct answerorhonest or heartfelt or logically coherentbut easy            What is an easy answerAn easy answer for a politician is one that assures you will never be provedwrong Or at least that if you seem to have been wrong another easy answerwill be available to explain why you werent There are no easy answers isitself an easy answerif you can get away with it Often you not only can getaway with it but you can also enhance your reputation for being thoughtfulhigh praise that in the culture of politics means indecisive in a classy wayrather than kindly or considerate of others or anything like that Sometimesthough you have to do better and this is when easy answers become hardwork            War and peace issues are the worst A famous joke amongacademics is that scholarly disputes are especially passionate because thestakes are so low By contrast when the stakes are as high as they can getthere is a special need for elected officials to avoid having a forthrightopinion Easy answers to the rescue            The current issue of American military involvementin Kosovo for example seems to be a yesorno question to which eitherconventional answercall them yes and nois decidedly uneasy Yes meansrisking American lives in a faraway land that has no apparent connection to theonly thing that really matters which is the Dow Jones industrial average Nomeans doing nothing as the worlds only superpower while a thug governmentcommits daily televised atrocities against white people in Europe not justsome unmediated Africans Unless youre extraordinarily lucky the outcome ofmaking either choice will leave you morally implicated in some dead bodieswith larger raw numbers making up for lack of American citizenship in the caseof a no            Fortunately even forKosovo there are answers available besides yes and no They will be familiarfrom intervention disputes dating back at least to Vietnam but they areespecially useful for the summersquallstyle military actions of today inwhich we all agree to be frenzied about the occupation of Kuwait or adrugsmuggling dictator in Panama or warlords in Somalia or genocide in Bosniaon the strict understanding that we will be allowed to forget all about thesematters and places in six months max Here are half a dozen consumertestedeasy answers on issues like Kosovo            Well Cokie my concern is that if we go into INSERTLOCATION we should do so with the resources necessary to get the job doneAirstrikes alone or only  troops or a mere half a dozen hydrogenbombs or whatever is on the menu just arent enough It is immoral to putAmerican soldiers at risk without a guarantee of overwhelming superiority for acertain and speedy victory            This is perhaps the mostprestigious dodge the Powell Doctrine named for Gen Colin Powell who isresponsible for the doctrine but not its use as a dodge The Powell Doctrineholds that the lesson of Vietnam is do it right or not at all Go in full forcefrom the beginning rather than escalate yourself into a quagmire Or dont goin at all Finish quickly before the public loses patience or ideally as inthe case of Grenada before the public has even heard of the place Or ofcourse dont start at all As to which of these alternativesall or nothingat allis the right one in any situation the Powell Doctrine does not say Sothis is a great way to sound tough and sophisticated without actuallycommitting yourself Since any actual military engagement is not going toinvolve every last wing nut in the Pentagons miscellaneous screws jar youare well positioned to say I told you so if things go badly Yet you neveractually opposed the action so youre OK if things go well And no one canaccuse you of wimping out if the military action doesnt take place Hey youwanted to go in with more force            Where is our exit strategy Ted That is what Id liketo know            Exit strategy became afashionable term during the Gulf War It really sounds like you know whatyoure talking about And what does it mean As I understand it an exitstrategy is a sort of poor mans Powell Doctrine It does not demand certainand prompt victory It merely demands a certain and prompt conclusion to theexercise that is acceptable to the United States When invoking this concernit is not necessary to specifyand indeed it is hard to imaginewhatconclusion short of victory a guy like you who flings around terms like exitstrategy would find minimally satisfactory And no military action exceptfor actual movies can be fully scripted in advance So youre golden Ifthings go wrong Ted I pleaded with the president to make sure we had an exitstrategy And if the action goes well or disaster occurs because we didntintervene Ted I was behind this all the way Ive always said that victoryis the best exit strategy            Tim I support the president American credibility is atstake The commander in chief has made a commitment on behalf of the UnitedStates and the United States must honor that commitment            This is the sneakiestdodge and probably the most popularespecially among Republicans You get tobe patriotic and hawkish And if things go well you were behind the commanderin chief all the way But if things go badly it is the presidents fault formaking the commitment Tragically you had no choice but to support him oncethe commitment was made but of course making it was irresponsible follyPlease note that like a reheated stew this dodge works even better after amilitary action has begun Tim we never should have got into this quagmirebut now we have no choice but to             Im not persuaded this is so important so vital to thenations interests that we ought to intervene            Thats an almost exact quote from a real senatorBob Kerrey of Nebraska and illustrates a nifty linguistic evasion You dontsay youre against it you say youre not persuaded to be for it Not only doyou evade the tough choice you also evade responsibility for your decisionIts the presidents fault even if hes right because he didnt persuadeyou            You can also say likeSen Max Baucus of Montana that there are unanswered questions Beingundecided and wanting ever more information is another great way to bedesignated as thoughtful And with a bit of skill and a bit of luck you cankeep taking your own temperature until it doesnt matter any more Meanwhileyoure OK no matter what happens Not persuaded can be spun as a yes or a noA nice variant is to say The American people must be persuaded this is theright thing and the president hasnt made the case Not only is whateverhappens not your fault unless its good its not even the publics faultIts the presidents fault either because we did what he wanted orif wedidntbecause he didnt convince us to do so            I dont think we should begin bombing unless and untilthe Serbs really begin a very significant massacre against the people inKosovo            That is Don Nickles ofOklahoma in Tuesdays Wall Street Journal where most of these quotescome from In a way this is not a dodge It is a sort of madcap Solomonicapproach Sen Nickles is saying Why must we guess whether Milosevic is goingto kill a lot more people Lets wait and see if he does it And why must wechoose between saving a lot of Kosovars and saving none Lets split thedifference and save half of them As a bonus Nickles retains a valuable fudgefactor in the question of what qualifies as a very significant massacreDepending on what happens Nickles is in a position to accuse the president offailing to defend American interests and values or of recklessly endangeringAmerican lives on the basis of a massacre that was merely significant but notvery significant            Whats happening in WHEREVER is a tragedy and anoutrage Wolf Intervention to stop the bloodshed is absolutely essential Butits a job for INSERT NAME OF CLOSER COUNTRY ANDOR REGIONAL GROUP not forthe United States            This final dodge is slightly different Youreclaiming credit for sharing whatever humanitarian or geostrategic concerndictates military action while opposing the use of the only military power youyourself bear responsibility for I once interviewed an especially moronicsenator since defeated who declared that some worthy military action was ajob for the United Nations I asked him why other countries should risk theirsoldiers lives if the United States wouldnt and he replied I didnt sayother nations I said the United Nations When it was pointed out tohim that UN troops dont come from Mars he was stymied That point had neveroccurred to him            But exposing the logical flaw here does not dependon any huffing and puffing about Americas leadership role An American polgoing on American television to say that the Europeans should tidy up theformer Yugoslavia without our help is like the Economist running as hasbeen known to happen a stuffy editorial saying that a corrupt dictator in someThird World country should resign Of course he should And the sun shouldshine in London every day But even the Economist s opinion cannotaffect these matters When an answer moves beyond difficult to completelyimpossible it becomes easy once again            Watch for these easyanswers on the TV talk shows and in the newspaper Practice on your own Soonyou too can be ducking responsibility like a reallife member of
