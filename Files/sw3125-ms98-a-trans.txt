        well Vic you said your professional your favorite professional football team was the was the Cowboys   thats right   well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team   oh you could   yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here   okay   and uh they really uh pull for the Chicago what are the what are the Chicago team called the Bears yeah right   the Bears right im not sure how theyll do this year i dont know who theyll use as quarterback   Chicago Chicago right   im not sure they know who theyll use at quarterback yet   right well theres a lot of good teams out there in the professional world and uh course we hope also that the Cowboys do good i know i do and its your favorite team so why dont you tell me about them   well what uh i get optimistic about is just uh the relative age of the team now with all the youth that theyve added and sort of a change in the nature of the team to the to more of the uh the the pure athlete type at all the positions um i like them having added a wide receiver with a nice track background that can high jump real high   uhhuh whats his name   uh Alvin Harper i think out of Tennessee because he was a think hes about six foot three and apparently can catch anything thats anywhere near him and uh   Harper umhum umhum   i understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet   ill be darned   when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it   well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a wingback or something like that that would go down the field and and uh he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was getting hurt   getting hurt i dont think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a a a sturdy athlete   i see   i know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few years   whats the coachs name Johnson   yeah Jimmy   Jimmy you think he can do better this year than he did last year   well he did better last year than most people thought including including myself but uh   yeah but what about his players uh and their reactions to him and his uh kind of unorthodox professional football type uh coaching   well i guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college atmosphere to it than than certainly than his predecessor   yeah right uhhuh   i really dont know how they they really react to that It probably does him well right now with with like i said the youth he has on the team   uhhuh   um i think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some dividends is is changing the offensive coach that bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system that i think the so far the players are are uh responding responding well to   and Jimmys going to leave the offense to the offensive coach   well thats the theory   yeah uhhuh  and what about the quarterback do you think he is uh going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion     well i dont know whether anybody can for a whole year anymore   yeah thats true   but uh he is uh hes pretty sturdy but hes got to learn to get rid of it pretty quick   uhhuh   uh well is Cowboys your your favorite team as well or   well really in reality uh they are my favorite team uh uh and have been you know back since the glory days or before the glory days       they used to practice you know right over here uh on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area   right well over there at uh near Forrest i think and uhhuh   yeah right uhhuh and uh it was a dingy little old field uh uh that uh you you would have thought maybe a a high school would have played on and its all surrounded you know by apartments and businesses and everything i was shocked when i saw it   thats the one that i think that was the place that had the looked like corrugated tin fence around it painted blue   yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and   right   but i guess uh you know it doesnt take a lot of uh fancy things to make a good football team   well i guess not but   since they did uh they were Americas team you know back then   yeah during that time period they sure were   and and i dont think they are now though looks like somebody else laid claim to that   do you go to many of do you go to many of the games or have you before   uh ive been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube   well i guess i do too really   yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group       or a stands a fan stands up or im looking at the cheerleaders or the clowns   right   and when something does happen i say what happened you know and then course uh you can see it on the on the playback out there uh but back there when i was going i dont think it was that good   uhhuh   or if they had it at all you know   right thats right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl   yeah uhhuh   than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium   uhhuh we we have a lake house see and we go out of town   course oh that works out nicely   and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game   im hoping that theyll be successful and theyll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year   yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh return to their former glory days   uhhuh   you know i had people uh all over the world you know that i run into uh say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas   thats right   and so uh i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while hes unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and hes all uh hes all business   yeah he is that   and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh they were stars   right   and he cleaned that out real good and and im sure he lost some good ones that shouldnt have gone but in his type offense he was looking for youth and for uh uh uh to rebuild a new team and i think that was the reason why he cut all the players   uhhuh   and i think also that oil man that uh that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh is interested in making a dollar and and theyve certainly gone to uh great lengths to you know to bring the team back into Texas for spring training   right   and and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the various factions you know uh especially back in the beginning i think hes done a great job   well thats n ice   whats his name uh   oh the uh Jones yeah Jones is his name   Jones yeah and uh hes an oilman and hes got a little money behind him and uh and uh so you know the theyve got the stadium out there its a
