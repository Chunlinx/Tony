                okay   ooh   uh wow i dont know what that was i dont know   what what was that and uh to um   the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park   umhum oh yes uhhuh um the we have not camped in any of those places in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped but we used to go to Tyler State Park and um to Dangerfield and   umhum   in Texas that is where we camped basically um   what are they like   theyre very nice Tyler is really really a neat place to camp it has a nice a nice little lake and it has some really wonderful uh sights that are in the the wooded areas um the facilities are quite nice and our children like liked it quite well uh the kids are well they were quite a bit younger then and uh you know it they we felt real um safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area and uh it was just it was a really nice place to to camp   umhum   um now Dangerfield is lets see i think thats a little bit more more east further east and maybe south if i am remembering where that is no i think its a little bit further north when i think about it at any rate it was it was very nice as well but Tyler we sort of got spoiled with i think   uhhuh   but uh we had lived in Michigan before we came here and um had done a lot of camping in Michigan i think the upper peninsula of Michigan especially and then also we had done some camping in Colorado in the mountains so uh my parents were real avid campers  and my husbands parents were really avid campers as well so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally   yeah um   do you um have a large tent or     yeah it was a a nine by twelve uhhuh   uhhuh and how how many does that sleep uh comfortably   well there well supposedly it its they always say it sleeps more than it does   right   but it they it would have slept three adults anyway yeah   yeah yeah well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger uh we invested in some stacking um cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds but they were cots fold up cots that really gave us a lot more space um floor space and   umhum   so you didnt have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around and uh gave us a place to stack things during the day so that was real nice   right   but uh we um my my uh uh inlaws also had a camper um pop up tent tent you know one of those trailer pop ups and those are really nice too and the little more uh luxurious so to speak but not much   do do they have a kitchen in them   yes uhhuh its really nice in fact it even have a had a little refrigerator and and the whole business it was quite nice in that respect and   yeah yeah   uh everything was very convenient and you didnt have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car so that was nice yeah   trunk of your car all time right   so um do you have plans for for any other camping trips in the near future   oh maybe uh maybe back to Caddo or um uh Purdis Creek   uhhuh right   or uh i like Bob Sandlin too its a new park   uhhuh   and there is um not really camping but   um whats it called Cedar Hill   right   by Joe Pool   oh yes   and sometime i like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma   yes yes ive been in that area thats a really pretty state park um   umhum   just we didnt camp there but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area and its just real lovely its close to the lake and close to the dam i think its close to the dam up there so its its really quite pretty uh are you um lets see what was i was going to ask you something else oh do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to   oh from from those three just just uh from when i have been an adult i like Caddo the best   yeah uhhuh   um   is uh is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas   yeah thats right   i i would ive never been there and i would love to see what it looks like   its not its not very deep and they did build a dam on it but it was there before they built the dam its been there for a hundred years apparently an earth quake caused it   uhhuh oh i see how interesting i guess id never heard the history of that huh   yeah yeah   well that might be some place where we my husband and i can go were talking about starting camping again in the fall um our children are both grown and and so its just pretty much the two of us who do things and so uh we thought we might take some weekend trips then and maybe that would be a good place to to go to and see what it looks like   yeah its really nice   yeah yeah   and it i dont know probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas yeah   is it uh yeah i think so especially with uh uh when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty especially in east Texas its really nice so   thats right uhhuh   well uh  ive enjoyed talking with you   its nice talking to you   and um have uh uh some happy camping trips  hope you get to those places youve talked about   yeah you too   well okay thanks uhhuh bye bye   bye bye
