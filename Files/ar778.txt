                    Introduction        Tumor necrosis factor TNF has been implicated in the        development and pathogenicity of infectious diseases and        autoimmune disorders such as septic shock arthritis and        hypotension        It plays a pivotal role in the        inflammatory cascade and together with IL and IL has        been shown to mediate the acutephase response             Confirmation of its significance in disease comes from the        success of clinical trials using antiTNF therapy to treat        rheumatoid arthritis and Crohns disease               Bacterial lipopolysaccharide LPS or endotoxin is        found only in Gramnegative bacterial cell walls it can on        its own induce the acute inflammatory response and the        clinical characteristics associated with sepsis After        administration of LPS TNF and other inflammatory mediators        are released      Infusion of TNF initiates an        inflammatory process leading to a phenotype that is        indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis             Recent work on tristetraprolin TTP has provided a new        perspective on the regulation of TNF biosynthesis TTP        also referred to as NuP TIS or GOS is a member        of the family of zincfinger proteins that was originally        identified through genetic screens designed to identify        immediate early response genes        TTP was        shown to be an unusually prolinerich protein with a        predicted molecular weight of  kDa Its name derives        from the presence of three PPPPG amino acid repeats that        are conserved across species There are two CysCysCysHis        CCCH zinc fingers which are responsible for RNA binding             There are no studies of the subcellular        localization or the regulation of expression of native TTP        in freshly isolated cells or tissue Transfection studies        using nonhematopoietic cell lines or prolonged cell culture        have suggested that TTP is found in both cytoplasm and the        nucleus                A deficiency of TTP is associated with a profound        proinflammatory phenotype TTPdeficient mice exhibit        cachexia with dermatitis medullary and extramedullary        hyperplasia erosive polyarthritis and autoimmunity with        autoantibodies     This phenotype is similar to that        observed in mice that overexpress TNF     In agreement        with these data TTPdeficient mice were shown to        overproduce TNF and weekly injections of a neutralizing        antibody to TNF eliminated the predominant features of this        phenotype In addition mice with the double deletion of        TTP and TNF receptor TNFR do not manifest the        aggressive inflammation observed in TTPdeficient mice In        contrast mice deficient in TTP and TNFR show a more        severe phenotype suggesting a protective role for this        receptor            The increase in TNF biosynthesis in TTPdeficient mice        is associated with increased mRNA stability     TTP        binds to the AUrich element ARE in the  untranslated        region of TNF mRNA which regulates TNF mRNA turnover         in vivo     The interaction        between TTPTNF and the ARE promotes the turnover of TNF        mRNA TTP also regulates the stability of GMCSF        granulocytemacrophagecolonystimulating factor mRNA        through the ARE and therefore TTP deficiency is associated        with increased production of GMCSF and with myeloid        hyperplasia This is not a TNFdependent effect since the        phenotype is not affected by the removal of either TNFR        or  or by the addition of TNF antibody     Recent        studies have suggested a potential interaction between TTP        and both IL and IL via the ARE in their mRNA                    All studies of TTP expression to date have relied on        transfected cells and cell lines there have been no        studies on the localization of expression of human TTP or        on its regulation         in vivo or in freshly isolated normal        cells To examine the kinetic relation between TNF        production and TTP expression in models of septic shock we        developed an intracellular flow cytometric assay By this        method expression of TTP was determined in peripheral        blood leukocytes after the response to         in vitro stimulation with LPS TTP        was initially upregulated in all the cells in response to        LPS as shown by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy        The contribution of TNF to this LPSinduced upregulation        was confirmed using a humanized monoclonal antibody to TNF        The kinetics of TTP production was also examined in four        individuals infused with LPS After         in vivo exposure to LPS the initial        rise in TTP expression correlated with the plasma TNF        level We also observed secondary increases in some        individuals without parallel increments in TNF These        observations suggest that there are multiple factors        involved in the regulation of TTP                    Materials and methods                  Generation of antihuman TTP polyclonal          antibody          A peptide corresponding to the C terminus amino acids           of human TTP was synthesized purified by HPLC          and coupled to KLH keyhole limpet hemocyanin          Macromolecular Resources Fort Collins CO USA          Antihuman TTP polyclonal antibody was generated by          immunization of New Zealand white

Pierce Rockford IL USA to which disulfide linkage of          the peptide had been used to immobilize the peptide          Specificity in Western blotting and flow cytometry was          evaluated by detection of exogenous TTP in transfected           cells and by blocking this activity with peptide                                       Generation of TTP vector constructs          Human TTP cDNA was generated by RTPCR from THP RNA          and cloned into the pcDNA HisC vector Invitrogen          Carlsbad CA USA which encodes a histidine and epitope          EXPRESSTAG at the Nterminus of the protein          Orientation of the cloned DNA and the integrity of the          DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing with the ABI          Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit PerkinElmer          Wellesley MA USA and searched against the published          sequence TTP accession no M on the NCBI Database          using the BLAST search program                          Transient

                      Results                  Optimization and specificity of the TTP polyclonal          antibody          To determine the optimal working concentration of the          TTP antibody  cells transfected with TTP were fixed          permeabilized and stained at various concentrations of          antibody or IgG control There was a          concentrationdependent increase in fluorescence Fig          a which was standardized using fluorescent          microspheres in order to compare different experiments          and cell types     The optimum concentration of          antibody was determined to be  g per    cells          where the intensity curve began to flatten At higher          concentrations the MESF value for the control sera          increased concordantly indicating nonspecific binding          Specificity of the TTP antibody was determined by          blocking with the identical peptide sequence used to          generate the polyclonal antibody In the presence of          blocking TTP peptide at concentrations either  or           times the amount of TTP antibody used the detection of          the TTP protein within the transfected cells was nearly          eliminated Fig b          Confocal sectioning of transfected  cells showed          that the presence of TTP protein was primarily in the          cytoplasmic fraction Fig c Z sections taken every           m through the cell showed little if any TTP within          the nucleus In nontransfected  cells a small amount          of TTP was detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by          confocal microscopy Transfected  cells expressed nine          times as much TTP as the untransfected cells at the          optimal working concentration of antibody Preincubation          of the nontransfected  cells with TTP peptide blocked          the activity confirming its identity These results          confirmed our previously published data in which Western          blot analysis showed that TTP was localized in the          cytoplasmic extract of  cells                              Induction of TTP in the THP cell line          Since TNF biosynthesis in macrophages is rapidly          triggered by treatment with LPS the effects of this          endotoxin on TTP expression were examined THP cells a          human myelomonocytic cell line were incubated with and          without LPS  gml for up to  hours At          representative time points a sample was removed and          stained with either antiTTP or the IgG control as          described in Materials and methods The addition of LPS          rapidly increased the expression of TTP by THP cells          Fig a Increases in TTP were detectable  hour after          stimulation and were still evident in the cytosol  hours          after LPS treatment Analysis of the cells by confocal          microscopy Fig b confirmed the upregulation and          indicated that the TTP was expressed intracellularly          relatively homogeneously but confined to the cytoplasm          These data show that LPS stimulation rapidly increases          human TTP protein expression in the cytoplasm The          kinetics of induction by LPS parallels that seen with TTP          mRNA in bonemarrowderived murine macrophages                                       In vitroTTP induction with LPS in peripheral blood          leukocytes          Modulation of TTP expression by LPS was subsequently          examined in normal peripheral leukocytes Whole blood          from eight healthy volunteers was incubated at C alone          or with LPS  gml for up to  hours At periodic          time points a sample was taken and leukocytes were          purified by dextran sedimentation fixed permeabilized          and then stained with either antiTTP or control          antibody In leukocytes constitutive expression of TTP          ranged from approximately    to    MESF          Monocytes constitutively expressed over three times as          much TTP as either lymphocytes or neutrophils Table           Stimulation with LPS           in vitro produced an increase in          TTP expression in all leukocyte subpopulations This was          maximal  hours after stimulation TTP levels increased          to a higher maximal level in monocytes than in other          leukocytes    MESF Fig a Twocolor flow          cytometry indicated that CD and CD T lymphocytes          expressed equivalent amounts of TTP data not shown The          kinetics of TTP induction with LPS was consistent and          monophasic in all leukocytes Fig i The change in TTP          expression was greatest in neutrophils and least in          lymphocytes Since lymphocytes lack Tolllike receptor           and express little or no CD     we conclude that          the induction of TTP in these cells was occurring          indirectly presumably through stimulation with TNF          although other cytokines including IL IL and IL          could contribute to this response          LPSinduced TTP upregulation was confirmed in all cell          types by confocal microscopy Analysis confirmed an          increase in TTP in neutrophils  hours after stimulation          Fig  Similar data were obtained for lymphocytes and          monocytes data not shown Distribution in resting          levels and after stimulation with LPS was primarily          cytosolic which is in accord with our data for  and          THP cells                          Correlation of in vivoTTP production with TNF after          LPS bolus          To study the kinetics of TTP induction           in vivo  we infused  ngkg of          clinicalgrade endotoxin at time  in four volunteers          Blood was drawn before the infusion and at specified          intervals afterwards and aliquots were analyzed for          leukocyte cell counts TTP expression and plasma TNF          levels          The cell counts of all the leukocyte subpopulations in          all the volunteers fell rapidly as seen  hour after          infusion in all volunteers Fig abc in          concordance with published data       Beyond the          hour time point the neutrophil cell count increased          reaching a peak at  hours It then decreased to          baseline values at  hours Fig a Lymphocyte and          monocyte data showed similar initial kinetics The          lymphocyte and monocyte curves were biphasic peaking at           hours dropping to baseline at  hours and beginning          a second increase at  hours          Plasma TNF levels were analyzed throughout the study          The circulating TNF level increased to a peak at  hours          after infusion Fig d After  hours there was no          detectable TNF in any of the four volunteers This          monophasic peak was consistent with findings in other          studies              Analysis of TTP expression in leukocyte populations          before and after LPS infusion revealed a biphasic          induction with an initial peak occurring within  hours          and a second after  hours Fig abc Baseline and          maximum TTP expression in each cell type for each          volunteer is presented in Table  The expression and          initial upregulation of TTP in response to LPS in all          leukocyte populations was consistent with the data found           in vitro  Neutrophils responded          rapidly to LPS infusion reaching an initial peak within          an hour of infusion although the average increase in the          four volunteers appears to be moderate  Analysis of          monocytic TTP showed an increase in expression peaking          at  hours Fig b Lymphocyte TTP expression peaked at           hours which was later than the initial peak response          of neutrophils and monocytes Fig c A second more          dramatic rise which did not parallel changes in plasma          TNF levels Fig d was observed  hours after          infusion in all leukocyte populations                          TNF contribution in LPS induction of TTP          The human           in vivo studies described here show          increases in circulating plasma TNF that preceded TTP          induction in all the leukocyte types investigated This          observation is consistent with the hypothesis that LPS          mediates induction of TTP through the production of TNF          However this hypothesis does not explain the second rise          in TTP we observed           in vivo  which was not associated          with TNF To examine this phenomena in more detail THP          cells were cultured with LPS or TNF in the presence of          blocking TNF antibody The antibody sequesters TNF in the          supernatant preventing its interaction with TNF          receptors LPS induced greater TTP expression than TNF          Fig ab When THP cells were stimulated with LPS          in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody the TTP          response was reduced but not eliminated Fig a In          fact the initial induction of TTP detectable during the          first hour was unaffected suggesting that TNF was not          solely responsible for the LPSinduced rise In contrast          TNF induction of TTP by THP cells was completely          blocked in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody          Fig b                            Discussion        This study is the first to evaluate the expression and        regulation of endogenous human TTP in myeloid and lymphoid        cells It is the first to examine the subcellular        localization of native TTP protein in freshly isolated        cells since all previous studies relied on prolonged cell        culture or transfectionoverexpression approaches using        cell lines         We show that endogenous        human TTP is expressed in neutrophils lymphocytes and        monocytes They are significant in their demonstration that        native human TTP is totally cytoplasmic there was little        evidence of nuclear localization in these studies an        observation that is consistent with previous work with        human TTP in which immunoblotting showed cytoplasmic        localization            The discrepancy between our findings and findings of        nuclear localization of TTP may be due to several factors                First most of those studies did not        measure endogenous TTP but usually relied on transfection        of cell lines perhaps resulting in mislocalization due to        the presence of an epitope tag or overexpression                Second by definition those cells were largely        cycling and thus were not representative of normal        hematopoietic cells Third mouse or rat TTP was used in        those studies        Although highly conserved        it is possible that human TTP is subtly different from        rodent TTP We think this unlikely as immunoprecipitation        studies of bonemarrowderived murine macrophages show        murine TTP predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction            This matter requires further analysis once improved        antibodies to murine TTP are generated        Our studies clearly showed human TTP in lymphocytes and        neutrophils in addition to monocytes Early work by        Carballo and colleagues    showed the importance of        macrophages not lymphocytes in the development of the        phenotype associated with TTP deficiency This highlights        the importance of macrophages in the production of TNF        supported by current hypotheses on the pivotal role of this        cell type in TNF overproduction in autoimmune diseases            Thus our findings suggest that TTP serves an entirely        different role in other leukocytes relative to their role        in regulating cytokine production by macrophages and that        TNF production is not simply regulated by TTP        Despite these potential differences in the function of        human TTP based on cell type our studies show a common        pattern of induction by LPS in monocytes neutrophils and        lymphocytes The upregulation of human TTP occurs rapidly        within the first hour of stimulation This is consistent        with murine data demonstrating that upregulation occurs        within  min of LPS stimulation remaining high for         hours     Using confocal imaging we found TTP was        primarily detected in the cytoplasmic fraction confirming        our earlier immunoblotting studies            LPS stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes         in vitro revealed TTPinduction        kinetics analogous to that observed for THP cells We        used a whole blood assay since the cytokines produced        after         in vitro incubation with LPS are        analogous to those produced after         in vivo infusion providing an        important model of sepsis     Baseline expression of        TTP was higher in monocytes than in either lymphocytes or        neutrophils Lymphocytes responded the least to LPS        stimulation whereas monocytes responded the most        Monocytes were not followed beyond  hours after        stimulation with LPS because of the low numbers of cells        retrieved probably due to upregulation of adhesion        molecules ICAM            The induction of TTP expression by either LPS or TNF has        not been studied in an         in vivo system before In this study        four human volunteers were infused with LPS and the        subsequent changes in leukocyte cell count TTP expression        in leukocyte subpopulations and levels of TNF were        followed over a hour period Although there was some        individual variability in the overall kinetics basal        levels and the initial induction of TTP by LPS were within        the range observed         in vitro Tables and  All cell        types showed an increase in TTP expression within the first        hour Interestingly TTP was induced by LPS         in vivo more slowly after  hours vs         hours and to a lesser degree in the lymphocyte        population than in neutrophils or monocytes The absence of        LPSsignal transducers CD Tolllike receptor  on most        lymphocytes relative to monocytes and neutrophils may        account for this altered expression      Since        lymphocytes express TNF receptors and TNF itself can induce        TTP mRNA expression     these data are consistent with        the interpretation that TTP induction in lymphocytes is        transduced not by LPS binding but by TNF produced by        monocytes andor neutrophils acting on lymphocytes        The initial fall in leukocyte cell count observed         in vivo is in accord with published        data       The numbers of monocytes and        neutrophils dropped within the first hour by approximately         and  respectively and of lymphocytes by  after         hours This decrease is consistent with data suggesting        that the reduction in leukocytes results from a decrease in        granulocytes and monocytes as they become activated        migrating and adhering to vascular endothelium            This drop in cell numbers was followed by an increase in        all leukocyte populations beginning at  hours and        continuing through the hour time point This raises the        issue of whether the apparent changes in TTP expression        were due in part to differential rates of margination by        leukocyte subpopulations Since the levels of TTP induction        seen in the first hour         in vivo approximate those seen         in vitro  we believe that this        induction reflects the increased synthesis and expression        of TTP by all leukocyte subpopulations and is consistent        with the kinetics of their mRNA induction            TTP and TNF are reportedly involved in a        negativefeedback loop in which increases in TNF        concentration are associated with induction of TTP            In these studies LPS which induces the release of TNF            produced a rise in TTP within  hours of        stimulation Although the initial rise in TTP         in vivo paralleled a rapid and        considerable increase in plasma TNF the second late        increases in intracellular TTP did not reflect TNF levels        This change may have been mediated by other cytokines        IL IL whose levels have been shown to increase with        kinetics that parallel this rise in TTP              Alternatively the late rise in cytoplasmic TTP may be due        to release from the bone marrow of leukocytes that have        high levels of TTP or an adaptive response to        endotoxemia        TNF overproduction mediates both sepsis and chronic        inflammatory disorders such as RA Its production may be        modulated at transcriptional posttranscriptional and        posttranslational levels       Many of the        effects observed after LPS stimulation can be attributed to        subsequent production of TNF Moreover infusion of TNF        initiates inflammatory processes with a resulting        phenotype that is indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis             We investigated the contribution of TNF in the        LPSmediated induction of TTP in THP cells using a        blocking TNF antibody TNF induction of TTP expression was        almost completely eliminated by incubation with the TNF        inhibitor proving the direct effect of TNF on TTP        induction LPS however induced much greater levels of TTP        in THP cells than TNF did In the presence of blocking        TNF antibody LPS induction of TTP was initially unaffected        but began to decline after  hour suggesting that LPS        itself may mediate the initial increases in TTP and showing        that the prolonged induction of TTP is dependent on        TNF                    Conclusion        We have shown through an intracellular staining assay        that human TTP expression is modulated by LPS and TNF        LPSinduction of TTP was partly dependent on the production        of TNF The ability of LPS to induce TTP independently of        TNF may account for the earlier response observed in        neutrophils and monocytes that have LPSsignaling        transduction molecules In contrast lymphocytes        demonstrate a delayed and lower TTP response and are        probably responding to TNF or other cytokines produced by        myeloid cells In addition a second rise in TTP expression        was observed         in vivo  which did not correlate        with any detectable rise in TNF concentration implying        that there are additional factors involved in the        regulation of this intracellular protein TNF is a        predominant proinflammatory cytokine particularly in        sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders suggesting that        the role of its negative regulator TTP may be of        functional importance in the development and pathogenesis        of disease Investigating any potential abnormalities in        expression or regulation may prove to be a valuable        therapeutic intervention                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        APC  allophycocyanin ARE  AUrich element CM
