                      Where To Go        A city of several different ages Edinburgh has distinct        districts that are all eminently walkable You can divide your visit        into three or four separate tours each of which could fill either an        afternoon or an entire day There are also bus tours around the city to        help you get your bearings before you visit special attractions The        buses stand in line on Waverley Street near the main railway        station        The Old Town        Edinburghs Old Town occupies an amazing site where the        geology has its own fascinating story to tell The Castle Rock and        Arthurs Seat are the remains of lava streams that hardened after the        two volcanoes around them became dormant and cold During the last Ice        Age huge glaciers covered the region moving west to east across the        land and gouging trenches on either side of the volcanic mounds They        resisted the great power of the ice and caused a long stream of        sediment to collect At the end of the Ice Age some  years ago        the glaciers melted leaving a long ridge of sediment sloping gradually        from the top of the volcanic hills        When the castle was built atop the hill the original city        of Edinburgh grew on this ridge reaching down in a ribbon of        development toward the Abbey of Holyrood at the foot of the hill in        the east In the th century a strong city wallnow almost        completely destroyedprotected the population Combined with the        geological setting of the city this stifled development Instead of        expanding outward the city had no choice but to grow upward        The famous tenements or lands began to be built At        least  stories high they were reached through narrow alleys called        closes or wynds that became the focus of city life A constant        cycle of building decay collapse and rebuildingplus the        occasional catastrophic firegave the Old Town its characteristic        irregular layout and chimneystrewn skyline        Edinburgh Castle        The castle has always been considered the heart of        Edinburgh but its site is older than the city itself Excavations show        evidence of settlement in the Bronze Age ca  bc  It dominates        the skyline sitting atop Castle Rock The dramatically rising cliff of        black basalt stone made the castle impregnable to all but the most wily        commander It was the seat of power for anyone who ruled the region        control of which passed from Scotland to England many times over the        centuries        Following the Act of Union with England in  the        castle lost its strategic importance but later in Victorian times        experienced a rebirth The Victorians reworked the history and legends        of Scotland to add romantic neoGothic touches They also greatly        expanded the castle for decorative purposes rather than for defense        Today Edinburgh Castle is the mostvisited attraction in Scotland with        more than one million people passing through the entrance gate each        year        A visit to the castle will take at least two hours but        many people spend far longer there There is an informative recorded        tape in several languages you listen on headphones as you tour the        attractions to help you make the most of your visit The extremely        helpful and knowledgeable staff is more than happy to answer any        questions that you have        Your first view of the castle will be the Gate House which        you pass through to reach the inner wards  Built between  and         the Gate House was a Victorian attempt to recapture the medieval        castle style but it was more a cosmetic addition than a defensive        structure The dry ditches in front however date from the s In        the s bronze statues of two Scottish heroesWilliam Wallace and        Robert the Brucewere added to the faade In summer you will find an        honor guard of kilted soldiers standing sentry on the walkway over the        ditches        Once inside you will find yourself in the lower ward the        area of the castle that has been most heavily bombarded in many        military campaigns The Old Guard House now houses one of four gift        shops in the castle grounds The walkway here once had a ditch and        drawbridge to protect the inner gate called Portcullis Gate which was        reconstructed in the late th century on thcentury foundations It        was the main entrance to the castle and a formidable obstacle to the        enemy        Passing through Portcullis Gate you enter the middle ward        of the castle To your right is the Argyll Battery with a line of        muzzleloading eighteenpound guns pointing out over the skyline of the        New Town a prime spot for spectacular photography shots To your        right are the Lang Stairs which lead up to the medieval castle Walk        along past the battery to the Cart Shed built in the aftermath of the        Jacobian uprising in  It now houses the castle cafwith a good        selection of snacks and hot mealsbut was originally used to store        the provisions carts Beside the caf is Mills Mount Battery the        location of the One OClock Gun fired daily except Sunday atyou        guessed itpm Be prepared for it is indeed noisy        The cobbled street leads inexorably upward past the        Governors House and the New Barracks neither of which is open to        visitors Eventually you will reach Foogs Gate but take a right        before you travel through the gate and follow the path around to the        Castle Vaults These were cut into the Castle Rock in the th century        to create an extra floor of space they offer a fascinating insight        into the lives of the ordinary soldiers in days gone by The vaults        were used for a variety of mundane activities bakery and storehouse        but also functioned as a prison and barracks Prisoners soldiers and        the soldiers families endured the same harsh conditions Youll see        messages on the walls of the vaults carved by French prisoners during        their captivity        In the very bowels of the building is one of the most        famous attractions in the castle Mons Meg a gun weighing  kg         tons was a gift to James II in  from his wifes uncle Philip the        Good Duke of Burgundy Manufactured in Mons now in Belgium the gun        was stateoftheart for the times firing cannonballs weighing up to        kg lbs It was a formidable weapon but weighed so much that        it could be transported only kms miles per day often the        fighting had finished before it could be brought into play It was        fired to celebrate the first wedding of Mary Queen of Scots to        Franois II in  In  when fired as a birthday salute in honor        of the Duke of Albany Mons Meg burst her barrel and was retired from        active duty        Return to Foogs Gatethe name and age of the gate remain        a source of debateto enter the upper ward and the oldest parts of        the castle Directly ahead is tiny St Margarets Chapel said to have        been built by David I in the early th century in honor of his mother        Queen Margaret who died in  It is the oldest building in        Edinburgh and is still the site of weddings and baptisms Although the        chapel has been renovated since its construction you will find a        wonderful example of a Romanesque arch in the interior The        stainedglass windows one featuring a likeness of Margaret were        inserted into the existing openings in the s        Another set of batteries can be found in an open area south        of the chapel They are built on the site of Davids Tower once the        largest and most formidable structure in the castle Begun in  it        was the main royal lodging for centuries until it was battered and left        a wreck during the Lang Siege of  The remains of the        towerthe rooms in its foundationsare currently being        restored        Crown Square        At the very pinnacle of the upper ward is Crown Square a        beautiful collection of buildings housing the treasures of Scotland On        your right as you enter the square is the Scottish National War        Memorial the highest building in the city The building was originally        a barracks building but was suitably refurbished by Sir Robert Lorimer        in  to commemorate the Scots who fell in World War I the halls of        remembrance now also commemorate those who died in World War II and all        other conflicts Inside are leatherbound regimental books with each        servicepersons name duly inscribed Splendidly ornate stone friezes        realistically depict battle scenes of World War I with each branch of        the forces represented There is also a chapel dedicated to women who        sacrificed their lives for their country        Opposite the memorial is the Great Hall built in  for        the wedding reception of James IV and the English Mary Tudor It was        later used as the ceremonial and legislative chamber The original        hammerbeam wooden roof is the highlight of the design with thick        beams and painted decorations Be sure to see the monogram of        JamesIRon some of the stone brackets along with the red rose        and the thistle signifying the new alliance of Scotland and England        The hall was used as a barracks through much of its later history        before being renovated in  The interior dcor now says much more        about the Victorians romantic image of Scotland than it does about how        the room would have really looked The walls are lined with suits of        armor and swords        Along the east side of Crown Square is the Royal Palace        home to the most precious of the countrys treasures the Royal Regalia        of Scotland The palace much altered over the generations was        generally used as a residence only at times of dynastic importance or        danger when Holyrood down in the lowland was difficult to defend On         June  Mary Stuart gave birth to her son James the future James        VI of Scotland and James I of England in the small antechamber off a        larger room known as Queen Marys Room The last monarch to spend a        night in the palace was Charles I in         On the upper floors once the royal chambers there is an        exhibition telling the story of the royal regalia Called the Honours        of Scotland these are said to be the oldest complete setcrown        scepter and swordin Europe unchanged since  There are        displays of artisans creating the jewelslook for models with an        uncanny resemblance to John Lennon and Paul McCartney The highlights        of the tour are the honours themselves lying on blue velvet in a        secure glass cabinet in the Crown Room The Scottish crown was        fashioned of gold mined in Scotland greatly embellished during the        reign of Scotlands James III  The scepter and sword were        each papal gifts the former in  and the latter in  these        reinforced the links between Scotland and Rome Following union with        England in  however there was little use for the Scottish        regalia They were locked in a trunk in a sealed room in Edinburgh        Castle for  years before Sir Walter Scott received permission to        open the room in         Next to the regalia sits the Stone of Destiny or Stone of        Scone which historically served as the seat on which Scottish kings        were crowned a symbol of the land over which they would rule In         the stone was captured by the English from its resting place in Scone        Abbey and taken to London It has been used during crowning ceremonies        for all English then British monarchs since that time sitting under        the coronation throne throughout the ceremony In  the stone was        returned to Scotland amid great pomp though it will make the journey        to Westminster Abbey in London when the next coronation of a British        monarch takes place        On the lower floor of the Royal Palace Laich Hall has been        restored as closely as possible to its  dcor using traditional        techniques and colors This was where the monarch met advisers and        diplomats        Leaving the castle you will walk across the Esplanade a        broad open area originally created for regimental drill practice Today        it is usually used as the castle parking lot but it offers superb        views of both Princes Street to the north and the Old Town to the        south In August each year the Esplanade is filled by a temporary        arena erected for performances of the Military Tattoo        The Royal Mile        The town of Edinburgh eventually spread out below the        castle with a main street leading out the entrance and down to        Holyrood Palace In the th century this thoroughfare became known as        the Royal Mile because it was the route used by royalty to make their        way from the castle to Holyrood Although a mile long its name is        misleading because it is not one street but several different streets        In former times it even crossed the old outer boundary of Edinburgh        before it reached the palace        Since the route has never seen any major redevelopment it        has grown haphazardly but organically over the centuries Some of the        buildings date from the th century but it is also lined with        buildings of almost every era including numerous th and        thcentury tenements called lands sometimes  stories high These        were the residential areas of the city considered desirable when they        were first built Later they were often home to many

    Parliament Square adjacent to the cathedral is home to        Parliament House After its construction in  it held sessions of        the Scottish Parliament until the Act of Union in  but since

the former boundary of the town of Edinburgh and        the neighboring town called Canongate which was a community of        aristocrats and members of the royal court serving Holyrood Palace The        two towns were united in  Canongate derived its name from an edict        by David I  founder of the Abbey of Holyrood who granted a        right to raise a gate between the abbey and the Royal burgh of        Edinburgh        Several historical buildings lead off Canongate and a        number have interesting stories to tell Chessels Land on the left        was the place where Deacon Brodie

Holyrood area Edinburghs current royal quarter It comprises the        palace abbey and park along with their historic attractions The        easternmost stretch of the Royal Mileonly  m  yards        longis called Abbey Strand It is flanked by a building that        protected aristocratic debtors known as the Abbey Lairds from arrest        and certain imprisonment civil authorities had no jurisdiction within        the Abbey grounds and could not enter to arrest them        Palace of Holyroodhouse        The Palace of Holyroodhouse is the official residence in        Scotland of the reigning British monarch However it began life with a        totally different purpose In  the king David I ceded land to the        Augustinian order for the creation of the Abbey of Holyrood The name        Holyrood means holy cross the Scottish word for cross is rood        and it is suggested that it is derived from the fact that David gave        the abbey a cross that had been owned by his mother Queen Margaret        later St Margaret        Legend gives us a different account When David was hunting        in the woods he was about to be attacked by a stag when the figure of        a cross appeared between the antlers of the beast which backed away        from the king David gave funds to build an abbey on this site in the        depths of the forest in gratitude for his survival        With its detailed carvings the beautiful abbey was an        important center of worship but continued to have royal connections        because of the surrounding hunting grounds The royal entourage needed        some form of lodging and a guesthouse was built adjoining the abbey to        be used as a base for hunting parties        Scottish kings came to favor the site and it was James IV        who decided to transform the simple lodgings into a true royal palace        In  he had plans drawn up which his son James V expanded after his        death in  In  work started on a tower and royal apartments for        James and his wife Mary of Guise which now constitute the western        section and tower of the current palace Mary Queen of Scots later        occupied apartments here and there are decorative friezes in the rooms        from that time        In  the English invaded set fire to the palace and        sacked the abbey The great tower however survived It was        refurbished and the whole palace greatly extended in the following        years Early in  Oliver Cromwell stationed his garrison here while        attempting to subdue the rebellious Scottish monarchists he was        victorious at the Battle of Dunbar Later that year another devastating        fire destroyed much of the structurethough not the towerand        Cromwell made funds available to rebuild the structure But both the        design and workmanship were considered poor        Following the return of the British monarchy in         Cromwells work was redone and the buildings extended Charles II never        saw the palace on which he lavished so much money the royal coffers        expended  a fortune at the time but he created the foundation        of what we see today with its amazing ornamental plaster work and        carved wood paneling His heir James VI lived at the castle in the        s when the paint was barely dry        During the th century Holyrood was neglected by        succeeding British monarchs who preferred to stay in their London        residence though Scottish noble families lived within the compound It        was not until  when George IV made a state visit that the        fortunes of the palace revived Since then almost every reigning        monarch has spent time or held soires at Holyrood The palace has        been carefully tended throughout the th century        Visitors can tour the palace only when the monarch is not        in residence Queen Elizabeth will usually spend time in early August        but you should check with tourist authorities if Holyrood is a mustsee        for you Helpful guides take you down the long corridors and through        the most interesting rooms        The Great Stair is the formal approach to the royal        apartments in the southwestern tower The plaster ceilings here date        from  and depict angels carrying the symbols of royal power crown        scepter sword and wreath of laurel leaves The Royal Dining Room is        situated at the top of the Great Stair This majestic room is used for        modernday entertaining when the queen hosts dinners and banquets On        the walls are portraits of Bonnie Prince Charlie and his brother        Prince Henry        The Throne Room is one of a series of apartments built        during the reign of Charles II though it was originally designed as a        guard room that screened entrants to the private chambers beyond The        thrones on view here date from a visit by George V and Queen Mary in                Two magnificent state rooms follow both designed by Sir        William Bruce as part of the extensions and refurbishment in the s        The Evening and Morning Drawing Rooms originally the Presence Chamber        and the Privy Chamber were designed to meet visiting dignitaries and        are splendid in their detail the oakpaneled ceiling is superbly        decorated Be sure to take a look at the painting above the mantle The        scene depicting Cupid and Psyche was considered too risqu for the        eyes of Queen Victoria and during her reign it was covered by a        mirror The Kings Antechamber was where he entertained his more        favored guests        Next is the Kings Bedchamber perhaps the most richly        decorated room in the royal apartments Seventeenthcentury tapestries        depicting heroic scenes from the life of Alexander the Great adorn the        walls Although the bed dates from the s it has never been slept        in by royalty It belongs to the Hamilton family who have served as        hereditary keepers of the palace Beyond this is the Kings Closet        where only his intimate entourage would be admitted for evenings of        drinking and card games        From the kings apartments you will enter the Great        Gallery a long room that is home to  portraits of Scottish rules        dating back to antiquity Commissioned by Charles II the paintings        were all the work of one man Dutch artist Jacob de Wit De Wit worked        from likenesses of actual monarchs to produce his portraits For        ancient or legendary kings such as Ferguswho was said to have been        related to the Pharaohs of Egyptfashionable imagery of the time        helped to create the finished figures De Wit was paid a reasonable        stipend of  per year to produce the works examples of which can        also be seen in other rooms of the palace        The oldest part of the palace the James V Tower once        called the Great Tower is for many the highlight of the tour Its        strong stone walls which survived both fires in the th century        sheltered rooms that were occupied by Mary Stuart and her second        husband Lord Darnley in the s On the third floor is the Bed        Chamber of Mary Queen of Scots with her antechambers surrounding it        A set of stairs connects her room to that occupied by her husband        Nearby is the Outer Chamber of Mary Queen of Scots where        she socialized with her favorites and debated religion with John Knox        It is also where her secretary David Rizzio was left to bleed to        death after being stabbed by Lord Darnley and his cronies a bronze        plaque marks the spot You will find a number of Marys personal        effects on display The chambers were totally refurbished by Charles        II including larger windows to balance the design of the new        extensions However the original ceiling of Marys bedchamber is still        in place        Abbey of Holyrood and the Park        Outside set in manicured gardens are the remains of the        Abbey of Holyrood Today it comprises little more than the walls of the        church nave The rest of the abbey was raised to the ground in         but the church was saved because it was a parish church and therefore        served the local community Ornate carvings on the stone faade can        still just be discerned though they have suffered greatly through        weathering and pollution A small stone tomb in the southeast corner        houses the bones of several members of the royal family Originally        these all had separate burial sites but they were sacked by religious        protesters Queen Victoria arranged for the bones of David II James        II James V and Lord Darnley to be reinterred in a common tomb        To the south of the palace are the green landscapes of        Holyrood Park including the volcanic peak known as Arthurs Seat Once        royal hunting grounds today these areas are used for openair events        concerts and fireworks displays the parks trees are almost        completely gone On sunny summer days people picnic and families spend        time in the fresh air The rugged peak of Arthurs Seat  m  ft        in height can be reached by footpaths all around its base The path        nearest the palace takes walkers along the base of Salisbury Crags a        volcanic ridge The views from the summit of Arthurs Seatnobody is        quite sure which Arthur gave his name to the hilloffer wonderful        views of the city and across the Firth of Forth to the north        On the far side of Arthurs Seat is Duddingston Loch which        operates as a bird sanctuary Duddingston Kirk near the banks of the        loch is one of the oldest Scottish churches still in regular use        founded in the th century Extensions date from the th century        including a watchtower erected in the early s to deter body        snatchers On the causeway leading off Old Church Lane is Prince        Charlies Cottage where the Young Pretender stayed in  while        planning his strategy to defeat the English and retake the British        throne        Back in the city the Scottish Parliament Building        overlooks the palace the park and Arthurs Seat The design for the        new building was the subject of a competition won by Spanish architect        and designer Enric Miralles Construction began in         Directly in front of Parliament on Holyrood Road is Our        Dynamic Earth which opened in July  in a futuristic building under        a brilliant whitetented roof This interactive journey through the        history of the earth takes you back to the moment of the Big Bang         Experience the formation of the continental plates and the development        of different climatic regions then explore the complex and dynamic        interactions that make our planet work The exhibits are entertaining        and educational for all age groups posing questions about our roles as        managers of the earths resources and the future of the planet The fun        parts include getting to touch an iceberg experiencing the effects of        an earthquake in total safety and lying on the floor of the Showdome        to watch exciting weather phenomena flashing above        Grassmarket and Greyfriars        In the shadows of the southern walls of Edinburgh Castle        lies the rectangular space of Grassmarket Starting in  this was a        marketplace for local farmers as well as one of the main sites for        executions in the city Huge crowds would gather for the gory        eventsas they did for the marketsand a series of hostelries and        pubs set up business to cater to them Some of these still operate        putting out tables in summer so you can enjoy alfresco drinks and food        Grassmarket has a memorial to the Covenanters Scottish Protestant        clergymen martyred by Catholic Stuart kings in the th century        From Grassmarket a road runs parallel to the Royal Mile to        Holyrood on a lower level It has a number of bridges spanning its        route creating a shadowy dark and almost somber appearance The        alleyways and passages leading off this main thoroughfare are some of        the oldest in the city        Below Grassmarket is Cowgate known for generations as the        Irish Quarter because many families came here to escape the potato        famine in their own country At the western end of Cowgate where it        meets Holyrood Road you will see one of the few remaining sections of        Edinburghs old city wall Flodden Wall built following the Lang        Siege of the s In some ways the wall itself was responsible for        subsequent overcrowding and disease because people were too frightened        to live outside it        West Bow said to be so named because it was within a bows        length of the castle walls and Candlemakers Row are streets leading        away from Cowgate Head at the end of Grassmarket Here youll find        interesting shops for antiques collectibles and antiquarian books        Both these streets lead to the upper level of the George IV Bridge        From Candlemakers Row enter the Greyfriars Churchyard        through a gate on the right The Greyfriars Church was closely linked        with the Protestant Covenanters and many of those hanged in the        Grassmarket are buried here The church was opened in the first        one after the Reformationand the National Covenant was signed here        in  The church became a barracks during Oliver Cromwells        occupation of the city in the  in  there was an explosion of        gunpowder that had been stored by city fathers in the tower Fire did        further damage in  Greyfriars Church was restored in  to        produce the building you see now        The graveyard has some extremely ornate and fascinating        tombs replete with skulls and crossbones and other symbols of death        Gravestones rest along the tenement walls marking the outer perimeter        Some of the eminent citizens buried here are George Buchanan tutor to        Mary Queen of Scots James Craig architect of Edinburghs New Town        and Joseph Black physicist and chemist You will also find the grave        of Greyfriars Bobby just beside the main entrance From here you can        see some of the most impressive views of the complex layout of the Old        Town with layer upon layer of crenulated rooftops and hundreds of        chimneystacks        The main gate of the churchyard leads out to Greyfriars        Place and across the street you will find an excellent view of one of        Scotlands newest museums        The Museum of Scotland with its main entrance on Chambers        Street is housed in a remarkable new museum building opened in         designed by architects Benson and Forsyth It charts the history of        Scotland bringing under one roof a number of important collections of        artifacts The story begins  billion years ago with displays of        fossils and rock marking the geological changes that forged the        landscape It continues through the turbulent eras of Scottish history        for both church and state and on to the industrial developments of        modern times        Fascinating details such as Bonnie Prince Charlies        traveling canteen of cutlery along with his sword and targe a small        bag bring history to life Exhibits are devoted to Scottish pioneers        Sir Alexander Fleming and Alexander Graham Bell among others A fine        collection of medieval church artifacts and Celtic carvings can be        found on the first floor A roof terrace offers panoramic views over        the city skyline and there is an excellent restaurant on the third        floor        This new museum was built as an annex to the existing Royal        Museum a beautiful Victorian edifice with a large glass roofmuch        like a glass house The Royal Museum has displays devoted to        anthropology archaeology natural sciences and technology        Collections such as Asian art and Egyptian artifacts are on terraced        balconies allowing a full view of the roof from the ground floor        There are always several temporary exhibits to explore along with a        caf and gift shop Tickets for the Museum of Scotland allow entrance        also to the main collections of the Royal Museum fulfilling the stated        aim of the curators of bringing Scotland to the world and the world        to Scotland         The two museums are at the heart of the old University of        Edinburgh quarter with students still attending lectures in the        sandstone buildings Although the campus has grown and now occupies        sites all around the city the streets here have cheap eateries stores        selling eclectic clothing and bookstores James Thin on South Bridge        is the largest bookstore in the city        South of the museum a short walk down Forest Road brings        you to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary The city has a longstanding        international reputation for research and development which began in         with the founding of the Royal College of Physicians The School        of Medicine followed only a few years later The first infirmary was        founded in  in  the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal was        the first in the world published to promote discussion and knowledge of        medicine Joseph Lister pioneered the use of carbolic acid to keep        wounds clean and James Young Simpson experimented with chloroform as        an anesthetic        Opposite the infirmary with an entrance on Lauriston        Place is the ornate George Heriot School Although not open to the        public its towers and beautifully carved stone walls can be seen from        various vantage points in the city It has an interesting story to        tell George Heriot was banker goldsmith and jeweler to James IV        When he died in  he bequeathed his fortune to the education and        upkeep of orphans and the school was subsequently built for this        purpose        The New Town        By the beginning of the th century life in the city of        Edinburgh todays Old Town was overcrowded and unsanitary The city        had grown very little since the th century yet its population was        said to be over  Large families lived in high tenements sharing        a well with hundreds of other families Sewage and dirty water were        thrown from upper floors to the streets below and left to fester        In  the provost of the city George Drummond first        raised the possibility of expansion to the northeast across what was        called Barefoots Parks to the green fields beyond His ideas were not        made official until  and it was another  years before plans were        put into place for a competition to create a design for this new        development to be called the New Town        There were logistical problems to be overcome At the foot        of the castle was Nor Loch a large expanse of water that required        draining There would also have to be adequate access between the older        and newer parts of town including a bridge over the valley between        Barefoots Parks and the Royal Mile The prize for the competition        winner was a gold medalalong with world fame        The winner announced in  was James Craig an unknown        yearold architect and native of the city His plan was a simple        grid a symmetrical design with straight streets and grand squares The        recent union with England was the inspiration for street names such as        Rose and Thistle  Craig also praised the royal family with George        Street Queen Street and Princes Street Surprisingly the plan        contained little detail for the buildings that would line the streets        and frame the squares Instead Craig concentrated on the overall        design        In  construction had already begun on North Bridge        which would provide access from the Old Town Nor Loch was drained        creating land for todays Princes Street Gardens and the Mound was        constructed to provide a second westerly access between the two        settlements Initial demand for land in the New Town was not        spectacular in fact incentives had to be offered to entice        buyers        The first houses built here did not adhere to any set        design In  after only a few years the city decided to impose        planning guidelines At the same time an architect named Robert Adam        became popular in the fashionable circles of the welltodo having        made a name for himself in England It was he who would add the flesh        of handsome buildings to the bones of Craigs design        By the beginning of the th century the New Town had        become so popular that plans were made for a second stage This would        be a largely residential area extending north from Queen Street        incorporating a number of traffic circles circuses as well as        straight roads Most influential at this stage was architect William        Playfair and his flair can be seen in many of the streets and public        buildings of the time These streets are still largely residential and        make an interesting area to stroll displaying a wealth of original        detail Edinburgh became known as the Athens of the North for both        its aesthetic beauty and its wealth of talented individuals Notable        artists writers philosophers and scientists seemed to flock to the        city        Today the streets of the New Town have perhaps the        greatest collection of Georgian architecture in the world Many areas        enjoy protected status to save them for future generations to enjoy        Because so many buildings are still residences however there are        relatively few attractions to visit compared with the Old Town        Princes Street        Looking north from the high ground of the Old Town the        first street you can see is Princes Street It was once regarded as the        most beautiful street in Europe a claim that is difficult to        understand today since so many of the original buildings have been        replaced Princes Street is to Scots what Oxford Street is to the        Englishthe premier shopping street of the land Wide walkways have        plenty of room for shoppers and there are splendid views of the castle        all along its length        On the south side of the streetin the open ground below        the castle and on the site of the formerly marshy Nor Lochare        Princes Street Gardens a welcome place to relax in a sunny day The        West Gardens have a number of interesting memorial statues and        sculptures including the Scottish American War Memorial and the Royal        Scots Memorial        An the center of the gardens is Ross Open Air Bandstand        which plays host to free concerts throughout the year particularly        during the festival season During the summer beside the flight of        steps carrying people up to the Mound you will find the Floral Clock        Planted with hundreds of pretty blooms all in pristine condition it        has kept accurate time since its creation in         The West and East Gardens are split by the Mound an        artificial slope of rock and soil that carries a road connecting the        New Town with the Old Here you will find two of the most important        galleries in the city housed in classical buildings designed by        Playfair Set back from Princes Street is the National Gallery of        Scotland opened in  which houses a collection of works by native        Scottish artists and international masters The collectionand indeed        the building itselfis not huge or overbearing allowing visitors to        relax and enjoy the art perhaps more than is possible in such massive        galleries as the Louvre or Rijksmuseum Initially known as the Royal        Institute in the s the National Gallery benefited from a number of        bequests not least that of the Duke of Sutherland in  In  the        gallery and Londons Victoria and Albert Museum jointly purchased The        Three Graces a sculpture by Antonio Canova that was in danger of being        sold abroad        What it lacks in size the gallery makes up for in        quality Works such as Raphaels Bridgewater Madonna a Rembrandt        SelfPortrait and Velzquezs Old Woman Cooking Eggs are only three        from a collection that includes pieces by Titian Van Dyck Rubens        Constable Turner and Vermeer Scottish artists include Allan Ramsey        Sir Henry Raeburn and Sir David Wilkie        In front of the National Gallery is the Royal Scottish        Academy building designed as almost its twin It holds regular        exhibits and displays by academy members        Between the two buildings East Princes Gardens are        smaller than the West Gardens In winter a large ice rink covers the        lawns where you can enjoy outdoor skating in a picturesque setting        Rising above the flower beds is the solemn Scott Monument complete        with a resident flock of pigeons that badger people on surrounding park        benches for crumbs The Scott Monument is a huge stone Gothic        structure with four buttresses supporting a spire The whole edifice is         m  ft high In its shadow sits the statue of no velist Sir        Walter Scott and his faithful dog Maida carved from Cararra marble        Designed by George Meikle Kemp an unknown draftsman of humble birth        the monument took its inspiration from the design of Melrose Abbey        Sixtyfour additional statuettes carved into the structure represent        characters from Scotts books Steps inside the outer columns lead up        to galleries at four levels and the view from the top gallery is        spectacular        A small garden to the west of the Scott Monument has a        memorial to David Livingstone the explorer and missionary Created by        Amelia Hill it is the only statue in the garden to have been sculpted        by a woman When it was unveiled it received much criticism because        many thought it too small to occupy an open space        Beyond the two monuments is Waverley Bridge Here you can        pick up buses for a tour of city attractions This is also the site of        Waverley Station and the sound of arriving trains can be heard as        background noise throughout the day The lines take a dramatic route        through ditches cut through Princes Street Gardens and under the Mound        in the National Gallery you can feel a faint movement as the trains        travel underneath Waverley Street Shopping Centre which sits on the        corner of Princes Street is where you will find the main Tourist        Information Office        On the south side of the station is Market Street which        was one of the principle market sites during the Victorian era Market        Street is home to the Edinburgh City Art Gallery showcasing the work        of upandcoming artists On the same street you will also find the        ticket office for the Military Tattoo see pages  with an        accompanying gallery and souvenir shop        At the eastern end of Princes Street is Register House        completed in  from a design by Robert Adam and built for the        Scottish public records office Today it stores landregistry papers        and is the haunt of solicitors and professional researchers In front        of the building is a statue of the Duke of Wellington resplendent in        battle dress and cloak astride his trusty steed Copenhagen        George Street        George Street was the centerpiece of Craigs original        design for the New Town The grand thoroughfare anchored at each end        by a large square had a symmetrical pattern of streets on both its        flanks        George Street was the traditional center of Edinburghs        financial district Behind the strong plain painted doors many        successful bankers increased the wealth of their trusting investors        Scottish banking has long been held in high regard and it still plays        an important part in the world of finance However the        buildingsbeautiful though they arehave not been able to        accommodate modern computerized banking equipment increasingly the        institutions have moved to modern buildings around the city This        doesnt make George Street an empty shell Where banks have moved out        fashionable wine bars and restaurants have moved in making it a great        place to come for drinks or dinner        The western end of George Street begins at Charlotte        Square originally named St Georges Square after the patron saint of        England mirroring St Andrews Square at the streets eastern end        which was named for the patron saint of Scotland The name was changed        to honor Queen CharlotteGeorge IIIs wifewho felt a little upset        at having been left out of the original plans After all her husband        and two sons had roads named after them George Street and Princes        Street        Charlotte Square is arguably the jewel of the New Town        The faades of elegant houses on the north side were designed by Adam        and have changed little since they were finished in  In the center        of the terrace is Georgian House owned by the National Trust and        restored in period style to show the workings of a typical Georgian        household All of the many pieces in the house are authentic including        a huge array of kitchen utensils crockery cutlery furniture        carpets and curtains Most surprising is the fact that the bedchamber        is on the first floor rather than on the second upperfloor bedrooms        became fashionable only at a later date        On the western flank of the square West Register House        designed originally as a church St Georges was taken over by the        government in  and is now part of the Public Records Office The        building at the corner of Charlotte Square and South Charlotte Street        was the birthplace of Alexander Graham Bell inventor of the telephone        Plans are in place to turn the house into a museum charting the life        and works of this extraordinary man        Four streets to the east on George Street the most        stunning building on St Andrews Square is that belonging to the Royal        Bank of Scotland Originally a house it was designed by Sir William        Chambers and completed in  the dome was added in         Scottish National Portrait Gallery        From St Andrews Square it is only a short walk north to        Queen Street where you will find the Scottish National Portrait        Gallery on the corner More than  paintings of famousand        infamousScots can be found in the collection which was initiated by        David th Earl of Buchan Following the earls death Scottish        historian Thomas Carlyle decided to inspire his fellow countrymen        through a national gallery devoted to their heroes He obtained private        backing for the creation of the gallery which opened in         Designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson the building was        constructed in neoGothic style and statues on the outer faade depict        Scottish poets artists and statesmen The entrance hall also portrays        famous Scots in a beautifully detailed frieze just below the cornice        its a veritable Whos Who of the Scottish establishment The        entrance is also home to several sculptures including one of Carlyle        the gallerys founding father        The galleries are arranged chronologically which helps        put the figures into context Youll of course see Mary Stuart Mary        Queen of Scots and Bonnie Prince Charlieas himself and also as        Betty Burke his disguise to escape the English forces Sir Walter        Scott and Robert Adam are here but you will also find individuals such        as Neil Gow a virtuoso fiddler of great renown in his own lifetime         Likenesses can be found on canvas on bronze or plaster        medals or as sculptures There is an interesting section devoted to        thcentury Scots including Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother who        was born at Glamis Castle in  The gallery also has a strong policy        of both acquiring and commissioning works depicting modern Scots in the        public eye including actors Sean Connery and Robbie Coltrane and        Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson which keeps its        exhibitions fresh and fulfills Carlyles original aims        Calton Hill        From the eastern end of Princes Street the eye is drawn        to a hill topped with a series of interesting albeit disparate        buildings This is Calton Hill built around  m  ft of hard        volcanic rock and its monuments and architecture are said to have been        responsible for Edinburghs epithet Athens of the North  You will be        met by a flight of steep steps but the superb views across the city        make the climb worthwhile        At the very crest of the hill you will find the Old        Observatory the only building designed by James Craig left in the        city it was completed in  An additional observatory was added in        the s but the smoky skies and train steam over the city at that        time made it an unsuitable location for watching the stars The Royal        Observatory was relocated to Blackford Hill farther south in         Today the old building hosts the Edinburgh Experience a minute D        slide show charting the history of the city and bringing to life the        Edinburgh of today AprilOctober only        The nearby Nelson Monument an elegant tower  m  ft        high commemorates the famous naval victory at Trafalgar in  You        can climb the column for magnificent views of the city and the Firth of        Forth to the north At the top of the tower is a white ball on a metal        stake As one oclock approaches the ball rises to the top of the        stake and then drops exactly on the stroke of one This device is a        visual counterpart to the firing of the One OClock Gun at the Castle        It could easily be seen by ships in the Firth of Forth and was a useful        safeguard if prevailing winds carried the sound of the gunfire the        wrong way        A colonnaded circular monument to the right was raised in        the memory of Dugald Stewart professor of moral philosophy at the        University of Edinburgh in the s The classical design was taken        from examples in Athens        The most fascinating structure on Calton Hill is the        National Monument What looks from a distance like a huge Greek temple        with many Ionic columns turns out to be only a single faade with         columns It was planned in the s as a symbol of Scottish national        pride and designed as a miniParthenon in deference to the        neoclassical style popular at the time Unfortunately the public was        not enthusiastic the funding ran out and the project was abandoned        giving the monument its other name Scotlands Disgrace         Edinburghs Villages        Edinburgh has throughout most of its history been a very        compact city Even the New Town had very set boundaries The entire        city was surrounded by open countryside with a scattering of small        villages But massive growth during the th century saw Edinburgh        absorb many of these formerly independent communities into its        everenlarging limits Surprisinglyand happilythe villages did        not allow their character to be diluted and swallowed up into one        homogenous suburb They still maintain their own individual charms and        are certainly an important element in Edinburghs continuing        appeal        Dean Village        Less than one kilometer half a mile from the western end        of Princes Street is Dean Village It is set on the ribbonthin Water        of Leith whose narrow valley drops steeply here Dean Bridge carries        the main road over the Water it was designed and built by Thomas        Telford one of Scotlands greatest civil engineers        Dean was an industrial village its economy depending on        numerous small mills that have now completely disappeared A walk        beside the Water offers the most interesting views so dont cross the        bridge Instead take the cobbled alley of Bells Brae to Hawthornbank        Road down in the valley Youll see fascinating views of the rear of        the Georgian houses of the New Town as well as the small cottages of        Dean Village itself        A tenminute walk east on Belford Road brings you to two        important art galleries The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art        founded in  occupies the site of the former John Watsons School        a neoclassical building dating from the s The gallery rooms        display some of the best in thcentury art Cubists are represented        by Picasso including Mother and Child from his Blue Period and        Braque There are pieces by Matisse Magritte Mir and Hockney        Sculptures inside the gallery include works by Giacometti and there        are several large sculptures by Henry Moore displayed in the        surrounding grounds        Opposite the modern art gallery is the Dean Gallery        occupying a fine Victorian mansion that was once an orphanage The        gallery brings together a number of excellent private collections        including works by local Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi        Inverleith        Immediately north of Edinburghs New Town is Inverleith        an area full of green sites Large schools with acres of grounds        playing fields and recreation areas are interspersed with sumptuous        houses set in leafy lanes It was here that the Royal Botanic Garden        was moved in  from a location not far from the Abbey of Holyrood        The garden had been founded as early as  as a resource for medical        research affiliated for many years with the Royal College of        Physicians        The present site covers  hectares  acres of ground        divided into several different natural environments The huge Victorian        greenhouse New Palm House is impressive and packed with ferns and        palms that thrive in the warm damp environment A large s        greenhouse sits beside it and though lacking the elegance of its        neighbor still boasts an impressive collection The surrounding        landscaped grounds are kept in pristine condition Mature trees shade        lawns and flower beds that are home to numerous birds species and        cheeky gray squirrels You can also wander through the soothing Chinese        garden with its waterfalls and pretty red pergola        Corstorphine        About  km  miles west of Edinburghs center past the        rugby ground at Murrayfield you will find Corstorphine For centuries        this was a farming village separated from the city by the green        expanse of Corstorphine Hill On the slopes of the hill you will find        Edinburgh Zoo located just behind Corstorphine Hospital        The zoo opened in  and was designed with enclosures        rather than cages an idea that was new at the time This offered a        more natural habitat for animals and a clearer view for visitors When        the zoo celebrated the first successful hatching in captivity of a king        penguin in  it gained world renown no other zoo had examples of        this penguin species        Today Edinburgh Zoo continues work on the conservation of        animal species and acts as an educational resource The penguins still        take pride of placethe zoo has the worlds largest group in        captivityand they take a stroll around the zoo in the Penguin        Parade every day during the summer AprilOctober        There are over  species of animals on view here with        notable successes in the breeding of endangered rhinos and Rothschild        giraffes There are also beautiful big cats and a large Plains of        Africa exhibit where herds of antelope and zebra graze peacefully in        the Scottish sunshine The zoo lies on a hillside with visitors        needing to climb some inclines to the upper enclosures wheelchairs and        strollers are available        Leith        Situated on the coast Leith is only  km  miles from        the city center It has been an important settlement since the th        century and was the largest port in Scotland for many years handling        Edinburghs cargo It was a fiercely independent settlement with its        own fishing fleet and shipbuilding industry In  Leith was        incorporated into the city of Edinburgh        After a brief thcentury decline Leiths fortunes have        revived The old warehouses have been transformed into upscale        apartments and fashionable office buildings and there is a buzz of        chic commercial activity that has spawned smart restaurants and wine        bars Older localstrawler men or dockworkersmight lament the loss        of Leiths gritty saltoftheearth reputation but the town has an        air of excitement about it Buses from the city center will carry you        here in minutes        In  the Royal Yacht Britannia the vessel that carried        the queen and her official representatives on  royal and diplomatic        visits to venues around the world was decommissioned The fate of the        ship was undecided and at one time it was thought that it might be        scrapped but eventually it became a tourist attraction Several cities        made bids to host the ship and Edinburghs was successful her new        home would be at Leith After some work to make her visitorfriendly        she lowered her gangplank to the public in October         The ship was launched in April  when Elizabeth II was        in the first few months of her reign She and her husband Prince        Philip were very much involved in the interior decoration of the ship        choosing the furnishings for what would be their floating home The        royal quarters have changed little since that time Britannia was the        place where the queen said she could truly relax and it is very much a        reflection of her personal tastesurprising for its lack of the        ornate trappings that fill her official palaces        The ship entertained presidents princes and diplomats        but most people perhaps remember Britannia as the royal honeymoon boat        Princess Margaret began the tradition to be follo wed by three of the        queens children Anne Andrew and of course Charles who journeyed        with the newly designated Diana Princess of Wales around the        Mediterranean in         The most attractive part of Leith is the Shore a few        minutes walk east of Britannia The Shore formed around the mouth of        the Waters of Leith the narrow river running through Edinburgh Even        here the Waters are really little more than a large stream but they        flow into the Firth of Forth and beyond into the North Sea The Shore        comprises a quayside and several cobbled lanes with restaurants where        you can have a pleasant lunch The surrounding warehouse districts have        interesting stores for souvenir browsing A little way to the south are        Leith Links said to be the birthplace of golf where the Honourable        Company of Edinburgh Golfers built a clubhouse in  and where you        can still enjoy a bracing round in the sea air        Cramond        At presentday Cramond located at the mouth of the River        Almond the Romans constructed a fort in the second century ad  at        the eastern end of a defensive structure called the Antonine Wall The        foundations of the fort can still be seen but artifacts from the site        are displayed in the Huntly House Museum in Edinburgh        Sailboats and small pleasure craft dock at Cramond where        the tidal river exits into the Firth of Firth Much of the village is        from the th century and the whitewashed cottages are very        picturesque There are pleasant walks along the coastline and stops for        refreshment at the Cramond Inn which is believed to be a setting        described in Robert Louis Stevensons St Ives        Portobello        With its wide sandy beach Portobello is a quintessential        British seaside town When bathing in the sea became popular at the end        of the th century wealthy families from Edinburgh began to spend        days here taking the waters in stateofthe art bathing machines         In summer you can come to dip your feet in the sea and treat yourself        to an ice cream or cotton candy in spring or fall

Queensferry and the Forth Bridge        Approximately  kilometers  miles west of the city is        Queensferry a town that developed as a crossing point of the Firth of        Forth for routes to the north of Scotland It is said that Queen        Margaret later Saint Margaret traveled this route regularly in the        late th century and that the town took its name from her journeys A        plaque on the waters edge at the Binks a natural jetty formed by a        rocky outcrop marks her landing site        The old water ferry no longer runs but Queensferry        remains the crossing point for modernday travelers in their motorized        machines The logistical problems of spanning the Firth were numerous        but their solution resulted in one of the greatest engineering        achievements of the Victorian era the Forth Railway Bridge Completed        in  the bridge comprises three huge cantilevers joined by two        suspended spans for a total length of  m  ft For many        years it was the longest bridge in the world and the huge structure        seems to overshadow the town which sits on the banks of the river        below Maintenance is a mammoth task and it is said that painters work        constantly on the structure completing one end and immediately        starting again at the other        In  a sister structure the Forth Road Bridge was        completed to take vehicular traffic across the Firth The bridge is a        single unsupported span  m  ft in length Fascinating        pictures of the construction of both bridges can be found in the town        museum on Queensferrys High Street        Take a stroll around the pictureperfect little fishing        harbor where the boats become stranded like beached whales at low        tide From a
