                                 Steve Ballmers Bunk                        Steve Ballmer spoke and the stock market trembled Toobad it didnt yawn            Ballmer is president of Microsoft whichincidentallywell I hope just incidentally since I sure do like my jobowns                  Slate                and lastThursday in a postspeech questionandanswer period he told the Society ofAmerican Business Editors and Writers that the stock markets valuation oftechnology stocks including Microsoft was absurd Ballmers commentsalmost singlehandedly drove the techheavy Nasdaqtechheavy is an adjectivepermanently attached to Nasdaqto its worst performance in five months andsent Microsofts shares which full disclosure I own down  percent            As just about everyone has remarked Ballmers commentswere nothing new Microsofts CFO Greg Maffei told analysts this summer thatthe companys stock valuation was ludicrous and Ballmer told those sameanalysts that investors expectations for Microsofts future growth wereoutlandish Microsoft execs in general are wellknown for downplaying thecompanys future prospects Bill Gates himself supposedly told his father tosell his Microsoft stock soon after the company went public and saw its sharessoar to what then must have seemed like stratospheric levels Sensibly Gatesdad declined the advice            Ballmer also has a clear incentive to talk downMicrosofts stock price at least in the short term A higher stock price makesit more difficult to lure employees with stock options and more importantmakes existing options more expensive And keeping investor expectationsmoderate is a good way of making sure you meet those expectations            But even if Ballmers comments had been completelyunexpected and completely unrelated to any of Microsofts broader corporategoals they should not have moved the market because Steve Ballmer knows lessabout the appropriate valuation of technology stocks than the market does            The value of a company depends essentially on twothings the free cash flow cash above and beyond expenses including its costof capital and reinvestment that the company generates and the length of timethe company is able to continue generating free cash flow In valuing companieslike Microsoft Cisco which I also own shares of Intel and Dell so highlythen the market is saying two things These companies are generatingextraordinary amounts of free cash flow which they are and they will be ableto continue generating that kind of cash for a considerable length of time            Now the first point is not really arguable By anymeaningful measure of economic performance the dominant US technologycompanies today are among the most successful and profitable in the history ofthe world I say that for effect but Im not exaggerating The second pointwhich has to do with the sustainability of this domination is presumably theone Ballmer finds so objectionable With technology changing as rapidly as itseems to be Ballmer is arguing no company can really be sure of staying ontop for a long time            Now I think Ballmer is wrong about these valuationswhich is to say wrong about the future Thats why I own shares in some ofthese companies Now the fact that I think Ballmer is wrong is basicallyirrelevant except perhaps to my future here The fact that the marketthinks Ballmer is wrong is however very important            Our natural inclination after all is to imagine thatsomeone in Steve Ballmers position must know a lot more than everybody elseabout something like the valuation of technology stocks But to succumb to thatinclination is to reject the most important lesson taught by the triumph ofcapitalism which is that markets process information judge the future andallocate capital far more efficiently and successfully than any individual nomatter how wellpositioned possibly can We dont trust central plannersanymore because we know they can never know as much as or react as quickly asmarkets can And we shouldnt dump our Microsoft stock because Steve Ballmersays its too expensive for the very same reason
