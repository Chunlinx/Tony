        um i think we can have honest government what do you think     well i think there are honest people in our government i think its uh and we do have some checks and balances to keep it honest but i think its always a real challenge to um   umhum   make sure that we have people in there that we can count on   yeah   to be honest   well ive thought about the politicians that go in and you know they say none of them are honest but i think theyre honest when they go in they just keep       facing these challenges and not all of them respond favorably to them   yeah i think there are and have been some things that have been done to maybe make things better you know one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to um allow certain donations   umhum umhum   to uh be made because a a lot of times i think you know people anybody that runs for a political office has got to either be independently wealthy   yeah   or theyve got to be beholding to somebody to help them   yeah some special interest group   yeah and so you know i think  if if there were ways that we could get away from that and let just the common man be able to run   yeah umhum   for office that that   and yeah and of course he runs into a problem he may not can support the two homes and all of the other things even though they have a high salary   yeah   but its just uh i think public service was originally meant for public service but it its gotten to where its kind of rather hard to do       as public service you know they need uh money to operate on and this and that and feed their family and put their kids in college just like everybody else does   thats right   and that puts stress   yeah yeah well my husband has um held public office for a while and not a paid  public office i might add  and uh  if   umhum oh thats public service   yeah thats more public service i guess than public office and its been a real eyeopener to us course i feel that hes completely honest and   umhum hm yes   what all and there have people been people that have said you know that they how much is he being paid and all this kind of stuff to to do things and   oh yeah you always have people throwing stones dont you   yeah well obviously if they ever looked at our house or  our car or whatever they would know hes not getting paid anything but um     yeah well uh i guess that that uh its its the way people perceive and they perceive from their own wants too sometimes   yeah i think thats true   yeah they want somebody else in so theyve got to find something wrong with whoevers there   yeah thats probably true too   hm   but at the same time you know when i go to the polls to vote   yes   um i always  am real nervous about who im voting for even if i have studied the issues and heard what people have had to say and everything because   umhum umhum   um you dont know really know that person you know and you dont know even if what they say is what theyre gonna do and what their real feelings are on a lot of things i mean   no you dont umhum well sometimes they dont know that what they say is what they gonna do   absolutely   and depends on the situation and that makes it very difficult   yeah i guess thats a real problem you know i i i dont know how we solve that one because im not sure that you can ever especially the the higher up you go you know like a senator or   umhum umhum   congressman or something like that i dont know how you would ever get to know any of those people well enough to say you know i know this man on a personal basis i know he has integrity and i know he   umhum right   you know   and to go by voting records and that isnt always right   yeah or or just read the League of Women Voters answers that they give or   umhum yeah   yeah so its sometimes you just dont know   no i just uh kind of do the best you can isnt it   thats right   yeah well what do you think about um um the legality or making it illegal to do certain things do you think that helps   um   calling them accountable from a a law standpoint   well that would be nice if we could do that   yeah well i know uh some of them the Senate Ethics Committee is trying to do that but uh its really strange that they find someone totally guilty of something and then they go back and talk to their constituency and im thinking about one in particular     oh uhhuh   and uh then the constituency says oh well hes honest and we want him you know   oh i can think of one like that also  just blows your mind doesnt it oh think so   yeah im sure we both can yeah it sure does and then theyve proved that hes lined his pockets and everything else   yeah oh yeah   but i
