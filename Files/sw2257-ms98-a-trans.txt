            okay so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East   i dont think we have any choice   oh i dont think we did really either   as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it   well thats thats true yeah the uh the the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say were not going to let you cross this this point anymore and that really hurt the uh the people uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one   i think uh basically what were going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what well have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we dont then whats going to happen is that everybody well its just a one time shot theyre not going to do anything   uhhuh well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh its going to give us a chance for peace over there   i dont think theres ever going to be peace in in the Middle East   yeah that kind of   mostly it it just that that region never had peace even as far back in biblical times its never been peaceful   well thats umhum   you know the Arabs just dont like the Jews and the Jews dont like the Arabs and then half the Arabs dont like the other Arabs   but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didnt like the whites the whites didnt like the blacks but were getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean isnt it logical that just any of the that you can solve differences like that   no because you i i dont think the Mideast has the educational background i i i dont think theyre later theyre rate of literacy is so low that theyre still they still have a trouble mentality   so you umhum so you think it comes down to education or or something like that   well well you dont find many intelligent people starting wars you know   i suppose thats probably true   you know uh basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight one uh because theyve already been there all you have to do is go fight one and find out its not much fun ive spent uh over twenty eight months in Vietnam so and i mean its not its not a lot of fun   umhum no oh umhum   uh its as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty eight years ago you know but uh   yeah because yeah i guess the uh you kind of think about the good things and not about the bad   and you forget some of the smells and stuff like that but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world   umhum umhum right right   uh  as soon as one tribe gets the power they just knock off theyre old ancestral enemies and its pretty you know its pretty much that way over the Mideast and you have the Palestinian question and there hasnt been a Palestine over there for God since you know two hundred years three hundred years before Christ was born and but but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork going oh yes we want a Palestine nation but there hasnt been one for you know well over two thousand years   umhum   but you have this troubled mentality they all you know like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever but its basically all all based on the a a tribal network   right well isnt it also though based on religion i mean isnt that a a real powerful   out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family   umhum well dont dont you think though that uh because of religion it just enhances the differences uh of the tribes and makes it so that its that much harder to get along   well they have the same problem we do yeah i mean you know everybody theres Christianity and then you then we have subdivided Baptists and Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics and stuff its basically all the same   umhum   uh but but the Muslims are not as liberal in their interpretation of of the Kuran as we are in our interpretation of the Bible   right right   you get the more the more i guess you call the more militant sect of the Shiites who you know if youre not a Muslim and and you dont adhere adhere strictly to it then youre nothing and youre just youre youre just getting lip service much like uh the Ayatollah Khomeini   umhum   hes a hes a prime example oh id i i will but seriously doubt that that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are they cant even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow     thats true well since theres not going to be peace over there dont you think like getting involved as we have that thats going to mean that were going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out were going to have to be in the middle of it   well we only we have two choices we can be involved or not involved if were not involved then were going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark   umhum   uh we probably could with ultimate fuel supplies and uh some relaxation of our old uh policies here survive but were not going to do that   it doesnt seem that way does it   no theres there hasnt been any real you know alternating energy situations situations or or sources played out nobody wants to do it somebody has to make the hard decision and whoever does that will be a one term president   umhum yeah i know   yeah its kind of like uh Texas income tax whoever you know whoever puts that up is going to serve one term thats going to be it because your going to be gone they may pass the uh state income taxes but thatll be the last thing they pass   yeah thats probably true   nobody actually wants to make the hard decisions  have to do is basically what were doing now is pick some of the moderate uh Arabs or   umhum   you know Muslims as  and uh support them because theyre because they will have more uh encounter with us as far as the educational and sociological economic background goes   umhum   if you look over there youre not going to you dont see any Arabs driving uh   hum   racing cars they want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns   true they want the the gas guzzlers yeah   yeah so you know whos who produces those the US produces those and i think after the war no that were not going to see a bunch of the Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten blown out of the sky or off the ground   umhum didnt it though yeah i i got to agree with you there i think that does get a lot a lot of good there   you know and uh we we pretty much proved our worth in combat as it were and   umhum   where did they get the uh where where does the expertise come for for bringing a whole lot of ground and it doesnt doesnt come from Russia and it doesnt come from Europe it comes comes from the United States   umhum   whos going to put out their oil fires the United States   hum United States right   we have the technology when we have the people and we go do it and i think were going to i think were going to be a president in a a presence in the Mideast from now on   umhum lets say id have to say overall that the the war was was beneficia l to the United States with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean its people think better about uh the US now and thats really going to i think eventually come back and and help with overall business standards i mean people are going um take more pride in their work and things like that i think its going to really help out overall   i i i agree a hundred percent on that after after after all you know i mean everything Bush said Bush put down a deadline if if it wasnt meant to be one hed attacked   yeah umhum   and thats the way youre supposed to do it instead of doing like Jimmy Carter did you know say well you know uh um im getting out of the olympics and im going to give you back Panama   yeah     you know i mean you either make your stand or you dont if you cant back it up just dont say anything   umhum thats right   and everything Bush said he backed up of course he course he had some real good help   umhum oh yeah he had some excellent military people   yeah its like  and like Collin Powell and the rest and uh yeah Dick Cheney those people were real smart theyre a lot smarter that any body gives credit for   i i was the person i was impressed with most i mean i i really you know Colin Powell and and General Schwartzkopf theyre military people but i really didnt know that Cheney was as military minded as he is i mean   Cheneys hard core you dont get to be Secretary of Defense by being a wimp   thats right i well he was what uh a Senator from Utah or something like that i cant remember where   but hed served in the military   yeah and see i dont know that and it well you know i was real impressed with his handling of this i know that   oh yeah the whole i mean the whole thing was done well it was just you know   oh yeah   it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway   umhum   but i hesitate to call it a war since i mean it was i guess it was im not used to having them over in six days you know just kind of gosh we just got started good i guess the Israelis might be over it you know uh you know because they had a seven day war at one time but uh   i dont think very many people are yeah umhum   although i i wish instead of turning south you know and taking a right turn and going down Kuwait City i wished wed just turned left and gone toward Baghdad   yeah there was uh there was a lot of talk about the idea that the even the uh Iraqis themselves the people wished we would have done that uh   i think we should have because because were going if we dont do it now were going to have to do it shortly   yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but you know you kind of have to wonder whether its going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh you know   but the only thing thatll save that is we wont get the credit for or the blame for the massacre and and then if we do have to to go back in it will be because you know someone asked us to   well thats true too yeah umhum   and of course nows the time to do it because since we have the army over there id sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them out and then turn right around send them back over again   umhum yeah thats true yeah especially the cost of that and and uh uh the attitudes of the soldiers i mean theyre there they i think they could handle it better but if they came back and then had to turn around and go the attitudes would be just horrible   oh yeah they shouldnt leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet   yeah thats probably true   they just you know just just level the whole place and let it go but were going to have to be over there and were and our presence is going to have to be felt and theyve got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we dont then i think that were going to be back there   umhum   you know in the Jimmy Carter uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me     so do you think its you do think its a good idea for us to have uh
