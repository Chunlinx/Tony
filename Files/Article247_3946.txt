                                 Jane Stop This Crazy Thing                        And another thing It just hit me a few minutes ago when I was in the studyrepainting the red walls a redder reda project that I estimate will take meapproximately  painting hours since there also are  bookshelves and theback of each will need three coats since red paint streaks so badlythat theway we flit around from topic to topic here and at our real breakfast tableis indicative of a bigger problem in how we live our lives Were sofragmented My attention at any given moment is divided among so manycompeting thoughts that it makes my teeth ache An example This morning afteryou left for work I was playing with the baby on the couch and she waswiggling her fingers in the air in a way she considered menacing as sheshrieked I am the dinosaur ROARRRRR The dinosaur is scaring Mommy Thiswas perhaps the cutest sight I have ever witnessed in my life But even as Iwas saying Help save me from the dinosaur I was simultaneously thinkingHow am I going to wrap up that column today the kicker I have stinks should Iroast a chicken for dinner or not because its not worth it unless I go get thegood chicken and thats at a butcher store  minutes away and if waste minutes going to a butcher store how many of those red shelves will I be ableto paint today did I forget to give Zoe that permission slip she needed thismorning is my skin starting to look old do I hear the dog throwing up a sockin the kitchen maybe I should just end the piece by referring back to thelead but then I always do that so             A certain percentage of these thoughts were perhaps valid If I consideredthem in an appropriate time and place But the baby is only going to be thiscute and want to play dinosaur for about  seconds before she grows up enoughto get mean and criticize my hair like the others So why am I wasting themillisecond This used to be called multitasking and be considered a skillEven earlier it was called juggling And I used to envy people who kept allthe balls in the air I thought they got more out of life because they didmore But now I dont know Its been so long since I fully concentrated on oneidea or one task or one anything that my attention span has contracted to beabout as long as  well as long as it takes to paint the backs of threebookshelves And these as you know are not big bookshelves
