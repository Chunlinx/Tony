        what basketball team are you     well pretty pretty familiar with we moved here about six months ago or a year ago so im pretty familiar with the Mavericks   most familiar with yeah whered you move from   North Carolina   uhhuh well yeah the Mavericks uh have done fairly well in the past but doesnt look like theyre going to do too good this year   nope not doesnt look like   maybe maybe theyll surprise us though reckon   yeah that would be a big surprise   it would be a big surprise     yeah do you do you follow basketball   oh i kind of follow it a little bit im not a great fan of it but uh you know i read a little bit about it and follow it on the radio and everything       but i was glad to see them get rid of that guy Tarpley although by far the best player theyve ever had i guess   Tarpley   yeah i think he i think he he was i i think it went on went on too long  you want to get her out of here   yeah it did it did and and they had to do they had to get rid of him but i couldnt believe theyd given him a contract like they had where that they couldnt get rid of him   yeah well they already he already had uh two strikes against him when they gave him that contract   yeah uh i guess they felt like that was enough that you know uh if that you know if if they had to get out of it they could and they wouldnt want out of it unless he did something wrong   yeah   if he did that well thatd cancel the contract i guess   no thats true thats right if you get the third strike they can break the contract and if doesnt you want to pay him that much money because hes that good   yeah yes thats right hed be worth it yeah hed be worth it   yeah that makes sense uh did you uh see the score of their first game against San Antonio   but theres gonna oh they got blasted didnt they   yeah they lost by uh forty or fifty points hundred and uh   yeah that was unbelievable i id i hadnt seen that score i just heard somebody talking about theyd gotten beaten real bad   yep   and uh but i think they did better last night though didnt they   yeah they lost in overtime by a point or two   yeah so that was a good game i guess   yep   i i really dont follow them that closely there although there was a good article today in the in the Sunday Magazine about uh Brad Davis did you read that     oh yeah nope nope what did it say   course uh well it just uh this is going to be his last year but it just you know he just been its amazing that hes one of the original Mavericks you know still playing       hm yeah i dont think i was aware of that he was an original Maverick huh   he is the only original Maverick yeah  he started out with them when they started       and has made just to make the team every year since then so and you know you dont you dont make the team if youre not any good   uhhuh yep   so hes done well six hundred thousand a year   is that right thats what he makes   huh uhhuh       and hes worth it i guess   well how do you think theyll finish this year   i mean huh   not too good i imagine what do you think   no i dont see how that nah they wont even   they dont they wont   they wont even come close to the playoffs  i dont think   hm i dont think so theyre now theyre aiming trying theyre wishfully hoping i mean theyve lowered their sites from playoff to maybe five hundred which and thats probably a pretty big stretch   they what yeah yeah thats a big stretch probably yeah and uh but boy they you know theyve had some darn good teams in the past   yep yeah   i guess thats why its so hard to swallow you know right off the bat they started doing well but   yep how do they you kind of wonder how they let themselves get to where they have such an old team   yeah it makes you theyve had some coach problems over the years uh Motta was probably the best theyve ever had or ever will have but he i dont know he just he was such a hot head that he just quit one time   oh yeah   and man once he made up his mind to do something like that he gone he dont change his mind but he was by far i think the best coach they ever had   uhhuh   but he couldnt get along with   with who   i i mean Aguirre   oh Aguirre   yeah Aguirre   umhum   and uh he he had a hot temper   yeah i havent followed them too close until uh we moved we moved here i you know i remember seeing them in the playoffs a couple of years ago i guess   uhhuh uhhuh yeah probably yeah at least two years ago or longer   it yeah   but they did they used to have some darned good teams   uhhuh   but uh ive always been a and i dont follow basketball that closely but ive always been a a Celtics fan because i love i love to watch Larry Bird play   uhhuh  yeah i like watching the Celtics play theyre uh they play uh have played a good brand of basketball its real teamwork oriented   always you can always count on them playing a good brand of basketball and of course so you can the Lakers so can you depend on the Lakers for doing that   uhhuh   but i dont know i just always liked old old Bird he just can do things that i dont think humans are supposed to be able to do with a basketball you know him and Magic Johnson and old Jordan   uhhuh   but well have to keep our fingers crossed i guess for the old Mavericks   yeah itll take at least that   well and they got a they got a good owner i mean hes willing to spend the bucks to get what they need so i think its just a just a matter of time till they it may take them a couple of years   well i imagine it will theyre down to i mean like their top theres four of their starting five are like thirty over you know thirty three thirty   uhhuh yeah   so youre talking youre talking about pretty well having to rebuild from scratch   and that thats yeah thats just too old for a basketball team   yep   man old old Larry Johnson
