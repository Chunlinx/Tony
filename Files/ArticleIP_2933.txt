Licklider or Lickas he insisted on being called got the top job at an obscure governmentagency known as the Command and Control Research Division a division of thePentagons Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA which was created afterSputnik to close the purported gap between Soviet and American science            When Licklider arrived hisagency specialized in the sort of esoteric Department of Defense research thatcould only be called asinine his word in fact Air Force intelligence forinstance wanted to use the agencys huge mainframe computers to detectpatterns of behavior among highlevel Soviet officials The idea was to feedthe computers bits of information like The Soviet Air Force chief drank twomartinis yesterday or Kruschev isnt reading Pravda on Mondaysfrom which the computer was to deduce that the Soviets were building a newmissile or that some innercircle coup was imminent or whatever            This is a testof Words abilities            Licklidergot rid of the fanciful war games substituting something that must havesounded equally bizarrethe creation of an Intergalactic Network In twoshort years on the job he returned to MIT in  Licklider poured enoughmoney into Americas universities to influence an entire generation of computerscientists of whom some would go on to invent video games the mouse themetaphor of windows and icons and of course the Internet itselfLickliders prescience stemmed from his pioneering research ontimesharingthe thenunthinkable notion that more than one person couldshare a computer at the same time through terminals Timesharing had theadded benefit of letting people get their hands on keyboards which few of themhad ever done Computer science up to that point had been dominated bybatchprocessing a system believed to be maximally efficient whereinprogrammers wrote code at their desks copied it onto stacks of cards withholes punched into them and handed them over to technicians who had apriestlike say over who got to use the computer and when            Considering his achievements JCR Licklider may be themost influential littleknown person in the history of computer science KatieHafner and Matthew Lyon authors of Where Wizards Stay                Up Late TheOrigins of the Internet  dedicate their book to him although thatunfortunately is the grandest of their corrective gestures The short  pagesthey devote to his life do little more than summarize his rsum            This reflects a larger flawin the book Hafner a contributing editor at Newsweek and coauthorwith John Markoff of Cyberpunk Outlaws and Hackers on the ComputerFrontier  and Lyon her husband and an assistant to the president of theUniversity of Texas have written an epic technological history Their story ofhow the Internet was discovered is a blowbyblow saga of how a singleengineering problem in this case the construction of the ARPANET precursor tothe Internet was solved But the larger intellectual revolution undergirdingthe Internetthe redefinition of the relationship between people andcomputers which turned impersonal calculating machines into intimate tools foreveryday thoughtearns only a few mentions in passing There is merit toHafner and Lyons narrowly focused approach Theyve conducted extensiveinterviews with the scientists involved culled material from archives andprivate collections and revised the historical record where necessary            Forinstance they debunk the longstanding myth that the Internet was created as atest to see if computer networks could be designed to survive a nuclear warInstead as Lyon and Hafner show the Net was built because the federalgovernment needed a way for all the incompatible computers being used forgovernment research to communicate with each other In a sense the Internetwas the ultimate timesharing project a nationwide network capable ofconnecting any sort of computer with another computer            The logistics were daunting How on earth werescientists to create connections between dozens let alone hundreds ofcomputers without running up a fortune in telephone bills The answer whichoccupies three chapters of the book is packet switching and it remains thecore of todays Internet Instead of opening a direct connection with thedestination computer messages are sent willynilly chopped up into littlepackets that are reassembled when they get to their destination            Hafnerand Lyon tell the story of how two scientists Paul Baran in America and DonaldDavies in England arrived independently at the notion of packet switchingThey trace the web of conversations that brought their ideas to the office ofBob Taylor Lickliders successor Taylor didnt have time to manage thedetails of the ARPANET project and hired one particularly brilliant graduatestudent named Larry Roberts to do it for him Roberts assembled his fellowgraduate students from universities around the country then gave them theright to do more or less whatever they wanted Perhaps the greatest mystery inthe history of the Internet is one about which Hafner and Lyon never bother tospeculatehow and why the Pentagon at the height of the backlash against theVietnam War was persuaded to grant a bunch of longhaired Tolkienreading gradstudents huge sums of money without insisting on oversight Whatever thereason it worked The crucial design decisions were made at a series ofinformal gradstudent conferences and by September  a working connectionhad been opened between a computer at UCLA and one at Stanford            The second half of Where Wizards Stay Up Latedescribes the aftermath of the ARPANET project We read about how the studentsdeveloped interactive games created the first online discussion groups foughtover what technical standards to adopt and ran headfirst into issues stillrelevant todayprivacy online the appropriate use of computers ownership ofsoftware how to govern the Internet Once again though the authors dontinterpret the picture theyre painting in such studious detail The Internetbarely in the governments hands in the first place was hijacked by thestudents who seemed to be more interested in playing Dungeons and Dragons thanin using the network solely for research            How does the architecture ofthe Internet reflect the strange counterculture these students conjured up outof Pentagon funds Readers who want a more complete picture should read twoother books Steven Levys Hackers Heroes of the Computer Revolution which gives a stillfresh account of MITs Project MAC notcoincidentally funded by Licklider an enterprise dominated by the hackerethicthe compulsive urge to explore and improve on things In that sensethe Internet was the ultimate hack And Stewart Brands II CyberneticFrontiers  which recounts how this generation of computer kidsdesigned computer games based on science fiction and used the Internet tofashion a universe of their own Building the Internet was not simply aboutbuilding a better mousetrap it was for its creators also about building abetter and smarter and wildly utopian world That story remains to betold
