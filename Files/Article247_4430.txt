                                 Connection Trouble                        A plaintive Cassandra No Richard more a disappointed Eeyore My lastresponse wasnt lamenting the end of cyberspace It was lamenting the failureto connect What baffles me is your refusal to engage an argument that I havemadeany argument either in this exchange or from the book But you wontYou attack what I seem to be saying or what I must assume Why not attackwhat I say            For example            You say my first problem  is that I cannot distinguish between achange and a problem and then you go on to argue that realspace law will becarried over to the Net as needed But where have I ever said anythingdifferent My argument is against those who say law wont be needed andshouldnt be used            You ask why should we worry if the ACLU and the Christian right have theirgates to filter information so long as they dont impose their will onindividuals who do not join their cause But it was precisely my point thatthe PICS architecture enables the imposition on those who do not join theircause So are you agreeing with me Or disagreeing with me Or just nothearing me            You say Larry seems to think that public and private controls are thesame Where have I ever said anything like that Obviously they are bothcontrols Obviously they are differentially dangerous depending upon thecontext What words have I uttered to conflict with these obviousbanalities            You rightfully report my lament at the displacement of an embedded FirstAmendment and then quote my argument about the increasing power of governmentto zone cyberspace But then you chide me that the painfully obvious answerto my lament is that these changes wont come if that kind of restrictionviolates the First Amendment            But Richard look at what I wrote The section you quote was not talkingabout the First Amendmentit was talking about the consequences of increasingidentification The point was that this affected the commons not only as yousaid the gated communities My argument about the First Amendment comes threeparagraphs later and about filters not IDs Whatever protection this localordinance of a First Amendment has against filters it has painfully littleprotection against IDs            And then you close by saying that your view is that the standard set oflegal techniques  carry over well to this new environment and that nothingabout the Internet no special brand of cyberspace liberty changes thesefundamental relationships and the problems they pose And Im again just at alosswhat does this have to do with anything I said Much of my book is abouthow to translate legal values from real space to cyberspace So what do youbelieve you are arguing against            In every case for some reason I cant get you to focus on arguments that Iactually make either here or in the book I say commerce is changing thecharacter of the Net you say you dont get it I say it is changing the Netby changing the architecture you say it wont affect the commons only thegated communities and sidebyside networks I show three ways in which itis changing the commons not the private networks you respond with a string ofbanalities that have nothing to do with the commons or my point You run butyou will not hide Instead you say more and more that connects less andless            I have tried to sell a message it is true I am grateful to those whohave read it Im not sure it is right in ways I hope it is wrong and in theend Richard you might be right It might just not add up But youd be abit more convincing in selling that message if you actually wrote about what Iwrote            It might just make the argument a bit less diffuse and hypothetical            Be well
