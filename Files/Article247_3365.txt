                                 Mr Big Stuff                        Dear Jim            It was a pleasure to get your email about Daniel Bells book The Comingof PostIndustrial Society  Like you I was put off by Bells prose whichhasnt aged well But Ill avoid dwelling on that for now and skip right toyour requestan explanation of what Daniel Bell means by the postindustrialsociety Then we can get into what relevance this book may have in             According to Bell the postindustrial society has several distinctcharacteristics Since we live in an Age of Information Ill bullet pointthem for easier retrieval                           A shift from manufacturing to services               The centrality of the new sciencebased industries               The rise of new technical elites and the advent of new principles ofstratification               A changeover from a goodsproducing society to an information orknowledge society               A change in abstraction from empiricism or trialanderror tinkering totheory and the codification of theoretical knowledge for directing innovationand the formulation of policy               A change in reality from nature during agrarian times and technicsduring the Industrial Revolution to reality existing as the social world Society itself becomes a web of consciousness a form of imagination to berealized as a social construction                        That about sums it up            So why read this book now Well Im reading it because Judith Shulevitz myeditor at                   Slate                asked me to My reasons aside why should anyoneelse read this book I cant say I recommend it Heading to the beach with Bellmay lead to sudden extended bouts of deep sleep that if youre not wearing SPF can cause seconddegree burns on exposed skin This book should be keptindoors and used primarily as a sleep aid            Whats most interesting about Bells book in  is its timecapsulequalityextended sections on Marxism the use of science to develop atomicbombs and multiple pages on the arrival of affirmative action in Americansocietyand how totally dated these arguments now seem Bells world circa was one where Marxism seemed important the USSR appeared powerfuland group politics was poised to tear American democracy apart with tribalismwomens rights black power hippies labor etc His vision of apostindustrial society is one where science and scientistsbecause theyrethe ultimate knowledge workersrise to prominence                           The rated power of a country no longer rests on its steel capacity but onthe quality of its science and application through research and developmentto new technology For these obvious reasons the new relation of science togovernment  completely affects the structure of science as charismaticcommunity and as occupational society What becomes central therefore isthe question Who speaks for science and for what ends                        Thats a telling section both stylistically pretty dense andtheoreticallyBell believes in the helmsman model of directing society ForBell the postindustrial society is one where science scientists and thescientific method become the dominant model Science and scientists throughtheir work have the capacity to steer society Its similar to Norbert Weinersthinking the originator of the term cybernetics from the Greek word forhelmsman which postulated that society would be increasingly governed byfeedback allowing elites to steer better Bells postindustrial society isone where Big Government Big Corporations and Big Thinkers do Big ThingsIts Top Down And looking back at the s and s we see how very offthat thinking became            This after all is the era of yearold billionaires of bottom upchaos theory complexity theory the Internet Nasdaq viral marketingtribal marketing niches fragmentation heterogeneous globalization thehive mind the noosphere and so on The USSR What was that The atombombby that I take it you mean those crusty ICBMs somewhere inNebraskawhat about smallpox Biohazard  subway sarin and anthrax Theconsumercentric long boom of the s seems utterly distant from the drypostindustrial world Bell describes full of references to Weber RousseauLocke and Lenin Of course you cant fault someone for failing to predict ordescribe the future but you can compare Bell to authors who had a far bettersense of it Most important circa s would be Alvin Toffler  The ThirdWave  and Stewart Brand who wrote a crucial article for RollingStone in  about how the real legacy of the hippie cultural revolutionwas the computer hacker            Authors like Brand and Toffler understood the rise of what today we calllibertarianism with its crosspollination between cultural trendsdoityourself rock and roll homebuilding computer building etcsymbolized by the Whole Earth Catalog the Sex Pistols and the Apple II andeconomic trends the rise of the entrepreneur as hero the brand of me andeverlowering barriers to the flow of capital from market to market Go backand read their work from around the same time as Bells and you have atotally different response At least these authors arguments fall somewhere onthe map of  and neither of them seem to pay much heed to theUSSR            Bells inability to see a world beyond the context of military and economicBig Stuff is what dates this book most of all Big centralized models are outNetwork externalities are in Which leaves the questionwhat part of Bellspostindustrial society has come to pass Any Big Thoughts on this Jim
