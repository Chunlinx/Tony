                    Introduction        Circadian rhythms synchronized to external        environmental cycles such as day and night occur in a        broad range of physiological and behavioral processes        Endogenous oscillators or clocks capable of sustained        oscillation through multiple cycles control such rhythms in        the absence of external cues    Moleculargenetic        analysis of circadian rhythms in         Drosophila Neurospora and more        recently in vertebrate systems has led to the conclusion            that rhythms of gene expression are of central        importance both in the sustained generation of rhythmicity        clock genes and in the control of output pathways clock        controlled genes        Recently the search for components of the vertebrate        circadian system has led to the identification of        homologues of         period         and         timeless             originally characterized as central clock genes in         Drosophila  as well as         Clock and         Bmal          Cycle  identified initially in the        mouse       In         Drosophila CLOCK and BMAL regulate        transcription of         period          per  and         timeless          tim  in a cycle in which the PER and        TIM proteins dimerize enter the nucleus and negatively        regulate their own transcription    This pattern of        rhythmic gene transcription appears to be of central        importance to the clock mechanism In addition rhythmic        regulation of the transcription of clock controlled genes        such as tryptophan hydroxylase is important in the        regulation of overt rhythms downstream of the clock                  Among vertebrates circadian oscillators have been        formally identified in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the        mammalian brain   the retina     and the        pineal gland of nonmammalian vertebrates    Each        of these systems controls behavioral physiological or        neuroendocrine rhythms that are of physiological importance        to the organism However it has recently become apparent        that rhythmic gene expression occurs more broadly For        example in         Drosophila the circadian oscillator        controlling behavioral rhythmicity can be localized to a        small set of lateral neurons in the brain   while        circadian transcription of the clock gene         period  occurs in multiple tissues        and organs even when isolated to an         in vitro setting   The recent        identification of period gene homologues in mammals has led        to a similar finding of rhythmic expression in multiple        tissues       In one case sustained        rhythmicity has been demonstrated in tissue culture                 The         nocturnin gene was discovered in a        differential display screen for circadian gene expression        using the retina of the African clawed frog         Xenopus laevis    The gene        encodes a protein with a leucine repeat domain and a domain        homologous to the carbon catabolite repression  protein        CCR a transcription coactivator in yeast          Analysis of the EST database also revealed human        transcripts with extensive sequence similarity to the same        domain in yeast CCR and NOCTURNIN   CCR is thought        to affect gene transcription through interactions with        other proteins in the yeast transcriptional apparatus          In         Xenopus retina         nocturnin was found to exhibit high        amplitude rhythmicity in which most if not all of the        nighttime increase in mRNA could be accounted for as        increased gene transcription          Although the         nocturnin gene appears to encode a        potentially important component of the circadian regulatory        system in the         Xenopus eye its position within or        downstream of the circadian clock mechanism has not been        determined In addition its importance in mammalian        circadian regulation and in systems outside of the eye has        not been evaluated Here we report that a mouse homologue        of nocturnin is expressed in a circadian pattern in        multiple tissues including retina spleen kidney heart        and liver Widespread rhythmic expression of mouse         nocturnin          mNoc  parallels the pattern seen for        other clockrelated genes in the mouse indicating that        nocturnin is broadly associated with other circadian        regulatory components                    Results                  Homologues of Xenopus Nocturnin          Blast analysis of public databases reveals a large          number of coding sequences with significant similarity to                    Xenopus nocturnin            xNoc  As we originally reported            XNOC protein is similar to a large Cterminal          domain of the transcriptional regulator CCR but          appears to be lacking in several regulatory domains          critical to CCR function Recently however mouse and          human cDNAs encoding homologues Fig A of the same          domain of CCR but comparable in size to XNOC             have been reported Accession number  AAD and          AAD Furthermore availability of the complete          genome of           Drosophila melanogaster   has          revealed a coding sequence AAF with significant          similarity to XNOC In addition to these we have          recently added a complete coding sequence of mouse          nocturnin cDNA from retina            mNoc  along with partial coding          sequences for human            hNoc  bovine            bNoc  rat            rNoc  and chicken            cNoc           Among the sequences illustrated in Figure  NOCTURNIN          shows a high level of conservation throughout its coding          sequence As aligned xNoc is  and  identical to          HNOC and MNOC respectively The aa identity drops to           when compared to DNOC Among the vertebrate species this          conservation is particularly striking beginning at aa           This methionine not aligned in the           Drosophila sequence corresponds to          the fourth codon of           Xenopus   and mouse exon II            the ATG at this site meets the Kozak   consensus          for translation initiation in all three species and          represents a possible alternative site of translation          initiation In the region beginning at the start of exon          II XNOC is  identical to HNOC The short coding          sequence of XNOC exon I  aa aligns poorly with a          longer amino terminal region in the other species In          addition to the high sequence similarity           Xenopus   and mouse   genes          have a simple  exon structure with very similar          boundaries of the second and third exons          Previously an unusual leucine zipperlike domain was          identified in           Xenopus nocturnin   The third          leucine in the           Xenopus sequence is either a          tyrosine mouse and rat or a phenylalanine human cow          and chicken in other vertebrates see bar in Fig           Furthermore the alanine in position  of the second          heptad is replaced by a proline in all five species The          latter proline is adjacent to a conserved proline          identified earlier in XNOC Fig  These proline          residues are not compatible with the coiledcoil          structure charateristic of leucine zipper motifs            However conservation of this region of the protein          suggests that it is functionally important perhaps          serving as a protein interaction domain as is the case          for a leucine richregion in CCR                              mNocis Expressed in Multiple Tissues of the          Mouse          The principal goal of this study was to analyze           mNoc mRNA expression We used          CHHe mice because they are useful for studying clock          activity based on rhythmic release of melatonin CHHe          is one of the few mouse strains that synthesizes          melatonin rhythmically    In Northern analysis          using single stranded probes generated from the           mNoc  UTR or from exon II we          found that in contrast to our prior work in           Xenopus mNoc is expressed as a          single mRNA of about  kb Fig  The only variations          from this pattern was diffuse hybridization of the probe          above the  kb position when gels contained higher levels          of           mNoc mRNA Fig  liver and          kidney Fig  and at ZT  and diffuse hybridization          below the  kb band specifically in spleen Figs  C          the latter may reflect RNA degradation                    mNoc is expressed Fig  in          retina brain heart liver lung kidney ovary          skeletal muscle data not shown pineal gland data not          shown testis and thymus It appears to be expressed at          the highest levels in liver then testis kidney and          retina Lung has the lowest expression level of those          tested In addition           mNoc mRNA is expressed at early          embryonic stages Fig                           mNoc is Rhythmically Expressed in Multiple          Tissues          Northern analysis of retinal RNA shows that as was          the case in           Xenopus mNoc exhibits a rhythm of          mRNA abundance Peak expression occurs at the time of          light offset Fig A However the amplitude of the          rhythm is approximately  fold compared to the greater          than  fold amplitude seen in           Xenopus retina Rhythmicity with a          similar peak at ZT is also seen in heart Fig B          spleen Fig C kidney Fig D and liver Fig           The amplitudes of the rhythms in heart spleen and          kidney as determined by phosphor imaging reflect  to           fold changes between minimum and maximum In contrast          the magnitude of the daynight difference in liver          represents a nearly  fold change see Fig  Although          the overall pattern of rhythmicity is similar in these          tissues baseline expression during the day is evident in          retina heart and spleen and in part accounts for the          lower amplitude in these tissues                          Rhythms of mNocmRNA Abundance are Circadian in          Nature          In order to investigate the endogenous rhythmicity of           mNoc expression CHHe mice were          maintained in constant darkness for  hours before          sampling for rhythmic changes in DD Samples were then          taken in darkness at  time points referenced to the          normal LD cycle in which they had been maintained          referred to as Zeitgeber Time           mNoc from all five tissues shows          rhythmic changes in mRNA abundance Figs and           Furthermore liver tissue exhibits a high amplitude          rhythm with virtually no mRNA detectable in the daytime          as was the case in LD Fig B The other four tissues          all exhibit a higher level of daytime expression than in          LD Fig  Unlike other tissues spleen RNA exhibits a          diffuse zone of hybridization centered at  kb          which may reflect RNA degradation                    mNoc mRNA appeared to reach higher          levels at ZT in DD than LD in all tissues except retina          compare Figs    suggesting that light may          suppress           mNoc mRNA level This was          particularly striking in liver where the ratio of          mNocactin as determined by phosphorimaging was greater          at ZT in DD than in LD see Fig D This difference          appears to be significant in that it was reproducible in          an independent replication of the experiment in which LD          and DD samples were analyzed on the same blot                          CHHe and SV Mice Lack a Transposable IAP          Element in the NocturninGene          Laboratory strains of mice are heterogeneous in the          presence of a transposable intracisternal Aparticle          IAP element in the           nocturninCCR gene During the          course of our work on the mNoc cDNA it was reported             that a transposable IAP of viral origin present in          about  copies throughout the mouse genome is found          in the first intron of the           mNocCCR gene In DBA BALBc          CBl and CBl mice transcriptional read through          from the IAP insert to the           mNocCCR open reading frame          resulted in hybrid transcripts   and  kb whose          abundance increased in aging mice Apparently insertion          of the IAP element in the first intron occurred          relatively recently because the insert was found to be          lacking in some strains of mice   We confirmed the          lack of an IAP element in SV and CHHe the strain          used in the rhythmic analysis above mice through a          combination of genomic PCR and partial sequencing of a          genomic clone As shown in Figure  genomic PCR using          primers from sites in the intron adjacent to the IAP          position revealed only intronic sequence in CHHe and          SV mice This was further confirmed for SV mice          by the lack of an IAP element in genomic sequence from          this region as well data not shown Although the IAP          element is absent in these two strains of mice we          confirmed the presence of the IAP sequence by PCR in          BALBc Fig B and CBl data not shown mice as          reported                            Rhythmic Expression of mNocin BALBc Mice          We tested the hypothesis that the IAP element in          Intron I of BALBc mice    see Fig  would          disrupt rhythmic expression of           mNoc  Six week old BALBc mice          were kept in our animal facilities for two weeks and          liver and kidney tissues were obtained for Northern          analysis at  hour intervals through a lightdark cycle          As shown in Figure  mNoc in BALBc mouse liver and          kidney clearly exhibits rhythmicity similar to that seen          in CHHe mice with a prominent mRNA band at          approximately  kb Less abundant larger bands are also          seen above  kb liver and kidney and  kb liver only          Although larger mRNA bands have been reported to reflect          hybrid transcripts including components of the IAP          element in aging BALBc mice it is unclear whether this          would explain the larger bands in Figure  The bands in          Figure are smaller than the  and  kb bands reported          in old mice    and follow a rhythmic pattern          similar to that of the  kb band The larger bands could          reflect splicing intermediates that are seen only during          the period of maximal transcription of           mNoc  Although it is possible that          altered transcription of           mNoc as a consequence of an          interaction between aging and the IAP insert may alter          the rhythmic pattern of expression   our data          clearly indicate that the mere presence of the IAP          element in mice  weeks of age has little or no impact on          rhythmic expression Comparable results have been          obtained using CBl and CBAJ mice data not          shown                          Expression of mNocin the Brain          As shown in Figure            mNoc mRNA is expressed in tissue          from the midbrain which contains the hypothalamus          including the suprachiasmatic nucleus In several          attempts at temporal Northern analysis in LD using          samples excised from the midbrain of CHHe and CBl          mice we saw hints of low amplitude rhythmicity but the          results were variable and could have resulted from          sampling error data not shown We therefore examined          brain expression of           mNoc mRNA further using in situ          hybridization of tissue from CBl mice fixed at ZT           ZT  and ZT            mNoc transcripts were detected          Fig  in the suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN the          ventral hypothalamic nucleus arcuate nucleus Arc the          piriform cortex Pir the hippocampus Hip the          cerebellum the subiculum the internal granule layer of          the olfactory bulbs and the pineal gland Although we saw          variability at different sample times Table  in the          intensity of the hybridization in several brain regions          the observations were of a qualitative nature and the          magnitude of the changes was not great Although the in          situ hybridization data suggest low amplitude rhythmicity          in these brain regions including the SCN we have not          detected rhythmic expression in the brain comparable to          the high amplitude rhythmicity detected in peripheral          tissues                            Discussion        Our principal findings are that both the structure of        the putative NOCTURNIN protein and circadian expression of        its mRNA are conserved in the mouse In addition partial        cDNA sequences and database analysis reveals         xNoc homologues in         Drosophila  human rat cow and        chicken         xNoc was originally identified as the        product of a differential display screen for circadian        clockregulated genes    in the retina of the        African clawed frog a system known to exhibit circadian        clock activity in an         in vitro setting    High        amplitude circadian regulation of the         xNoc mRNA with peak abundance at        night was found to be a defining feature of the gene        Nuclear runon assays showed that the high amplitude        circadian rhythm of         xNoc was controlled at the level of        gene transcription Furthermore         xNoc was found to be expressed in        photoreceptors the site of a retinal circadian oscillator          To further our understanding of         nocturnin  we initiated analysis of        mammalian homologues of         xNoc         The main features of the putative NOCTURNIN protein in         Xenopus were a leucine repeat domain        and a CCR homology domain   both regions are evident        in the other sequences However the unusual leucinerepeat        domain originally identified in XNOC is not well        conserved and exhibits significant deviations from the        classic leucine zipper model   The principal changes        are the substitution of either tyrosine or phenylalanine        for leucine at the beginning of the third heptad repeat and        the addition of a second proline adjacent to the first in        the second heptad repeat Both changes although conserved        in five different species are deviations from the        classical leucine zipper model Proline residues as        pointed out previously   are expected to disrupt the        coiledcoil structure of the protein The conservation of        this domain including the prolines suggests that it is a        functionally important motif Although its function is        unknown one possibility is that it serves as a protein        interaction domain For example the leucinerich domain in        CCR mediates interaction with other proteins of the basal        transcription apparatus          The other conserved structural feature of nocturnin is a        domain with homology to the Cterminus of yeast CCR a        factor required for the transcription of genes including        ADH the glucose repressible alcohol dehydrogenase II          CCR is a multidomain protein substantially larger        than nocturnin    its estimated molecular weight is         kDa compared to  kDa for XNOC CCR is thought to        interact with other proteins via a leucine rich domain in        the middle of the molecule It is of some interest that        while XNOC MNOC and HNOC all align with the Cterminal        domain alignment of the leucine zipperlike domain of XNOC        with the leucine rich region of CCR is relatively poor        Furthermore regulatory domains such as the glucose        repressed activation domain and glucose independent        activation domain found in the aminoterminal half of CCR          are not present in NOCTURNIN The fact that CCR has        been characterized as a transcriptional coactivator has        led to the speculation that nocturnin serves a similar        function However the lack of key activation domains in        nocturnin that are required for the function of CCR        suggests that yeast CCR may not be the best model for        delineating NOCTURNIN function We believe that one of the        keys to understanding NOCTURNIN function is to identify its        putative binding partners        xNoc was identified on the basis of its high amplitude        circadian expression in the         Xenopus retina   However in        several additional         Xenopus tissues we were unable to        detect         xNoc mRNA by Northern analysis A        major finding of this study is that         mNoc mRNA is detected in most if not        all tissues of the adult mouse Furthermore        identification of ESTs derived from mouse and human        embryonic cDNA libraries along with our Northern data on        mouse embryo RNA indicate that mNoc is expressed early in        development Recently early and ubiquitous expression of         xNoc has also been detected during         Xenopus embryogenesis Green        unpublished Furthermore rhythmic increases of mRNA        abundance that persists in constant darkness have been        seen in mouse retina liver kidney heart and spleen This        provides evidence that the rhythmic changes in         mNoc mRNA are controlled by one or        more circadian oscillators Although this study has        emphasized retinal and nonneural tissues Northern        analysis has revealed         mNoc mRNA in brain and pineal tissue        In addition we have found see below that nocturnin is        expressed in multiple brain regions including the        suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN the site of the central        circadian oscillator controlling behavioral rhythmicity                 The widespread circadian expression of         mNoc mRNA in multiple tissues of the        mouse parallels that of the         Drosophila central clock gene         period  which was recently        characterized in mammals The         period gene is rhythmically expressed        in multiple tissues as well as in the central clock        controlling behavior in both         Drosophila   and mouse              At present we do not know if         nocturnin plays a role as a central        component of the circadian clock mechanism or as a clock        controlled gene perhaps coupling clock activity to an        unidentified physiological rhythm However widespread        expression and rhythmic regulation of         mNoc argues against a limited role in        rhythmic physiology of the retina or in the regulation of        its melatonin output rhythm suggested by the earlier work        on the         Xenopus eye It seems more likely        that         nocturnin is coupled to circadian        function in a general way as either a central clock        component or as a downstream effector        During the course of our work on         mNoc  it was reported    that        a transposable intracisternal Aparticle IAP element of        viral origin is found in the first intron of the mouse         nocturninCCR gene Furthermore it        was reported that in DBA BALBc CBl and CBl        mice transcriptional read through from the IAP        transcriptional start site to the         nocturninCCR open reading frame        resulted in hybrid mRNA transcripts whose abundance        increased in parallel in aging mice This report raised the        immediate concern that disrupted         mNoc transcription might modify its        rhythmic expression pattern and function However        insertion of the transposable IAP in the         nocturninCCR gene was apparently a        recent event occurring after the origin of modern mouse        strains because some mouse strains lack the insert          Our genomic sequencing and PCR experiments confirm this        finding by demonstrating that the IAP element is present in        Balbc and CBl mice but lacking in SV and CHHe        mice Thus the rhythmic expression of         mNoc as a single mRNA species in        CHHe mice appears to reflect the wildtype condition for        this gene        The IAP insert appears to strongly affect the expression        of         mNoc mRNA in aging mice The multiple        hybrid forms of         mNoc mRNA   along with the recent        report of an absence of rhythmic expression   of         mNoc mRNA in mice containing the IAP        element have raised the possibility that differences among        mouse strains could provide a basis for understanding         nocturnin function It is well known        that strains of inbred mice have different rhythmic        phenotypes Perhaps the best understood is the lack of the        ability to produce melatonin in some strains such as BALBc        and CBl and the production of normal rhythms of        melatonin in others such as the CHHe and CBA              Recently we initiated studies directed at        analysis of         mNoc expression in BALBc mice with        the goal of determining if the IAP insertion has a direct        consequence on rhythmic         mNoc expression Our analysis shows        that the presence of the IAP element has no impact on         mNoc expression or its rhythmicity in        mice up to  weeks of age Although it is possible that        altered expression of the         mNoc gene during the process of aging        may affect the rhythmic phenotype our data indicate that        the IAP insert itself cannot be regarded as a specific        insertional mutation with direct consequences on        rhythmicity        Although         nocturnin was originally identified        as a rhythmic gene product in photoreceptors the most        striking rhythmicity identified in the mouse is in the        peripheral tissues such as liver and kidney In parallel        with the findings of this study we recently identified         nocturnin as a rhythmic gene product        in rat liver and kidney based gene array analysis of over         rat Unigenes Kita et al unpublished        Interestingly in the latter study rNoc was identified        among a group of clockregulated genes that included         Per          Per          Per          Bmal  and Dbinding protein          DBP  Independent clock driven        pathways may be critical in the function of many tissues        and organs as suggested by the widespread expression of        clock genes in peripheral tissues              Support for this conclusion comes from the recent finding        that circadian oscillation of gene expression in the liver        is entrained by food intake independently of the central        oscillator in the brain   An understanding of the        rhythmic function of nocturnin may come from analysis of        its role in rhythmic physiology of the liver and        kidney                    Materials and Methods                  Animals and tissue collection          CHHe mice wild type  at the rd locus were          originally obtained from Dr Michael Menaker at          University of Virginia and
