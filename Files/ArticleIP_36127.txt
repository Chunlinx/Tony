                                 PIs the quotSensationquot Art Worth the FussP            What modern man wants said the French symbolistpoet Paul Valry is the grin without the cat the sensation withoutthe boredom of its conveyance Francis Bacon was fond of this quote andDamien Hirst and Marc Quinn are fond of Francis Bacon Knowing this New Yorkdealer Jeffrey Deitch suggested the title for the Brooklyn exhibition Baconcited Valry to mean precisely that modern art including realist art like hisown could do without narrative without literary values Indeed art had tostrive to achieve an instantaneity that bypasses laborious storytelling Thingshave pretty much come full circle if you now think that what makesGenerationSensation so groovy is that they graft literary themes onto modernart I cant quite think that you are being serious when you assert that loveand death and nature are themes germane to literature to the exclusionof the visual arts Theres plenty of each big theme Id have thought inTitian Rembrandt Rubens Picasso            You coyly ask permission to voice the heresy thatformalism is overrated as if we are writing in  and you have somethingbrave to say Come on Deborah Formalism has been the theory non gratafor quarter of a century It has been replaced by a conceptual orthodoxy everybit as reductive and exclusionary as Roger Fry and Clement Greenberg neveractually were The analysis of art profits nothing by a Manichaean oppositionof form and content It is a symbiosis of form and content that makesfor satisfying aesthetic experience Anyway as soon as a generation of artistsor connoisseurs declares for one the gauntlet is dropped and the next willplumb for the other            Incidentally you do subscribe to oneformalist dogma The insistence that one must see an exhibition beforehaving anything critical to say about ideas and images within it attributes agreat importance to the visceral experience of objects an attendance to formIf the art is so much about real life as you praise it for beingcommunicating beyond the precious confines of the art world dealing withthemes and issues that are bigger than paltry aesthetic experiences then allcredit surely to Citizen Rudy for plunging right in with his criticism            To me Mona Hatoum whose work you admire is verytypical of a kind of institutionalized avantgardist whose work sends me tosleep on my feet Installationher mediumis a nonstarter anyway at best apoor cousin of window dressing or stage design simply the wrong instrument forconveying subtle ideas visually if her ideas are subtle Hatoumsgrating nihilism always needs to revert to theories or story lines extraneousto the actual object to have any validity with lots of special pleading on thefeminist and Third World fronts Its odd that you started our correspondenceby congratulating the young Brits for their raucous theoryfree and politicallyincorrect humor and you should end up with Hatoum who could have been inventedfor October magazine and virtually was invented by the arid Marxistjournal Third Text             Rachel Whiteread is vastly more interesting to methan Hatoum Even with her though the problem remains that too much of theaesthetic decision has been taken before the work begins that form is imposedrather than achieved But still Id say to anyone earwigging thiscorrespondence that it is worth going to Brooklyn crossing the pontificalpicket line and breezing past the offal and Ofilis just for the clear calmmeditative experience of Whitereads Ghost  Ive long been convincedthat it is Whitereads masterpiece better than her shortlived Houseand the West Broadway watertower but Im coming round to realizing that it isa masterpiece on any terms So I must say Im grateful to Mr Saatchi forletting me see it at his gallery the Royal Academy at theirs and now theBrooklyn Museum too Its a rare case of improvement on repeated viewings            But lets be honestMost of the stuff in Sensation evaporates even during the first viewing Assoon as you get the joke say of Gavin Turk depicting himself in a waxworkas Johnny Rotten in the pose of Warhols portrait of Elvis there is not muchleft for aesthetic uplift As an ad man Mr Saatchi will be aware of theinfamous dictum of a certain master of propaganda Goebbels that the lierepeated often enough becomes truth I think the critics job is to resist theinevitable process by which junk exhibited often enough and written aboutenough becomes important            DavidCohen            PS I hate to think ofyou lonely at lunchtime How about next week sometime
