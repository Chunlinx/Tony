        all right whats whats the last thing you had done Bernie     oh the last thing i had done or did lets see um  was getting a an old seventy eight Jeep Cherokee ready to trade in   uhhuh   and uh so i was basically just going around and doing what i could do fixing door locks and checking the transfer case fluid and things like that im kind of a motor head myself so this topics actually pretty good for me   uhhuh huh   um i got a seventy Chevelle that im restoring too so its uh theres constant work going on to that car   yeah so you do a lot of a lot of repairs for yourself   yeah yeah   yeah i didnt uh used to do too many repairs but i got we ended up with a real old uh car that kind of needed constant repair just to keep it running   sure   and um it got to be too expensive to take it in so i started uh i guess the first thing i did was replace the starter you know i did sparkplugs and things and and then i had it needed a starter so i replaced that needed a water pump so i replaced that   uhhuh   and uh just about a week or two ago i had to pick change an intake manifold gasket which was which for me is you know i mean im im forty id never done much auto repairs until about the last year or so so talking about taking the carburetor off and the   oh wow uhhuh right i mean thats some thats some serious work not only uh i mean you have to have a yeah i mean you have to have a knowledge of quite a few of the the systems there to to do that what i mean that   yeah yeah it was uh it was yeah well i didnt have i dont have much knowledge of the systems but i just kind of know you know i i make note of when i take a anything off and   bet you can   and uh  so you know generally if you just kind of make make note of where everything goes as youre taking it off uh you can   yeah have you tried any like the Chiltons uh manuals   no huh how are they   oh i i recommend recommend them ive uh used i uh i have a Chiltons manual on my Chevelle and every anytime i undertake anything it i start start with that that book   uhhuh well does it tell you kind of a stepbystep how to type of thing oh it does huh   yeah yeah yeah theyre theyre pretty good um the only problem ive noticed with them is that when i started working on cars i um   yeah   uh didnt really have much knowledge of them at all and and you know its hard the language of motor automotive mechanics is a language all its own and just the names of some of the parts you know they tell you to put the wrench on something and   umhum yeah yeah i have trouble with that trying to talk to people at parts shops shops now   you know yeah you know and it took a while before you figure out what everything is and uh       and what you are supposed to be doing with it but i i think its a lot better than than starting from starting cold and thats for sure   yeah yeah  what kind of uh well you pretty well do everything   no yeah   yeah i used to uh pay to have tuneups done and uh oh brake jobs and things and kind of had to do them  on this old car and and uh   uhhuh   i i dont think id ever pay to have someone put plugs and and things in and the brake changing brake pads is that was easy   oh i know brake job   that was nothing that was nothing i you know i didnt have to bleed the lines down or anything but it looked like if you were just um it looked like in most cases you probably couldnt get air in those lines is is that right   right well i i dont know ive get ive gotten the Chevelle ive did done the brakes all the way around it myself and uh   yeah that was easy   well this this ones got drum brakes though drum brakes drum brakes are a little bit tougher than disc brakes but um but still its not anything that that   okay tougher yeah   you know its just a matter of putting the parts in the right place and there isnt really anything you can do wrong to it um   yeah yeah   and those ones did have to have the lines bled though but but bleeding the lines is just a matter of uh you know just having somebody on the uh pumping the pedal the brake pedal for you and when its   they did yeah and you just open a a valve of some sort until till fluid comes out i guess yeah   yeah yeah exactly   yeah well that uh the disc brakes i mean that you know i i used to pay like sixty seventy dollars to have that done i spent spent ten bucks on pads   sure yeah   and it took a couple hours and they just they just snap in basically i mean it was it was uh it was easy   yeah yeah theres no not not too much trick for that   yeah   theyre uh buy i just this new vehicle i buy i just bought a ninety one GMC Sonoma which is a little pickup truck with a and im wondering when the time comes for the maintenance on this thing how much im gonna be able to do myself and   yeah   how much is going to require all their diagnostics and all that   yeah   it looks pretty simple i used to have an eighty five Chrysler Laser and this one certainly looks a lot more simple than than that motor   umhum   but uh i havent i havent gotten into fuel injectors and things like that and that things fuel injected so i dont know what uh um   yeah   how that will will be the only thing ive ever done on a fuel injector is replace the hose on it it was leaking so  i dont know   huh   i like the old cars open up the hood on my Chevelle and theres nothing under there but a big motor and uh  and you know no
