                                 Standards for Vampires                           Plot Holes is an occasional column about logical inconsistencies inmovies                        What happens to a vampirein the daylight Does he explode into flame as in John CarpentersVampires  Turn into a Pompeiilike ash sculpture as in Interview Withthe Vampire  Feel a little short of energy as in Bram StokersDracula  Or merely require the use of a good sunblock as inBlade             Behaviorally speakingvampires are all over the place Not only do they differ morphologically frommovie to movie but they behave with stunning inconsistency even within theirown films Why for instance would a vampire who can hover a good  feetabove the pavement have to scramble frantically over a chainlink fence whenbeing chased by Buffy the Vampire Slayer Why cant the Master Vampire inJohn Carpenters Vampires  a creature who has repeatedly demonstratedhis ability to disembowel and decapitate humans with a single swipe of hishand manage to do anything more deadly to James Woods during their finalepochal confrontation than just cuff him around            The vampire is a species of the undead Like any otherspecies it should manifest a certain behavioral logic that moviegoers can relyupon What if I wanted to make a movie about say bears And what if I foundit more interesting creatively if the bears in my movie had fish scalesinstead of fur Would audiences placidly accept such a frivolous reordering ofnature I think not Yet when it comes to vampires filmmakers feel free toreinvent the rules with every picture            This has become such aproblem in our society that I hereby propose a Uniform Code of VampireStandards and Practices  In my opinion there are four major areas that arein need of immediate clarification             Mortality and MortificationVampires declares Kris Kristofferson in Blade  are hard to kill Theytend to regenerate Fair enough but its past time for a meeting of the mindson this crucial issue How exactly do you kill a vampire It was easy enoughback in  the year of FW Murnaus silent classic Nosferatu  If awoman pure in heart manages to keep the vampire by her side all night untilafter the cock has crowed he is guaranteed to suffer what looks like amassive coronary and disappear in a puff of smoke In the  Dracula however which like Nosferatu is based on Bram Stokers novel BelaLugosi has to be impaled through the heart in his coffin whereupon he emits astrange little disappointed groan that remains a benchmark of decorum whencompared with the hissing and writhing deaths of modern screen vampires            In Interview With the Vampire  Tom Cruise informs usthat the staketotheheart method is nonsense Later he suffers a slitthroat is eaten by an alligator and then what is left of his body is consumedin a fire But only a few centuries later he bounces right back InBuffy  vampires are much easier to dispatch A simple wooden stake willdo it after allor in an emergency a broken guitar neck In the  FrancisFord Coppola version of Bram Stokers Dracula  Dracula dies when he isimpaled by a bowie knife wielded by an improbable Londonbased cowboy ButAnthony Hopkins playing the films mad vampire hunter seems to put more storein chopping off heads than impaling hearts In John CarpentersVampires  a vampire cant get real dead unless he is dragged out into thesunlight though he can be considerably slowed down if his heart is pierced bya crossbow bolt or a giant crucifix The vampires in Blade  however canwalk around in the daytime if they have prudent ultraviolet protection butdisintegrate on the spot when they are hit in either the head or the heart witha hollowpointed bullet filled with garlic  Blade  by the way is oneof the only contemporary vampire movies that bothers to regard garlic as aserious deterrent In Blade  garlic is as dangerous a substance to avampire as bad seviche is to a human It induces instant anaphylacticshock                           ProposedStandard crucifixes and garlic to be regarded as nonlethal irritantsVampire death to be assured by penetration of heart muscle by any foreignobject or by prolonged exposure to sunlight Decapitation alone not sufficientto secure desired death effect A deceased vampire should not explodedisintegrate burst morph or molder but should serenely resume countenancepertaining at the time of its transmogrification See No  below             Transmogrification We face no morechallenging issue than the mechanics of turning ie becoming a vampire Inless sophisticated movies everybody who is bitten by a vampire turns into oneusually after an unspecified incubation period The artsier the film the moreelaborate the distinction between the merely dead and the truly undead To thedegree I could follow the tortuous logic of Interview With the Vampire it seemed to be that the average victim dies a straightforward bloodsuckingdeath But every millennium or so a vampire meets that special someone Inorder to turn this person it is necessary for the vampire to drain thevictims tank and top it off at the crucial moment with a quart or so of hisown blood whereupon the thirsty recipient becomes a newborn vampire weepingat the beauty of the night In Bram Stokers Dracula  by contrast thenew recruit must also drink the vampires blood but the transformation is farpokier requiring weeks and weeks and if the vampire happens to get stuck witha bowie knife before the process is completed it immediately goes intoreverse Blade  like several other AIDSconscious vampire movies treatsvampirism as an infectious blood disease Look at the polys a beautifulyoung hematologist says to her colleague as shes performing an autopsy on avampire cadaver theyre binucleated                           ProposedStandard Vampirization to be contingent upon total extraction ofvictims own blood and its subsequent replacement by blood of donor vampire Ifmore than  hours occur between initial suckage and revivification victim nolonger qualifies for living death designation and will be consideredconventionally deceased             Motility Not to mince words Canvampires fly In the early days of the movies before special effects they hadtrouble getting off the ground The bald pointyeared vampire inNosferatu is barely ambulatory in fact He shuffles arthriticallyaround his castle and when he rises from his coffin hes as stiff as anironing board When Lugosi takes to the air its in the form of a giant Asianfruit bat He also turns into a hyena and an armadillo species that aresimilarly not native to Transylvania            In recent vampire movies the miracle of flight iswell established Cruise gathers Brad Pitt into one of many homoerotic embracesin Interview With the Vampire and soars with him high into the nightsky Gary Oldman turns himself into some sort of gigantic hominidbat creatureand flaps about in Dracula  The Vampire Master in John CarpentersVampires can fly down the road fast enough to catch a speeding car and canstick to the ceiling of a motel room But at crucial moments in these moviesthe vampire always seems to forget he has these powers and ends up wrestlingaround on the floor of a dusty convent or abandoned factory with theearthbound hero                           ProposedStandard vertical flight only to a maximum of  feet above theground Sustained flight permissible if vampire takes the form of a bat owlor other authentic nocturnal species Vampire is specifically prohibited fromturning into a flying homonculus Once flight capabilities are established anddemonstrated in a motion picture they must be used consistently and logicallythroughout without regard to the convenience of the filmmakers             Dentition Are fangs fixed orretractable Lugosi managed to evade this critical issueone never sees histeeth at all Nosferatu s vampire is so eccentrically snaggletoothedthat his fangs seem a danger only to himself In the original Draculanovel the hero notices Count Draculas peculiarly sharp white teeth thatprotruded over the lips almost at once In his baroque homage to the bookCoppola apparently could not muster the will to portray the character with sucha pronounced overbite and so Draculas fangs descend only periodically amidso much gaping mouth movement that the count looks like hes coughing up ahairball The vampires in Buffy the Vampire Slayer  in contrast existin a constant state of dental arousal Theyre the exception however Almostevery other vampire movie accepts the patently unnatural convention that avampires fangs are capable of receding into his gums But since vampires areunnatural to begin with maybe thats OK                           Proposed Standard  retractablefangs as default characteristic Strongly recommend when appropriateonscreen discussion of physical requirements for said phenomenonas when acharacter in Blade observes an odd muscle structure around thecanines            This plea for a code of standards should notbe considered antivampire For the sake of vampires themselves we need a fewsimple regulations With teeth of course
