              so have you remodeled your house recently   i havent done too much uh i mostly get stuck doing repairs like broken replacing a broken window the neighbor threw a rock through the window with his lawn mower   can you do that yourself or do you have it done   i did that myself and it kind of surprised me i just paid attention to how i took it out and went to the hardware store and got a new one and put it back in   and then you put putty around the edges   yeah yeah thats all there was to it   im im impressed that you did that though   well the screen still has a hole in it so dont be too impressed     we um live in our current house about three years and weve only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a eighty year old house in another city   oh wow   and thats where i got my real experience at repairs and so ive replaced many windows   ill bet you have   but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i dont know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because it blended in   uhhuh yeah yeah what all did you do to your eighty year old home did you totally remodel it or had   well uh we had a lot of it done i cant claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even tiled what do you i forgot what you call that where you  skim the top and then revarnish   uhhuh oh yeah   and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done we bought when we bought the house uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous owners had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so when then we took down the   ill bet yeah   um fabric to find huge plaster cracks   oh no   not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didnt do any real major we moved just a couple walls   right right   and we put in new bathroom fixture not not we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new   oh the oh yeah uhhuh   i like old houses but it is everyone talks about it its true small bathrooms and small closets   that thats right yes i lived for a while in Ohio and i was so impressed with the old homes there that the big old homes but i know people were constantly remodeling them and fixing them up   uhhuh and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing   thats right and those lovely old homes had no insulation whatsoever   thats right       you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our house it had fifty six windows so we decided in order with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic a a lot of it because we didnt have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime   uhhuh   the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and when we had an engineer come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our house so it quote couldnt breath       and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem   ill bet it was did it damage the walls   well not you could i dont know im sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a fan in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um   umhum   we actually took a screen uh door window off one of windows  to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became   uhhuh   cooler weather and then we sold our house  and i never i always hope that the owners didnt have the same problem next year its all those things that you dont necessarily want to tell them i dont know i mean we werent trying to be dishonest or anything you just         well you gave it your best shot   we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know its   yeah   and overdid it   perhaps we overdid it   ill bet that eighty year old house had a lot of pretty moldings   its prettiest features it had beautiful wood molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors   oh   and um i suppose that was its its prettiest features but and the and the floors were beautiful   uhhuh   but it much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas   uhhuh   i dont i only have friends there i dont think i have the energy or the money  for those sort of beautiful old homes now     no ive just recently helped a friend put up crown molding in the in his guest bedroom up around the ceiling of course it was a ten foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small room to   thats
