                    PRESENTATION of CASE        A yold white female presented to the hospital in July  with pain in the left eye        and left upper lid ptosis She did not perceive any difference in perspiration between the        two halves of her face She was a nonsmoker and denied any history of head or neck trauma        or ocular cardiac vascular or neurologic disease Neuroophthalmological examination was        normal except for  mm of left upper eyelid ptosis drooping of the eyelid miosis        constriction of the pupil and mild enophthalmos recession of the eyeball into the        orbit consistent with classic leftsided Horner syndrome Figure  There was no        carotidynia a neck pain syndrome associated with tenderness to palpation over the carotid        bifurcation or carotid bruit A chest radiograph obtained to rule out an underlying left        apical superior sulcus tumor was normal Magnetic resonance imagingmagnetic resonance        angiography of the brain with crosssectional imaging of the neck was obtained which        revealed extracranial left internal carotid artery dissection Figures  and  The        patient was treated with unfractionated heparin and coumadin and made an uneventful        recovery The patient was seen in the clinic a few months later and did not have any        complications at followup                    DISCUSSION        Horner syndromecharacterized by the constellation of miosis ptosis anhidrosis lack        of sweating enophthalmos and anisocoria unequal pupil sizeis present in up to  of        internal carotid artery dissections  Most patients experience neck facial and head        pain ipsilateral to the lesion because of ischemia or stretching of the trigeminal pain        fibers surrounding the carotid arteries  Ophthalmic manifestations have been reported        to occur in up to  of patients with internal carotid artery dissection  Common        findings in descending order of frequency are painful partial Horner syndrome due to        disruption of the thirdorder neuron oculosympathetic fibers as seen in our patient        transient monocular vision loss and permanent visual loss         De Bray et al studied the prognosis of  cases of isolated Horner syndrome due to        internal carotid artery dissection  They found that  of cases of Horner syndrome due        to internal carotid artery dissection were painful The risk of an early ischemic stroke        within the first  wk was high around  without initial antithrombotic treatment                Internal carotid artery dissection is a potentially lifethreatening condition and        carries a substantial risk of disabling stroke  Carotid dissection is underrecognized        as a cause of Horner syndrome and can be missed  It is important to diagnose dissection        because anticoagulation can prevent carotid thrombosis and embolism  The investigation        of choice is magnetic resonance imaging and angiography scan of the head and neck The        treatment advocated for dissection is anticoagulation for  mo
