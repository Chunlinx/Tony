                okay i guess our topic is um advice about going to college do you have children of your own   uhhuh oh no i dont have any children but im still going to college uhhuh NC State   oh are you what school are you going to oh are you enjoying it   um well its a lot of work   are you working on your um   my Bachelors uhhuh   Bachelors degree and what field of study are you in   um its actually in computer science and i have a special interest in Voice IO   uhhuh oh well thats neat are you from North Carolina   no im actually from Amarillo Texas originally   oh are you really oh   uhhuh   well what took you to North Carolina   um the service   oh i see   yeah   well that was one of the things i was thinking about in school um when i went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock   uhhuh   and uh i had a friend my roommate went to Tech also but she was from New Mexico   uhhuh   and she had to pay out of state tuition  and i think that would have uh played a real big part in my decision   ooh it would have played a major part in mine     yeah because um she was paying of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now it was like four dollars a semester hour   uhhuh   and so i was going to  school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester and she was paying forty dollars an hour  so shes paying ten times as much because she was out of state   golly yeah luckily ive paid in state tuition the whole time   oh thats good yeah so i think  that would be one thing i would definitely consider  try to find a school within the state that um i liked well enough to attend   umhum um uhhuh the second thing is some colleges only offer the uh Liberal Arts   uhhuh   and uh whereas like State they offer engineering courses   right yeah   so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to atteck somewhere um attend somewhere like Tech   yeah right   and um aside from the uh well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one wont     yeah thats true that was something else i had was i had government aid of course but uh it was wonderful because i got one of those grants that you dont have to repay   oh really   and yeah it was so nice it paid most of my tuition and um a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing so  yeah i really   hm wow thats great was it a Pell grant   im sorry what did you say   what kind of grant was it   well it was called a BEOG a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant and it was from the government and it was based at first it was based on my parents income  my parents had five children and really didnt make enough money to   uhhuh   send any of us to school and so uh because based on the number of children and the amount of money uh   umhum   my father brought in i got a small grant but then after that i was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own   umhum   so then i got a real big grant because the amount of money i was making really didnt compare   wow uhhuh   so it was kind of nice i dont know if those are still available or not but   hm       uh im not quite theres theres a lot of different organizations who uh who do give grants but uh im not exactly sure which ones they are and how how much that they you know they generally run   yeah  yeah  well this was great it was just based on you know how much your tuition  costs and everything and generally it paid everything so i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing so that was   umhum golly thats great   yeah it was really nice   oh another thing ive got a ive got a degree from another college and uh something that might play a part is the size of the college   uhhuh right   uh lots the smaller schools can give you a lot uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and   umhum yeah umhum   and they just give you a  teachers assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a TA   umhum thats right   and uh you dont get near the uh quality of education  and as well the uh smaller schools often times dont cost as much   hm i didnt know that   oh yeah     well  i guess the only comparison i had ever heard was between um a Christian college because i  thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech   umhum umhum   and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech um the Christian college was so much more expensive   hm   but i guess some of the other colleges smaller colleges might might be a lot different   um oh i at State i think its just a waste of somebodys money to go there   really   its really a shame because of you know the instruction um id rather go to any other college you know in the state and i would definitely get my moneys worth uh much better than State   yeah umhum yeah huh   its kind of unfortunate because theyve theyve just grown so big that they just dont care about the students anymore   yeah yeah youre just a number   yeah theyre theyre bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up   um right   and uh yeah its really a bad situation here   yeah   oh thats a shame well i i felt a little cheated at Tech also once i got into my i um major ed in
