results concerning the effect of        information from health care personnel in a nontrial        setting are more ambiguous      In an early        metaanalysis by BernardBonnin and colleagues            nursing support without phone followup did not have a        statistically significant effect on breastfeeding        duration        The infants father and other relatives may also play        important roles in supporting and favoring breastfeeding                      Several studies have looked at the content of infant        feeding information from the perspective of medical        professionals      but fewer studies have asked the        mothers if and when         they received breastfeeding        information     A literature search failed to identify        any study that correlates information about breastfeeding        in a nontrial setting with feeding patterns including the        use of colostrum and prelacteal food        In Bolivia the exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants        under  months of age was found to be above  with          of infants still being exclusively breastfed at         months of age     In a second study only  of        infants in Bolivia had begun receiving solid foods by         months of age     Although several studies have dealt        with infant feeding and infant and maternal health                 to the authors knowledge there are no data        on the relationship between attitudes towards breastfeeding        and information about breastfeeding and the actual        breastfeeding pattern in this country        The main objective of the present study was therefore to        investigate the relationship between the attitudes of the        mother and her family towards breastfeeding and the actual        feeding pattern in a Bolivian population A second        objective was to study the relationship between        breastfeeding information specified according to source        and timing and feeding pattern                    Methods                  Study area          This study took place in La Paz Bolivia The          interviews were conducted in consultant rooms waiting          halls and maternity wards of four hospitals Del Nino           De Octubre San Gabriel and Obrero                          Study population          Bolivian mothers with an infant   year of age were          eligible for this crosssectional study The mothers          lived in the La Paz urban area or in villages within a          fourhour bus ride from the city          This study was part of a larger study on infant          feeding n   infants Subjects interviewed about          attitudes nmax   or about breastfeeding          information nmax  did not differ with regard to          educational level social class or ethnicity from the          mothers in the larger study who were not asked about          attitudesbreastfeeding information The questions on          breastfeeding information were added at a stage when a          number of women already had entered the study hence the          smaller number of mothers answering questions about          breastfeeding information          Ten women declined to participate mainly because of          insufficient ability to speak Spanish          The mothers were between  and  years of age mean             standard deviation SD years and  of the          total number were teenagers Practically all the mothers          were urban dwellers and the majority were Catholic Table                    The mean age of the infants was    SD

author interviewed all the mothers and filled in          the questionnaires in Spanish No interpreter was used          The mothers were interviewed as they entered the hospital          or in some cases while waiting for a visit with a          doctor          The mothers attitude to breastfeeding was evaluated          by posing the question What is your opinion about          breastfeeding The mother was then offered five          alternatives presented in a random order very bad bad          neutral good very good When asked to describe the          attitudes of their family the interviewed mothers were          offered four alternatives in random order negative          indifferent positive or do not know          Hence the attitudes of persons in the mothers social          network were not determined directly but were reported          by the mother based on her perceptions of their          attitudes Information about breastfeeding was assessed          by posing the question Have you received information          about the advantages of breastfeeding from a doctor          nurse other family member neighbor television radio          or newspapersmagazinesbooks If the mother gave a          positive answer regarding any of these sources she was          then asked if and when she had first received          breastfeeding information from each source and was given          three alternatives before the birth of the child on          the maternity ward or after leaving the maternity          ward                          Definitions          Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as not giving          anything else besides breast milk at the time of the          interview The maximum intake of nonbreast milk fluid in          the past week that was allowed in this definition of          exclusive breastfeeding was set at  cucharillas          teaspoons or  cuchara larger spoon or  fluid          ounce Except for this amount of fluid and for prelacteal          food the absence of previous complementary foods or          more supplementary fluids than the above weekly amount          since birth was demanded for proof of exclusive          breastfeeding In those cases where the weekly intake of          foodfluid could not be specified the end of exclusive          breastfeeding was set at the date of introduction of the          foodfluid in question The provision of vitamins did not          preclude exclusive breastfeeding Hence the definition of          exclusive breastfeeding used in this study differs from          that suggested by Labbok et al     In all analyses          of exclusive breastfeeding in the current paper a since          birth perspective has been used Any breastfeeding          included exclusive predominant and partial breastfeeding                       Colostrum was defined as the breast milk produced in          the first five days after delivery Prelacteal food was          defined as food given to the child before breastfeeding          had been initiated                          Ethics          The study was approved by the hospital directors of          the four hospitals after they were informed about its          content and objectives All participants gave their          informed consent The interviews were conducted without          the identities of the interviewed

         Discussion                  Strengths and weaknesses of the study          All the interviews in this study were conducted by the          author and this should have ensured a consistent          technique and interpretation of the answers A number of          interviews were interrupted and certain questions were          not answered by all women The interruptions occurred at          all four hospitals and were not limited to a certain          socioeconomic group Nevertheless bias cannot be          excluded and the results should be interpreted with          caution In the mids  of infants in the urban          areas of Bolivia received at least one vaccination              Although the hospital visits of most infants were for          the purpose of regular checkups and vaccinations a          number of infants were seen because of illness Hence in          the present study bias in the sample cannot be excluded          There is a risk that the reasons for the visits were          associated with feeding patterns     Some mothers          may also have been worried and the fact that such          feelings may have affected the reliability of their          answers cannot be excluded          The attitudes of the infants father and grandmother          and the mothers sistersbrothers were reported by the          mother These answers may have differed from the true          opinions of the infants father grandmother etc              However it seems unlikely that such discrepancies have          affected the results since maternal feeding behavior is          influenced by what the mother perceives as the attitude          of her partner or of her own mother Social class and          ethnicity were assessed by the author No weighting was          used The use of a formal index for social status such          as the Hollingshead ISP Index of Social Position would          have improved the study          The intake of three teaspoons of fluid per week and          the use of prelacteal food were allowed under the          definition of exclusive breastfeeding in the present          paper An average of less than half a teaspoon a day of          fluid would not be expected to contribute to the actual          nutrition of the child and was hence accepted in the          definition of exclusive breastfeeding At the time of          study the WHO accepted drops and syrups in their          definition of exclusive breastfeeding page           httpwwwwhointchildadolescenthealthNewPublicationsNUTRITIONwhocddserPDF          It was the authors impression that prelacteal foods were          seldom given for nutritional reasons but rather as a          matter of tradition          This was a crosssectional and retrospective study          not a clinical trial and for that reason the content of          breastfeeding information was not checked In a recent          study from the United States the majority of          pediatricians were unfamiliar with the content of the          Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative     and two thirds          of the doctors did not make specific recommendations on          the duration of breastfeeding     Any strategy          aiming to decrease the use of prelacteal foods and to          increase the use of colostrum and the duration of          exclusive breastfeeding must take both the timing and the          content of breastfeeding information into consideration          The mothers were asked at what stage they had first been          informed about breastfeeding This means that the extent          to which mothers answering before birth had also          received information on the maternity ward or after          leaving the maternity ward is uncertain The fact that          duration of exclusive breastfeeding use of colostrum          and avoidance of prelacteal food were linked to          healthcarerelated information before birth or on the          maternity ward but not to before birth may indicate          that we should focus our efforts on informing mothers          about breastfeeding on the maternity ward Future studies          may choose to approach the issue of timing in a different          manner          The same potential confounders were used in all          regression analyses of the relationship between attitudes          towards and information about breastfeeding and feeding          pattern This was done in order to inhibit the risk of          data torturing This study was based on interview data          Feeding data have not been confirmed through direct          observation or other validation and there is an obvious          risk of recall bias However the data on the rate of          exclusive breastfeeding at various ages for example          show a good correlation with those from the preceding          Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry Data not shown                                       Main findings          Almost all mothers thought breastfeeding was good or          very good This is not surprising since two thirds of          the mothers spontaneously mentioned the nutritional and          immunological properties of breast milk when asked if          they knew of any advantages of breastfeeding According          to the mothers in more than  of cases the infants          father and grandmother were both positive toward          breastfeeding          Latin ethnicity and middleupper class mothers were          three times more likely than other mothers to report that          breastfeeding was very good This could either be due          to better knowledge of breastfeeding advantages or to a          different use of language In this study both Latin          origin and middleupper class background were strongly          linked to having been informed about breastfeeding by          someone and both variables correlated with mentioning          advantages of breast milk A third factor of seeming          importance regarding access to information was level of          education Educational level was also the only remaining          independent variable in a stepwise regression analysis of          determinants for knowledge of breastfeeding advantages          In richer countries a high educational level may          translate into longer breastfeeding duration          The data did not support a link between attitude of          the mother and duration of exclusive breastfeeding          Maternal attitude has otherwise been shown to be an          important predictor of the breastfeeding decision               One reason for the surprising results may be that          Latin ethnicity although linked to a very positive          attitude towards breastfeeding has also been linked to a          shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding unpublished          data In many developing countries affluent groups have          lower breastfeeding rates     A second reason could          be the way attitude was defined in the present study          Losch and colleagues    describe attitude as          intention to breastfeed while Scott and colleagues             define it as feeding preference A third reason          could be the measurement of maternal attitudes A          multiattribute utility questionnaire such as the one          used by Dungy et al might have yielded different          results              No breastfeeding parameter correlated with the          attitude of the infants father or grandmother and this          is in contrast to studies from other countries                 Almost all partners and grandmothers in this study          were reported to be positive toward breastfeeding and          the lack of negative or neutral attitudes towards          breastfeeding diminishes the chances to link attitude to          feeding behavior Lay support for breastfeeding probably          results in a longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding              It must however be emphasized that the cited          metaanalysis by Sikorski and colleagues    was based          on randomized and quasirandomized trials in which even          lay persons had undergone breastfeeding          counselinglactation management courses Although          partners and grandmothers in Bolivia may have an          influence on feeding decisions because of their emotional          importance to the mothers it is unlikely that they will          exert much effect through the transmission of facts          Hence the results of the present study do not support          Losch and colleagues    in their recommendation that          information be targeted not only at mothers but also at          other individuals such as fathers Such measures may not          influence infant feeding patterns in Bolivia          Sixtythree percent of           the women in the present study          reported that health care personnel had informed them          about breastfeeding This figure offers a different          perspective than studies reviewing the extent to which           medical professionals claim to take          up issues concerning breastfeeding with pregnant women                        The unequal distribution of health caremediated          information found among Bolivian women indicates a          structural problem especially since only information          mediated by health care personnel doctor or          doctornurse influenced the actual duration of exclusive          breastfeeding and the use of prelacteal food and          colostrum The correlation between professional          informationsupport and exclusive breastfeeding duration          is in line with a recent Cochrane report in which the          relative risk for stopping exclusive breastfeeding before          the final study assessment was significantly lower among          women receiving professional support  CI relative          risk                The use of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal foods          are cornerstones in early infant nutrition and may be          prerequisites for the establishment of future exclusive          breastfeeding Resources must be made available to enable          health care personnel to inform all Bolivian women about          breastfeeding This is especially important in a poor          area of the world where the prevalence of gastroenteritis          is high     Numerous studies have shown a protective          effect of breastfeeding in relation to infectious          diarrhea               On the basis of this study it is reasonable to          advocate that in Bolivia breastfeeding information          should be supplied before birth or perhaps even more          importantly on the maternity ward Intervention with          antenatal breastfeeding support seems to have less effect          on breastfeeding rates than trials offering only          postnatal support     In that context the          observation by Reiff and colleagues    that health          care personnel may exert a stronger influence on mothers          infantfeeding practices with nonverbal teaching the          hospital modeling of infant formula products than with          verbal teaching is important Breastfeeding promotion          programs on a maternity ward setting should include more          than just verbal information eg roomingin          breastfeeding assistance and talks during          hospitalization The maternity ward may also provide          mothers with a place to exchange ideas and experiences          among themselves as well as to solve breastfeeding          problems                            Conclusions        In conclusion the results of this study indicate that        breastfeeding information delivered by health care        personnel in a nontrial setting may influence the infant        feeding pattern including the use of prelacteal foods and        colostrum This study does not present any evidence        indicating that the attitudes of the mother or the        infants father or grandmother influence actual feeding        behavior However this is a crosssectional and        retrospective study with a risk for recall bias and data        need to be confirmed in a longitudinal study in which the        timing and content of the information are taken into        consideration                    List of abbreviations used        Adj adjusted        AOR adjusted odds ratio
