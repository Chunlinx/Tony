its because Im adumb narrowminded conservative but I count nine reasons in the misnamedarticle EightReasons Not to Cut the CapitalGains Tax by Michael Kinsley            Too bad none of them arevery good reasons In reference to No  how do you get the  percent figureDo only  percent of all Americans own their own homes and think of sellingthem from time to time If so then Im more elite than I thought The truthis the capitalgains tax affects a lot more than  percent of allAmericans            Otherthan that I enjoyed the article             John T Tant

reason in his Eight Reasons Not toCut the CapitalGains Tax Unless you can go back in time cutting the taxrate on existing capital gains cannot possibly increase investment inproductive resources You cannot change individuals past investment decisionsThose who claim to want a cut in the capitalgains tax rate because it willincrease investment and not because it is a handout to the rich could gain alot of credibility if they advocated reducing the rate only on future capitalgains                           Bill Nelson                                       Its MyMoney                        I guess that one of thethings I liked about the blast at capitalgains tax cuts in Eight Reasons Not toCut the CapitalGains Tax by Michael Kinsley was the writers cheerfuladmission that he has written it all before I assume that he formed hisconvictions as a student when he had no investments and didnt even know whatthey were            I am  and when I makemoney out of the market it is because I watch the ticker much of the morningstudy documents make guesses and take riskswith money that I earnedmyself I could lose my shirt at any moment I have had noticeable losses andthe feeling of

but I have lived happily in Brussels for the last years and there is very little that I recognize in the highly subjectiveaccount I Have Seen the Future of Europe  by Gregg Easterbrook Heis apparently unable to provide accurate factual information and evencontradicts himself            For example Sabena is veryfar from being a statesanctioned monopoly as it is in competition with othercarriers on all its routes except those with too little traffic to support asecond operator If you want to find such a monopoly you need look no furtherthan the rails where the national operator operates the worlds fastest incooperation with similar companies in the neighboring countries Also thestandard offpeak rate for local phone calls here is less than  US cents perminute which scarcely makes dialup access to an ISP a luxury            Although Icould flag numerous other fundamental errors I think that these should beenough to make my point that Easterbrooks opinion of European telecoms andcommunication bureaucrats is far from the truth                           Alan FReekie                                       Get Outof Your Cocoon                        As a Eurocrat in my cubicleat the European Commission sitting on the ergonomic chair I borrowed from asecretary when mine collapsed last year I was wondering who got those plushsuites with leather chairs that Gregg Easterbrook referred to in I Have Seen theFuture of Europe  Suddenly I got it He is referring to the Council ofMinisters a separate institution where representatives of the  member statesget together to make decisions mostly on proposals by the Commission            Justbecause somebody can write and his or her spouse gets an assignment abroad doesnot mean they have insight on a whole continent I do not think Easterbrook hadto relocate to write that piece Since Slate is distributed electronically andis available to a wide international audience you should get less ethnocentricviews of the

reviewing the reviews of Roy Jenkins Gladstone  youunderstandably fell afoul of those tricky British titles of nobility Youcalled the author Lord Roy Jenkins which is not correct That would make himthe younger son of a duke like Lord Randolph Churchill or Lord Peter Wimseyand not thereby actually a lord except in using that word in this courtesytitle            Instead he is a life peerwith a barony of Jenkins Jenkins of Hillhead to distinguish him from someother Lord Jenkins So you can call him Lord Jenkins of Hillhead or LordJenkins for short or by his actual name Roy Jenkins since he still usesit but not Lord Roy Jenkins It is Margaret Thatcher or Lady Thatchernot Lady Margaret Thatcher James Callaghan or Lord Callaghan not LordJames Callaghan and so on            This isworth pointing out because most retired toprank British politicians are inthis position and an amazing number of writers even those for theEconomist  make this mistake Im sure most of the politicians who wentto the Lords only so theyd have a place to speechify after retiring from theCommons would rather do without this but its part of the British schtick soat the least we ought to get the names right
