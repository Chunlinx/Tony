              all right  um   so let me guess its the Dallas Cowboys   no   no   no not originally from Texas   oh okay   uh either San Francisco or Miami   okay   now San Francisco i thinks almost everybodys favorite and uh   uh i dont know   not many people know about Miami   i used to be a big Miami fan when they back in the seventies when they were real good   Larry Csonka and all them yeah   yeah they were my favorite team for a while   well i didnt get uh into football until about Danny Dan Marinos first year   okay are you you used to live in Miami   no   oh   originally from Louisville Kentucky   okay   no just uh i liked them   yeah my biggest team ever my favorite was uh the Los Angeles Rams   theyre pretty good i like their   yeah i never lived anywhere near Los Angeles   um i liked Eric Dickerson Dickerson   yeah   uh   yeah   i dont know   but i think theyre on the down slide i dont know   i think the team coming up is the Raiders   the Raiders huh um   yeah hes getting some teams together some people together there   yeah i think the the team i like rooting for the best which i dont i dont know if they really are the   a good team but theyre an underdog thats why i like them is the Philadelphia Eagles   sometimes i dont like Randall Cunningham   you dont like him   no   i like him   uh   i like him because hes reckless   i think thats why i dont like him   okay   now my underdog team is the Broncos   the Broncos oh yuck i hate them   yeah well people put me in labor back when they was in the Super Bowl   yeah i used to live in Colorado and i i kind of rooted against them and everyone else couldnt understand why because the people out there are really serious about them   oh yeah i know my sister lived in Colorado for a little while and uh   so i   i dont know she said they go crazy   yeah i had fun rooting against them it was   yeah youd have the whole town on you didnt you   i know it was kind of funny because i wasnt from Colorado   yeah well i i dont know   but um   ive never been to any  a game or anything like that   uhhuh   i just uh   ive gone to a few games i not in a while went to uh actually went to a play off game once   that wouldve been great   when we lived i lived in Maryland and we saw the Raiders play the Colts in the play off   when was this   it was like uh at least ten years ago   okay   it went into double overtime   i bet that was a good one   yeah it was a great game   i like those close games   so who do you thinks going to win this year   right down this year thats a toss up between uh the Giants with them trying to repeat   umhum   and oh i hate to hazard a guess uh im trying to go through and see whos got who uh id say the Raiders but i doubt it i think theyre going to be next year   hum   uh San Francisco might try to make a run back but i doubt it   yeah   theyve lost too many people   yeah i think Buffalos got a pretty good shot   yeah yeah i uh   if they hold together   forget who their quarterback is i can see his face   yeah i cant remember his name either   what is his uh lets see   they have the defense to do it   yeah well uh if i could think of some of their names i   Bruce Smith   Bruce Smith uh hes a guard isnt he     no hes a defensive end   yeah   hes a big mean guy   i shoot i cant even think whos quarterback uh the uh darn uh coach name for the Bills   um isnt it Marv Levy   yeah i think so   yeah thats it i had fun watching the Super Bowl last year because the the Giants coach looks like my sisters boyfriend   Jim   im like what is he doing whats Matt doing out there  called her up and said hey whats your boyfriend doing out in TV   the what now who who was this   uh the the Giants coach um whats his name i cant think of his name   oh Bill Parcells   Bill Parcells yeah my sisters boyfriend looks like him   oh okay   so i had fun laughing at it     all right i i didnt catch that for a minute   yeah looks like him a lot younger but   oh theres one team that i out and out hate and thats the Bears   you hate the Bears i dont really like the Bears either   uh Mike Ditka i dont like the way he treats people   um   i didnt like him from uh oh one year when uh McMahon was real big f or the Bears   yeah   and uh he had put Doug Flutie in   uhhuh   and Doug Flutie had called a time out   huh   you know he was in trouble the time was running out on the clock and he goes walking up to Mike Ditka to talk to him and Mike Ditka just turns his back on him and walks away   huh   and i didnt think thats you dont do that   no i mean thats not what a teams about   uh but he you know   i mean if a guy screws up you got to say okay you screwed up what do we do now and move on   its you know i played softball and i screwed up coming around third base one time and the uh   yeah   the coach actually called time out and came and tapped my tail with her foot and said you know pointed that finger and went ah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know and i thought okay   so thats better than ignoring you i think   you know yeah well it didnt hurt and she was more you know we was in a uh it was a play off of a sort i guess yeah we was down in there in North Carolina   huh huh   uh for the uh nationals   wow   im trying to think where we were i dont remember where we were   huh well Raleigh just got a uh one of the new football teams the new World whatever it is World Football League or   World League yeah   yeah but Raleigh Sky Raleigh Durham Skyhawks   have you watched any of those games   i watched a little bit this weekend a few minutes of the one game   oh ive watched the New Jersey and New York teams you know i theyre combined   yeah thats thats who was playing   ive watched them twice and they look like bumbling idiots out there at times       uh they dont look like they know what theyre doing   huh   and i know they do theyve got to know   yeah   but i watched them when they was playing that team over there in New England i think is where it was and uh last week i watched them play   huh   and they just they looked terrible but they got the the NFL backing them so they might make it   huh yeah that would be interesting to see im uh every attempt so far i think has failed  at a second football league   uh yeah well well uh thats how i got to liking Doug Flutie he was playing for the Generals   yeah   on uh the uh USFL   uhhuh   and down in Memphis they had a uh team called the Showboats   yeah i remember that   and uh you know i didnt care for the Showboats much but i did like a couple of their players   huh   uh and a couple of them even went to the uh NFL i just dont remember their names   huh   uh Doug Fluties the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason   huh   uh i think thats because of what Ditka done to him that just put it in my head and kept it there but uh i dont know   yeah   but uh i dont know   well it will be interesting seeing these games across the you know from London or wherever   yeah well i that the London Knights i think is who it is   Spain uhhuh   uh they were a fairly decent looking team   huh   they take the football serious   yeah   uh shoot i dont remember remember what the score   well they have a whole nation behind them you got to remember that instead of just you know one section of the country like we have   yeah thats true i never thought of it like that   they dont they dont have another football team to root for no competition yeah so   no competition   theyre going to have a lot more support over there   yeah i know they take their softball serious or their soccer serious i mean   yeah definitely   and so i guess they would take it serious i i never thought of it like that i guess the next time somebody starts harping down ill just bring that up   yeah   thats a good come back thank you   all right       all right sounds good   what about your kickers   huh   kickers on softball football teams   kickers huh i dont know i hadnt thought too much about that i always liked Matt Bahr because he went to Penn State   oh   i like Penn State my dad both my mom and dad went to Penn State so   i ive ive barely made it out of high school   uhhuh   uh but i like uh Reggie Roby   Reggie Roby who does he play for   he Miami   okay   uh uh at times i like Kevin Butler on the Bears you know there are some teams uh some guys i like on the Bears   huh uhhuh   hes hes all right but they got uh uh whats his name i was going to mention Majkowski but hes a quarterback oh well i cant think of his name   huh   cant even think of what team he plays for either   huh   thats real bright   huh all right well listen ive got to go   yeah well   it was good talking to you   all right byebye   all right byebye
