   With your personal commitment the IUPUI Chancellor will be able to      act sooner and more effectively when special opportunities arise      As is true at other campuses almost all of our operating funds are      restricted We must use income from fees and appropriations for defined      purposes and most gifts are designated Even at ivycovered      wellendowed universities discretionary funds are limited At IUPUI      they are scarce Through annual unrestricted gifts from individual and      corporate supporters the Chancellors Circle will make it possible to      respond more fully and flexibly to current needs You are invited to      become a part of this important new venture to strengthen this growing      partnership of two great state universities in Indianapolis      IUPUIs Mission and Plans      Every great city needs a firstrate system of higher educationboth      public and privateanchored by a first rate public university For

economic growth      IUPUI envisions a complete and unified university campus one that      will become a model for public higher education for the nations cities      Private gifts will play a vital role in reaching these goals The      Chancellors Circle offers distinctive ways to add momentum to further      growth of this campus for Indianapolis and Indiana      Faculty Recruitment and Development Discretionary funds are especially      needed to attract and retain faculty members During the s there      will be much stiffer national competition for new faculty The numbers of      PhD holders will be down many current faculty will retire and      enrollments will increase At IUPUI where we continue to face critical      shortages of fulltime faculty we will have to make special efforts      Gifts to the Chancellors Circle will help pay travel costs to our city      and campus for prospective faculty and their spouses along with some      relocation costs The Chancellors Circle also will help current faculty      keep up with their scholarly and professional peers They need individual      support to attend conferences present papers publish their works and      keep in touch with others in their fields across the country      Faculty and Student Awards Annual presentations of Chancellors awards      encourage outstanding work among faculty staff and students These      awards provide chances to recognize unusual achievements and sometimes      offer honoraria as incentives The Chancellors Circle will help to      defray costs of these special awards      Special Opportunities No organization can anticipate every opportunity      that may become available during its next budget cycle These can include      unforeseen chances to enhance student and faculty learning by inviting      special visitors and scholars to the campus when they happen to be in the      state sometimes local events can generate chances for faculty and staff      to assist the community because of their unique forms of expertise      Or sudden changes in other countries can create openings for faculty      research The campus also can serve as a community forum sponsoring      public lectures by authorities on issues in the news Support from the      Chancellors Circle can help us take advantage of such emerging      options      Joining The Circle As a
