                what kind of home is yours pretty similar to the ones around you or   well i think so i mean   is it   we live in a neighborhood where you know the none of the homes are exactly exactly alike   umhum   our homes a two story home and   oh     theres about half and half in our neighborhood that are ramblers that are two stories   uhhuh is yours a split entry   no no its just a   no its a   its a regular two story all the bedrooms are upstairs and the and everything else is downstairs the basement is   oh oh   unfinished now you you live in Mantua dont you   right yes uh we live in a ours is a little  um   oh   ours the street is fairly new in fact we were the very first home on the street and weve lived here almost nine years   oh is that right   yes and so we were we were the first one and um and i we dont have a garage or and the and the basement is not finished in fact were just trying to review our options right now and decide whether we want to finish the basement and add on a garage or whether were going to find something else or   oh   gee were just growing out of it   did you build the house   yes yes we did it it was new and um   uhhuh   theres a variety of of homes along our street in fact next door to us is a log cabin home   oh really   yes and its its just beautiful inside its   do you like it   i do but if i think if i had a log cabin id want it to be   uhhuh   a cabin type home rather than a   oh rather than your personal residence     yeah rather than something i went to every day and i and i would want it on a different setting than you know a row of houses its   something yeah   its beautiful inside but it to me it looks just a bit out of place   yeah weve got a person that wants to build a log cabin in this neighborhood and we have some uh protective covenants     oh oh yes   and theyve really got into kind of some well its kind of been a messy situation its   oh   actually gotten down to lawsuits and these are people that are you know   oh has it   in   oh thats   see each other every Sunday at church and then theyre suing each other its not its not a good situation   oh dear   oh dear  now why did they want to build a log they just thats what they prefer huh   well its its a a single gal that uh well shes divorced and   oh   uh think they have theyre pretty actually uh good price per square foot   uhhuh   and uh think shes thinking that would be a good economical way to get a get the home that she likes at   oh oh thats yeah because apparently they save quite a bit when you put them together from the kit or or however they come     yeah i im not sure its its been a really controversy a controversy   oh dear so is she going to be able to build to build it do you think   not so far no because the the restrictive covenants provide to the   not so far   one of the uh covenants is uh curiously enough uh that it has to be in harmony with the existing structures   oh   so when the you know when the copy  it doesnt look like the other homes it kind thats one thing item that has to occur in our neighborhood   right   huh well that is interesting   we have to have uh a lot of uh   if you dont have uh brick on it for example theyre a little bit hard on you   umhum oh yeah   like you have a certain amount brick and a certain amount uh some other material siding or   does it have to be uh a certain square footage or a certain price   stucco uh i think there is a minimum square footage im not sure what it is   is there oh weve weve been looking around at different pieces of land and have found a a couple that that had the minimum square footage   oh uhhuh   you know requirement but um huh thats interesting that the other houses along our road are like you say some are ramblers and some are the two story so   uhhuh   but ours ours is the smallest one on the road     ours is you know our subdivision is really only about seventy homes   so oh   and uh our street is uh the nicest homes are on our street i will say that not uh being boastful but i think our street does have the nicer homes   uhhuh yeah well thats good   we border uh well just on the other side the houses across our street uh from ours are the probably the nicer homes because they border on the golf course and they have a creek that runs through their backyard   oh oh oh thats nice   yeah but uh   that is nice now did you build you built yours   uhhuh yeah weve been in it six years   oh oh did you do the contracting yourself or did you hire a contractor or   and uh we had a contractor come and do that uh   oh   i really dont know much about home construction i well i know a little bit i did a little bit of work in summer in summer sometimes just doing some framing but   uhhuh uhhuh   i dont know when you got a full time job and a family you really dont have the time   thats right it takes it takes did you finish your basement yourself or   no i havent finished it yet   oh you havent finished it   but see our upstairs has four bedrooms   oh you dont need it yet then do you   we we really havent had occasion to to to need it so   to need it
