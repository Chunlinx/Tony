                      What to Do        Shopping        Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong While its no        longer the bargain shopping destination it once was there are still        some good buys to be had Since Hong Kong is a dutyfree port and        charges no sales tax goods are cheaper here than in the country where        they were made On photographic equipment electronic goods and        watches you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country        Specialty goods and souvenirs often handmade come from Hong Kong and        elsewhere in China Custommade garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors        are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable        garments Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong        Kongs dutyfree regime and are subject to tax        Youll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong        Central and Kowloon and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay which caters        to local shopping Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to        be more expensive than smaller family shops tucked away in the side        streets        Stores do not open until am or later but shopping goes on        into the evening up to pm Most shops are open seven days a week        Shops in Central are an exception they generally close at pm and are        not open on Sunday The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a        halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February        Buyer Beware Be aware that name brands including        electronics are sometimes fakes glass may be sold as jade and that        antique you bought may have been made last night Always ask for a        receipt that records information about the item and if you buy an        antique be sure to get a certificate of authentication Needless to        say avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take        you to wondrous bargains        The large department stores have fixed prices but elsewhere        you should ask whether there is a discount especially if you buy        several items in one shop Compare prices before you buy any        significant item Always ask to see the manufacturers guarantee when        purchasing watches cameras and audiovisual and electronic        equipment        Note that when haggling the merchant assumes you are        prepared to pay cash If after concluding a deal you try to pay with        a credit card he may then boost the price in order to cover the card        charges        It is advisable to shop at outlets that are
