From a lifetime of undisciplined reading withinnocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mindI have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominateRed Pants items a sampling of which followsMy

by Dorothy Gilliam inthe Washington Post    Submitted by                               LIGHT REFRACTIONS            If you are a fan of oldfashioned jazzwhat is nowknown as traditional or trad jazzyou are familiarwith one of the standard jump tunes of thegenrea tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble Even if you are not a fan you must have heard itas least a dozen times  It is the one that goes DahDah  Dah  Dah  dadatdatdah  Dadedadedadedatdatdah  dadedadedadedatdatdahThats it sure youve heard it                        I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Rambleback in about  when I was in my early teensMy memory is rickety but I am sure my first recordingwas labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE and I think though Iam less sure that it was played by the late MuggsySpanier who was to my mind one of the greatest ofjazz trumpeters  Later I got another recording of thesame tune this one by I think Mezz Mezzrow  Thelabel said MUSKAT RAMBLE  I thought that was surelythe first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographicalerror in of all things a simple title on asimple rpm record  This remember was in myyouth and it was a time when typographical errorswere called typographical errors not typosat leastby kids in junior high  Some time later I got stillanother version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE with still anotherversion of the title  This time it was MUSCAT RAMBLEThat I thought was really absurd  Not only had theyleft out the R theyd changed the K to C  Now itmade no sense at all  On the other hand I reasoned ifthere were in fact some sort of cat called a muscatperhaps it wasnt so outrageous  I looked up muscat inmy Websters and found that it is a variety of grapeTo name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed tome preposterous  I was young and by todays standardsat least pathetically innocent            During my time in senior high and after that inthe Army Air Force I had other things on my mindthere was a war on after all and I didnt givethe MUSKRATMUSKATMUSCAT RAMBLE problem anythought            Speaking of my time in the AAF which was utterlyundistinguished I think I must make a confessionNow might be as good a time as any to reveal atheft I committed at an Air Force Base near SeymourIndiana  It was winter and bitterly cold  The windused to sweep across that damned airfield with whatseemed an absolute determination to crystallize ourbodies  One day when the wind chill factor was nearingabsolute zero I took shelter in the service clubThere was the omnipresent phonograph or Vic  shortfor Victrola and the stack of records next to it  Inthose days people as a rule did not take much care ofphonograph records  Usually the records were takenfrom their jackets and loaded naked in stacks wherethey picked up dust scratched one another andtraded static electricity  I was shuffling through a stackof about fifty records and I came across three BessieSmiths  I played all three and the few other GIs inthe room which was quite largebig enough for afairsized dance with a small orchestraeither paidno attention or asked me to put on something by GlennMiller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead  AmongBessies numbers were Dying Gamblers Blues SingSing Prison Blues  and one I had never heard calledBlack Mountain Blues  which has the imcomparablelinesHome in Black Mountain a chile will smack yofaceHome in Black Mountain a chile will smack yofaceBabies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass                        andGoin back to Black Mountain me an my razoran my gunGoin back to Black Mountain me an my razoran my gunGoin cut him if he stan still goin shoot him if herun                        I was and still am captivated by Babies cry forliquor an the birds sing bass and in the arrogance ofmy youth I was certain that nobody else on the airfieldeither knew or cared who Bessie Smith was norwould any other GI be enchanted by basso birds so Iturned thief  I cant remember how I did it but somehowI smuggled those records back to my barracks andgot them home intact on my next furlough  I keptthem in good shape until my last rpm turntabledied            End of digression and back to MUSKRATKATCATMuskrat Ramble is credited to Edward Kid Ory andRay Gilbert  Kid Ory played great jazz tromboneThe only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find himlisted as coauthor of Muskrat Ramble             About thirty years ago when I was concocting anepicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand Iwent to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatelthat was being sold for an absurdly low price andthat I thought might be exactly right for my sauce  Itwasnt bad The wine jogged my thoughts back toMuscat Ramble   Muscatel is made from muscatgrapes is sometimes called muscat  and being relativelycheap and sweet and high in alcohol content isthe booze of choice for a great many wines  An oldcollege friend of mine who celebrated his twentiethbirthdaymeaning twenty years of AA sobrietyacouple of years ago tells me that when he was on theskids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunktank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodleand Napa Valley smoke             I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble wasalmost certainly the original name of the tune  Myreasoning is that it is not likely that Kid Ory or RayGilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even lesslikely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskratdoing anything that we would be likely to think of asrambling  Muskrats according to my encyclopedialook like giant rats are found in and around themudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds havepartially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimmingThey do not appear to do much rambling  Muscator muscatel on the other hand is found on skidrows all over the land  A guy with a bottleshapedbrown paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upperend has almost certainly been slugging down a sweetwine of high proof and the odds are pretty good youwould find it is a muscadoodle   After the guy finisheshis Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off he is lookingfor the means to get another muscat fix  Now he is on aramble with his hand out and a pleading look in hisroadmapped eyes  I suspect that that is precisely thesongs origin            My theory is that the r got put in there simplybecause muskrat is a more common word than muscat It is the same reason most of us I assume have heardHes in the hospital with prostrate trouble  Prostrateis a more common word that prostate  so prostrate iswhat we get  The r fits in naturally  I got a strangesort of corroboration from my good friend RosyMcHargue who is now pushing eightyseven years andhas spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax withsome of the best jazzbandsBenny Goodman RedNichols Ted Weems and a slew of others  Rosy toohad seen the tune as Muskrat Muskat  and Muscat   Iasked him what he thought the original title was  Hehad known Kid Ory well and he said You knowTom Im not exactly sure  I once asked Ory about itand he said Its muscat  Muskrat   So I think thatsjust the way everyone said muscat             There you are  I find a muskrat ramble difficult toimagine visually  I picture muskrats wallowing aboutin the mire and paddling sluggishly through the waterbut I wouldnt call that rambling  On the other handa wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintainhis muscat levelnow that has a touch of poetryMaybe not in the same class with all the birds singbass but poetry nevertheless                              As a nonexpert although interested subscriber toVERBATIM it is a bit mysterious to me that the singularnoun absence takes the plural verb are   I refer tothe first sentence of your article about the LongmanDictionary XV                              Helen W Power in

Leonard Bloomfield having begun with a theoryof meaning which emphasized the environment inwhich objects were present and named had to add theobvious proviso that we sometimes mention what isnot present  I have lately been reading accounts of theexploration of the western and northwestern deserts ofAustralia in the s and I have become very aware ofthe effect absent necessities might have on the frequencyof particular items in discourse  In the desertthe missing necessity is water  As the explorer ErnestGiles put it the explorers experience is a baptismworse than that of firethe baptism of no water            My impression was that in the journals of desertexplorers the word water  alone or in compounds andwords relating to water were unusually frequent  It isI suppose likely that people with little money mustthink of money more than the welloff do and that thehungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirstyon drink  Here was a chance to quantify such things  Idecided to make a count of words relating to water inreports of desert exploration            Taking quite at random a single page page  inthe journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early exploration of country east and north of Perth Ifind the word water used fifteen times  Ten pages onpage  water occurs nine times but there are alsothe related words stream twice well twice poolchannel  and the circumlocution essential elementTwo words dew and shower  refer in the context to thepresence of water the rest are in contexts indicating itsabsence            I tried another explorer Ernest Giles  Takingpage  again I was reminded that Giles is rathergiven to semiserious poetic diction at times and wefind him referring to the presence of water in the FinkeRiver as the stream purling over its stony floor orquoting some bygone poet brightly the brook throughthe green leaflets giddy with joyousness dancesalong  Perhaps present water called for some stylisticcelebration  Two hundred pages further on there is lessexuberance in the circumlocution that fluid so terriblyscarce in the region and in three other referenceswater is simply water   Giles is not always waxing poeticand may like other explorers be useful as a sourcefor the history of Australian and general English  Hisuse of the word tank to refer to a hollowedout reservoirGibson dug a small tank and the water sooncleared antedates the OED  for instance            Since this linguisticstatistical study of an obsessionmight well prove to be an important contributionto psycholinguistics I decided to make a larger sampleof watery words choosing the straightforward journalsof Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton who led an expeditionacross the western interior of Australia in  In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages of the published journal there were twentyeightoccurrences of the word water eight of them incompounds no page being without at least one exampleIn addition there was a rich collection of wordsrelating to water not necessarily indicating its presenceHoping to find a lake is included though ofcourse it doesnt indicate the presence of water  Evenwords which are usually of more general reference arebrought into relation with water in a text like thisGumtrees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs ofpossible water  Apart from these words and lake words and phrases directly associated with thoughts ofwater and reinforcing the sense of obsession includepool springs drainage hole clay hole flood channelwatercourses waterhole rockhole drink drinkablerunning water stream  and native well             The last two items merit comment  Stream is oftensaid not to be used in Australia except in metaphoricalways normally being replaced by creek Warburtons use sandbanks intercept the streamwhich finally splits into narow watercourses andspreads itself over the plains and so it ends as a creeksuggests a somewhat more complex relation betweenthe two words  Britishborn explorers did not set out towrite Australian English of course  Gregory usesstream in the way normal in England Giles consistentlyrefers to gens in the hills of central Australiathough glen is not current outside placenames incontemporary Australian English            The other name native well is as a later explorerDavid Carnegie author of Spinifex and Sand points out a misnomer  He believes native wells areessentially rockholes depressions in rock buried infairly shallow sand which when hollowed out by thenatives appear to be wells  This sort of misnomerleads Carnegie to suppose that to the uninitiated nomap is so misleading as that of West Australia wherelakes are saltbogs without surface water springs seldomrun and native wells are merely tiny holes in therock yielding from  to  gallons            Carnegie also describes nammaholes and soaks assources of water  Soaks are shallow wells sunk near thebase of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoirNammaholes have been variously described to Carnegiethey are depressions on the surface of rocks oftenwith a rounded bottom where stones are often foundsuggesting that the stones have something to do withthe formation of the holes            Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the lossin our speech of English country words the glens andstreams alive anyway in the journals of explorerscoppices and brooks woods becks  and rivulets   Perhapsthese words did not really fit  We might havedone better with Arabicspeaking settlers  Wadi  forinstance would describe an inland creek rather wellBe that as it may a

bookrecently published in Britain that is typical of theharsher brand of such works  The work in questionoffers nothing regarding language so its review here isancillary to the main function of VERBATIM  The feministmovement is very much alive in Britain and theGreenham Common Women are probably largelyresponsible for much of the national sentiment againstthe Cruise missiles installed at an American base nearthat village  In Britain as elsewhere most books byfeminist writers are reviewed by women usually feministsMen are seldom assigned to review them possiblybecause the editor fears that they will be eitherignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if notbiased against them or because the editor is a womanBecause writing an unfavorable review of a bad feministbook would be tantamount to treachery suchbooks are often unjustifiably praised as was the casewith this work by Rosalind Miles which was well receivedon its publication in June            According to the blurb on the dust jacket of thisdistinctly unpleasant book Rosalind Miles is head ofthe Centre for Womens Studies at Coventry Polytechnica lecturer broadcaster journalist and author ofseveral other books including a highly acclaimedbiography of Ben Jonson  One might like to believethat this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarshipbut the text does not bear out the promise            For the most part the book consists of a rewritingof history from the dawn of time with the purpose ofdemonstrating two main themes the fact thatwomen were responsible for all the important contributionsto the advancement of civilization as the developmentof agriculture for instance often despitethe arrogance and stupidity of men and the factthat women have long been subjected to dominationby men  Miles suggests that such domination is a recentphenomenononly a couple of thousand yearsoldfor she points to the clear superiority of womenin primitive religions and matriarchies right onthrough to the Egyptian dynastic rulers  At one pointshe gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggeststhat females were responsible not only for all ofhuman evolutionary biology but for the very notion ofcounting in order to keep track of menstruation andprobably by the same token astronomy  She quotesand presumably accepts another source which holdsthat woman first awakened in humankind the capacityto recognize abstracts  If you believe that balderdashyoull believe anything            In the good old days we were taught that thepyramids were built by tens of thousands of slavesRecent speculation has it that they were not slavesbutwhat would one call them  ordinary laborersHere comes Miles authoritatively quoting Diodorusthe Greek historian who recorded BC that innocentwomen even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaveswhose forced labour built the pyramids bound in fetters they work continuallywithout being allowed any rest by night or dayThey have not a rag to cover their nakedness andneither the weakness of age nor womens infirmitiesare any plea to excuse them but they are driven byblows until they drop dead  p                        As the pyramids were already about  years oldwhen Diodorus wrote his World History  one is givento wonder what his authority might have been for sucha vivid description  It is even less comprehensible howa modern researcher could accept it and have the effronteryto promulgate it  Miless book is riddled withmany similar distortions convenient omissions andgeneralizations Women have always commanded over halfthe sum total of human intelligence and creativityFrom the poet Sappho who in the sixth century BCwas the first to use the lyric to write subjectivelyand explore the range of female experience to theChinese polymath Pan Chao Ban Zhao whoflourished around AD  as historian poet astronomermathematician and educationalist the rangeis startling  In every field women too numerous tolist were involved in developing knowledge andcontributing to the welfare of their societies as theydid so the Roman Fabiola established a hospitalwhere she worked both as nurse and doctor becomingthe first known woman surgeon before shedied in AD   p                        Earlier on page  we learnt about Agnodice wholived to become the worlds first known woman gynaecologistin the fourth century BC  Clearly this rosilycheckered past was soon to be replaced chiefly itseems as JudeoChristianIslamicConfucianBuddhistcultures flourished  It was not too bad early onwhen according to Miles the seven Maccabean martyrswho saved Judaism did so only at the instigationof their mother  Miles continuesIn early Christianity likewise women found notmerely a role but an instrument of resistance tomale domination in choosing to be a bride ofChrist they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser malefry  Thousands of young women helped to buildthe church of God with their body blood andbones when frenzied fathers husbands or fiancspreferred to see them die by fire sword or thefangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout sicthe duty and destiny of womanhood  p                        But the situation soon deterioratedEven St Paul later the unregenerate prophet offemale inferiority was forced to acknowledge thehelp he received from Lydia the seller of purpledyes in Philippi  ibid                        This rewriting of history is punctuated by an arrayof fourletter invectives applied to males and byadjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring  and soforth to women  Citing a Judaic lawbook of the thcentury which identified a woman for the days precedingduring and following her period as niddahimpure Miles has the lack of taste to write the followingAs a final stroke in a grim foreshadowing ofwhat the future held in store for the Jews the niddahhad to wear special clothing as a badge of herseparate and despised status  p                        Here and there in this morass of misunderstandingMiles treads on solid ground if one can agree withthe eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell  Campbellknown for his extensive analyses of the worldsmythologies religions and cultures noted the markedbias against women emerging from Judaic conceptslater reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrineMost of the religions of the world connected womanwith mother earth fertility and all the otherprogenetic and nurturing associations and this wasborne out in the cultures of the people  According toCampbell the only godlike female figure in the Bibleis the Virgin Mary and she appears identified as virginonly in the Gospel according to Luke  As Luke wasa Greek Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryoverfrom the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheonAlthough this might help explain the JudeoChristianMuslimtendencies to subjugate womentreating them essentially as chattel it does not accountfor a similar treatment accorded them in other culturesnotably that of Japan  It is not entirely clearwhether Campbell was commenting on HinduismBuddhism etc as they once existed conceptually forit is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatmentof women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adheringto those religous precepts            Campbell held that the ancient mythologies andreligions are allegorical and that there was no realdistinction between gods and goddesses who weregiven sexual identity when in human form only tomake them more meaningful  With all respect thatseems a highly debatable issue and one far too complexfor this discussion though we can certainly trace adiminution in the role of female divinities or divinitywhen we come to examine Judaism and its congenersand progeny  Other debatable aspects are the questionsof whether the debasement of women is a reflection ofthe theology or the ritual whether the scripture of anyreligion should be understood allegorically or literallyand so forth  If there is something wrong it behoovesus to get at the roots of the problem not to flail aboutwildly for only after the source of a disease has beenidentified can one properly investigate its cure            History according to Rosalind Miles blasts awayat the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviatingthem will effect a cure of the disease  In thisjeremiad males are viewed as the enemy and are socharacterized throughout the book which concludeswith exhortations to engage the foe and a strident callto arms though not mens            Laurence Urdang                              Archaeology  Language            A VERBATIM Book Club Selection            Just when you thought it was safe to assume thatwe now know all we are ever likely to know about thepast someone digs another hole and unearths literallyor figuratively some ancient artifact one day it is afragile scroll found in a cave near the Dead Sea thatturns out to be preBiblical the next day it is an entireterracotta army of Chinese soldiers the next it is askull excavated from the Olduvai Gorge that compelsanthropologists once again to revise their guessesabout the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vshominids  Most of the relies from the past are goneforever destroyed by the plows of countless generationsof farmers reduced to rubble by erosion by conquerorsby prehistoric and modern urban developers byfire and flood and just by time  Many we may hopehave not yet been found  The interest in mans forebearsdid not become fashionable upon the publicationa few years ago of Roots  on a far larger scalewe have been trying to discover all we can about theorigins not of men but of man  Strange to say howeverthat interest does not seem to be more than a fewhundred years old if the ancient Greeks and Romansthe Indians the Chinese and other peoples were curiousabout their own prehistory I have not heard of itPerhaps the fascination with mans past grew out ofthe obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism certainlymodern archaeology seems to have followedclose behind for the excavation of the supposed site ofTroy took place only about  years ago  Perhaps it isjust as well for only by the means available to modernscience are we now able to preserve some of the artifactsthat we find and through radiocarbon datingdetermine their approximate age            Archaeology is a popular pursuit and its manifestresults not only receive considerable publicity but canbe seen in museums  Not so paleolinguistics or thereconstruction of ancient languages  Even the remnantswe have from early languages that had a writingsystem are relatively sparse Classical Latin andGreek Hebrew and a few other languages are betterdocumented than others but for most all we have to goon are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptionsthere barely enough in many cases to allow us toidentify the language let alone draw any conclusionsregarding its structure or meaning  Perhaps one daywe shall find an Etruscan library buried deep in theItalian countryside but for the present we have tomake do with what we have which is precious littleAbout languages that had no writing system we knownothing at all  But some very clever comparative linguistsbeginning in Germany in the th century theorizedabout how the nature of the ancestors of themore modern tongues  In some instances ancient languageshave been decoded some from multilingualinscriptions  The work of Jean Francois Champollion in deciphering hieroglyphics from the RosettaStone was an astonishing accomplishment for itenabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancientEgyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions andrevealed an enormous amount of the knowledge wehave today about their civilization which lasted forabout  years  Another significant breakthroughwas that of Michael Ventris  who decipheredthe Linear B script found on Crete and identifiedit as an early form of Greek  From the standpointof language Ventriss work was more important particularlybecause it filled in a gap in our knowledge ofthe early states of IndoEuropean languages            Many years ago a linguistic scholar counted all ofthe languages then spoken of which he had evidenceThe total was approximately  but that is probablyonly a vague estimate he undoubtedly missedsome some have sprung up since his time modernHebrew for instance and some have vanished  Theexact count is unimportant and at best spurious forit is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria forwhat distinguishes dialect from language  Then tooone must examine the techniques used to group themany languages of the world            Linguists examining Classical Greek Latin GermanEnglish Slavic Swedish Norwegian DanishDutch Lithuanian Iranian Hindi and the other languagesof India and Europe found that there werecorrespondences among many of the common wordsSome like French Spanish Italian and Portuguesehad more in common with one another than they didwith say German English Swedish Danish andDutch which in turn bore only a remote resemblanceto Russian and Polish on the one hand and thetwo extant varieties of say Gaelic on the other  Onerapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingersand toes for after years of laboriously categorizingthese languages the number of different mainbranches called families and subfamilies came toabout ten  Ingeniously certain differences betweenfamilies were explained by various phonetic shifts thatinexplicably took place in one language group butnot in another  Although certain other languages weregeographically nearby it was impossible to establishany resemblances between them hence Basque forexample is not classified as being in the same familywith other European languages nor are Hungarianand Finnish both of which belong to their own groupAt the conclusion of this vast exercise done withoutthe aid of computers there emerged a pattern of familialrelationships that linked together languages spokenin earlier times from Britain as far east as ChineseTurkestan and from India as far north asLappland  Charts showing the chief languages andtheir derivations can be found in many dictionariesinsidethe front cover of The Random House Unabridged for example  Because linguists are constantlylearning more and more about the relationshipsamong languages it is best to avoid using an olderchart for the same reason it would be wise not tostake too much on the accuracy of even a currentchart            The languages discussed here are what are usuallycalled the IndoEuropean family similar family treescould be drawn for the Semitic languages SinoTibetanJapanese Bantu MalayoPolynesian and so onEach is a distinct phylum although there may bewordborrowing among them lexicon is consideredless important in the classification of languages thanstructure and grammar  It is important too to notethat writing systems are irrelevant for instance Polishis written today using the Roman alphabet but Russiana related Slavic language uses the Cyrillic Yiddisha Germanic language is written in Hebrew charactersLatin Greek and Sanskrit which resembleone another rather closely in some respects all usedifferent alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizableto untrained readers of modern languageswere written in cuneiform quite suitable for writingon soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics            It would be nice to think that while linguists wereworking so hard to organize languages they wereworking alongside the archaeologists who were providingthe raw materials  But only rarely did they collaborateand with few exceptions their work was notcorrelated in a systematic way  Schliemann who discoveredthe site of Troy used the evidence in HomersIliad to determine his digging site where any ruinshad long since disappeared from view  In many otherplaces the ancient sites lay buriedand stilldobeneath modern cities modern property ownersquite understandably take a dim view of tearing downtheir buildings on the off chance that the remnants ofan ancient town will be found several yards belowtoday before a new building is erected in London anarchaeological team examines the cleared site for itsarchaeological significance  But there as everywhereelse nothing can interfere with progress and regardlessof the finds and their importance the archaeologistmust eventually yield to the bulldozer  Notwithstandingeven the brief glimpses afforded by suchinvestigations can provide some insight into civilizationsthat existed hundreds or in some cases thousandsof years earlier            Based on the sparse evidence available linguiststheorized about the earlier languages that had givenrise to those attested  In other words based on whatthey knew about a group of languages which weredocumented they tried to imagine the language thatthey sprang from  In most cases they dealt with wordsand functional elements creating what are called reconstructionsin hypothetical family prototypes calledvariously ProtoLatin ProtoGreek ProtoGermanicProtoIndoIranian and so forth the ultimate goalbeing to posit a single language called ProtoIndoEuropeanThat is not entirely true for linguists knowtoo much about language to suggest that there everwas literally a single language from which all IndoEuropeanlanguages descended  Nonetheless it is convenientto think about the existence of a group ofprotodialects which can be referred to as ProtoIndoEuropean            It seems only natural that once an original languageor Ursprache  was posited the next step was tospeculate on its source or Urheimat   That is whatRenfrew has tried to do  Essentially he proposes thatthe parent of all IndoEuropean languages was itselfborn in central Anatolia whence it spread eastwardwestward and northward being modified by the influencesof the languages with which it came into contacttill it ultimately emerged in its recognizablemodern manifestations which we categorize into GermanicHellenic Italic IndoIranian Anatolian ArmenianCeltic Tocharian Albanian and BaltoSlavic            I have no quarrel with Renfrews theorynotwithstandingthe generally received wisdom that hasplaced the homeland north of the Black Sea regionand the Volga steppes  It is difficult for the nonspecialistreader like me to assess the validity of his argumentswhich are based on his contention that thelanguage and its congeners were carried along by thespread of nomad pastoralism  Using the evidence availableRenfrew contends that the original IndoEuropeanlanguage closely related to Hittite separatedafter  BC with the IE languages of western Europedeveloping from western Anatolia and those ofIran India and Pakistan from the eastern divisionThe choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrewsdepends on whether one accepts a wave theoryfirst promulgated more than a hundred years agoby Johnanes Schmidt a German linguist or one ofindigenous development  Pottery finds can be interpretedto support either the imposition of an elite culturefrom Turkmenia or a late development of theIndus civilization  Renfrew accepts the wave theoryand in the last two thirds of Archaeology  Languagehe sets forth his arguments in its favor  Unfortunatelythe presentation of his linguistic argument where theauthor is clearly treading on more speculative groundthan in those parts dealing with outright archaeologywhere he is on more familiar territory is disorganizedand repetitious  It is difficult to place all the blame onRenfrew for his editor should have noticed the lack ofcoherence  The result is an argument that is persuasivebut scarely convincing            Nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilableby laymen are not easy to find and if the readercan tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concernedabout the precise birthplace of IndoEuropeanArchaelogy  Language provides an interesting marchthrough the millennia of prehistory in sevenleagueboots

works is this one uses the cursorto highlight a particular word for which synonyms aredesired  It is similar in principle to finding a synonymin a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonymsto find them  I am not sure why but I expectedthe program to network in the same way  Howeverwhen I highlighted antecedent  what appeared on thescreen was the same list of synonyms but with

aclever computer ploy but it does not provide a particularlyuseful synonym dictionary for as we all knowsynonymy in language does not yield to the commutativelaw of mathematics in language Things equal tothe same thing are not necessarily equal to eachother  Perhaps the Proximity people thought that theyhad got round that little problem by giving the samedefinition for each of the items in the list but we knowthat only very rarely are two synonyms biuniquewhich is another way of saying that if A  B B doesnot necessarily always equal A an ineluctable fact oflanguage            If a

everyone in the world must know by now WilliamSafire writes a column in The New York TimesMagazine called On Language  Considering the circulationof The New York Times on Sundays his columnis probably the most widely read commentary oncontemporary English in the world that places morethan one uncommon burden on a writer he must dohis utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjectslikely to be of interest to his readers and he mustwrite well            Those familiar with Safires editorial style reflectedin his political columns on the editorial pagesof The N Y Times  may agree with me in the contentionthat when he writes about language he seems tobe writing on his day off I cannot put my finger onwhy but On Language always strikes me as an excruciatingeffort to be cute  In part that is attributableto the designation of his correspondents whokeep him informed on language that is not withinearshot as the Lexicographic Irregulars an amusingreference the first time or two it was used

is the umpteenth collectionof Safires columns and like the previous collectionscontains a selection of letters from readers  It is thosethat are so sorely missed in his column  True there isan occasional mention in his column of a point raisedby a correspondent and the Letters section of theMagazine prints a comment from time to time but animportant feature of the books is their inclusion of farmore writerreader interaction than one might suspectfrom reading the column alone  For one thing theletterwriters call attention to errors or misinterpretationsand are largely critical  Safire cannot be accusedof being copyproud except evidently of awful punsas in  Ms is deliberately msterious  but at least it isnot deliberately msleading  and other mscegenations            There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of themost influential writers on contemporary English andit is essential that his books be in the libraries of allwho are interested in the subject regardless of theiralignment with his opinions  For one thing he documentsmany neologisms an activity that endears himto many working lexicographers  From the sometimescavalier manner in which he treats his subject onewonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibilityhe has toward his readers            The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs fromwhich this review was prepared unfortunately therewas no

to knowhow to sort out the many topics to be covered in ausage book most reasonable writers have taken a stabat writing an entry under a heading that seems a likelyplace to look then have provided a detailed index  NotBernice Randall  True one can find different from etc in an entry so headed but for absolute constructionsone is referred to an entry called Covered withonions relish and ketchup I

search for only would be futile            Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage needsome lightening up but I am hard put to agree thatthey are quite as frivolous and lightheaded as thisbook would have us believe  Fun is fun but those whomight rely on such a book are quite serious about theinformation they are seeking and it is unfair to playfast and loose with their sincerity  A sense of humorabout a subject is born of a feeling of security about itbut security is the one characteristic often lackingamong those who would use Current American Usage             There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her workBut of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms  And ofwhat use are the interminable examples for instanceof the misuse of like for as  which draw out the entryto three pages  More than four pages are devoted toclichs under the guise of Lo and behold its mansbest friend which being an exclamation reallyought to end in an exclamation point  The article onBritishAmerican English Theres no home like EatonPlace is a good one but at six pages its utility isquestionable  In the matter of pronunciations ofBrEng names it is an oldfashioned fantasy of Americansthat Brits go

real faults are its title which belies the contentthe cutesy headings and the lack of a truly detailedindex selfindexing does not provide coverage ofsufficient detail  As a reference work on usage it

             Loose Cannons  Red Herrings            Readers should be familiar with Robert Claibornesearlier books especially Our Marvelous NativeTongue The Life and Times of the English Language One might say that subtitling the present book ABook of Lost Metaphors is an example of a loosecanon sic  unless metaphor is taken in its broadestsensebut one is unlikely to find red herrings here theetymologies of a few hundred words and phrases aregiven many not readily findable in standard works ofreference  The rationale behind referring to them aslost arises from the authors observation of an unfortunatestate of affairs because of an increasingly widespreadlack of familiarity with the basic structuralelements of our cultureGreek and Roman mythologythe Bible literature and ordinary historicalfactpeople today are unable to discern the origins ofterms like aphrodisiac Achilles sic heel or tendonmeet ones Waterloo sow dragons teeth  and handwritingon the wall  to name a few  There are many ofcourse but unaccountably they are not the focus ofthis book            Claiborne investigates and reports on expressionslike sow ones wild oats  about which he tells us littleor nothing the modern Latinate designation Avenafatua came too many centuries after the original expressionto have any relevance to it so why bring upthe information that fatua is Latin for foolish it wasalso Latin for wild which might be more to thepoint  In any event it is hard to discern from the archstyle affected in an attempt to make dull facts interestingjust what is the origin of sow ones wild oats   Inmany entries Claiborne labors the obvious offeringlittle or nothing we do not already know could easilyimagine or for which the author offers no explanationAmong examples of the first are spit and polishon the spot on the square stick ones neck out  etcExamples of the last include spill the beans square thecircle stalemate  etc  Between these is an occasionalflash of useful wisdom much of it pretty well coveredby other books of this type which seem to be proliferating            What is missing for example at square the circle is the information that because the area of a circle ismathematically calculated using pi  which is irrationalthere is no mathematical way of calculating thedimensions of a square with the same area as that of agiven circle  But that does not mean that such a squarecannot exist  As for stalemate  which is related tocheckmate  would it not have been important to indicatethat the  mate part has nothing to do with Englishhaving been borrowed from checkmate which is aloanword from Persian and has nothing to do withcheck  either            Often an entry offers nothing in the way of etymologyand merely explains the meaning  Does anyreader need

of the dialects of a languageand their distribution  The field is about  years oldMost prominent among its earliest practitioners inEngland was Joseph Wright who prepared the sixvolumeEnglish Dialect Dictionary  which was publishedbetween  and  the bestknown contemporaryBritish specialist is Harold Orton  In Americawork proceeded space during the s largely underthe direction of Raven McDavid Hans Kurath andlater Harold Allen more recently Lee Pedersen andothers have investigated American English dialectsBetween  and  fieldworkers based at the Universityof Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialectswhich studied  localities in England whichas everyone ought to know does not include Wales orScotland  The present book is extracted from the twomajor works that resulted from the Survey The LinguisticAtlas of England  and A Word Geographyof England  both under the direction of HaroldOrton aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the lattereffort            People generally seem to find

southern England and of bairn north of aslightly wavy line between Boston on the Wash to theeast and Lancaster on the west coast            The authors have provided a brief introductionwhich is easy to follow a list of suggested readingsand the names and addresses of the several institutionsand societies in Britain where readers may indulge amore intensive interest in dialect study  The maps areclear each occupying a full page and the word informationis well set forth on them  Where necessarybrief but not cryptic explanations are provided of anyinformation that might seem to be out of the ordinaryI have only one nit to pick with the authors  In theirdescription of isoglosses  they writeThese are drawn to run midway betweenlocalities which were shown by the Survey ofEnglish Dialects to use the different words orpronunciations which are the subject of the map                        Although it is true that isoglosses in effect set off thevarious areas where a particular usage was recordedmore accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect siteseither where speakers employ both usages or wherespeakers using one or the other live in very close proximityHence the term isogloss  from iso  same  glossword to describe the line on a map where the termsare of equal distribution  Isoglosses are to dialect mapswhat isobars and isotherms are to weather maps whatisobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans etcThe authors are not alone in getting this wrong it isincorrect in some dictionaries            In those countries where dialect study is undertakendialectologists observe that there are todaymany factors militating against the strict maintenanceof older dialect boundaries the standardization of terminologyas adopted by national periodicals newsservices radio and television the establishment ofprestige dialects and through the media theirpromulgation and the huge population shifts thathave taken place particularly in the US since WWIISuch shifts have been somewhat slower in Englandbut seem now to be speeding up  There are manyother lesser factors at work but taken together alltend toward standardization especially as the olderspeakers die off  In some respects it may not be longbefore certain aspects of dialect geography will belargely historical  The importance of dialect is emphasizedregularly in the press where we read about peoplebeing killed as in parts of India because they usethe wrong shibboleths            This book is a good introduction to the subject inEngland those familiar with dialectology inAmerica and those interested in the study in Englandor indeed generally would be well advised to addWord Maps to their libraries            Laurence Urdang                              American Literary Almanac            This is an

book is styledan almanac but that is unimportant there is noother book I know of that contains as much diverseinformation about American writers as this one  Itsreadability and organization make it suitable forbrowsingeven for reading straight throughso inthat respect at least it does not resemble books in theOxford Companion series  It contains many photographsof writers some quite early these
