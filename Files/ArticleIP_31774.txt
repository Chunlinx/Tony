                                  A Philistines Guide to Italy            I just got back from honeymooning in Italy BeforeI went there I was a philistine Now Im a philistine whos been to Italy Idid learn a few things Chiefly I learned that Italian guidebooks are designedfor people who are interested in broadening themselves Heres a guide for therest of us                           Art In the country the bigattraction is villas which charge you a few thousand lire to admire theirgardens and sculptures The gardens are half patio and half golf course Somesculptures depict the Count of SoandSo who used to own the villa Othersmemorialize his bad taste In cities most of the art is in museums and bigchurches called duomi  The ceilings of the duomi arespectacular So are the floors My wife suggested that we model our bathroomfloor after one of them The floors are checkered with marble slabscommemorating rich people The more money you give to the church the biggeryour slab and the better your location Basically it works like theRepublican National Committee                           Religion Most of the art in museums is religious The bigtheme is Jesus There are four kinds of Jesuses Baby Jesus Spurting JesusFloating Jesus and PropellerHead Jesus Baby Jesus sits in Marys lap He hasadult features and expressions wholly inappropriate to an infant In somepaintings he looks like Joe Pesci in others Don Rickles in othersChristopher Walken The Uffizi Gallery in Florence has a Baby Jesus thats adead ringer for Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz Occasionally Baby Jesussuckles at Marys breast Evidently the artists who painted Mary had never seena naked woman Her breast starts around the collarbone and takes off like atorpedo            Spurting Jesus hangs on the cross and spouts blood from agash in his chest Lots and lots and lots of blood In the Dormitory of SanMarco in Florence theres a whole row of monks cells each of which has aSpurting Jesus on the wall The monks were supposed to meditate on thesepaintings all day This cant have been helpful Maybe they meditated onwhether the Jesusonthecross had a penis He seems to have had one when hewas a baby but now bits of fabric are conveniently placed to obscure it            Floating Jesus is myfavorite He wears a white robe and hovers over the thieves who have just dugup his grave With one hand he makes Mr Spocks live long and prosper signWith the other he carries the flag of some Scandinavian country            PropellerHead Jesus has a halo with a red cross in it thatlooks like a propeller This is the easiest way to identify Jesus Lots of guysin these paintings look like Jesus and they all have halos Sometimes oneguys halo blocks your view of the guy behind him My wife and I spent severalminutes discussing a huge mural of the Last Supper before we realized that theguy we thought was Jesus was really Judas Very embarrassing We should havelooked for the propeller What its supposed to convey I dont know What itconveys to me is Hey Over here This ones Jesus            I dont mean to bedisrespectful to religion I loved the duomi and the little shrinesnestled into odd corners of the hill towns But lets face it much ofChristian history is bloody awful In San Gimignano theres a whole torturemuseum specializing in instruments of the Inquisition The skull crusher andrectal pear are particularly memorable The museum charges twice theadmission fee that other museums charge and people pay it because basicallywe love cruelty The museum pretends to teach the lessons of mans inhumanityto manespecially mans inhumanity to womanand visitors make the appropriatenoises of disgust as they study each device But the truth is werefascinated One exhibit presents the electric chair as a testament to Americanbrutality I suppose I am a brute On the train to Venice packed into acompartment with several nice old Italian ladies I peered out the window atthe sky stretching toward Yugoslavia and pronounced it excellent bombingweather Charming my wife replied coldly as she shrank into her seat            D riving If you take the scenic backroads dont expect to notice the scenery Youll spend the whole trip withyour eyes glued to the road and occasionally your rearview mirror in which acaravan of Italian drivers will be tailgating you Youre too terrified tospeed up because the road is narrow and winds sharply around hillsides Theycant pass you for the same reason My advice is to take the bus The bus wetook along Lake Como to Bellagio careened around dozens of bends any of whichcould have plunged us hundreds of feet into the lake At first I thought thedrivers we passed on that road were nuts Then I saw the bikers They woreracing gear and refused to get out of our way                           CarsAmericans build wide roads and new cities to fit big cars Italians buildlittle cars to fit old cities and narrow roads In Siena the locals driveminiature threewheeled vans pickup trucks and even dump trucks designed tonavigate the citys tiny medieval passageways Thanks to the proprietress ofour hotel who climbed into the passenger seat and issued directions Imaneuvered our Fiat Punto through a footwide stone maze up and down aseries of alleys at harrowing right angles past scaffolding and cafe tablesto the parking lot            L anguage In preparation for our trip Ispent months studying Italian soccer on television I mastered the wordsportiere  goalkeeper colpo di testa  header andquattro minuti di ricupero  four minutes of injury time Italian isbetterknown as the language of lovers of course which is one reason whypeople honeymoon there The other reason is that the words husband and wifeare easier to practice in a foreign language            Less than a week into our marriage we were touringLake Como on a ferry when we cruised past a wedding party The captain tootedhis horn and called out over a megaphone Vivano gli sposi  Long livethe bride and groom Everyone smiled and sighed The scene was perfectlyscripted for a honeymoon What wasnt scripted for a honeymoon was our phrasebook which included translations for Is your wifehusband here Id likeyou to use a condom and You cant stay here tonight Part of the problem isthat Italian makes everything sound like a sex act Menaggio Dongo LemnaCadenabbia Faggeto Bellagio And those are just the towns along LakeComo                           Pigeons Italian piazzas are full of pigeons I hate pigeonsTheyre slow stupid ugly and rude Not only do the Italians feed them theysell bags of birdseed to tourists who in turn feed the pigeons Naturally thepigeons hang out in the piazzas all day cooing and crapping and waiting to befed Welfare for flying rats I was delighted to discover skyward prongs in theledges of the Basilico San Marco in Venice designed to prevent pigeons fromalighting there I also watched a boy in Lucca try to run over pigeons with hisbike My only regret is that I passed up a chance to order roasted pigeon inFlorence            T ourists The affinity between pigeons andtourists makes sense The tourists too are slow stupid ugly and rude Theyset off flash bulbs in churches They thrust their fingers within an inch ortwo of priceless paintings pointing out the obvious Years ago the touriststook snapshots Now they make videotapes They videotape anything that movesand much that doesnt In San Gimignano I watched a man painstakinglyvideotape a door In Venice I watched tourists on a bridge videotape touristson a boat who in turn were videotaping the tourists on the bridge                           GermansItaly is one of their favorite travel spots Somehow this makes meuncomfortable German travel particularly in Europe has never been good newsEveryone has their ethnic hangup I suppose this is mine I dont know whyMaybe its that Holocaust thing Not that I hold it against all Germans Infact the hotel we stayed at in Bellagio was run by a nice German familyLovely people And I was becoming quite comfortable with the whole Germanatmosphere reallyright up until the Lufthansa flight attendant showed me howto place the mask securely over my nose and mouth and breathe deeply            F ood The best advice I got before thetrip was from my colleague Jacob Weisberg who said Order the beans If thewaiter asks whether you want gas or no gas hes referring not to the beans butto the water which comes with or without bubbles The only bad food in Tuscanyis the bread which provides all the blandness of matzot without the moralsatisfaction The ice cream varies In San Gimignano its outstanding InLucca its a ripoff In Venice every vendor sells the same bad ice creamevidently at the behest of a conglomerate whose boats we saw unloading theirsinister cargo at various docks In case you get homesick Venice now has fourMcDonalds with menus tastefully adapted for Italian sensibilities AMcChicken is called a McChicken A FiletoFish is called a FiletoFish                           Cell phones In Venice we saw aman in a green suit and sunglasses prancing around a storefront gesticulatingwildly and apparently arguing with himself Eventually we figured out that hewas talking to a tiny phone in his ear People go out to eat with friends andspend the whole time yapping with somebody else on the phone In Siena a manand woman dined at the outdoor table next to ours They both wore weddingrings The man had brought his dog along His phone rang and he spent the restof the meal in what sounded like a playful conversation with a child The womanjust went on eating It doesnt add up If the guy wanted to talk to his kidwhy did he leave the kid at home If the kid was at home why was the dog atthe restaurant If the woman was the guys wife why was he ignoring her Ifshe wasnt his wife why were they wearing rings If she was the kids mom whydidnt the guy hand her the phone I dont get it But then being a philistineis all about not getting itand never having to say youre sorry
