                                 Tax the Knickers Off Your Grandchildren            As of this writing BillGates estimated net worth is  billion On the conservative assumption thathes earning  percent after taxes and inflation his investment income isabout  million a day            Its difficult for one toeven imagine what it would be like to have that kind of pure income But itwont be as difficult for your grandchildren If US per capita income managesto grow in real terms at a plausible  percent per year then in just years the average American family of four will enjoy a daily income of million And those are not some future ravagedbyinflation dollarsImmeasuring everything in the dollars of             More remarkably if theUnited States could achieve the growth rates that have been reported by SouthKorea in the past couple of decades it would take only about  years untilthe average familys income approaches  million per day If the United Statesgrows like South Korea your childrens grandchildren can live like BillGatesunless they rise above mediocrity and live even better            So each time the Sierra Clubimpedes economic development to preserve some specimen of natural beauty it isasking people who live like you and me the relatively poor to sacrifice forthe enjoyment of future generations that will live like Bill Gates            Taking from the poor andgiving to the rich is the opposite of income redistribution as it is usuallypracticed If we were consistent wed insist that those wealthy futuregenerations owed us something not the other way around If some moralprinciple allows the tax collector to confiscate  percent of Gates incomethat same moral principle should allow the unemployed lumberjacks of Oregon toconfiscate your rich grandchildrens view of the giant redwoods            I amaccepting for the sake of argument the Sierra Clubs presumption that it canaccurately foresee what our descendants will value But its worth mentioning aseparate reason to be skeptical of the conservationist agenda For all we knowthose descendants might prefer inheriting the proceeds of economic developmentto inheriting the redwoods                           The conservationists are not alone intheir pathological concern for future generations The same impulse haslaunched an epidemic of hysteria over federal deficits The national debt is tothe s what the nuclear freeze was to the s Its the one issue you dontreally have to understand before you can start feeling morally superior to yourneighbors From that point of view its even better than the nuclearfreezenot only does your expression of deep concern put you on the moral highground but you actually get to stand on that ground and prescribe sufferingfor everybody else            Thus we have the ConcordCoalition types who are always whining that the national debt forces them tolive well at their grandchildrens expense I have news for them Nobodycan force you to live well at your grandchildrens expense If you think yourlifestyle is too extravagant spend less and bequeath the savings to yourgrandchildren            The arithmetic works If thegovernment cuts your taxes by  and sticks your grandchildren with thebillsay  with accumulated interestyou dont have to spend the You can put it in the bank where it will grow to  by the time yourgrandchildren withdraw it to pay their taxes            While it makes no sense toworry that you are living well at your grandchildrens expense youmight legitimately worry that someone else is living well at yourgrandchildrens expense Maybe your neighbor applies his  tax cut to buya car made of steel that could otherwise have been a girder in a factory thatmight have employed your grandchildren Economists disagree about how plausiblethat story is but we all agree that if youre out to protect yourgrandchildren from the national debt its basically the only story you have toworry about            If you are worried about thatstory it means one of two things Either  you believe that your neighbor hasno right to live well at your grandchildrens expense or  you believethat your neighbor has that right but youd prefer to prevent him fromexercising it In Case  I assume you have sufficiently little interest inmoral niceties that you wouldnt be reading a column like this one in the firstplace That leaves Case  But if you believe that your neighbor has no rightto live well at the expense of your fabulously wealthy grandchildren you mustalso believe that your neighbor has no right to live well at the expense ofBill Gates In other words if youre unhappy about the national debt youshould be doubly unhappy about the progressive income tax            The popular philosophy ofincome redistribution requires us to transfer income from the few highearners of today while the popular philosophies of conservation and fiscalresponsibility require us to transfer income to the many high earnersof tomorrow Those who embrace all these philosophies at onceBill Clintoncomes to mindhave about them at least a mild air of intellectualschizophrenia            For amore technical analysis of what we owe to future
