       Date Tue Jan            Judith Shulevitzs article EvolutionaryPsychologys AntiSemite is so outrageous a piece of yellow journalism that Iam surprised that a prominent magazine like                   Slate                would run itIt bears about as much semblance to what Ive written as a creationist tractattacking evolution bears to Darwins Origin of Species  It is sooutrageous one almost yearns for British laws on libel so that I could forceher to prove her claims such as that I am evolutionary psychologysantiSemite or that my ideas about Jews represent the broadest ugliest andmost vicious antiSemitism passing for scholarship in this country today Someof her statements are simply overly general others simply false while othersare incomplete or take my thoughts entirely out of context In generalShulevitz fails to even once indicate that I have adduced a great deal ofevidence for my claims and that I have developed a fairly elaborate theorybased on evolutionary biology and
