                                 Confessions of a Cybershaman            The dramatic growth of theInternet has people extrapolating wildly Every day we see something new andamazing Surely given what we have seen so far the future is bright Dontbelieve me Need more details Just ask your resident visionary            Predicting the future oftechnology has gone from a minor sideline of the scientists and engineersactively building that future to a discipline of its own No technology companyworth its salt lacks a fulltime visionary on staff And every marketer andspinmeister must be a junior visionary The higherplaced your visionary themore visionary your company will seemso by all means promote one to vicepresident Even so make sure the CEO does the vision thing as well            Visionary has even become a profession As Hunter S Thompson once wroteWhen the going gets weird the weird turn pro Their business cards dont havevisionary on them but these people are not hard to spot They may befellows at some impressivesounding institute youve never heard of beforeOr they might write a magazine column and have recently published abestselling book If you need more vision than that you can subscribe to theirnewsletters attend their elite annual conferences of industry big shots orinvite them to speak or consult for astronomical fees            Being a visionary is a new profession but it is reallyjust a variant on fortunetelling which may be the worlds oldest And itsmarketing appeal is similarpeople will pay for reassurance about the unknownThe fortunetellers of old had many techniques Yet the crystal balls and tealeaves are just apparatus All fortunetelling in fact rests on threepillars            First you must tell peoplemore or less what you think they want to hear Second you must spice yourpredictions with drama Nobody wants a prediction that the future will be moreor less like the present even if that is statistically speaking an excellentprediction Predictions must involve either acquiring or losing love wealthor life itselfideally a combination of all three            Thirdyour predictions must somehow avoid measurement of their accuracy Many trickshave been invented to serve this end Predictions can be vague for example orcouched in complicated gibberish Either way there is a loophole Andcustomers generally dont mind Seeking advice about the future is more aboutrelieving insecurity or anxiety than about achieving statistical accuracy            But being a fortuneteller is harder these daysChicken entrails arent enoughyou need to channel the spirit of anyearold warrior Or you become a technological visionary for theInternet The techniques of being an Internet visionary are just like those oflowertech fortunetellers through the ages A technological visionary must tellpeople what they want to hear because your companys stock wont rise if youspout an unpopular vision to analysts Big shots wont speak at your conferenceif you piss them off Internet visionaries also use standard soapopera themesA popular one life and deathnot of people but of companies or even betterentire industries Tell em that old media are going to die There seems tobe an infinite appetite for this despite precious little evidence If youhurry you can tell them that push will conquer all but that ones got aweek left at best Talk like an action heroso you seem tough and important And be bold It is better to predict dramaticthings that dont happen than boring things that do            Most ofall being a technological visionary is not about predicting what will actuallyhappen This astounded me when I first realized it and even now I am notreally comfortable with the thought Technology and engineering are all abouttesting hypotheses against realityarent they Yet there is no evidence thatthe public or the press holds any technological visionaries accountable Infact many latterday Internet fortunetellers dont even bother with vaguenessor complicated loopholes They just baldly spout predictions certain thatnobody will care if these predictions are true            Aconfession I have been accused of being a visionarymyself And in all candor I fit the profile What can I say in my defense Isay this The problem does not rest with us visionaries Sure there are a fewbad apples in every crate and a few legitimate deep thinkers who sometimes getcarried away But most visionaries are smart and honorable people who aresincerely interested in the future The problem is the need that drives peopleto visionaries in the first place            Technologyis driving our lives at a torrid pace That generates many concernsWill my company come through this richer or poorer Will my job be safe Whatdoes it all mean The technology that shapes the modern world is asincomprehensible to most people as the forces of nature were to a society ofhuntergatherers So we turn to technological visionaries as we once turned toshamans            This call to play fortuneteller is not easilyrefused A reporter from a major publication cornered me recently and saidNathan I only have a couple of minutes Quick what is your visionTwentyfifteen I riposted but only with my glasses on Ho ho But hedidnt want a joke Nor did he want a carefully constructed set of argumentsprojecting current trends or a wellreasoned strategy He wanted a soundbitesomething pithy to take out of context            What doesit matter that you have the whole truth if you cant understand it In thiscontext it is understandable that nobody really cares about a visionarystrack record If next weeks vision is exactly the opposite of this weeksdont hesitate to tell that one too Among modern occupations only cultleaders and TV weathermen rival the technological visionarys ability to retaincredibility despite all evidence to the contrary            There is an antidote to visionary disease We as a societyhave to learn more about the technology that is shaping our lives and becomemore comfortable with it Few people these days believe that evil spirits causeillness that the rain god causes rain or that electriclight bulbs aremystical We do not fear the forces of nature as much as our species once didbecause we understand those forces better Even if most people dont actuallyunderstand say where hurricanes come from there is widespread comfort withthe notion that some experts do At the same time there is widespreadappreciation that even weather experts have their limits which empowers peopleto treat experts as mortals rather than as gods            One day the technology thattoday creates a market for visionaries will be as mundane as light bulbsPeople who have grown up with that technology will be as comfortable with it aswe are with light bulbs today They will not be as dependent on cybershamansThere is a name for the people who will accomplish this daunting task and putcorporate visionaries like me out of business We call them children Buttheyll have their own fears about the future and somy last predictionthefuture of the fortunetelling industry is secure
