                    Background        Signal transduction is the primary means by which cells        coordinate their metabolic morphologic and genetic        responses to environmental cues such as growth factors        hormones nutrients osmolarity and other chemical and        tactile stimuli Traditionally the discovery of molecular        components of signaling networks in yeast and mammals has        relied upon the use of gene knockouts and epistasis        analysis Although these methods have been highly effective        in generating detailed descriptions of specific linear        signaling pathways our knowledge of complex signaling        networks and their interactions remains incomplete New        computational methods that capture molecular details from        highthroughput genomic data in an automated fashion are        desirable and can help direct the established techniques of        molecular biology and genetics        DNA microarray technology has evolved to the point where        one can simultaneously measure the transcript abundance of        thousands of genes under hundreds of conditions producing        hundreds of thousands of individual data points Similarly        highthroughput yeast twohybrid experiments have        identified thousands of pairwise proteinprotein        interactions Once a core pathway is established these        data can readily be integrated into model refinements as a        recent study in systems biology elegantly demonstrates            However synthesizing these data         de novo into models of pathways and        networks remains a significant challenge        How can one bridge the gap from transcript abundances        and proteinprotein interaction data to pathway models        Clustering expression data into groups of genes that share        profiles is a proven method for grouping functionally        related genes but does not order pathway components        according to physical or regulatory relationships Here we        present an automated approach for modelling signal        transduction networks in         S cerevisiae by integrating        proteinprotein interaction      and gene expression        data Our program NetSearch draws all possible linear        paths of a specified length through the interaction map        starting at any membrane protein and ending on any        DNAbinding protein Microarray expression data             is then used to rank all paths according to the degree of        similarity in the expression profiles of pathway members        Linear pathways that have common starting points and        endpoints and the highest ranks are then combined into the        final model of the branched networks        Our approach is calibrated using the yeast MAPK        mitogenactivated protein kinases pathways involved in        pheromone response filamentous growth and maintenance of        cell wall integrity Fig  These pathways are activated        by G proteincoupled receptors and characterized by a core        cascade of MAP kinases that activate each other through        sequential binding and phosphorylation reactions they are        among the most thoroughly studied networks in yeast and are        therefore excellent benchmarks against which to test our        approach                    Results                  Input data and parameters          Recent papers      have used the yeasttwohybrid          technique and literature surveys to identify and assemble          over  nonredundant proteinprotein interactions          among more than  proteins While twohybrid screens          efficiently identify fusion proteins that are able to          interact the biological significance of the interaction          for native proteins acting           in vivo generally requires          verification because the technique is susceptible to a          high rate of false positives     To assess the          possible contribution of falsepositive proteinprotein          interactions to the combined interaction dataset we          analyzed the connectivity of each protein and found that          a small fraction of proteins had a very high number of          interactions highlighted in red Fig  With these          highly connected proteins included in our data set          NetSearch generates  million candidate signaling          pathways of length seven or less  of which involve          one of these twentytwo highlyconnected proteins We          excluded the highly interacting proteins from the          interaction dataset based on their nonspecific inclusion          in the predicted pathways and evidence of their          susceptibility to systematic error This yielded an          interaction map that contains  interactions among           proteins an average of three interactions per          protein          Using the NetSearch algorithm this protein          interaction network was queried for paths up to length          eight that begin at membrane proteins and end at          transcription factors The search generated approximately           million candidate pathways of length eight or less          whose biological plausibility was assessed using gene          expression data          To score the pathways we first used a           k means algorithm to cluster all          yeast genes into clusters based on their expression          profiles NetSearch then assigned each pathway a          statistical score    according to the number of          pathway members that clustered together For example a          path with six members in one cluster would score higher          than a path that only had five members in that cluster          Cluster size influenced path scoring such that a path          that had three members from a cluster of  elements          would score higher than a path that had three members          from a cluster of  elements Also a path with four          elements in one cluster and three elements in a second          cluster would score higher than a path that had four          elements in cluster one but no more than two elements in          cluster two          Pathways were scored using NetSearchs sumprob          scoring metric Assuming N proteins total and a          partitioning of proteins into k clusters C             C            C           k  with N             N            N           k members respectively and a pathway          p of L proteins p            p             p           L  where c           p i  number of proteins in p in          cluster C           i  the sumprob score is computed as          follows                    prob           p i scores a pathway for a cluster C                    i such that pathways which are more          concentrated in C           i have higher scores The summation in          prob           p i computes the cumulative          hypergeometric probability of pathway p containing c           p i or more members of C           i  prob           p i assesses coclustering of          pathway members in the single cluster C           i  sumprobp the sum of prob           p i values over all clusters for          which c           p i   is a simple measure of          coclustering across the entire collection of available          clusters The rationale for the restriction c           p i   is that without it a          pathway could get a high score simply from having single          members in one or more rare clusters in which case the          score would no longer reflect           co clustering          The exact composition of paths discovered using          NetSearch depend on the parameters used in path drawing          and path scoring To ensure that NetSearch reproducibly          generates statistically significant biologically          plausible paths we combinatorially varied every          parameter value in the pathdrawing and pathscoring          algorithms and selected parameter combinations that          generate the most statistically significant pathways          Statistical significance was measured by drawing pathways          from membrane proteins to DNAbinding proteins through          the experimentally determined proteininteraction map          henceforth called real pathways and comparing these          pathways with pathways drawn through control interaction          maps that were created by randomizing all pairwise          interactions in the original dataset The randomization          procedure was performed three times and statistics were          calculated on the average output of these runs Paths          produced using these interaction maps are henceforth          referred to as random pathways We ultimately chose          parameters that maximized the number of highscoring          pathways produced with real interactions while          minimizing highscoring pathways from the randomized          interactions          The parameters we varied included the number of          clusters into which the genes were grouped the          microarray expression datasets used in clustering the          maximum path length and the scoring metric Expression          data were clustered into     and           clusters and NetSearch best discriminated between real          pathways and random pathways when genes were grouped into           clusters Three           S cerevisiae expression datasets          were examined individually including the Compendium          set composed of expression profiles in response to           diverse mutations and chemical treatments     the          MAPK set composed of  conditions chosen to probe the          behavior of MAPK signal transduction     and the          Cell Cycle set composed of  conditions relevant to          the cell cycle     Combinations of these datasets          were also examined for a total of five different sets          that allowed us to compare the utility of data that          probes specific biological processes such as MAPK          signaling or the cell cycle and that which probes the          state of the cell more broadly such as the Compendium          set and the combined sets The composite data set that          combined all three individual sets for a total of           conditions provided the best discrimination between real          pathways and random pathways although the other sets          performed comparably          The final input parameter that required evaluation was          the maximum path length allowable for NetSearch paths          While short path lengths risk omission of key path          members longer path lengths increase the likelihood of          including falsepositive interactions As a first step          towards determining the optimal maximum path length we          examined the path lengths connecting every possible pair          of the  proteins in the interaction dataset          regardless of subcellular localization The minimal path          length between any two proteins chosen at random contains          on average  members Secondly we examined the          fraction of pathways with high coclustering ratios for          various path lengths Consistent with our finding that          the average path length between any two proteins is           this fraction peaks at eight which we set as our          maximum unless otherwise noted                          NetSearch output          Using a maximum path length of eight and  gene          clusters from  conditions       NetSearch          generated  million pathways each for the real and          randomized protein interaction datasets From the          experimental real data  pathways had a          coclustering score   Fig  At this cutoff          randomized interaction data produced on average only           this number of pathways  pathways P               However we emphasize that NetSearch selects paths based          on their rank relative to all paths between selected          starting and endpoints The absolute score depends on the          particular expression data set used and varies from          network to network depending on the degree of          coregulation in the cell under the conditions tested in          the expression data          The signaling network models generated by NetSearch          for the pheromone response cell wall integrity and          filamentation pathways are depicted in Fig  In each          case the starting protein receptor depicted in blue          and ending protein transcription factor depicted in          red were selected as inputs and NetSearch draws all          possible paths between these points The size of each          vertex is proportional to the sum of scores of the paths          in which that protein is found providing a useful visual          clue to the potential importance of a protein in the          given network Comparison with Fig shows that NetSearch          reproduced many of the essential elements of these MAPK          pathways while providing a detailed account of the          experimentally determined interconnections among network          elements Of the three network models the one generated          for the pheromone response pathway originating at Step          Fig A exhibited the highest coclustering scores          Every protein NetSearch included in this network model          has a description in the Yeast Proteome Database YPD             consistent with a known or plausible role in mating          Of the nineteen proteins we have included in our          depiction of the pheromone response network eighteen are          annotated as playing a role in the fungal cell          differentiation by MIPS     The probability that          this selection would have occurred by chance was          calculated with the hypergeometric distribution was found          to be P      Our model does differ in several          respects from the canonical pheromone response pathway          depicted in Fig  It includes more members of the          heterotrimeric G protein complex including the alpha          beta and gamma subunits the GDPGTP exchange factor          and the GTPaseactivating protein Gpap Step Step          Cdcp and Sstp respectively It includes Farp a          protein necessary for pheromoneinduced cell cycle arrest          in G     Mptp a protein necessary for recovery          from cell cycle arrest     and Bemp and Sph both          of which are necessary for establishment of cell polarity          during shmooing and budding      In our          proteininteraction map there is no direct interaction          between a pheromone receptor Step or Step and any          component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex          StepStepGpap so NetSearch drew indirect paths          through Akrp a known inhibitor of signaling in the          pheromone pathway     The predicted network does not          include the GTPase Cdcp paths were instead drawn          preferentially through its cofactor Cdcp which          physically interacts with Step or Step because of          missing interactions in the proteininteraction map          Fig Bdepicts the pheromone response network at          several different score cutoffs and demonstrates how          higher coclustering score cutoffs reduces the complexity          of the proteininteraction map NetSearch detects           paths of length eight from Step to Step and          incorporates  different proteins into those paths The          top graph in Fig Bshows the network constructed from          all  paths with each protein arranged on the          perimeter of an ellipse for clarity In the middle          graph all paths that scored below the median have been          eliminated leaving only  proteins On the bottom of          Fig B only the highest scoring paths those used to          construct the network in Fig A with  proteins are          depicted Comparison of these networks indicates that          most proteins are eliminated by simply excluding the          pathways that score in the bottom half further          modifications to the cutoff affect the results          incrementally In setting a precise cutoff for pathway          inclusion in the final network models one seeks to          strike a balance between the inclusion of falsepositives          and the omission of truepositives We set the cutoff          such that the top fifteen paths for each network were          included          The network model generated for the cell wall          integrity pathway is depicted in Fig C Membrane          proteins in particular may fail to produce interactions          when forced into the nucleus by the requirements of the          standard twohybrid technique We observed this to be the          case for the cell wall integrity pathway as neither          Wscp Wscp Wcsp or Midp were observed to interact in          any of the highthroughput screens To reconstruct this          network we therefore started with the momomeric GTPase          Rhop and restricted our search to a length of seven          because of the omission of the initial signal sensor Of          the  proteins included in this network model all but          Smdp have descriptions consistent with a role in cell          wall maintenance NetSearch included both GTPase          constituents of this pathway Rhop and Cdcp as well          as associated GAPs and other interactors including          Rdip Rgap and Gicp Other included network elements          are Fksp the glucan synthase of which Rhop is a          subunit     the actin protein Actp and the          proteins Bnip Budp and Sphp which are associated          with Rhomediated signal transduction actin filament          organization cell polarity establishment and bud          growth Smdp forms a complex with the Sm core          spliceosomal proteins     and we are not aware of          any role it may play in maintaining cell wall integrity          Its inclusion is most likely a result of its expression          correlation with           BUD in one of the microarray          datasets but it seems unlikely that the observed          interactions of Smdp with Spap and Sltp have          biological significance In the NetSearchgenerated          model Bckp is downstream of Mkkp because although it          interacts with both Mkkp and Mkkp it has been shown          specifically not to interact with Pkcp in twohybrid          assays              The network model for filamentous growth Fig D          involves  proteins  of which are known to play a          role in filamentous growth or have functions consistent          with that role with the exception of Fusp As in the          pheromone response and cell wall integrity network          models key components of the Ras GTPase are included          such as Cdcp the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange          factor Cyrp the Rasassociated adenylate cyclase          and Srvp which enables the activation of adenylate          cyclase by Rasp Several proteins with roles in actin          filament organization cell polarity establishment bud          growth and GTPasemediated signal transduction are          shared with the cell wall integrity pathway including          Bnip Spap Budp and Actp NetSearch depicts          interactions between Abpp and both Srvp and Actp          consistent with the function of Abp in tethering Srvp          to the cytoskeleton The adenylate cyclase and associated          proteins mentioned above along with Hspp and Hscp          activate the cAMP pathway     a pathway that acts in          parallel with the MAPK pathway to promote filamentation          Hspp is a chaperone protein known to interact with a          number of signaling pathway components     It is          required for activation of the pheromone signaling          pathway     and for the general response to amino          acid starvation     It may play a similar role in          response to nitrogen ammonia starvation a trigger for          filamentation Fusp included in our predicted network          does not have a documented role in filamentation it is          required for cell fusion during pheromone initiated          mating Its transcript levels are significantly          upregulated in response to pheromone but are unchanged          in           tec strains     that study          notes however that in           dig dig cells fus is          constitutively activated and both mating and invasive          growth are observed Tecp conspicuously absent in our          model has not been observed to interact with any          proteins in highthroughput twohybrid screens                            Discussion        The utility of yeast proteinprotein interaction maps        for generating signaling network models has previously been        suggested     and they have been used to predict        metabolic pathways     Expression data has been used        to generate and refine models for genetic regulatory        networks without the benefit of proteinprotein interaction        data     In this study we have used expression data        to rank candidate pathways of interacting proteins This        approach has a strong biological and experimental        rationale proteins used in the same signaling network must        exist simultaneously with its activation The genes        encoding these proteins must be transcribed at        approximately the same time and under the same        environmental conditions in which the signaling network is        required Furthermore experimental evidence suggests that        when a signaling network is activated positive feedback        mechanisms upregulate the expression of genes that encode        pathway proteins     implying that this rationale is        also applicable to surveillance pathways whose protein        components may need to be constitutively present in small        quantities but whose concentration increases with        activation This biological rationale is borne out by        evidence that interacting proteins have more highly        correlated expression profiles than do noninteracting        proteins     However if a single component of a        signaling network is independently and differentially        regulated it would not necessarily be excluded using our        approach if for instance it connected two halves of a        pathway which had similar average expression profiles        NetSearch can be used to predict new signaling pathways        identify previously unknown members of documented pathways        or identify smaller clusters of interacting proteins Until        we have a more complete proteininteraction set a user who        wishes to explore a particular pathway        httparepmedharvardeduNetSearchneeds to specify        pathway starting points and ending points such as membrane        and DNAbinding proteins respectively This selection can        be based on a known genetic interaction a shared mutant        phenotype a shared functional classification or signature        expression profile This is the approach we have followed        in constructing the networks depicted in Fig  Those        networks are comprised of all highest ranking linear paths        connecting the receptors and transcription factors for that        pathway        The pheromone response pathway is commonly depicted as a        simple linear transmission of the mating signal from the        membrane receptor Step for alphafactor or Step for        afactor to the nuclear effectors Step and Mcmp via        a MAPK cascade However mating pheromone exposure also        induces other cellular processes such as those required for        polarized growth cell cycle arrest and recovery from cell        cycle arrest Furthermore the topology of the protein        interactions required for these processes is considerably        more complicated than a series of pairwise interactions In        addition to accurately depicting the MAPK cascade our        predicted pheromone response network identifies many        proteins necessary to execute the coordinated processes of        growth polarization and cell cycle arrest and reflects the        complex topology of the interaction network        The complexity of these interactions are observed in        large multifunctional complexes of possibly dynamic        composition For example products of Ste Ste Cdc        Cdc Far Bem Ste Ste and other proteins are        thought to constitute a complex that has numerous        interactions among components and that mediates many        different cellular processes      The complex may        coordinate mating pheromone detection with  cell cycle        arrest via Farp  MAPK signal transduction via Step        and Step and  cell polarity via Bemp and Farp        among others             Given that several of these networks share components of        the MAPK cascade the mechanism by which inputoutput        specificity is maintained remains one of the most important        questions in the field of molecular signal transduction        One well accepted hypothesis is that scaffolding proteins        such as Step and Pbsp tether the MAPK module to the        appropriate input and output components     The recent        identification of numerous Step analogs in yeast and        mammals makes this hypothesis even more intriguing            Beyond scaffolding proteins higherorder protein complexes        have been hypothesized to play a role in maintaining signal        specificity     Our computational results suggest that        this may indeed be the case When comparing the minimal        pathways for pheromone response and filamentation as        depicted in Fig  it appears that maintaining signal        specificity would be a considerable challenge But when        comparing the two network predictions depicted in Fig         one notes many differences all of which may help ensure        specificity The network perspective suggests not a single        scaffolding protein but many scaffolding proteins  in        fact a scaffolding network The possibility exists that        relatively nonspecific kinases function simply as        phosphorylation modules operating inside insulating        networks that are the primary determinant of signaling        specificity        Because our proteinprotein interaction data is only a        small fraction of a truly complete interaction map one        finds portions of a network that cannot be connected using        available proteinprotein interaction data This was the        case in our attempts to model the HOG network While        NetSearch correctly identified the upstream elements of        this pathway Slnp  Ypdp  Sskp  Sskp it was        unable to form any connections to Pbsp or Hogp that ended        in a transcription factor In some cases a missing        interaction can be circumvented however In the model for        the pheromone response network NetSearch inserted Akrp a        known inhibitor of the pheromone pathway     between        Step and the G protein complex StepStepGpap        Although the proteininteraction dataset we used contained        no direct interaction between StepStep and Step        StepStep has been shown to interact in a targeted yeast        twohybrid study            Our failure to model the HOG pathway underscores the        fact that for the purposes of this algorithm missing        interactions falsenegatives are a more significant        obstacle than are falsepositive interactions Missing        interactions cannot be created by the algorithm but        falsepositive interactions are deemphasized as a result        of the bias imposed by ranking paths according to the        similarity of expression profiles Bearing this out of the        fiftyeight proteins included in our networks only Smdp        seems to be included as a result of falsepositive        interactions This is distinct from the case of Fusp        which may be misplaced in the filamentation pathway but        whose interactions with Actp and Step are real This        highlights a general observation on the integration of        genomic technologies Twohybrid and microarray expression        studies are both known to have a sizable fraction of        systematic errors for instance selfactivators in        twohybrid experiments and crosshybridization in        microarrays but when looking at the intersection of the        two the true signals tend to reinforce one another        whereas the systematic errors in the two tend to be        different and are reduced further into the noise These        effects may help explain why we observe so few        falsepositive proteins inserted into our predicted        networks        In addition to using more complete interaction datasets        such as those found in Ho    and Gavin     one        could improve this approach by integrating more types of        data Homology modelling could be used to differentially        weight the inclusion of molecules likely to be involved in        signal transduction eg kinases and genetic        interactions could weight the inclusion of the two proteins        in the same path Signaling motif identification    and        data from protein kinase chips    could also easily be        incorporated into this framework Based on the interaction        data available the networks depicted in Fig are static        with all interactions given equal weight and without        information on the direction of information transfer In        reality signaling networks are dynamic and vectorial        complexes with interactions of varying strengths among        component proteins     The technology necessary to        generate data which will allow modelling of these network        properties are beginning to emerge Kinase chips           will allow one to incorporate information about the        direction of information flow The strength of protein        interactions with DNA has been measured on chips in a        highly parallel manner    and the same could be done        for proteinprotein interactions     Data on the        spatial and temporal colocalization of signaling        components is being generated by new imaging techniques            which will yield insight into the mechanism with        which the cellular response to a signal is modulated by the        intensity and the duration of the signal     and the        interplay with parallel pathways                    Conclusions        The approach we have presented allows one to query the        intersection of two enormous sets of functional        genomicderived molecular data One can in effect        simultaneously browse proteinprotein interaction and gene        expression data It allows one to extract a group of        highlyconnected highlycorrelated proteins from global        data to isolate a subnetwork of particular interest        Significantly this approach does not require prior        knowledge of pathway intermediates The interaction data        determines the pathways that are considered and gene        expression data is used to rank the pathways Although we        have focused on signaling pathways this approach should be        applicable to modelling the relationships among any group        of interacting proteins that cooperate to perform a given        function within a cell and the webversion of the software        allows for these queries As many genomic techniques are        generating increasingly large amounts of molecular data        new tools such as this will be required for the synthesis        of parts into pathways in order that we may understand        how cells regulate the many processes necessary for growth        and development                    Authors contributions        MS conceived of the study performed the network
