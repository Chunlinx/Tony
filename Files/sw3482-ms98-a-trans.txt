                 this is the first i have used this have you talked to anyone before   only one time before   okay uh i understand that were supposed to talk about pets so do you have any pets   thats right i sure do i was just feeding them all  i have a a large aquarium   oh what do you have   and   that sounds fishy   excuse me   that sounds fishy   yeah it is   i dont guess you make any waves though do you   no  ive got ive got a lot of fish in my aquarium and ive also got a dog who is sitting out there in the rain wishing id let him in  but i yeah its raining here   rain where what part of town are you in   uh real far north just north of Addison yeah   oh really well im out in Garland so its not raining uh well it may be raining i havent been outside   oh yeah its raining out here and i just steam cleaned my carpet today and i really dont wanna let the dog in   oh bless his heart what kind is it   hes a a mutt hes part Schipperkes and part Chow   uhhuh   and hes hes real cute hes a he can turn me into a real sucker sometimes but     can he get in out of the rain   uh oh yeah he has a house but   oh he just wants to give you the guilt trip   well he usually spends all his time with us  the whole time   i see oh well thats good thats good   so how about yourself do you have any   well i used to have a poodle and he died and so my neighbors cat has adopted me so it comes in and to see me and i have it a bed made on the little patio outside and   umhum oh uhhuh uhhuh   uh i think its adopted me so i think its my cat now because i even took it and had its shots but because its so friendly     oh youre kidding uh   i was afraid she hadnt well ill ask her she had not had its shots so i was concerned so i took it and had the shots   oh yeah thats not good   no its a beautiful gray cat its real sweet but anyway im i have to travel a lot right now in about um another year ill probably get another dog because ill be through traveling   uhhuh huh uhhuh so youre a dog person huh   well i think so i dont know how to handle cats   really i i used to have a cat and he actually he died this summer but uh i had him for thirteen years and when we got this dog i didnt know what to do it just i never had a dog before in my whole life   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   and it was its really different to have a different type of animal   well i i just dont know much about cats and i um i dont know why i dont they see to themselves i think more than dogs do so that   yes they do theyre very self sufficient and they dont demand nearly as much attention or care   thats right they say you you um have a dog but you what is the saying that you never really own a cat that you may own a dog but you the cats just kind of tolerate tolerates you     yes thats right thats right   well do you um um have your are you going to breed your dogs   no huhuh hes been neutered   oh its just just for fun huh   oh yeah hes just a pet and he he actually has turned out to be a great watchdog too so   uhhuh have you been to North Park to see the kennel they have over there this year that you can adopt a dog you know for the holidays   no uh no i havent well i certainly dont need another one   thats real cute well dont go over there then because it really hurt touches you when you see those that are up for adoption   i know well you know i went before we got this dog we were looking around and we went to um some humane societies and that sort of thing and they would not allow us to adopt a dog   uhhuh uhhuh how come   because we both work and they required someone to be home all the time and quite honestly i think probably some dogs got put to sleep that couldve had a good home i mean   oh well i didnt realize that because i most people do work now and uh thats surprising   yeah thats right yeah and i was too and and also there you know they come out and inspect your property and make sure you have a fence it has to be like an eight foot fence and our fence only happens to be six feet i mean im not   but your little dog cant go over an eight foot fence   no no  i just   so did you have to end up buying him   yeah we ended we ended up we got him it was sort of a flea market but they had a pet store had a little shop setup   uhhuh   and yeah we ended up buying a dog which isnt you know really what i wanted to do but i couldnt pass the requirements   yeah isnt that i didnt realize that well did you go to   and yeah and ill tell you my dog is spoiled   well somebody told me that the Richardson kennel was good or the Richardson   hm   what do you call it where they pound i guess is real good about letting you have them there so i dont know   uhhuh yeah i guess we shouldve tried the pound but the humane society uh wasnt interested in giving us a pet so   huh well thats terrible   yeah i thought it was too but   i dont know how long were supposed to talk do you   um its usually like five minutes not too long   okay so i well does it  does the recording come on or something   no you just sort of decide when youre done talking and thats it did you   okay  well do you work in Dallas   yeah i work at TI yeah   oh TI i see oh so youre part of the program then   well i just found out about it through a different department um i dont know anyone actually well i i might   uhhuh
