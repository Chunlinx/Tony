                                 Jesuitical vs Talmudic            An exchange occurred notlong ago in Californias Sacramento Superior and Municipal Courts As a lawyerattempted to excuse his clients behavior with a convoluted explanation JudgeJames Ford interrupted acidly with the comment Thats just  thats justtoo Jesuitical for words The colloquy continued as follows                                        Lawyer Pardon me                                                    Judge Its too Jesuitical  You probably didnt go to aJesuit school                                                    Lawyer Certainly didnt I am of the Jewish faith                                                    Judge Then its too Talmudic for words                        One can almost hear the appreciative chuckles from thespectators gallery at this bit of reparteethe overreactivetensiondispelling response that very mild witticisms tend to produce in solemnvenues And yet someone should have risen to say Objection It is common toregard Jesuitical and Talmudic as synonymous but this does an injustice toboth words            Talmudic originally signified nothing more than of or pertaining to theTalmud  Oxford English Dictionary  the Talmud being the postbiblicalRabbinic code of Jewish laws and interpretations that is the source ofauthority in Orthodox Judaism Jesuitical originally signified of orpertaining to the Jesuits belonging to the Society of Jesus Jesuit OED  again the Jesuits being the Roman Catholic clerical orderfounded by Ignatius Loyola in  as an intellectual bulwark against theReformation Whatever else may be said about them both Talmudic andJesuitical carry connotations of great learning and meticulous attention toargument Where they diverge is in motivation            Very early owing in part to English Protestantpropagandists the word Jesuitical came to characterize a form of argumentdesigned less to seek the truth than to make a case a form of argument thatwas aggressive and clever but perhaps not always sincereindeed one that wasat times cunningly equivocal or downright deceitful Aside from pureantiJesuit animus this nuance probably arose from the work of somethcentury Jesuit theologians who imperfectly employed a method known ascasuistry in resolving questions of moral theologyan approach that gave thebroadest possible leeway to individual behavior This form of justificationwhich became known as laxism may explain why Jesuit priests were theconfessors of choice among Europes Catholic aristocracy            To characterize a lie asan economy of truth would be a Jesuitical formulation To say that one hadsmoked marijuana but did not inhale would be a Jesuitical distinction BillClinton received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University a Jesuitschool William Safire argues that Jesuitical has by now developed a sensedevoid of any overtones of prevarication subtle intricate moralisticreasoning informed by a rigorous logic is his definition I am not assanguine as Safire and believe that using the word will always carry someslight risk It may be wielded as a slur and received as a compliment or viceversa            Talmudic carries none ofthis baggage The Talmud with its commentaries on the Torah and itscommentaries on the commentaries the process goes on and on cannot be faultedfor using guile to arrive at a congenial truth But the word has its ownnegative connotations Talmudic scholarship is famous for the tortuous andpainstaking manner in which truth is pursued and establishedif it can beestablished at all It is assumed by Talmudic scholars that the language of theTalmud is precise and that each word is therefore of surpassing significanceAs a result even infinitesimal details are treated with the utmostseriousness Also while Talmudic scholarship is sometimes aimed at practicalaffairs for instance civil and criminal law dietary laws the status ofwomen it also considers issues that have no practical application at all andsometimes delves into matters that may seem utterly fanciful            In hisbook The Essential Talmud  rabbi and scholar Adin Steinsaltz recounts afamous absurdist parody A rabbi asked his disciple why the letter peh p
