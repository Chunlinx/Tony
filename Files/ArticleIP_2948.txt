                                 The European            George Steiner has beenwriting his incandescent essays on high culture for nearly four decades nowsteadily deepening his insights and widening his topical reach but carrying onthe same essential errand In earlier times he would have been one ofEnlightenments missionaries in our own he has come to be seen more as aguardian a defender of embattled humanism While Steiner has hewed totraditions and verities the world around him has been mutatingPoststructuralism has come and gone multiculturalism is exercising itsliberations and tyrannies the computer has become the dominant tool ofdiscourse And Steiner has been quietly gathering the authority of hisintransigence                           No Passion Spent the latest of the critics many studies and collections sends its root threadsback to nearly every phase of his complex endeavor There are essays on all thefamiliar Steiner subjectstranslation tragedy the eclipse of humane culturethe connection between language and ethics and Judaism and the Holocaust Newif not unexpected subjects include Kierkegaard Simone Weil dreams thedeaths of Socrates and Jesus and the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl            Steineropens the collection with The Uncommon Reader a tourdeforce meditation onJeanSimon Chardins painting Le Philosophe lisant  which becomesthrough attentive reading of detailshis folio his hourglass his incisedmedallions his ready quillan emblem for the vanishing culture of book andreader Reading has always been for Steiner a quasipriestly activity As hewrites in Real Presences the second essay Where we read truly where theexperience is to be that of meaning we do so as if the text incarnates  a real presence of significant being  Chardinsreader in his solitary bearing his grave demeanor honors this most freightedobligation which can be construed as an obligation to being itself But therevolution  brought on by computers by planetary electronic exchanges bycyberspace and soon virtual reality  as Steiner puts it in hisintroduction has all but brought this particular sense of presence toextinction He lets himself dream that there might arise schools of creativereading but he also knows that his dreams will remain just that            For all his elegiac rumination though Steiner does notlack a polemicists instinct for the intellectual or ideological hot spot Hebegins his attack with smaller provocations In A Reading AgainstShakespeare for instance he uses Wittgensteins stated reservations aboutthe Bard to test some of our dearest assumptions about this mythic figureWithout ever calling Shakespeares linguistic greatness into question Steinersuggests an alternative requirement for true greatness that comprehended inthe German term Dichter  which carries certain lofty notions of witnessand moral responsibility Steiner knows his Shakespeare and Shakespeare is noDichter  The work is too teeming too multiform it lacks the felt forceof either the presence or absence of God Shakespeare gives us plenitude at theexpense of ethics or higher spiritual aspiration The conclusion cageyteasing is one of Steiners typically pregnant equivocations Plato heproclaims was wrong when he banished the poets Wittgentstein misreadsShakespeare Surely this must be so            And yet            Theessay called Archives of Eden seeks to provoke on a larger scale Advancingexample after example measuring reputationsthose of composers Roger Sessionsand Elliott Carter say against those of Stravinsky and SchoenbergSteinerinsists that America has produced very little that can stand up to theintellectual or artistic achievements of Europe The dominant apparatus ofAmerican high culture he writes is that of custody they make theart we build the museums If there is truth to the contentionSteiner ispersuasive when he compares various fields and finds that only architecture andmodern dance those uniquely American triumphs exhibit signs of lifehisargument still feels more like animadversion than rigorous reflection            If as Steiner claims the greatness of a culture restsupon traditions upon history then America must be found wanting In adangerously cantilevered sentence of the kind that Steiner does at times resortto he asserts It may well be that the ethnicdemographic elements in thesuccessive waves of American settlement are Darwinian negative that theyembody the brilliant survival of an antihistorical species whereantihistorianism would entail an abdication from those adaptive mechanismsof tragic intellectuality of ideological caring Kierkegaards Heideggersword Sorge  which are indispensable to cultural creation of the firstrank For the rest of us a translation What those tired and huddled massesthat wash up on Americas shores are tired of specifically is history            Theargument continues Steiner rears up to make his wellknown linkage betweenelite culture and eruptions of barbarism He notes that the correlationsbetween extreme creativity  and political justice are to a significantdegree at least negative In this regard he argues the American choice fora leveling democracy makes abundant sense            He ends by questioning whether the threat to thought andcreation of the first rank lies in the apparatus of political repression orin a consensus of spiritualsocial values in which the television showing ofHolocaust is interrupted every fourteen minutes by commercials in whichgasoven sequences are interspersed and financed by ads for pantihose anddeodorants His own answer maddeningly brief invokes Archimedes garden inSyracuse where the philosopher worked defiantly on his theorem even asbarbarians clamored at the gates That garden may have been a counterEden writes Steiner But it happens to be the one in which you and I mustcontinue our labor My hunch is that it lies in Syracuse stillSicily thatis rather than New York State            This is all pure Steinerhightoned and irritating vibrating with barely curtailed snobbism but alsoventuring hard queries and unpopular responses His views are calculatedlydivisive Indeed it is hard to square ones indignation at being patronizedwith the nettlesome suspicion that he may be right Ours is not now nor is itever likely to become a civilized culture in the European sense of the wordMost of usGod bless Americacouldnt care less This is Steiners pointprecisely We long ago decided to ignore the poets counsel and took the roadmore traveled We narrowed our intellectual horizons and flattened ourdiscourse and more than ever we need a critic like Steiner to remind us ofwhat a difference that choice has made Those who feel no sense of crisis aboutlatemodern life will nibble and scowl and drop the book with an impatientthump The rest of us will be piqued shamed outraged instructed and maybeperversely fortified
