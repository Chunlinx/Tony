                how are you tonight   im fine   are you a Native American   yes   so you are real  so all the rest of us are um immigrants   i guess  why   its kind of interesting that they would do how do you feel about the idea of letting all these foreigners in   it doesnt well to a point its okay you know i dont mind ive never had a problem with them letting people in i just dont think that they they are right in some of the things they do   well do you think there should be restrictions on uh who you should let in the states   no because then you get to the problem of then then youre not a free country anymore okay   well what about if somebody was um is sick say they have AIDS or something   uh it doesnt matter everybody over here has got it anyway theyre you know AIDS is AIDS as long as if they tell you before they come here thats fine you know that they got AIDS but then all you have to do is make sure theyre not passing it around   yeah   but then they dont know how it really you know to me they dont know nothing about AIDS anyway so   yeah that it its really sad that uh but apparently theyre theyre i think there are some rules that wont let people in who have   thats just a different you know my my problem with immigration is when you take people that has been here on welfare or trying to make it and you know the united States gives people that come into the country more money to start their life than the people thats already here thats trying   yeah   this is thats the only fallback i see because ive seen like when the Vietnamese come over they get they have stores and you know Uncle Sam done bought uh uh you know Uncle Sam had to pay for it they gave them that loan but people over here cant even get a small business loan like that   yeah   its harder for somebody from America to get a loan from their own country when a foreigner can get more and i dont think thats right   yeah that that can really be a problem i know in in in New York theres a problem with the Koreans that uh that that the uh black community is complaining that the Koreans are taking over   umhum what is the yeah that and then you have well then you have the well no Mexicans they they dont take over too much they just they just make more money   well i have a friend thats married to a in fact he went went to Korea and married a Korean and brought her home and uh   umhum thats a lot   the problem was that that she is a real hard worker and has started a a couple of businesses and now shes started a Korean health food store and     yeah   shes really a gogetter that uh and she started off uh cleaning uh houses   yeah   and uh then she found out that these automobile dealerships needed and so she got some people to help her and she had one and then she was doing a good job and she wound up having uh eight or ten automobile dealerships   yeah   that she was cleaning and and apparently uh her her husband is sort of watching the money for her but apparently shes a really a hard worker and willing to do the hard work   yeah   and has been able and now shes made enough money to start this health food store i dont know how shes doing but it i guess you have to admire the people who have come in and work and dont you know dont take money from the government   yeah now thats all right i dont mind people that work for what they do i give them a and if and if they work so hard and then get give them a small thats fine i just dont think that the handouts are equal   yeah no it it its also kind of   okay thats what im saying there theres so much problem with the handouts and then now by the economy being like it is this is the worst time they could have for everybody coming into the United States   well and the problem is that the jobs its its like the minimum wage everybody saying well i made the minimum wage but my son i have a seventeen year old son and hes saying well hell go out and work at minimum wage well the problem is uh minimum wage is not enough to live on   no its not and if its uh its just like my husband well we was talking about it before he sold his truck he was a truck driver now for him to actually make money he would have to make almost nine dollars a hour thats just to live   yeah   okay but you cant find no jobs like that   no you dont and and and thats what i think is so sad about the whole uh proposition and if youve got all these people who come and work for for nothing and uh   okay for nothing thats where you problem comes in is because some people will work for nothing when other people wont   yeah   and then thats why you have your i think thats where the the the line is even in Japan in Japan though its the same way they have their their economy is booming because of the United States if you dont understand that and i i i sit and i think about it but the the car the car market over the the automobile industry you know its been the United States for so long and the last   yeah   fifteen twenty years the Japanese have just taken over   yeah why do you do you do you think that has any anything to do though with uh   i think it has a lot to do with the price of a car and how much see to me they people dont look at it but if you take a Japanese car and bring it over here they sell it for the same amount of American car   yeah   okay if you take an American car and take it to Japan you cant even hardly you couldnt afford it   what what about cars that are that   so our our import tax on them is no big deal but their their tax on us and you cant you cant do that plus they can make it cheaper because they dont pay that much   well what about the what about the fact that it is right across the border in Mexico   the what is   well you know i dont know if you know   i dont i dont like the idea of the illegal aliens   well but no im talking about the idea of the that the company set up uh factories right across the border Right across the Texas border in Mexico   i dont oh thats just thats just so that the uh now see they made more money down there and they got real cheap labor in Mexico   well you you you think you think thats worse than than having the Mexicans come across the border and work in the factory of the United States and take jobs away from Americans   yeah i no i think it would be better if they would stay down there and get right papers to come across the border   well but but what you think of the of of the big uh the big companies that uh that that set up factories in Mexico and basically move jobs out of the United States down to Mexico   well theres a lot of companies TI do that TI got companies in Mexico i dont if its in Mexico Mexico but they got them in in foreign countries   yeah yeah its in   you know so but but   anyway but but do you think but the thing is down if they put a factory down there that means that theres more jobs for those people so theyre not crossing the border you   as much but some of them are still crossing not because of i know a lot of times i dont think its just because of the money i think its because they dont they the the the country themselves you know like the government should i say because everybodys not free to do what they want to do in every country   but but do you think do you think thats why theres so many people that want to come to the United States because of freedom or   yeah   do you think thats the main reason do you think the   i think its freedom and the and and to and the right to do what you want to do   as opposed to well   doing what the government wants you to do or been doing the government thinks youre able to do so its the same thing   yeah   and the government forcing you or taking more of your money than you want to give them   yeah   because i can make a million dollars and i know exactly Uncle Sam cant take half my money they can take  whatever the percentage is for that amount you know   yeah   thats it   yeah but do you but the what about the do do you think thats fair for for people that come in here from say like the Koreans i know i know a lot of Koreans thats why um and and you think its fair   umhum the only thing about a Korean or the or the Vietnamese that like i said i dont like is the idea like i said is i dont mind them because they can do anything they want to do and as long as they dont take jobs but see a lot of the jobs theyre taking people dont realize nobody else wants   well yeah we were yeah well we had uh we knew some Laotians and and uh the job they took uh you know basically are cleaning jobs   you see what im saying umhum   and um of course theres a lot of money in cleaning you know if you get a good business going   umhum   you know theres theres a lot of money to be made for cleaning but they um   but see just like her Korean food store okay thats mostly for Koreans   umhum yes   and thats just like over here on on on Walnut and uh Plano Road or is it Jupiter one of them streets anyway   uh   that whole section is nothing but but like Chinese or or Korean foreign i dont what it is   yes yeah yeah it is and i find that uh   okay and thats because they cater to their own people   yeah   which people dont realize it but there is a lot of them here and that way they can make money because they make money and then they put it right back into to somebody elses business   and that thats interesting they would i was reading something that said that they way   and and there that is wrong with America people dont put they money back into the same thing thats why Americans buy foreign if Americans would buy American cars we wouldnt have to worry about none of this   yeah yeah what they were saying is that these uh people come in and they will uh they will uh live on say twenty percent of what they make and and theyll put four or five families in in one apartment   yeah   and uh and   but see some people you cant do that to some apartments wont let you do that and then a lot of people you cant like i dont think i could live with my sister   yeah well thats another thing   okay families American families dont get along that good enough to stick together   no but the idea though is well is if if you could put two or three families in a in a together theyd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save their money and and uh and buy a bunch of things   thats right thats why now that works if you can find somebody to do it with but its very rare that you can find somebody to do it with     well most of us like our freedom you know we like to be left alone and we like uh   umhum   you know we like to have our own room and you know you
