GAO Accounting and Information Management DivisionMay Executive GuideInformation Security ManagementLearning From Leading OrganizationsPrefaceIncreased computer interconnectivity and the popularity of theInternet are offering organizations of all types unprecedentedopportunities to improve operations by reducing paper processingcutting costs and sharing information However the success ofmany of these efforts depends in part on an organizationsability to protect the integrity confidentiality and availabilityof the data and systems it relies onDeficiencies in federal information security are a growingconcern In a February  series of reports to the Congress GAOdesignated information security as a governmentwide highrisk areaIn October  the Presidents Commission on CriticalInfrastructure Protection described the potentially devastatingimplications of poor information security from a broaderperspective in its report entitled Critical Foundations ProtectingAmericas Infrastructures Since then audit reports have continuedto identify widespread information security weaknesses that placecritical federal operations and assets at riskAlthough many factors contribute to these weaknesses audits byGAO and Inspectors General have found that an underlying cause ispoor security program management To help identify solutions tothis problem Senators Fred Thompson and John Glenn Chairman andRanking Minority Member respectively of the Senate Committee onGovernmental Affairs requested that we study organizations withsuperior security programs to identify management practices thatcould benefit federal agencies This guide outlines the results ofthat study It is intended to assist federal officials instrengthening their security programs and we are pleased that ithas been endorsed by the federal Chief Information OfficersCouncilThis guide is one of a series of GAO publications listed inappendix I that are intended to define actions federal officialscan take to better manage their information resources It wasprepared under the direction of Jack L Brock DirectorGovernmentwide and Defense Information Systems who can be reachedat  or brockjaimdgaogovGene L Dodaro Assistant Comptroller General Accounting andInformation Management DivisionGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page A Message From the Federal Chief Information OfficersCouncilWashington April  A high priority of the CIO Council is to ensure theimplementation of security practices within the Federal governmentthat gain public confidence and protect government servicesprivacy and sensitive and national security information ThisExecutive Guide Information Security Management Learning FromLeading Organizations clearly illustrates how leadingorganizations are successfully addressing the challenges offulfilling that goal These organizations establish a centralmanagement focal point promote awareness link policies tobusiness risks and develop practical risk assessment proceduresthat link security to business needs This latter pointthe needto link security to business requirementsis particularlyimportant and is illustrated in a statement of a security managerquoted in the guide Because every control has some costassociated with it every control needs a business reason to be putin placeThe CIO Council is pleased to endorse the principles and bestpractices embodied in this guide Its findings underscore thepolicies articulated in Appendix III to OMB Circular ASecurity of Federal Automated Information Resources We expectthat it will be a valuable resource for all agency CIOs and programmanagers who execute those policies and will complement the otheractivities of the Council to improve Federal information systemssecurityWe look forward to working with the General Accounting Office inthe future as we implement these best practices to further enhanceagency security practices and programsContentsFederal Information Security Is A Growing ConcernFederal Information Security Is A Growing ConcernElectronic information and automated systems are essential tovirtually all major federal operations If agencies cannot protectthe availability integrity and in some cases theconfidentiality of this information their ability to carry outtheir missions will be severely impaired However despite theenormous dependence on electronic information and systems auditscontinue to disclose serious information security weaknesses As aresult billions of dollars in federal assets are at risk of lossvast amounts of sensitive data are at risk of inappropriatedisclosure and critical computerbased operations are vulnerableto serious disruptionsThis guide is designed to promote senior executives awarenessof information security issues and to provide information they canuse to establish a management framework for more effectiveinformation security programs Most senior federal executives likemany of their private sector counterparts are just beginning torecognize the significance of these risks and to fully appreciatethe importance of protecting their information resources Theopening segments describe the problem of weak information securityat federal agencies identify existing federal guidance anddescribe the issue of information security management in thecontext of other information technology management issues Theremainder of the guide describes  practices organized under fivemanagement principles that GAO identified during a study ofnonfederal organizations with reputations for having goodinformation security programs Each of these practices containsspecific examples of the techniques used by these organizations toincrease their security programs effectivenessPotential Risks Are SignificantAlthough they have relied on computers for years federalagencies like businesses and other organizations throughout theworld are experiencing an explosion in the use of electronic dataand networked computer systems As a result agencies have becomeenormously dependent on these systems and data to support theiroperationsThe Department of Defense alone has a vast informationinfrastructure that includes  million computers and over networks that are used toPage  GAOAIMD Information Security Managementexchange electronic messages obtain data from remote computersites and maintain critical records Civilian agencies also areincreasingly reliant on automated often interconnected systemsincluding the Internet to support their operations Forexamplelaw enforcement officials throughout the United States andCanada rely onthe Federal Bureau of Investigations National Crime InformationCentercomputerized database for access to sensitive criminal justicerecords onindividual offendersthe Internal Revenue Service relies on computers to process andstorehundreds of millions of confidential taxpayer recordsthe Customs Service relies on automated systems to support itsprocessingand inspection of hundreds of billions of dollars worth ofimported goodsandmany federal agencies such as the Social SecurityAdministration theDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of Health andHumanServices rely on automated systems to manage and distributehundreds ofbillions of dollars worth of payments to individuals andbusinesses such asmedicare social security and food stamp benefitsAlthough these advances promise to streamline federal operationsand improve the delivery of federal services they also exposethese activities to greater risks This is because automatedsystems and records are fast replacing manual procedures and paperdocuments which in many cases are no longer available as backupif automated systems should failThis risk is exacerbated because when systems areinterconnected to form networks or are accessible through publictelecommunication systems they are much more vulnerable toanonymous intrusions from remote locations Also much of theinformation maintained by federal agencies although unclassifiedis extremely sensitive and many automated operations areattractive targets for individuals or organizations with maliciousintentions such as committing fraud for personal gain orsabotaging federal operations Several agencies have experiencedintrusions into their systems and there are indications such astests at the Department of Defense that the number of attacks isgrowing and that many attacks are not detectedAdditional risks stem from agency efforts to examine and adjusttheir computer systems to ensure that they properly recognize theYear  These Year  conversion efforts are often conductedunder severe time constraints that without adequate managementattention could result in a weakening of controls over theintegrity of data and programs and over the confidentiality ofsensitive dataGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Information Security RisksWeaknesses Abound but Management Attention Has BeenLackingJust as in the private sector many federal agencies arereluctant to make the investments required in this area ofcomputer security because of limited budgets lack of directionand prioritization from senior officials and general ignorance ofthe threat Statement of Gary R Bachula Acting Under Secretary forTechnology Department of Commerce before House ScienceSubcommittee on Technology June  Unfortunately federal agencies are not adequately protectingtheir systems and data In September  we reported that auditreports and agency selfassessments issued during the previous years showed that weak information security was a widespreadproblem Specifically weaknesses such as poor controls overaccess to data and inadequate disaster recovery plans increased therisk of losses inappropriate disclosures and disruptions inservice associated with the enormous amounts of electronicallymaintained information essential for delivering federal servicesand assessing the success of federal programs Due to thesepreviously reported weaknesses and findings resulting from ourongoing work in February  we designated information securityas a new governmentwide highrisk issueIn our September  report we stated that an underlying causeof federal information security weaknesses was that agencies hadnot implemented information security programs that  establishedappropriate policies and controls and  routinely monitored theireffectiveness Despite repeated reports of serious problems senioragency officials had not provided the management attention neededto ensure that their information security programs wereeffectiveAlso in that report we made a number of recommendationsintended to improve the Office of Management and Budgets OMBoversight of agency information security practices and strengthenits leadership role in this area Specifically we recommended thatOMB promote the federal Chief Information Officers Councilsadoption of information security as one of its top priorities andencourage the council to develop a strategic plan for increasingawareness of the importance of information security especiallyamong senior agency executives and improving information securityprogram managementInformation Security Opportunities for Improved OMB Oversightof Agency Practices GAOAIMD September  HighRisk Series Information Management and TechnologyGAOHR February GAOAIMD Information Security Management Page governmentwide Initiatives that we suggested for the CIOCouncil to considerincorporating in its strategic plan includeddeveloping information on the existing security risks associatedwithnonclassified systems currently in usedeveloping information on the risks associated with evolvingpracticessuch as Internet useidentifying best practices regarding information securityprograms sothat they can be adopted by federal agenciesestablishing a program for reviewing the adequacy of individualagencyinformation security programs using interagency teams ofreviewersensuring adequate review coverage of agency informationsecuritypractices by considering the scope of various types of auditsandreviews performed and acting to address any identified gapsincoveragedeveloping or identifying training and certification programsthat couldbe shared among agencies andidentifying proven security tools and techniquesSince September  the CIO Council under OMBs leadershiphas taken some significant actions which include designatinginformation security as one of six priority areas and establishinga Security Committee The Security Committee in turn hasdeveloped a preliminary plan for addressing various aspects of theproblem established links with other federal entities involved insecurity issues held a security awareness day for federalofficials and begun exploring ways to improve federal incidentresponse capabilitiesAlthough there is more that OMB and the CIO Council can doinformation security is primarily the responsibility of individualagencies This is because agency managers are in the best positionto assess the risks associated with their programs and to developand implement appropriate policies and controls to mitigate theserisks Accordingly in our reports over the last several years wehave made dozens of specific recommendations to individualagencies Although many of these recommendations have beenimplemented similar weaknesses continue to surface becauseagencies have not implemented a management framework for overseeinginformation security on an agencywide and ongoing basis A list ofour previous reports and testimonies on information security isprovided at

the President and the Congress any material weaknessesthat could lead to fraud waste and abuse in governmentoperations The Chief Financial Officers Act requires agencies todevelop and maintain financial management systems that providecomplete reliable consistent and timely informationIn addition a considerable body of federal guidance oninformation security has been developed OMB has provided guidancesince  in its Circular A Appendix III Security of FederalAutomated Information Resources which was updated in February Further NIST has issued numerous Federal InformationProcessing Standards as well as a comprehensive description ofbasic concepts and techniques entitled An Introduction to ComputerSecurity The NIST Handbook Special Publication  December and Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for SecuringInformation Technology Systems published in September Additional federal requirements have been established for theprotection of information that has been classified for nationalsecurity purposes However these requirements are not discussedhere because this guide pertains to the protection of sensitive butunclassified data which constitute the bulk of data supportingmost federal operationsExploring Practices of Leading OrganizationsTo supplement our ongoing audit work at federal agencies andgain a broader understanding of how information security programscan be successfully implemented we studied the managementpractices of eight nonfederalAppendix II lists the principles identified in NISTs GenerallyAccepted Principles and Practices for Securing InformationTechnology Systems September GAOAIMD Information Security Management Page organizations recognized as having strong information securityprograms The specific objective of our review was to determine howsuch organizations have designed and implemented their programs inorder to identify practices that could be applied at federalagenciesWe focused primarily on the management framework that theseorganizations had established rather than on the specific controlsthat they had chosen because previous audit work had identifiedsecurity management as an underlying problem at federal agenciesAlthough powerful technical controls such as those involvingencryption are becoming increasingly available to facilitateinformation security effective implementation requires that thesetechniques be thoughtfully selected and that their use be monitoredand managed on an ongoing basis In addition there are manyaspects of information security such as risk assessment policydevelopment and disaster recovery planning that requirecoordinated management attentionTo identify leading organizations we reviewed professionalliterature and research information and solicited suggestions fromexperts in professional organizations nationally known publicaccounting firms and federal agencies In selecting organizationsto include in our study we relied primarily on recommendationsfrom the Computer Security Institute and public accounting firmsbecause they were in a position to evaluate and compare informationsecurity programs at numerous organizations In addition weattempted to select organizations from a variety of businesssectors to gain a broad perspective on the information securitypractices being employed After initial conversations with a numberof organizations we narrowed our focus to eight organizations thathad implemented fairly comprehensive organizationwide informationsecurity programs All were prominent nationally knownorganizations They included a financial services corporation aregional electric utility a state university a retailer a stateagency a nonbank financial institution a computer vendor and anequipment manufacturer The number of computer users at theseorganizations ranged from  to  and four hadsignificant international operations Because most of theorganizations considered discussions of their security programs tobe sensitive and they wanted to avoid undue public attention onthis aspect of their operations we agreed not to identify theorganizations by nameWe obtained information primarily through interviews with seniorsecurity managers and document analysis conducted during and aftervisits to the organizations we studied In a few cases we touredthe organizations facilities and observed practices in operationWe supplemented these findings to a very limited extent withinformation obtained from others For example at the state agencywe also met with a statewide security program official and withstate auditors In addition we asked the Computer SecurityInstitute toPage  GAOAIMD Information Security Managementquery its members about their efforts to measure theeffectiveness of their security programs in order to gain a broaderperspective of practices in this areaTo determine the applicability of the leading organizationspractices to federal agencies we discussed our findings withnumerous federal officials including officials in OMBsInformation Policy and Technology Branch the Computer SecurityDivision of NISTs Information Technology Laboratory CIO Councilmembers the chairman of the Chief Financial Officers Councilssystems subcommittee information security officers from  federalagencies and members of the Presidents Commission on CriticalInfrastructure Protection Further we discussed our findings withour Executive Council on Information Management and Technology agroup of executives with extensive experience in informationtechnology management who advise us on major information managementissues affecting federal agenciesThroughout the guide we make several observations on federalinformation security practices in order to contrast them with thepractices of the nonfederal organizations we studied Theseobservations are based on the body of work we have developed overthe last several years and on our recent discussions with federalinformation security officers and other federal officials who areknowledgeable about federal information security practicesAlthough we attempted to be as thorough as possible within thescope of our study we recognize that more work in this arearemains to be done including a more indepth study of individualpractices We also recognize that the practices require customizedapplication at individual organizations depending on factors suchas existing organizational strengths and weaknessesSecurity as an Element of a Broader Information ManagementStrategyAlthough this guide focuses on information security programmanagement this is only one aspect of an organizations overallinformation management strategy As such an organizations successin managing securityrelated efforts is likely to hinge on itsoverall ability to manage its use of information technologyUnfortunately federal performance in this broader area has beenlargely inadequate Over the past  years federal agencies havespent a reported  billion on information technology withgenerally disappointing missionrelated resultsRecognizing the need for improved information management theCongress has enacted legislation that is prompting landmark reformsin this area In particular the Paperwork Reduction Act of emphasized the need for agencies to acquire and apply informationresources to effectively support the accomplishment of agencymissions and the delivery of services to the public TheClingerCohen Act of  repeated this theme and provided moredetailed requirements These laws emphasize involving seniorexecutives in information management decisions appointingseniorlevel chief information officers and using performancemeasures to assess the contribution of technology in achievingmission results Although their primary focus is much broader bothof these laws specify security as one of the aspects of informationmanagement that must be addressed This environment of reform isconducive to agencies rethinking their security programs as partof broader information management changes and considering theimplementation of the practices that have been adopted bynonfederal organizationsOther Issues Affecting Federal Information SecuritySecurity program management and the related implementation ofcontrols over access to data systems and software programs aswell as service continuity planning are central factors affectingan organizations ability to protect its information resources andthe program operations that these resources support However thereare numerous policy technical legal and human resource issuesthat are not fully within the control of officials at individualagencies These issues are currently being debated and in manycases addressed by privatesector and federal efforts Theyinclude but are not limited to matters concerning  the use ofencryption to protect the confidentiality of information and othercryptographic capabilities including digital signatures andintegrity checks  personal privacy  the adequacy of lawsprotecting intellectual property and permitting investigations intocomputerrelated crimes and  the availability of adequatetechnical expertise and security software toolsThese topics are beyond the scope of this guide and thus arenot discussed herein However it is important to recognize thatstrengthening information security requires a multifaceted approachand sometimes involves issues that are beyond the control ofindividual businesses and agencies Although the managementpractices described in this guide are fundamental to improving anorganizations information security posture they should beconsidered in the context of this broader spectrum of issuesLeading Organizations Apply Fundamental Risk ManagementPrinciplesThe organizations we studied were striving to manage the sametypes of risks that face federal agencies To do so they hadresponded to these risks by reorienting their security programsfrom relatively lowprofile operations focused primarily onmainframe security to visible integral components of theirorganizations business operations Because of the similarities inthe challenges they face we believe that federal entities canlearn from these organizations to develop their own more effectivesecurity programsFederal and Nonfederal Entities Face Similar Risks and Rely onSimilar TechnologiesLike federal agencies the organizations we studied must protectthe integrity confidentiality and availability of the informationresources they rely on Although most of the organizations wereprivate enterprises motivated by the desire to earn profits theirinformation security concerns focused on providing highqualityreliable service to their customers and business partners avoidingfraud and disclosures of sensitive information promoting efficientoperations and complying with applicable laws and regulationsThese are the same types of concerns facing federal agenciesAlso like federal agencies the organizations relied tovarying degrees on a mix of mainframe and clientserver systemsand made heavy use of interconnected networks In addition allwere either using or exploring the possibilities of using theInternet to support their business operationsInformation Security Objectives Common to Federal andNonfederal EntitiesProtect the confidentiality of sensitiveAvoid fraud personal and financial data on employees clientscustomers andAvoid expensive and beneficiaries disruptive incidentsProtect sensitive operational data fromComply with pertinent laws inappropriate disclosure andregulationsAvoid thirdparty liability for illegal ormalicious acts committed with the organizations computer ornetwork resources Avoid a hostile workplace atmosphere that mayimpair employee performanceRisk Management Principles Provide A Framework for an EffectiveInformation Security ProgramAlthough the nature of their operations differed theorganizations all had embraced five risk management principleswhich are listed in the box below These principles guided theorganizations efforts to manage the risk associated with theincreasingly automated and interconnected environment in which theyfunctionedRisk Management Principles Implemented by LeadingOrganizationsAssess risk and determine needs Establish a central managementfocal point Implement appropriate policies and related controlsPromote awareness Monitor and evaluate policy and controleffectivenessAn important factor in effectively implementing these principleswas linking them in a cycle of activity that helped ensure thatinformation security policies addressed current risks on an ongoingbasis The single most important factor in prompting theestablishment of an effective security program was a generalrecognition and understanding among the organizations most seniorexecutives of the enormous risks to business operations associatedwith relying on automated and highly interconnected systemsHowever risk assessments of individual business applicationsprovided the basis for establishing policies and selecting relatedcontrols Steps were then taken to increase the awareness of usersconcerning these risks and related policies The effectiveness ofcontrols and awareness activities was then monitored throughvarious analyses evaluations and audits and the results providedinput to subsequent risk assessments which determined if existingpolicies and controls needed to be modified All of theseactivities were coordinated through a central security managementoffice or group the staff of which served as consultants andGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page facilitators to individual business units and senior managementThis risk management cycle is illustrated in the diagram belowRisk Management CycleAssess Risk  Determine NeedsImplement CentralMonitor Policies FocalEvaluateControlsPointPromote AwarenessThis continuing cycle of monitoring business risks maintainingpolicies and controls and monitoring operations parallels theprocess associated with managing the controls associated with anytype of program In addition these principles should be familiarto federal agency officials since they have been emphasized in muchof the recent guidance pertaining to federal information securityMost notably they incorporate many of the concepts included inNISTs September  publication Generally Accepted Principlesand Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems and inOMBs February  revision of Circular A Appendix IIISecurity of Federal Automated Information ResourcesPrinciples Were Implemented Though Similar PracticesThe organizations had developed similar sets of practices toimplement the five risk management principles although thetechniques they employed varied depending on each organizationssize and culture Some programs were less mature than others andhad not fully implemented all of the practices However securitymanagers at each organization agreed that the  practices outlinedin the following illustration which relate to the five riskmanagement principles were key to the effectiveness of theirprogramsSixteen Practices Employed by Leading Organizations To Implementthe Risk Management CyclePracticesPrinciplesThe following pages provide a more detailed discussion of thesepractices and illustrative examples of the techniques used toimplement them by the organizations we studied The discussionfollows the order of the practices as outlined above Individualagency priorities for adopting the practices will vary depending ontheir existing security programsPage  GAOAIMD Information Security ManagementAssess Risk  Determine

as it supports the business needs andrequirements of our company Senior security manager at a major electric utilityAll of the organizations said that risk considerations andrelated costbenefit tradeoffs were a primary focus of theirsecurity programs Security was not viewed as an end in itself butas a set of policies and related controls designed to supportbusiness operations much like other types of internalcontrolsControls were identified and implemented to address specificbusiness risks As one organizations security manager saidBecause every control has some cost associated with it everycontrol needs a business reason to be put in place Regardless ofwhether they were analyzing existing or proposed operationssecurity managers told us that identifying and assessinginformation security risks in terms of the impact on businessoperations was an essential step in determining what controls wereneeded and what level of resources could be expended on controlsIn this regard understanding the business risks associated withinformation security was the starting point of the risk managementcycleIn GAOs recently revised Standards for Internal Control in theFederal Government Exposure Draft GAOAIMD December controls over computerized information and informationprocessing are discussed in the context of the larger body of anagencys internal control activitiesGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Practice  Recognize Information Resources as EssentialOrganizational Assets That Must Be ProtectedInformation technology is an integral and critical ingredientfor the successful functioning of major US companies Deloitte  Touche LLP Survey of American BusinessLeaders November The organizations we studied recognized that information andinformation systems were critical assets essential to supportingtheir operations that must be protected As a result they viewedinformation protection as an integral part of their businessoperations and of their strategic planningSenior Executive Support Is CrucialIn particular senior executive recognition of informationsecurity risks and interest in taking steps to understand andmanage these risks were the most important factors in promptingdevelopment of more formal information security programs Suchhighlevel interest helped ensure that information security wastaken seriously at lower organizational levels and that securityspecialists had the resources needed to implement an effectiveprogramThis contrasts with the view expressed to us by numerous federalmanagers and security experts that many top federal officials havenot recognized the indispensable nature of electronic data andautomated systems to their program operations As a resultsecurityrelated activities intended to protect these resources donot receive the resources and attention that they meritIn some cases senior managements interest had been generatedby an incident that starkly illustrated the organizationsinformation security vulnerabilities even though no damage mayhave actually occurred In other cases incidents at otherorganizations had served as a wakeup call Two organizationsnoted that significant interest on the part of the board ofdirectors was an important factor in their organizations attentionto information security However security managers at many of theorganizations told us that their chief executive officers or othervery senior executives had an ongoing interest in informationtechnology and security which translated into an organizationwideemphasis on these areasAlthough the emphasis on security generally emanated from topofficials security specialists at lower levels nurtured thisemphasis by keeping themPage  GAOAIMD Information Security Managementabreast of emerging security issues educating managers at alllevels and by emphasizing the related business risks to their ownorganizationsSecurity Seen As An EnablerIn addition most of the organizations were aggressivelyexploring ways to improve operational efficiency and service tocustomers through new or expanded applications of informationtechnology which usually prompted new security considerationsOfficials at one organization viewed their ability to exploitinformation technology as giving them a significant competitiveadvantage In this regard several organizations told us thatsecurity was increasingly being viewed as an enablera necessarystep in mitigating the risks associated with new applicationsinvolving Internet use and broadened access to the organizationscomputerized data As a result security was seen as an importantcomponent in improving business operations by creatingopportunities to use information technology in ways that would nototherwise be feasiblePractice  Develop Practical Risk Assessment Procedures ThatLink Security to Business NeedsThe organizations we studied had tried or were exploring variousrisk assessment methodologies ranging from very informaldiscussions of risk to fairly complex methods involving the use ofspecialized software tools However the organizations that werethe most satisfied with their risk assessment procedures were thosethat had defined a relatively simple process that could be adaptedto various organizational units and involved a mix of individualswith knowledge of business operations and technical aspects of theorganizations systems and security controlsThe manufacturing company had developed an automated checklistthat asked business managers and relevant staff in individual unitsa series of questions that prompted them to consider the impact ofsecurity controls or a lack thereof on their units operationsThe results of the analysis were reported in a letter to seniormanagement that stated the business units compliance with thesecurity policy planned actions to become compliant orwillingness to accept the risk The results were also reported tothe internal auditors who used them as a basis for reviewing thebusiness units success in implementing the controls that theunits managers had determined were needed Through the reportingprocedure the business managers took responsibility for eithertolerating or mitigating security risks associated with theiroperationsSuch procedures provided a relatively quick and consistent meansof exploring risk with business managers selecting costeffectivecontrols and documenting conclusions and business managersacceptance of final determinations regarding what controls wereneeded and what risks could be tolerated With similar objectivesin mind the utility company had developed a streamlined riskassessment process that brought together business managers andtechnical experts to discuss risk factors and mitigating controlsThis process is described in detail as a case example on pageOther organizations had developed less formal and comprehensivetechniques for ensuring that risks were considered prior to changesin operationsThe retailer had established standard procedures for requestingand granting new network connections Under these proceduresdocumentation about the business need for the proposed connectionand the risks associated with the proposed connection had to besubmitted in writing prior to consideration by the central securitygroup Then a meeting between the technical group whichimplemented new connections the requester and the centralsecurity group was held to further explore the issue Thedocumentation and meeting helpedPage  GAOAIMD Information Security Managementensure that the requesters business needs were clearlyunderstood and the best solution was adopted without compromisingthe networks securityThe financial services corporation had implemented proceduresfor documenting business managers decisions to deviate fromorganizationwide policies and standards In order to deviate from amandatory policy the business unit prepared a letter explainingthe reason for the deviation and recognizing the related risk Boththe business unit executive and the central security group managersigned the letter to acknowledge their agreement to the necessityof the policy deviation Deviations from less rigid standardswere handled similarly although the letter could be signed by thebusiness unit executive alone and did not require the centralsecurity groups approval though it was generally received In allcases the central security group discussed the informationsecurity implications of the deviation with the appropriateexecutive and signedoff only when it was satisfied that theexecutives fully understood the risk associated with the deviationHowever the ultimate decision on whether a deviation from policiesor standards was appropriate was usually left to the businessunitOrganizations Saw Benefits Despite Lack of PrecisionActual losses are not necessarily good indications of riskSecurity manager at a prominent financial institutionAlthough all of the organizations placed emphasis onunderstanding risks none attempted to precisely quantify themnoting that few quantified data are available on the likelihood ofan incident occurring or on the amount of damage that is likely toresult from a particular type of incident Such data are notavailable because many losses are never discovered and others arenever reported even within the organizations where they occurredIn addition there are limited data on the full costs of damagecaused by security weaknesses and on the operational costs ofspecific control techniques Further due to fastpaced changes intechnology and factors such as the tools available to wouldbeintruders the value of applying data collected in past years tothe current environment is questionable As a result it isdifficult if not impossible to precisely compare the cost ofcontrols with the risk of loss in order to determine which controlsare the most costeffective Ultimately business managers andsecurity specialists must rely on the best information availableand their best judgment in determining what controls areneededDespite their inability to precisely compare the costs ofcontrols with reductions in risk the organizations said that riskassessments still served their primary purpose of ensuring that therisk implications of new and existing applications were exploredIn particular the security managers believed that adequateinformation was available to identify the most significant risksFor example in addition to their own organizations experiencethey noted that information on threats specific softwarevulnerabilities and potential damage was widely available intechnical literature security bulletins from organizations such asthe CarnegieMellon Computer Emergency Response Team CERTsurveys done by professional associations and audit firms anddiscussion groups Although much of this information was anecdotalthe security managers thought that it was sufficient to give them agood understanding of the threats of concern to their organizationsand of the potential for damageIn addition the lack of quantified results did not diminish thevalue of risk assessments as a tool for educating businessmanagers By increasing the understanding of risks riskassessments  improved business managers ability to makedecisions on controls needed in the absence of quantified riskassessment results and  engendered support for policies andcontrols adopted thus helping to ensure that policies and controlswould operate as intendedPractice  Hold Program and Business Managers AccountableHolding business managers accountable and changing the securitystaffs role from enforcement to service has been a major paradigmshift for the entire company Security manager at a major equipment manufacturerThe organizations we studied were unanimous in their convictionthat business managers must bear the primary responsibility fordetermining the level of protection needed for informationresources that support business operations In this regard mostheld the view that business managers should be held accountable formanaging the information security risks associated with theiroperations much as they would for any other type of business riskHowever security specialists played a strong educational andadvisory role and had the ability to elevate discussions to highermanagement levels when they believed that risks were not beingadequately addressedBusiness managers usually referred to as program managers infederal agencies are generally in the best position to determinewhich of their information resources are the most sensitive andwhat the business impact of a loss of integrity confidentialityor availability would be Business or program managers are also inthe best position to determine how security controls may impairtheir operations For this reason involving them in selectingcontrols can help ensure that controls are practical and will beimplementedAccordingly security specialists had assumed the role ofeducators advisors and facilitators who helped ensure thatbusiness managers were aware of risks and of control techniquesthat had been or could be implemented to mitigate the risks Forseveral of the organizations these roles represented a dramaticreversal from past years when security personnel were viewed asrigid sometimes overly protective enforcers who often did notadequately consider the effect of security controls on businessoperationsSome of the organizations had instituted mechanisms fordocumenting and reporting business managers risk determinationsThese generally required some type of signoff on memoranda thateither  reported deviations from predetermined controlrequirements as was the case at the financial services corporationand the manufacturing company discussed previously or  providedthe results of risk assessments as was the case of the utilitycompany described in the following case example According to thesecurity managers such signoff requirements helped ensure thatbusiness managers carefully considered their decisions beforefinalizing themGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Case Example A Practical Method for Involving BusinessManagers in Risk AssessmentA major electric utility company has developed an efficient anddisciplined process for ensuring that information securityrelatedrisks to business operations are considered and documented Theprocess involves analyzing one system or segment of businessoperation at a time and convening a team of individuals thatincludes business managers who are familiar with businessinformation needs and technical staff who have a detailedunderstanding of potential system vulnerabilities and relatedcontrols The sessions which follow a standard agenda arefacilitated by a member of the central security group who helpsensure that business managers and technical staff communicateeffectively and adhere to the agendaDuring the session the group brainstorms to identify potentialthreats vulnerabilities and resultant negative impacts on dataintegrity confidentiality and availability Then they analyzethe effects of such impacts on business operations and broadlycategorize the risks as major or minor The group does not usuallyattempt to obtain or develop specific numbers for threat likelihoodor annual loss estimates unless the data for determining suchfactors are readily available Instead they rely on their generalknowledge of threats and vulnerabilities obtained from nationalincident response centers professional associations andliterature and their own experience They believe that additionalefforts to develop precisely quantified risks are notcosteffective because  such estimates take an inordinate amountof time and effort to identify and verify or develop  the riskdocumentation becomes too voluminous to be of practical use and specific loss estimates are generally not needed to determineif a control is neededAfter identifying and categorizing risks the group identifiescontrols that could be implemented to reduce the risk focusing onthe most costeffective controls As a starting point they use alist of about  common controls designed to address various typesof risk Ultimately the decision as to what controls are neededlies with the business managers who take into account the natureof the information assets and their importance to businessoperations and the cost of controlsThe teams conclusions as to what risks exist and what controlsare needed are documented along with a related action plan forcontrol implementation This document is then signed by the seniorbusiness manager and technical expert participating and copies aremade available to all participant groups and to the internalauditors who may later audit the effectiveness of the agreed uponcontrolsEach risk analysis session takes approximately  hours andincludes  to  people though sessions with as many as  and asfew as  people have occurred Additional time is usually needed todevelop the action plan The information security group conductsbetween  and  sessions a month According to the utilityscentral information security group this process increases securityawareness among business managers develops support for neededcontrols and helps integrate information security considerationsinto the organizations business operationsPractice  Manage Risk on a Continuing BasisInformation security is definitely a journey not adestinationthere are always new challenges to meet Chief information security officer at a major financialservices corporationThe organizations emphasized the importance of continuousattention to security to ensure that controls were appropriate andeffective They stressed that constant vigilance was needed toensure that controls remained appropriateaddressing current risksand not unnecessarily hindering operationsand that individualswho used and maintained information systems complied withorganizational policiesSuch attention is important for all types of internal controlsbut it is especially important for security over computerizedinformation because as mentioned previously the factors thataffect computer security are constantly changing in todays dynamicenvironment Such changing factors include threats systemstechnologies and configurations known vulnerabilities in existingsoftware the level of reliance on automated systems and electronicdata and the sensitivity of such operations and dataExisting Federal Guidance Provides a Framework for ImplementingRisk Management PracticesOMBs  revision of Circular A Appendix III recognizesthat federal agencies have had difficulty in performing effectiverisk assessmentsexpending resources on complex assessments ofspecific risks with limited tangible benefits in terms of improvedsecurity For this reason the revised circular eliminates alongstanding federal requirement for formal risk assessmentsInstead it promotes a riskbased approach and suggests thatrather than trying to precisely measure risk agencies focus ongenerally assessing and managing risks This approach is similar tothat used by the organizations we studiedSimilarly the concept of holding program managers accountableunderlies the existing federal process for accrediting systems foruse Accreditation is detailed in NISTs Federal InformationProcessing Standards Publication  Guideline for ComputerSecurity Certification and Accreditation which was published in According to NIST

retailing companyManaging the increased risks associated with a highlyinterconnected computing environment demands increased centralcoordination to ensure that weaknesses in one organizational unitssystems do not place the entire organizations information assetsat undue risk Each of the organizations we studied had adoptedthis view and within the last few years primarily since  hadestablished a central security management group or reoriented anexisting central security group to facilitate and oversee theorganizations information security activities As such thecentral group served as the focal point for coordinating activitiesassociated with the four segments of the risk management cycleAs discussed in the previous section on risk analysis thecentral security groups served primarily as advisers or consultantsto the business units and thus they generally did not have theability to independently dictate information security practicesHowever most possessed considerable clout across theirorganizations due largely to the support they received from theirorganizations senior management In this regard their viewswereGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page sought and respected by the organizations business managersThe following case example describes how one organizationstrengthened its central security group and reoriented itsfocusCase Example Transforming an Organizations Central SecurityFocal PointIn  realizing that security was an essential element of itsefforts to innovatively use information technology a majormanufacturer significantly reorganized and strengthened its centralinformation security function Prior to the reorganization acentral security group of about four individuals concentrated onmainframe security administration and had little interaction withthe rest of the company Since then the central group has grown toinclude  individuals who manage the security of the companys main network  decentralized computer operations and Internet use In addition the group participates in thecompanys strategic planning efforts and in the early stages ofsoftware development projects to ensure that security implicationsof these efforts are addressed In this regard it serves as acommunications conduit between management and the informationsystems staff who design build and implement newapplicationsMembers of the central group possess a variety of technicalskills and have specific information security responsibilitiessuch as developing policy maintaining the firewall that protectsthe organizations network from unauthorized intrusions orsupporting security staff assigned to individual business unitsAccording to the groups manager because of the shift in thecentral groups responsibilities the members of the group had tochange their mindset from a staff organization to a serviceorganization They had to be willing to work with business managersto enable rather than to control business operationsPractice  Designate a Central Group to Carry Out KeyActivitiesOverall the central security groups served as  catalysts forensuring that information security risks were considered in bothplanned and ongoing operations  central resources for adviceand expertise to units throughout their organizations and  aconduit for keeping top management informed about securityrelatedissues and activities affecting the organization In additionthese central groups were able to achieve some efficiencies andincrease consistency in the implementation of the organizationssecurity program by performing tasks centrally that might otherwisebe performed by multiple individual business unitsSpecific activities performed by central groups differedsomewhat primarily because they relied to a varying extent onsecurity managers and administrators in subordinate units and onother organizationally separate groups such as disaster recoveryor emergency response teams Examples of the most common activitiescarried out by central groups are described belowDeveloping and adjusting organizationwide policies and guidancethus reducing redundant policyrelated activities across theorganizations units For example the manufacturers centralsecurity group recently revamped the companys entire informationsecurity manual and dedicated one staff member to maintainingitEducating employees and other users about current informationsecurity risks and helping to ensure consistent understanding andadministration of policies through helpline telephone numberspresentations to business units and written informationcommunicated electronically or through paper memosInitiating discussions on information security risks withbusiness managers and conducting defined risk assessmentproceduresMeeting periodically with senior managers to discuss thesecurity implications of new information technology uses beingconsideredResearching potential threats vulnerabilities and controltechniques and communicating this information to others in theorganization Many of the organizations supplemented knowledgegained from their own experiences by frequently perusingprofessional publications alerts and other information availablein print and through the Internet Several mentioned the importanceof networking with outside organizations such as the InternationalInformation Integrity Institute the European Security Forum andthe Forum of Incident Response and SecurityGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Teams to broaden their knowledge One senior security officernoted Sharing information and solutions is important Manyorganizations are becoming more willing to talk with outsidersabout security because they realize that despite differingmissions and cultures they all use similar technology and facemany of the same threatsMonitoring various aspects of the organizationssecurityrelated activities by testing controls accounting for thenumber and types of security incidents and evaluating compliancewith policies The central groups often characterized theseevaluative activities as services to the business unitsEstablishing a computer incident response capability and insome cases serving as members of the emergency response teamAssessing risks and identifying needed policies and controls forgeneral support systems such as organizationwide networks orcentral data processing centers that supported multiple businessunits For example some central groups controlled all newconnections to the organizations main network ensuring that theconnecting network met minimum security requirements Similarlyone organizations central group was instrumental in acquiring astrong user authentication system to help ensure that network usecould be reliably traced to the individual users Further mostcentral groups oversaw Internet useCreating standard data classifications and related definitionsto facilitate protection of data shared among two or more businessunitsReviewing and testing the security features in both commerciallydeveloped software that was being considered for use and internallydeveloped software prior to its being moved into production Forexample the manufacturing companys central group reviewed all newInternet related applications and had the authority to stop suchapplications from going into production if minimum securitystandards were not met Similarly the central informationprotection group at the utility was required to approve all newapplications to indicate that risks had been adequatelyconsideredProviding selfassessment tools to business units so that theycould monitor their own security posture For example thefinancial services corporation provided business units withsoftware tools and checklists so that they would assumeresponsibility for identifying and correcting weaknesses ratherthan depending on auditors to identify problemsPage  GAOAIMD Information Security ManagementPractice  Provide the Central Group Ready and IndependentAccess to Senior ExecutivesSenior information security managers emphasized the importanceof being able to discuss security issues with senior executivesSeveral noted that to be effective these senior executives had tobe in a position to act and effect change across organizationaldivisions The ability to independently voice security concerns tosenior executives was viewed as important because such concernscould often be at odds with business managers and systemdevelopers desires to implement new computer applications quicklyand avoid controls that would impede efficiency user friendlinessand convenience This ability to elevate significant securityconcerns to higher management levels helped ensure that risks werethoroughly understood and that decisions as to whether such risksshould be tolerated were carefully considered before finaldecisions were madeThe organizational positions of the central groups varied Mostwere located two levels below the Chief Information Officer CIOHowever the groups reporting directly to the CIO or to an evenmore senior official viewed this as an advantage because itprovided them greater independence Several others said thatdespite their lower organizational position they felt free tocontact their CIOs and other senior executives when importantsecurity issues arose and they were relatively unrestrained by theneed to go through the chain of command Some noted that seniormanagers frequently called them to discuss security issues Forexample at the nonbank financial institution the senior securitymanager was organizationally placed two levels below the CIO butshe met independently with the CIO once every quarter Also duringthe first three months of  she had met twice with theorganizations chief executive officer at his request to discussthe security implications of new applicationsIn contrast several federal information security officials toldus that they felt that their organizations were placed too low inthe organizational structure to be effective and that they hadlittle or no opportunity to discuss information security issueswith their CIOs and other senior agency officialsRather than depend on the personal interest of individual seniormanagers two of the organizations we studied had establishedseniorlevel committees to ensure that information technologyissues including information security received appropriateattention For example the universitys central group had createda committee of respected university technical and policy experts todiscuss and build consensus about the importance of certaininformation security issues reported to senior management thuslending weight and credibility to concerns raised by the centralsecurity officeGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Practice  Designate Dedicated Funding and StaffUnlike many federal agencies the central groups we studied haddefined budgets which gave them the ability to plan and set goalsfor their organizations information security program At aminimum these budgets covered central staff salaries and trainingand security hardware and software At one organization businessunits could supplement the central groups resources in order toincrease the central groups participation in high priorityprojects While all of the central groups had staffs ranging from to  people permanently assigned to the group comparing the sizeof these groups is of limited value because of wide variations inthe  sizes of the organizations we studied  inherentriskiness of their operations and  the additional support thegroups received from other organizational components and fromnumerous subordinate security managers and administratorsIn particular no two groups were alike regarding the extent ofsupport they received from other organizational units For examplethe computer vendor relied on a security manager in each of theorganizations four regional business units while the utilitysninemember central group relied on  parttime informationsecurity coordinators at various levels within the company Somecentral groups relied heavily on technical assistance located inanother organizational unit while others had significant technicalexpertise among their own staff and thus were much more involvedin directly implementing and testing controlsDespite these differences two key characteristics were commonto each of the organizations  information securityresponsibilities had been clearly defined for the groups involvedand  dedicated staff resources had been provided to carry outthese responsibilities The following table summarizes the detailson the size and structure of the organizations informationsecurity staffsPlacement and Staffing of Eight Central Information SecurityManagement Groups Practice  Enhance Staff Professionalism andTechnical SkillsThe organizations had taken steps to ensure that personnelinvolved in various aspects of their information security programshad the skills and knowledge they needed In addition theyrecognized that staff expertise had to be frequently updated tokeep abreast of ongoing changes in threats vulnerabilitiessoftware security techniques and security monitoring toolsFurther most of the organizations were striving to increase theprofessional stature of their staff in order to gain respect fromothers in their organizations and attract competent individuals tosecurityrelated positionsUpdate Skills and Knowledge of Security Managers andSpecialistsThe training emphasis for staff in the central securitymanagement groups many of whom came to their groups withsignificant technical expertise was on keeping staff skills andknowledge current This was accomplished primarily throughattendance at technical conferences and specialized courses ontopics such as the security features of new software as well asnetworking with other security professionals and reviewing thelatest technical literature and bulletins To maximize the value ofexpenditures on external training and events one central grouprequired staff members who attended these events to brief others inthe central group on what they had learnedIn an effort to significantly upgrade the expertise ofinformation security officers in its various business units thecentral group at the financial services corporation had recentlyarranged for an outside firm to provide  weeks of training forthese individuals The training which is planned to take place inweek increments throughout the year is expected to entail abroad range of securityrelated topics including generalinformation security encryption access control and how to builda better working relationship with the corporations technicalinformation systems groupCiting an emerging trend the senior information securitymanagers had also started to create information security careerpaths and stress professional certification for securityspecialists In particular many organizations were encouragingtheir staff to become Certified Information Systems SecurityProfessionals CISSP One security manager noted that securityspecialistsThe CISSP certification was established by the InternationalInformation Systems Security Certification Consortium Theconsortium was established as a joint effort of several informationsecurityrelated organizations including the Information SystemsSecurity Association and the Computer Security Institute todevelop a certification program for information securityprofessionalsPage  GAOAIMD Information Security Managementalso needed excellent communication skills if they were toeffectively fulfill their roles as consultants and facilitators forbusiness managers who were less technically expert regardingcomputers and telecommunicationsEducate System AdministratorsIncreasing the expertise of system administrators presenteddifferent challenges System administrators are important becausethey generally perform daytoday security functions such ascreating new system user accounts issuing new passwords andimplementing new software These tasks must be completed properlyand promptly or controls such as passwords and related accessrestrictions will not provide the level of protection intended Inaddition system administrators are the first line of defenseagainst security intrusions and are generally in the best positionto notice unusual activity that may indicate an intrusion or othersecurity incident However at the organizations we studied as atfederal agencies security is often a collateral duty rather thana fulltime job and the individuals assigned frequently havelimited technical expertise As a result the effectiveness ofindividual system administrators in maintaining security controlsand spotting incidents is likely to varyTo enhance the technical skills of their security administratorsand help ensure that all of them had the minimal skills neededmost of the groups had established special training sessions forthem For examplethe manufacturer required new security administrators to spend to  daysin training with the central security group depending on theirtechnicalskills before they were granted authority to perform specificfunctions onthe network such as controlling the users access rightsthe central security group at the university held annualtechnicalconferences for the universitys systems administrators andengagedprofessional training organizations to offer oncampus trainingat veryreduced rates andthe state agency held a biannual conference for systemsadministratorsthat included sessions related to their information securityresponsibilitiesAttract and Keep Individuals with Technical SkillsMost of the groups cited maintaining or increasing the technicalexpertise among their security staff as a major challenge largelydue to the high demandGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page for information technology experts in the job market Inresponse several said they offered higher salaries and specialbenefits to attract and keep expert staff For example thefinancial services corporation provided competitive pay based onsurveys of industry pay levels attempted to maintain a challengingwork environment and provided flexible work schedules andtelecommuting opportunities that allowed most of the staff to workat home  day a week In addition provisions were made for staffto do the type of work they preferred such as software testingversus giving presentationsOrganizations relied on both internally and externally developedand presented training courses sometimes engaging contractors orothers to assist For example the state information securityoffice above the state agency worked with an information securityprofessional organization to provide a relatively lowcoststatewide training conference The state organization providedmeeting rooms and administrative support while the professionalorganization used its professional contacts to obtain knowledgeablespeakersThe organizations viewed information security policies as thefoundation of their information security programs and the basis foradopting specific procedures and technical controls As with anyarea of operations written policies are the primary mechanism bywhich management communicates its views and requirements to itsemployees clients and business partners For informationsecurity as with other types of internal controls these views andrequirements generally flow directly from risk considerations asillustrated in the management cycle depicted aboveAs discussed earlier our discussions with the eightorganizations focused on their methods for developing andsupporting policies and guidelines We did not discuss the specificcontrols they had implemented due to the proprietary and oftenhighly technical nature of this informationPractice  Link Policies to Business RisksThe organizations stressed the importance of uptodate policiesthat made sense to users and others who were expected to understandthem Many senior security managers told us that prior to therecent strengthening of their security programs theirorganizations information security policies had been neglected andoutofdate thus failing to address significant risks associatedwith their current interconnected computing environment As aresult developing a comprehensive set of policies was one of theirfirst steps in establishing an effective corporatewide securityprogram In addition they emphasized the importance of adjustingpolicies continually to respond to newly identified risks or areasof misunderstanding For exampleAt the financial services corporation the central securitygroup routinelyanalyzed the causes of security weaknesses identified bymanagement andby auditors in order to identify policy and related controldeficienciesThe university had recently developed more explicit policies onsystemadministrator responsibilities in recognition of the criticalrole of systemadministration in a distributed environmentThe manufacturing company had recently drafted policies onsecurityincident response after an incident had exposed shortfalls inthe companysguidance in this areaA relatively new risk area receiving particular attention inorganizational policies was user behavior Many policies areimplemented and to some extent enforced by technical controlssuch as logical access controls that prevent individuals fromreading or altering data in an unauthorized manner However manyinformation security risks cannot be adequately mitigated withtechnical controls because they are a function of user behavior Ina networked environment these risks are magnified because aproblem on one computer can affect an entire network of computerswithin minutes and because users are likely to have easier accessto larger amounts of data and the ability to communicate quicklywith thousands of others For example users may accidentallydisclose sensitive information to a large audience throughelectronic mail or introduce damaging viruses that are subsequentlytransmitted to the organizations entire network of computers Inaddition some users may feel no compunction against browsingsensitive organizational computer files or inappropriate Internetsites if there is no clear guidance on what types of user behaviorare acceptableTo address these risks many of which did not exist prior toextensive use of networks electronic mail and the Internet theorganizations had begun placingGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page more emphasis on user behavior in their policies and guidelinesFor example the universitys policies went beyond the traditionalwarnings against password disclosure by including prohibitionsagainst a variety of possible user actions These includedmisrepresenting their identity in electronic communications andconducting and promoting personal commercial enterprises on thenetwork The senior security officer at this organization notedthat when rules such as this are aimed at users it is especiallyimportant that they be stated in clearly understandable relativelynontechnical language The security officers at the computer vendorsaid that because the companys information security policiesemphasized user behavior they were included in the organizationsemployee code of conductPractice  Distinguish Between Policies and GuidelinesDetailed guidelines are an important supplement to the officialpolicies because they educate users and serve as an awarenesstool Security manager at a prominent financial institutionA common technique for making organizational informationsecurity policies more useful was to divide them into two broadsegments concise highlevel policies and more detailed informationreferred to as guidelines or standards Policies generally outlinedfundamental requirements that top management considered to beimperative while guidelines provided more detailed rules forimplementing the broader policies Guidelines while encouragedwere not considered to be mandatory for all business unitsDistinguishing between organizational policies and guidelinesprovided several benefits It allowed senior management toemphasize the most important elements of information securitypolicy provided some flexibility to unit managers made policieseasier for employees to understand and in some cases reduced theamount of formal review needed to finalize updated policiesGuidelines Can Serve As An Educational ToolSeveral security managers said that short policies thatemphasized the most important aspects of the organizations securityconcerns were more likely to be read and understood than voluminousand detailed policies However they noted that more detailedguidelines often provided answers to employees questions andserved as a tool for educating subordinate security managers andothers who wanted a more thorough understanding of good securitypracticesFor example the utility company had distilled the fundamentalcomponents of its information protection policies into less thanone page of text This narrative  stated that Information is acorporate asset     Information must be protected according toits sensitivity criticality and value regardless of the media onwhich it is stored the manual or automated systems that processit or the methods by which it is distributed  outlined theresponsibilities of information owners custodians and users defined the organizations three data classification categoriesand  stated that each business unit should develop aninformation protection program to implement these policies ThepolicyGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page statement then referred the reader to a page reference guidethat provided definitions recommended guidelines and proceduresexplanatory discussions and selfassessment questionnairesdesigned to assist business units in understanding the need for thepolicies and how they could be implementedGuidelines Provide for FlexibilityAlthough the latitude granted to business units variedproviding both policies and guidelines allowed business units totailor the guidelines to their own individual units informationprotection needs It also reinforced the business managers senseof ownership of their information assetsFor example the large financial services corporation haddivided its information security rules into policies andstandards Policies were mandatory highlevel requirements thatwith rare exception had to be followed An example of a policy wasthat units were required to use commercially developed softwarerather than developing unique software inhouse An example of astandard at the same institution was a prescribed minimum passwordlength At this organization deviations from policies had to bedocumented in a letter signed by both the executive of the businessgroup requesting the deviation and the central information securitygroups manager However deviations from standards required onlyapproval from the groups executive Such deviations were requiredto be documented in a letter and though not required were usuallyapproved by the central security group All deviations had to berenewed annuallyPractice  Support Policies Through the Central SecurityGroupGenerally the central security management groups wereresponsible for developing written corporatewide policies inpartnership with business managers internal auditors andattorneys In addition the central groups provided relatedexplanations guidance and support to business units Severalsecurity managers noted that business managers are much more likelyto support centrally developed policies if they clearly addressorganizational needs and are practical to implement For thisreason these organizations had developed mechanisms for involvingother organizational components in policy documentationMost often this involvement was in the form of reviews of policydrafts However the university had established an informationsecurity policy committee that included top university officialslegal counsel and representatives from student affairs facultyaffairs and internal audit to assist in the development and reviewof policiesThe central security management groups played an important rolein ensuring that policies were consistently implemented by servingas focal points for user questions By serving as a readilyavailable resource for organization employees they helped clear upmisunderstandings and provided guidance on topics that were notspecifically addressed in written guidanceMost organizations had also made their policies availablethrough their computer networks so that users could readily accessthe most uptodate version whenever they needed to refer to themIn addition many organizations required users to sign a statementthat they had read and understood the organizations informationsecurity policies Generally such statements were required fromnew users at the time access to information resources was firstprovided and from all users periodically usually once a year Onesecurity manager thought that requiring such signed statementsserved as a useful technique for impressing on the users theimportance of understanding organizational policies In additionif the user was later involved in a security violation thestatement served as evidence that he or she had been informed oforganizational policies Additional techniques for communicatinginformation security policies are discussed in the next section onpromoting awarenessUsers are much more likely to support and comply with policiesif they clearly understand the purpose for the policies and theirresponsibilities in regard to the policies Information security manager for a state agencyUser awareness is essential to successfully implementinginformation security policies and ensuring that related controlsare working properly Computer users and others with access toinformation resources cannot be expected to comply with policiesthat they are not aware of or do not understand Similarly if theyare not aware of the risks associated with their organizationsinformation resources they may not understand the need for andsupport compliance with policies designed to reduce risk For thisreason the organizations considered promoting awareness as anessential element of the risk management cyclePractice  Continually Educate Users and Others on Risks andRelated PoliciesThe central groups had implemented ongoing awareness strategiesto educate all individuals who might affect the organizationsinformation security These individuals were primarily computerusers who might be employees contractors clients or commercialpartners such as suppliers One organization took an even broaderview targeting awareness efforts also at custodians and securityguards after a night security guard accidentally destroyed someimportant data while playing games on a computer after hoursThe groups focused their efforts on increasing everyonesunderstanding of the risks associated with the organizationsinformation and the related policies and controls in place tomitigate those risks Although these efforts were generally aimedat encouraging policy compliance the senior security official atthe retailing company emphasized the importance of improving usersunderstanding of risks She said that her central security grouphad recognized that policies no matter how detailed could neveraddress every scenario that might lead to a security incident As aresult her overarching philosophy regarding awareness efforts wasthat users who thoroughly understood the risks were better equippedto use good judgment when faced with a potential security breachFor example such employees were less likely to be tricked intodisclosing sensitive information or passwordsThis last point highlights one of the most important reasons forsensitizing computer users and other employees to the importance ofinformation security Users disclosing sensitive information orpasswords in response to seemingly innocent requests from strangerseither over the phone or in person can provide intruders easyaccess to an organizations information and systems Suchtechniques often referred to as social engineering exploitusers tendencies to be cooperative and helpful instead ofguarded careful and suspicious when information is requestedWithout adequate awareness about the risks involved in disclosingsensitive information users may volunteer information which canallow an intruder to circumvent otherwise welldesigned accesscontrolsPractice  Use AttentionGetting and UserFriendlyTechniquesTo get their message across the central security groups used avariety of training and promotional techniques to makeorganizational policies readily accessible educate users on thesepolicies and keep security concerns in the forefront of usersminds Techniques used includedintranet websites that communicated and explained informationsecurityrelated policies standards procedures alerts and specialnotesawareness videos with enthusiastic endorsements from topmanagement forthe security program to supplement basic guidance such as theimportanceof backing up files and protecting passwordsinteractive presentations by security staff to various usergroups to marketthe services provided by the central information security groupand answeruser questions andsecurity awareness day and products with securityrelatedslogansThe organizations avoided having onceayear onesizefitsallsecurity briefings like those seen at many federal agencies Thesecurity managers said that it was important to relate securityconcerns to the specific risks faced by users in individualbusiness groups and ensure that security was an everydayconsiderationCase Example  Coordinating Policy Development and AwarenessActivitiesAfter experiencing a significant virus infection in  aretailing company assigned one of its managers to step up effortsto promote employee awareness of information security risks andrelated organizational policies Since then this individualsresponsibilities for information security policy development andawareness which had previously been handled on a parttime basishave evolved into a fulltime awareness manager position in theorganizations central security group The companys response to aminor incident involving the unintentional release of companyfinancial data illustrates the compatibility of these roles Toreduce the chances of a similar incident the awareness managerconcurrently  coordinated the development of a policy describingorganizational data classification standards and  developed abrochure and guidelines to publicize the new standards and educateemployees on their implementation By coordinating policydevelopment and awareness activities in this manner she helpsensure that new risks and policies are communicated promptly andthat employees are periodically reminded of existing policiesthrough means such as monthly bulletins an intranet web site andpresentations to new employeesAs with any type of business activity information securityshould be monitored and periodically reassessed to ensure thatpolicies continue to be appropriate and that controls areaccomplishing their intended purpose Over time policies andprocedures may become inadequate because of changes in threatschanges in operations or deterioration in the degree ofcompliance Periodic assessments or reports on activities can be avaluable means of identifying areas of noncompliance remindingemployees of their responsibilities and demonstrating managementscommitment to the security programThe organizations we studied had recognized that monitoringcontrol effectiveness and compliance with policies is a key step inthe cycle of managing information security Accordingly theymonitored numerous factors associated with their security programsand they used the results to identify needed improvements Theyused various techniques to do this and several mentioned theirefforts to identify evaluate and implement new more effectivetools as they become available Such tools include software thatcan be used to automatically monitor control effectiveness andinformation systems activity In addition several of the securitymanagers expressed interest in improving their ability to moreprecisely measure the costs and benefits of securityrelatedactivities so that their organizations could better determine whichcontrols and activities were the most cost effectiveGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Practice  Monitor Factors that Affect Risk and IndicateSecurity EffectivenessThe organizations focused their monitoring efforts primarily on determining if controls were in place and operating as intendedto reduce risk and evaluating the effectiveness of the security program incommunicatingpolicies raising awareness levels and reducingincidents As discussed below these efforts included testingcontrols monitoring compliance with policies analyzing securityincidents and accounting for procedural accomplishments and otherindicators that efforts to promote awareness were effectiveTesting the Effectiveness of ControlsDirectly testing control effectiveness was cited most often asan effective way to determine if the risk reduction techniques thathad been agreed to were in fact operating effectively In keepingwith their role as advisors and facilitators most of the securitymanagers said that they relied significantly on auditors to testcontrols In these cases the central security management groupskept track of audit findings related to information security andthe organizations progress in implementing corrective actionsHowever several of the central security groups also performedtheir own tests For example the central security group at theuniversity periodically ran a computer program designed to detectnetwork vulnerabilities at various individual academic departmentsand reported weaknesses to department heads A subsequent reviewwas performed a few months later to determine if weaknesses hadbeen reduced The central security manager told us that sheconsidered the tests which could be performed inexpensively by herstaff a costeffective way to evaluate this important aspect ofsecurity and provide a service to the academic departments whichwere ultimately responsible for the security of their departmentsinformation and operationsSeveral organizations periodically tested system and networkaccess controls by allowing designated individuals to try to breakinto their systems using the latest hacking techniques This typeof testing is often referred to as penetration testing Theindividuals performing the tests which at various organizationswere internal auditors contractors student interns or centralsecurity staff were encouraged to research and use hackinginstructions and tools available on the Internet or from othersources in order to simulate attacks from real hackers By allowingsuch tests the organizations could readily identify previouslyunknown vulnerabilities and either eliminate them or makeadjustments in computer and network use to lessen the risksOne organization had performed annual tests of its disasterrecovery plan to identify and correct plan weaknesses A recenttest was particularly effective because it involved a comprehensivesimulation of a real disaster The test involved staging a surprisebomb scare to get employees who were unaware that the threat wasa pretense to evacuate the building After the employees hadevacuated they were told that they were participating in a testthat they were to assume that a bomb had actually destroyed theirworkplace and to proceed with emergency recovery plans The testwhich was organized by the agencys contingency planning groupproved extremely successful in identifying plan weaknesses and indramatically sensitizing employees to the value of anticipating andbeing prepared for such eventsMonitoring Compliance With Policies and GuidelinesAll of the organizations monitored compliance withorganizational policies to some extent Much of this monitoring wasachieved through informal feedback to the central security groupfrom system administrators and others in other organizationalunits However a few organizations had developed more structuredmechanisms for such monitoring For example the utility companydeveloped quarterly reports on compliance with organizationalpolicies such as the number of organizational units that hadtailored their own information protection policies as required bycorporatelevel policy Also several organizations said that theyhad employed selfassessment tools such as the Computer SecurityInstitutes Computer Security Compliance Test to compare theirorganizations programs to preestablished criteriaAccounting For and Analyzing Security IncidentsKeeping summary records of actual security incidents is one waythat an organization can measure the frequency of various types ofviolations as well as the damage suffered from these incidentsSuch records can provide valuable input for risk assessments andbudgetary decisionsAlthough all of the organizations kept at least informal recordson incidents those that had formalized the process found suchinformation to be a valuable resource For example at the nonbankfinancial institution the central security manager kept records onviruses detected and eradicated including estimates of the cost ofpotential damage to computer files that was averted by the use ofvirus detection software This information was then used to justifyannual budget requests when additional virus detection software wasneeded However as discussed in the following case example theuniversity had developed the most comprehensive procedures foraccounting for and analyzing security incidentsCase Example Developing an Incident DatabaseA universitys central security group had developed a databasethat served as a valuable management tool in monitoring problemsreassessing risks and determining how to best use limitedresources to address the most significant information securityproblems The database accounted for the number of informationsecurity incidents that had been reported the types of incidentsand actions taken to resolve each incident including disciplinaryactions At the time of our visit in February  incidents werecategorized into  types which generally pertained to thenegative effects of the violations Examples included denial ofservice unauthorized access data compromise system damagecopyright infringement and unauthorized commercial activityBy keeping such records the central group could develop monthlyreports that showed increases and decreases in incident frequencytrends and the status of resolution efforts This in turnprovided the central security group a means of identifying emerging problems  assessing theeffectiveness of current policiesand awareness efforts determining the need for stepped up education or new controls toaddress problem areas and  monitoring the status ofinvestigative and disciplinary actions to help ensure that noindividual violation was inadvertently forgotten and thatviolations were handled consistentlyThe means of maintaining the database and the details that itcontained had changed as the number of reported incidents at theuniversity had grownfrom  or  a month in  to between  and a month in early and as the databases value as amanagement tool became more apparent Records originally maintainedin a paper logbook had been transferred to a personal computer andinformation on followup actions had recently been expandedThe universitys senior security officer noted that the databasecould be augmented to provide an even broader range of securitymanagement information For example while the university did notdevelop data on the actual cost of incidents such as the cost ofrecovering from virus infections the database could be used tocompile such information which would be useful in measuring thecost of security lapses and in determining how much to spend oncontrols to reduce such lapsesMonitoring the Effectiveness of the Central Security ManagementGroupSeveral of the central security groups had developed measures oftheir own activities outputs and expertise as an indication oftheir effectiveness Examples of these items includedthe number of calls from users indicating knowledge of andrespect forsecurity specialiststhe number of securityrelated briefings and training sessionspresentedthe number of risk assessments performedthe number of security managers and systems administrators whowereCertified Information System Security Professionals andthe number of courses and conferences held or attendedEmerging Interest in More Precisely Measuring Cost andBenefitsSeveral of the security managers expressed an interest indeveloping better measurement capabilities so that they could moreprecisely measure the ultimate benefits and drawbacks ofsecurityrelated policies and controlsthat is the positive andnegative affects of information security on business operationsHowever they said that such measurements would be difficultbecause it is costly to do the research and recordkeeping necessaryto develop information on  the full cost of controlsboth theinitial cost and operational inefficiencies associated with thecontrolsand  the full cost of incidents or problems resultingfrom inadequate controls Further as discussed previouslyregarding risk assessment actual reductions in risk cannot beprecisely quantified because sufficient data on risk factors arenot availableIn an effort to more thoroughly explore this topic we expandedour discussions beyond the eight organizations that were theprimary subjects of our study by requesting the Computer SecurityInstitute to informally poll its most active members on thissubject We also discussed assessment techniques with experts atNIST Although we identified no organizations that had madesignificant progress in applying such measures we found that moreprecisely measuring the positive and negative effects of securityon business operations is an area of developing interest among manyinformation security experts For this reason improved data andmeasurement techniques may be available in the futureGAOAIMD Information Security Management Page Practice  Use Results to Direct Future Efforts and HoldManagers AccountableAlthough monitoring in itself may encourage compliance withinformation security policies the full benefits of monitoring arenot achieved unless results are used to improve the securityprogram Analyzing the results of monitoring efforts providessecurity specialists and business managers a means ofreassessing previously identified risks  identifyingnew problem areasreassessing the appropriateness of existing controls andsecurityrelatedactivities  identifying the need for newcontrols and  redirecting subsequent monitoring efforts Forexample the central security group at the utility redirected itstraining programs in response to information security weaknessesreported by its internal auditors Similarly security specialistsat the manufacturing company recently visited one of the companysoverseas units to assist in resolving security weaknessesidentified by internal auditors The previously cited example ofusing records on virus incidents to determine the need forvirusdetection software also illustrates this pointResults can also be used to hold managers accountable for theirinformation security responsibilities Several organizations haddeveloped quarterly reporting mechanisms to summarize the status ofsecurityrelated efforts However the financial servicescorporation provided the best example of how periodic reports ofresults can be used to hold managers accountable for understandingas well as reducing the information security risks to theirbusiness units A description of this process is provided in thefollowing case exampleCase Example Measuring Control Effectiveness and ManagementAwarenessAt a major financial services corporation managers are expectedto know what their security problems are and to have plans in placeto resolve them To help ensure that managers fulfill thisresponsibility they are provided selfassessment tools that theycan use to evaluate the information security aspects of theiroperations When weaknesses are discovered the business managersare expected to either improve compliance with existing policies orconsult with the corporations security experts regarding thefeasibility of implementing new policies or control techniquesRatings based on audit findings serve as an independent measureof control effectiveness and management awareness At the start ofevery audit the auditors ask the pertinent business managers whatweaknesses exist in their operations and what corrective actionsthey have deemed necessary and have planned After audit work iscomplete the auditors compare their findings with managementsoriginal assertions to see if management was generally aware of allof the weaknesses prior to the audit The auditors then develop tworatings on a scale of  to  One rating to indicate theeffectiveness of information security controls and a second ratingto indicate the level of management awareness If the auditorsdiscover serious but previously unrecognized weaknesses themanagement awareness rating will be lowered However if theauditor finds no additional weaknesses management will receive agood awareness rating even if controls need to bestrengthenedThese ratings are forwarded to the CEO and to the board ofdirectors where they can be used as performance measuresAccording to the banks central security manager the bankchairmans goal is for all business units to have favorable ratings or  in both categories Such a rating system provides not onlya measure of performance and awareness but it also places primaryresponsibility for information security with the managers whoseoperations depend on it Further it recognizes the importance ofidentifying weaknesses and the risk they present even when theycannot be completely eliminatedPractice  Be Alert to New Monitoring Tools and TechniquesThe security specialists said that they were constantly lookingfor new tools to test the security of their computerizedoperations Two security managers noted that their organizationshad implemented new more sophisticated software tools formonitoring network vulnerabilities However several securitymanagers said that the development of automated monitoring tools islagging behind the introduction of new computer and networktechnologies and that this has impaired their efforts to detectincidents especially unauthorized intrusions Similarly asdiscussed previously managers are looking for practical techniquesfor more precisely measuring the value of security controls andobtaining better data on risk factors In such an environment itis essential that  security specialists keep abreast ofdeveloping techniques and tools and the latest information aboutsystem vulnerabilities and  senior executives ensure they havethe resources to do thisSeveral security managers told us that in addition to readingcurrent professional literature their involvement withprofessional organizations was a valuable means of learning aboutthe latest monitoring tools and research efforts Examples of suchorganizations included the Computer Security Institute InformationSystems Security Association the Forum of Incident Response andSecurity Teams and less formal discussion groups of securityprofessionals associated with individual industry segments Severalsecurity managers said that by participating in our study theyhoped to gain insights on how to improve their information securityprogramsConclusionWe are on the verge of a revolution that is just as profound asthe change in the economy that came with the industrial revolutionSoon electronic networks will allow people to transcend thebarriers of time and distance and take advantage of global marketsand business opportunities not even imaginable today opening up anew world of economic possibility and progressVice President Albert Gore Jr in the Administrations July report A Framework For Global Electronic CommerceTo achieve the benefits offered by the new era of computerinterconnectivity the federal government like otherorganizational entities and individuals must find ways to addressthe associated security implications Individual security controlsand monitoring tools will change as technology advances and newrisks are likely to emerge For this reason it is essential thatorganizations such as federal agencies establish managementframeworks for dealing with these changes on an ongoing basisDeveloping an information security program that adheres to thebasic principles outlined in this guide is the first and most basicstep that an agency can take to build an effective securityprogram In this regard agencies must continually  explore andassess information security risks to business operations determine what policies standards and controls are worthimplementing to reduce these risks  promote awareness andunderstanding among program managers computer users and systemsdevelopment staff and assess compliance and control effectiveness As with othertypes of internal controls this is a cycle of activity not anexercise with a defined beginning and endBy instituting such a management framework agencies canstrengthen their current security posture facilitate future systemand process improvement efforts and more confidently takeadvantage of technology advancesAppendix IGAO Guides on Information Technology ManagementExecutive Guide
