                                 Can You Kill Someone Twice                        Murder Isnt Always a Crime claims the tag line for the new movieDoubleJeopardy  in which Libby Parsons Ashley Judd is framed by her husbandin his faked murder Upon her release from prison she plans to kill himforreal this timesince as everyone knows you cant be prosecuted twice forthe same crime If this plot were real could Libby get away with it            Legal precedent for these circumstances is lacking However most legalexperts agree that the Libby would go back to prison for the secondmurdereven though the courts records would show that she was convicted ofkilling the victim years ago            Libbys defense in the moviedouble jeopardyis derived from the FifthAmendment of the Constitution which says that no person shall be subject forthe same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb Libbys problemis that double jeopardy can only be claimed when multiple prosecutions arisefrom a single criminal action For example a double jeopardy defensewould certainly fail if a defendant claimed that he couldnt be prosecuted fora second assault on a victim just because he was convicted of assaulting hertwo years earlier            The obvious objection to this analogy is that while you can clearly assaultsomeone twice you can only kill a person once Therefore the evidence thatwould prove Libbys guilt in one crime would necessarily clear her of theother The problem with this defense is that the court is free to overturn ordisregard earlier factual findings if new evidencesay a recently killedbodyproves them to have been incorrect Libby would have welcomed thisflexibility if the court had discovered that her husband was alive while shewas still imprisoned If the state or Libbys defense lawyer grosslymismanaged the first case in a way that resulted in her wrongful convictionshe might be able to sue for damages But it would not affect her secondtrial            If convicted in a second trial Libby might argue that she had alreadyserved her time and should be set free Depending on the state in which themurder was committed the court might have some leeway in reducing Libbyssentence But convicted murderers are almost never given suspended sentencesand in Libbys case the circumstances might increase her punishment because themurder was premeditated            Next question                           Explainer thanks                                  Slate                               reader Mason Stockstill forsuggesting the question and King County Washington Superior Court JudgeWilliam Downing for helping to answer it
