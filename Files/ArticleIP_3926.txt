       Slate                speculates in the Aug  FlytrapToday and beyond on whether President Clinton will issue a meaculpa for his stillalleged transgression debates the value of anyphysical evidence that may confirm he had consensual sex with former WhiteHouse intern Monica Lewinsky and reports how weird inexplicably weird it isto see Lewinsky in the flesh before her grand jury testimony Like others inthe national press you seek to elevate what you call this Flytrap flap tothe level of scandals such as Watergate or IranContra At the same time youlower the level of political discourse in                   Slate                to that of theNational Enquirer  building on harmful hearsay while generally ignoringquestions about the partisan motives and support behind Starrs seeminglyinterminable investigations            Gimme a break Flytrap isnothing but a flyspeck when compared with presidential scandals of the pastYet thanks to the efforts of conservative Clintonhaters and a scandalhungrypress it has become a major story that threatens to undermine the valuablework Clinton has done in boosting our nations economy cleaning up ourenvironment advancing the needs of the poor and middleclass supporting awomans right to choose making improvements in our education system a toppriority and asserting both American might and values abroad All that is realnews The Lewinsky imbroglio is nothing but an opportunity for the media todabble in salaciousness That                   Slate                is following suit makes mequestion my subscription

                  Yourrelentless preoccupation with Clinton and Monica in Flytrap Today and elsewherehas finally pissed me off As a Canadian this clearly is not a matter of mypolitical affiliation but as a Canadian it is also clear that the concerns of                  Slate                have very little appeal outside the United States             DonaldThom Ottawa                           Give

Aug  Culturebox and though I believe she has been less than fair inseveral of her comments about my work I am nevertheless indebted to her fortaking up some of the questions I raised about Holocaust scholarship in theJune issue of Commentary             To begin with though Iconsider some of the things being written about the Holocaust by feministscholars to be offensive even shocking I have never suggested answering themwith censorship or anything of the sort I am only in favor of subjecting themto criticism which is what I have done in the pages of Commentary  andwhich I was heartened to see Shulevitz has herself now done in                  Slate                           Nor do I believe that theextermination of Europes Jews is a religious topic that is or should bebeyond discussion I made it quite clear in Commentary that I favorserious research and teaching about the Holocaust in a university setting andI have never suggested otherwise I do however oppose the propagation ofnonsensea word that applies with precision to many things being written thesedays The OferWeitzman book Women in the Holocaust  rightly held upfor disapproval by Shulevitz is by no means the worst of its kind Readers whowant to see how memory of the Holocaust is being twisted in the service of acontemporary political cause should turn to the August issue ofCommentary and examine some of the passages I quote from the writings ofJoan Ringelheim director of education at the US Holocaust Memorial MuseumShe is hardly a marginal academic in a fringe institution in fact sheoccupies one of the most important positions in the field            Finally I was more than alittle troubled and perplexed by the charge that I engage in distortion In theonly instance Shulevitz provides I stand accused of taking a word from anobscure feminist source and repeating it throughout my piece for rhetoricaleffect She also suggests without elaborating that I have committed othereven more serious distortions            Yet the one example Shulevitzputs forward is about as thin as the paper                   Slate                is not printedon Far from incessantly repeating the word malestream I use it only twiceAnd I hardly drew it from a hard to find source I was citing a basic text aspecial issue of the journal Contemporary Jewry devoted to gender andthe Holocaust referenced in virtually every book on this subject I hope I amnot being shrill in pointing out that this journal is readily available inthe New York Public Library which Shulevitz claims to have combed            Culturebox we are told intends to make a habit of ruling on disputes ofthe sort I provoked in Commentary  Shulevitz would help it acquire somewelcome credibility in its rulings if she were also to make a habit of beingfair             GabrielSchoenfeld Senior editor Commentary New York City                           JudithShulevitz replies                                       Gabriel Schoenfeld has apoint and Cultureboxwho sometimes writes too much too fastmust concedeit The word censorship was illchosen Schoenfeld doesnt have the authorityto censor anybody and was only exercising his right as a critic to damn entirefields of endeavor What Culturebox ought to have said is that as aresponsible critic at a publication as serious as Commentary  Schoenfeldshould think about the language he uses when he does damn entire fields ofendeavor Is everything that comes out of the latterday study of women and theHolocaust Culturebox says latterday because he exempts chroniclers of theghetto from his criticisms execrable one of the worst excesses ofHolocaust studies and nakedly ideological It is true that he only usesmalestream twice but he quotes it in order to imply that feministseverywhere are using it at every turn Mainstream scholarship on the Nazigenocide we are being told on every side is not so much mainstream asmalestream  There isnt a field of study Culturebox couldnt makeridiculous simply by quoting its more unappealing jargon Does Schoenfeldreally mean to compare women writing about women who died in the camps with anarrow cult living somewhere on a commune and insisting on a macabre sisterhoodwith the dead Jewish women of Europe                                       Strangeas it may seem to a journalist writing outside the academy attacks asmeanspirited as his have real consequences inside the academyparticularly onthe funding tenuring and acceptance of scholars under attack Just ask anyliterature professor how quickly English French and German departmentsflushed out their theory mavens once deconstruction became a dirty word Or tryto find a job for a PhD specializing in cultural studies now that Alan Sokalhas made a laughingstock of the field Not that these particular movementsdidnt deserve ridicule mind you But it behooves both Schoenfeld andCulturebox with the prestige and reach of magazines such as Commentaryand Slate behind them to pause for a deep breath before we relegateentire categories of scholarship to the dustbin of intellectualhistory                                       Snakepit                        Thanks somuch David Edelstein for planning my weekend for me Make that canceling myweekend because prior to reading your review of Snake Eyes in TrigonometryI had planned to see the actual movie version and now I neednt bother Yourreview not only told me I would hate the ending but gave such detaileddescriptions of half the shots in the film that I was left with the feeling Ihad already seen the entire thing All I need now is a CD of the music and abag of popcorn Your writing has the power to evoke strong visual images in theminds eye and for that very reason I feel you should show restraint whenreviewing a film early in its release I found myself thanking the celluloidgods I had missed your review of The Crying Game              JudithSpencer Fort Worth Texas                           DavidEdelstein replies                                       Thesequence I detailed was from the middle of the picture occupied about minutes of screen time and was evoked because it illustrated De Palmas filmsyntax better than the usual dumb adjectives I didnt give away any plotsurprises read the review in the New York Times if you want to knowthem I didnt even say who the villain was although its so obviousand iseven in the coming attractionsas many critics have And if I think that theending is a major dud and DONT say so in print then as a critic Ive beenderelict in my dutiesespecially if said undescribed ending left anotherwise friendly audience pissed off See Snake Eyes next weekend andlet me know if I really spoiled it for you                                       Why GuiltMay Set You Free                        In EverydayEconomics Steven E Landsburg misses the point when he compares thedamage done by letting  guilty people go free with the damage done byconvicting one innocent person He is right to try to quantify the costs buthe should include all the costs            The trouble with a legalsystem that allows a significant probability of convicting innocent people isthat it allows unscrupulous prosecutors to become petty tyrants Will you standup to an official who can put you at significant risk of conviction with atrumpedup case Private enemies could also tyrannize each other What will youdo if your neighbor threatens to frame you for some crime and you know thecourts might convict you on borderline evidence Landsburg should count notonly the cost to innocent people of going to jail but also the cost in libertywhen they must cave in to threats of slander or malicious prosecution            We see this now in our tortsystem where innocent parties routinely cave in to threats of lawsuits            Of courseBlackstone knew that it would be better to convict one innocent person than let criminals go free if the effects were limited to those  cases He wasconcerned with the effect on everyone else             WalterStromquist Berwyn Pa                           Addressyour email to the editors to
