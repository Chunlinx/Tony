                                 The Return of the LWord                        Dear Brent            Well I know Bradleys formal announcement is hardly newshes been runningfor president for years now hasnt hebut I was struck by the stories thismorning Never mind the aw shucks stuff We expected that Also the now derigueur claims that hell restore the dignity of the Oval Office wont bedriven by polls etc etc What interested me was his unabashedoldfashioned capitalLliberal pitch Hes really running on the idea ofhelping poor peoplestrengthening the weak and challenging the strong andspreading the new stockmarket prosperity to the least among us            Im not complaining more power to him if he can pull it off But it sort ofamazes me that he thinks it will work in late s America Just a few yearsago the very word liberal was taboo And the ever astute Clinton would nomore claim to be a liberal than he would try a tell a story about himselfwithout spin Remember all that stuff about triangulating and the Democratsas the party of the suburban middle class I didnt think Id see anotherdeclared liberal Democrat in my lifetime outside of New York City of courseAnd what I really wonder is Could Bradley be on to somethingpolitically            Is the metoo generation finally growing up and looking beyond itself Isthe comfortable middle class so comfortable now that people feel they canafford to be liberal again Arthur Schlesinger Jr always told us this wouldhappen that American politics run in cycles of conservative constraint andliberal largesseand I suppose in his own way Bush too has signaled that hesees a new mood dawning With compassionate conservatism he too is bankingon a sense that the public wants to think of itself as generous again nowgenerous caring altruistic andyes lets face itliberal The questionremains of course how  What can we as a nation really do to help thepoor and the left out And Bushs ostensibly conservative ideas could turn outto be more effectively liberal than Bradleys more conventionallyliberal ones But I must say Im struck by the shift in rhetoricand what itsays about both mens readings of the national mood            Which brings us back to where we were yesterday Are there other means ofachieving equal opportunity than with preferences It sounds as if you and Iagree completely on that The answer is education and what I calldevelopment Narrow the gap in blackwhite school achievement and you wontneed to put your thumb on the scale of college admissions or hiring orpromotions or anything else And yes I agree Ward Connerly took a principledstand for just that longterm solution when he endorsed the ACLU suit pressingfor better schools in poor areas of California But the question here too itseems to me is precisely how do you do it How do we make the schools reallywork for poor kids What do we do about the parenting that doesnt prepare themfor school How do we counteract the peer pressure that tells them not tobother in class because its acting white And who exactly should be doingall thisthe government or the charitable private sector or some combinationof the two            Im sorry if I sound like a broken record but I always come back to thesame question the means Im thrilled that the public may be feeling morecompassionate now But thats only the beginning of the conversation not theend of it The deviland answeris in the details We may all be liberalsagain now but what exactly are we going to do about it            All bestTamar
