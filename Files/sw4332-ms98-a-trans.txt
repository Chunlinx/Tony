                well i guess theres a lot of uh complex issues here some of which are moral and some are um   more logistical as to the merits capital punishment i suppose the uh the moral ones are are the more nebulous when it comes to trying to discuss and the logistic ones i guess are uh i suppose a reasonable default on um issues the moral issue would be just let everybody live and not um not try and make those kind of judgmental errors but that goes and affects the logistical ones in that now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldnt have to i suppose that might actually be a uh pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though   oh yeah i guess it has to do with uh what anger revenge   yeah yeah   oh what human life is worth and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody   yep yeah those are all good ones i suppose uh another one is um if you do decide that its uh you know you want to do this is somebody capable of making the judgment rationally you know do we have the um do we really have that ability to go out and judge somebodys crime all these circumstances and other stuff and weigh it   you mean do we have the right or are you talking logistical here   can we really do it are we are we that good that we can really do it its like uh like nuclear power plants you know its a great idea but logistically we just havent been able to get our act together well enough to   well that i think you can take that nice simple nice simple  nice problematical logistical argument and say well are you morally able to make a mistake you know what what is uh is it all right to guess wrong once in a while   um yeah yeah   and if its if its not acceptable to ever make a mistake you know ever sentence somebody to death that shouldnt be   yeah exactly   then uh you cant use the death penalty   yeah or shouldnt   well yeah okay   shouldnt be using it theres a lot of cants and shouldnts and donts and stuff that seem to be pretty well ignored these days um   so what are they doing down in uh Georgia   well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i dont know if um if they executed anybody on it recently i dont think so uh i dont know you know its gotten to the point where something like that if i see it in the paper or hear about it its just kind of like in one ear and out the other some state recently executed somebody where was that Texas   oh   i havent heard about any lately uh Florida was doing a few werent they   yeah what kind of crimes is it that they usually do this for murders big murders   uh yeah usual serial killers or multiple murders like if uh you know somebody kills a family or   yeah yeah what did they uh give Jeffrey Dahlmer what did they do to him   didnt they lock him away in a uh psychological ward   uh that would make too much sense   no no they didnt they didnt they just let sent him to prison thats right   yeah yeah seemed to me it was a relatively senseless thing to do with somebody that was so rare something kind of wasteful not that um not that we need more or anything like that         yeah that was a bizarre case and i guess are they did the government federal government pass some recent um regulation something about for certain certain crimes uh if um theres a gun involved or something like that the death penalty is automatic or is there something like that out there   uh well theres something like that and theres always proposals to uh make punishment nastier   yeah   you know or whenever somebody gets off lightly somebody visible gets off lightly they you know the judge has what like a range of sentences he can give like three to ten   yeah theres some real yeah theyre theyre often does seem to be backlash against light things   and he gets the   i guess occasionally theres some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh Jim Bakker getting forty five years thats that seemed like justice but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced him or something like that i dont know if they changed it   yeah theres a general impression that uh these snakes get off eventually uh like Klaus Von Bulow     yeah   who will i guess
