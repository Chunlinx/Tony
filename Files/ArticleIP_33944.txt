love traitor and arepulsive pariah The Mirror described him as a cad and a love rat who gives otherrodents a bad name Hewitts offense is that he has written a book of memoirsand sold the rights to another tabloid the Mail on Sunday  for areported             Thebook is presumed to draw on  love letters written to him by the late princessduring their fiveyear affair that according to the Mirror

over tothe royal family Hewitt then successfully sued to get them back but promisedto keep them private His lawyer said Sunday that he intended to keep hispromise but the Mirror reported that hurtful claims based on theletters have already been published in American magazines It also notedcoolly that Ferretti  is extremely ill with cancer in the south ofFrance            Thetwo warring tabloids were united in pious indignation against the Mail onSunday for buying the serialization rights The Mirror called thepaper treacherous and hypocritical while the Sun said The Sunbegs everyone to refuse to pay out for the book And we urge every newspaper totell Hewitt to get lost They were divided however about whether a statue ofthe princess should be erected as a memorial to her The Mirror  whichis prostatue has attacked the queen for having expensive monuments made toseveral of her dead dogs but refusing to support one for Diana It claimedMonday in its frontpage lead that the pop singer Elton

in Angola the country where she spearheaded hercampaign In Angola government forces and Unita rebels are again laying minesmore intensively than ever it said While the land mine has been proscribedby threequarters of UN members not including Russia China India andmostimportantthe United States Angola remains its macabre shop window thepaper said It and Kosovo were the two countries that have seen most mines laidin the past year            InParis the daily Libration published an interview Monday with Jonas Savimbithe leader of Angolas Unita rebel movement who was a hero of the UnitedStates when Ronald Reagan was president but has now been abandoned by itSavimbi who still controls about twothirds of Angolas territory blamed hisloss of international standing on American opportunism Until  we wereuseful for fighting the Russians and the Cubans in Angola he said Andwithout false modesty by comparison with Nicaragua and Afghanistan we werethe Wests best freedom fighters But once the Russians and the Cubans leftthe United States had no use for Unita Since the big American change of the election of Bill Clinton it has contacted us only to ask us to sign oursurrender and to consent to our political even physical liquidation Theinterview which Libration claims is Savimbis first in two yearscontained no reference to land mines            As thepeople of East Timor voted Monday on their future the International Herald Tribune rana comment from Hong Kong blaming the West for exacerbating thetragedy by its romantic passion for encouraging the pettiest of nationalismsnot least that of the  inhabitants of half a small island in anarchipelago populated by  million The writer Philip Bowring said thatthe West is in the grip of selfrighteous moralising over preserving colonialboundaries left by the Portuguese If the issue here is Timorese identity whynot a chance for independence for all of Timor he wrote Or is East Timordefined not by geography and its own ethnicity but by its Portuguese past andthe backgrounds of its independence activists In Australia the SydneyMorning Herald said in an editorial Monday that while the vote in EastTimor marks a new beginning for the territory this is also a day full offoreboding The last say over East Timors future is with the Indonesians whomust be forced to pay a price for any failure to honor the result of

which republicans seek toexert their illegal authority over their areas the paper said in aneditorial If one could imagine such a process applied across the BritishIsles that would be equivalent of nearly  people violently evicted fromtheir homes The methods of Slobodan Milosevic are being practised in thecountry Tony Blair governs Peace is mocked in our time            On its front page
