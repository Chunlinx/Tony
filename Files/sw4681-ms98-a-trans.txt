                um taxes  you want to go ahead   sure we pay far too much in taxes well far too much for what we get i mean its just   umhum i agree   i dont know it just too too much of the money is just lost   umhum well i think uh you know when i look at um all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money thats not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at it at a better discount um when you when   hm you mean like those you know twenty thousand dollar toilets   exactly exactly thats exactly um the whole thing when you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going and its just as long as the the person thats spending the money uh doesnt think about oh i can go out and spend anything that i want to its just unlimited   sure its real easy to spend other peoples money right   right an unlimited source so they they think well ill go out and buy a four hundred dollar toilet seat and i could have went to Kmart and bought it for you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh     right  i dont mind them getting what they need its just when they pay so much for it   exactly   it takes very you know very little to just shop around and   exactly and i know a lot of uh corporations now are looking at their amount of money thats being spent and   thats true   theyre looking at whats the best buy it used to be you could go if you had a company you had to go through certain people and you didnt care what you paid   yep   i mean you just got it done now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things going to actually shop at Best Buy for Best Buy is one of our electronics stores for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies   right   that mark up their amounts and say you know ill give you a legal pad for five bucks and you can go to another shop and get if for maybe sixty cents or ninety or ninety cents that kind of thing so     yeah and im also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the worlds probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years   except for everything keeps going up you know and i know as a middle class um you know and also i have one dependent has       my daughter and i keep looking at well wheres the tax socalled tax um   hm   uh relief for having children i mean there is none i mean i think i paid just as much as when i didnt have her   yeah i know oh i know i mean i dont even you know i dont even get get to see half my paycheck between K and and the thirty four percent theyre taking out for taxes  let alone when i end up having to pay   so umhum sure exactly uhhuh exactly yeah thats the whole thing now theyve gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes       but youre still gonna owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year whats gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isnt going to be in their savings uh account   sure   nope they wont be able to pay   they wont be able to pay it and therell be a lot of problems because of that you know put people into you know January or February which is always supposed to be this month after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale nobodys gonna have the money to spend     sure none   theyre gonna be paying on their taxes so theyre gonna have to just cut back so i dont know where the answer is and   i dont and plus  you know theres also like taxation without representation well i dont feel represented anymore in our government i mean its  its certainly not a government for me they dont take care of my needs   yeah yeah no no well  thats the whole thing i think people are getting so fed up with it now we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the   and and people dont care anymore either people people dont wanna go out to vote   no no well i dont think people think they can make a difference and when youve got candidates as you do its candidates that have money and its backed by big business   yep   and big business says well we dont care about the little person and uh you know youre not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns around   no but but thats thats going to backfire because   umhum well who knows uh   little people who buy everything so   yeah generations from now we might uh set back in our little uh rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say you know this government itself isnt working just like the communist government of uh the old uh USSR and maybe thats gonna happen to America where theyll say hey were fed up   yeah yeah i wonder though   maybe itll have to be just individual state tax       and each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know where you have to pay out to federal or whatever i dont know who knows but   yeah im not i dont know i cant think of any easy answers to it but somethings has to happen i mean   umhum   im certainly fed up with it   yeah  everybody is in fact im not sending in my tax money
