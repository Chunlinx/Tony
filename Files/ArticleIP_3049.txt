                                 Unforgiven            What the agony of Jesus onthe cross is to Christians the Holocaust is to Jews Except that the massacreof millions whose only crime was to be born Jewish has no transcendent meaningno sacred closure To theologize the Holocaust is meaningless even to thesuperOrthodox who accept everything as Gods will To secular skeptical Jewsthe horror is still just another episode though the worst in the unendingsuspicion and hatred of the Jews            What somepiously accept and others try to explain is to Aharon Appelfeld a centralevent in many peoples lives that has become a metaphor for our century Therecannot be an end to speaking and writing about it Appelfeld a survivor fromCzernowitz in Austrian Galicia whose first language was German now lives inJerusalem and writes in Hebrew He is the most telling novelist of theHolocaust for he has no need to describe it directly He has put his ownsufferingas a boy he saw a Nazi kill his motherinto short narratives ofselfabsorbed Jewish life before the war that are so ominously tonelessartfully simple and repetitious deceptively compressed in feeling that thereader aware of the horror about to descend on these people feels likescreaming but knows he will not be heard            The bestknown of these narratives are Badenheim  and To the Land of the Cattails  In The IronTracks Appelfeld has reversed his usual strategy The war ended long agobut for Erwin Siegelbaum who at  saw the Nazi officer Nachtigel murder hisparents the war has never ended For  years he has been living on trainsthat remind him of the train on which he was once deported His purpose is tofind Nachtigel and kill him This is mad but it signifies the depth at whichthe Holocaust can enter a Jews soul            Sincethe end of the war I have been on this line as they say a long twisted linestretching from Naples to the cold north a line of locals trams taxis andcarriages The seasons shift before my eyes like an illusion I have learnedthis route with my body Now I know every hostel and every inn everyrestaurant and buffet the vehicles that bring you to the remotest corners            Boarding still another train he gets a sortof constant renewal One can live on trains The officials now know him sowell that they drop the loud jangling popular music he detests on theloudspeaker and put on chamber music Shaving on a train gives him a new startin life There is one station where he is met by a regular driver now a sortof friend There are two stations on his route for which he has lovestations he can return to knowing he will be able to refresh himself with asolid meal and a cup of really good coffee But for the most part I live bysigns by codes whose meaning I alone know There was even a terrible momentwhen he spent two weeks in bed because it seemed to me that a new war hadstarted            Iconfess I have no faith in anyone outside the train He is so frozen insidethat he remains completely detached from the occasional woman on board whoattracts him            Thereis nothing like love on a train Sometimes it lasts only a station or two Themain thing is that youll never see the woman again Of course sometimes youget entangled and you suddenly have aside from your valise a sluggishcreature who keeps demanding coffee and cigarettes Thus I repeat to myselflove for two stations and no more            In his apathy he remembers the farce lived by Jewishorators and organizers such as his Communist parents They were always movingabout depriving him of a proper homeand always resolute They could not takein the fact that their comrades disliked them for being Jews            My memory is my downfallIt is a sealed well that doesnt lose a drop to use an old expression Nothingcan deplete it My memory is a powerful machine that stores and constantlydischarges lost years and faces In the past I believed that travel would bluntmy memory I was wrong Over the years I must admit it has only grownstronger Were it not for my memory my life would be differentbetter Iassume My memory fills me up until I choke on a stream of daydreams  Butin recent years I have learned to overcome this A glass of cognac forinstance separates me from my memory for a while            Where doeshe find the funds for this endless life on trains This is one of the subtlestissues in the book He lives by buying up old ceremonial objects retrieved fromsynagogues nearly destroyed by the Nazis And in this merchandising of theoncesacred there is no relief for him no peace He has competitors alsosearching for these objects and what is more they too are looking forNachtigel in order to avenge themselves            The peasants and army veterans Siegelbaumencounters think favorably of the war An innkeeper who lost his hearing atStalingrad and communicates by writing answers Siegelbaums saying Hitlerdeceived the world            Not truehe replied without hesitation            Why            Hitlerwanted to destroy the Jews and indeed he destroyed them he explained            When Ididnt answer he added in big letters It was a great mission and itsucceeded            But theystill exist I couldnt refrain from writing to him            Amistake he didnt hesitate to reply            Siegelbaum wants to kill theman for revealing his hidden desire I ought to have killed him There isnothing simpler than killing a man and yet for some reason I cannot do itEventually he does locate Nachtigel and after some false pleasantries heshoots him The event leaves him pretty much as he was before The Jewish needto find an answer to the Holocaust is not forthcoming It would have to be asmonumental and worldshattering as the terror itself In the face of prosperouspostwar Germany retribution is a joke When Siegelbaum finally cries out Whycant I pray he cannot find an answer within himself His melancholy is awellknown Jewish disease The Communist leaders he knew even spoke grandly ofa war against melancholy            Its real name is despairthat central human emotion in the face of overwhelming odds of which tragedy ismade There are no accommodating solutions after the fact There is noforgiveness for so much pain and no one to reconcile with But a story aspiercing as this goes to the heart of the matter for it embodies the terribleevent in such a way that it steals up on us and will haunt us in our sleep
