                                 Watching the Couples Go By            One of my persistentfantasies used to be of sitting at a sidewalk table at a cafe in Paris I wouldbe writing with my pen  la plume de ma tante  in a notebook  uncahier  while smoking a Gauloise I would not be writing economics Onecannot write economics while sitting at a sidewalk cafe Maybe that is whythere have been so few distinguished French economists I would be writing anovel or perhaps poetry or even a philosophical treatise But I wouldfrequently raise my eyes to watch the girls  les filles  go by            I nolonger have that fantasy I do however eat from time to time at an outdoortable in front of a small restaurant on the street leading to the KennedyCenter I dont try to write there I cant write with la plume de matante  I am addicted to the word processor I suppose I could use a laptopcomputer But that mechanism would destroy the romantic illusion Instead Iwatch the passersby            I am not concentrating on the girls I am concentrating onthe married couples How do I know that those men and women walking twobytwoup to the Kennedy Center are married to each other Well  percent of all menbetween the ages of  and  are married so if you see a man in that agegroup walking with a woman to the Kennedy Centerwhich is not exactly ClubMedits a good bet that the two are married and almost certainly to eachother            I lookparticularly at the women in those couples They are not glamorous There areno Marlene Dietrichs Marilyn Monroes or Vivien Leighs among them It is asign of my age that I cant think of the name of a single living glamorousmovie actress Some of them are pretty but many would be considered plainSince they are on their way to the Kennedy Center presumably to attend a playan opera or a concert one may assume that they are somewhat above average incultural literacy But in other respects one must assume that they are likemost people average            But to the man whose hand or arm she isholding she is not average She is the whole world to him They may argueoccasionally or even frequently He may have an eye for the cute intern in hisoffice But that is superficial Fundamentally she is the most valuable thingin his life            Genesis says And the LordGod said It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a helpmeet for him  And so made He a woman It doesnt say that He made apretty woman or a witty woman or an anykindofadjectivewoman He made the basic woman            Why isthis basic woman so valuable to the man whose hand or arm she is holding as Isee them making their way up to the Kennedy Center I think there are threesimple things            First she is a warm body in bed I dont refer to theirsexual activity That is important but too varied for me to generalize about Irefer to something that is if possible even more primitive It is humancontact            A babycrying in its crib doesnt want conversation or a gold ring He wants to bepicked up held and patted Adults need that physical contact also They needto cuddle together for warmth and comfort in an indifferent or cold world Atleast they need to be able to do that The plain woman and plain man I amwatching do that for each other            But conversation is also important Thesecouples may have been talking to each other for  years or more You mightthink they have nothing left to say But still they can talk to each other inways that they cannot talk to anyone else He can tell her of something good hehas done or something good that has happened to him without fearing that shewill think he is bragging He can tell her of something bad that has happenedwithout fearing that she will think he is complaining He can tell her of themost trivial thing without fearing that she will think he is bothering her Hecan count on her interest and understanding            Theprimary purpose of this conversation is not to convey any specific informationIts primary purpose is to say I am here and I know that you are here            Third the woman serves the mans need to be needed If noone needs you what good are you and what are you here for Otherpeopleemployers students readersmay say that they need you But it isnttrue In all such relationships you are replaceable at some price But to thiswoman you are not replaceable at any price And that gives you the selfesteemto go out and meet the world every day            So thisordinary womanone like about  million others in Americahas this greatvalue to this man she is going to the theater with He surely does not make acalculationdoesnt mark her to market He probably never says how much hevalues her to himself or to her But he acts as if he knows it            Isee that I have written these views entirelyfrom the point of view of the man That is only natural for me But I dont fora minute think that the relationship I have been trying to describe isonesided On the contrary I am sure it is reciprocal            I can hear you saying Howdo you know all this You are only an economist practitioner of the dismalscience You arent Ann Landers That is all true But my wife and I walked upthat hill to the Kennedy Center many times
