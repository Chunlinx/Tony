        oh hows your products been     um i really havent had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out   i hear that one have you had any lately go out   yeah ive had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three and they unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh i really dont have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that   oh wow   yeah it was a hassle   so you didnt get anything even all the all the warranties were out   yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the ice the refrigerator warrantys still good but the ice maker itself       lasted three years and it was three years and two months   youre kidding yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too   no uh watch out   yeah the only thing ive had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and   umhum   i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that its nontoxic and such and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so   hm   i didnt return it because itd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it but thats about the only thing ive had gone wrong   i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the   thats incredible   the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something i cant even pronounce and they uh       the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them   and they all went out at the same time   uh within two days of each other   or two days wow   i was it wasnt a good week i was pretty mad       and plus the place that id bought um them all had gone out of business so even if uh i think even if i had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that retailer so i dont know if i couldve taken it to another retailer or not   wow thats frustrating   but i didnt have to worry about all that because they werent under warranty       so it was a call to the local appliance dealer   uhhuh   who came out and fixed them all but i the only other things that ive ever had trouble with um i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers   uhhuh they go out a lot   yeah ive had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and the other two werent but i just other than that you know TVs and things like that i havent ever had any trouble with i dont think products are getting much better though   yeah see im in the manufacturing field i just home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags   oh really thats interesting   yeah at Morton International and i think well its its changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything after each assembly process and so our testing is pretty thorough but   do you do you test each individual one or do you just test   um   like if youve got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay   um the tests that well we test every one electrically we dont i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag   umhum   and but we do test after during the assembly project product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure its there after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after its done and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so   well thats something ive never had to use its never ive never been involved in an automobile accident so luckily thats a product that i havent had to test       but i think its a great idea im im   yeah   seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to to come about but that   well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government its incredible how much testing they have to do   oh im sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i dont mind spending the extra money on the car   uhhuh   if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing im not a real big seat belt my uh
