                Slates Pundit Central column has an excellent summary of the exchange butChatterbox believes readers of this column will want to scrutinize the text forevery last ambiguity for the

Senator on guns and violence                SAM DONALDSON Excuse me Cokie Recently in your life               BRADLEY No               SAM When you were a kid               BRADLEY Well yes Right Have you               SAM I think a couple of times Ive tried it And I inhaled               BRADLEY Have you Cokie               COKIE Oh listen I was so pregnant during those years The senator                BRADLEY George Who wants to know               GEORGE WILL No               SAM How come you give George a pass               GEORGE No Im from the Falstaff generation               COKIE Can we get to guns and violence               GEORGE Thats my Shakespeare                BRADLEY Shakespeare thats right               COKIE Theyou wrote an OpEd on guns                                        Chatterboxs postgame analysis                                       The context suggests that Sam like Bradley is admitting                  only                   youthful marijuana use  But its possible hes being cageyand is ducking the cocaine question Its also possiblethis isadmittedly a fanciful readingthat in saying I inhaled Sams referring toboth marijuana and cocaine though if that were the case hed probablysay I tried them  not I tried it                                  Cokie keeps trying to change the subject That may be because sheagrees with Chatterbox that its a phony issue Or it may be becauseshe doesnt want to answer the question In fact she doesntanswer the question she just says she was so pregnant during those yearsThis answer implies that she couldnt take drugs because she wasconstantly pregnant during the s But obviously she wasnt pregnantfor the entire decade  She has only two kids Hence this is not only anonanswer  but a nonalibi  Does this mean shes hiding pastdrug use Chatterbox who opined in his previous item that Cokie is almost certainly not a past cocaine userguesses not Rather Chatterbox suspects Cokie of being too embarrassed toadmit that shes one of those goodygoodies who never tried                  marijuana                   or                   cocaine                                  George answers no twice for some reason Sam thinks hehasnt answered the first time It doesnt seem especially surprising that henever tried                   marijuana or cocaine  But what does he mean when hesays hes from the Falstaff generation Its possible George means that hisgenerations drug of choice was alcohol presumably not sack Sir JohnFalstaffs favorite beverage Specifically George may mean that when he wasin college he drank a lot of Falstaff Beer For an unofficial history of theFalstaff Brewing Cothirdlargest brewer in the United States during Georgescollege yearsclick here More likely however George is alluding to Falstaffsobservation in Henry IV Part I                   that the better part ofvalor is discretion Act V Scene iv line  In this context that mightmean that when George was young and relatively irresponsible he didnt want tomess with dangerous and illegal substances Or it might mean that todayhe doesnt want to discuss the matter at all in which case wed need toreinterpret his two nos to mean No I dont want to talk about this               The other GeorgeGeorge Stephanopoulosdidnt have to answer the questionbecause he wasnt present during this segment But George S previouslytold this column that hed never used cocaine  Chatterbox forgot to askGeorge S whether hed ever used marijuana but doesnt feel like calling himback to ask now                                 Bill Kristol is never around when this question gets askedHe was out of the office when Chatterbox was phoning around for the earlier item and like George S didnt appear during this segmentyesterday Chatterbox continues to have no                   opinion about whetherhe ever used illegal drugs                                       Addendum                Brian Lamb got asked Monday morning on CSPANsWashington Journal whether hed ever used cocaine or anyother illegal drug He said                no  Also on the show was MattDrudge of the Drudge Report  who said I havent done cocainebut declined to say whether hes used any illegal drugs  Througha bizarre sequence of events                   Slate                editor Michael Kinsleyended up being the one who asked Lamb about past drug use Kinsley saidhed answer the question if asked but no one asked Drudge refused toask and Lamb seemed about to ask but then didnt However Kinsley long agoconfessed in the New Republics TRB column that he experimentedwith marijuana in the distant past and wrote I deeply regret thisyouthful indiscretion The column Regrets Only is included in Kinsleys collection Big Babies  After taking his first puff duringfreshman year in college                                             I found the drug had no effect on me whatsoever and I determinednot to experiment with illicit substances any further  However a few dayslater I experimented with marijuana once again On that occasion I enjoyed it agood deal more This youthful indiscretion I also deeply regret During thenext several years overcome by the spirit of scientific inquiry Iexperimented with marijuana perhaps two hundred or more times                                        Kinsley now tells Chatterbox that he also triedcocaine             The CSPAN caller who got all this started identified himself as thecolumnist HC from a satirical Website called CF  Click here for itswitless                   Slate                spoof HC said he was stoned inspiringthis classic CSPAN exchange                                             BRIAN Why are you stoned                              HC Because I enjoy it               BRIAN What are you stoned on               HC Marijuana                                       Disclaimer Although Chatterbox deplores selfrighteousness andhypocrisy regarding illegal drug use he also deplores illegal drug use itselfSpecifically regarding cocaine a lesson of the s was that its use is bothaddictive and potentially deadlytwo facts that were unknown to youthful babyboomers who tried it during the s That doesnt justify the ongoingdisparity between criminal sentences for possession of powder cocaine andpossession of crackcrack is much more likely to be used by blacks and ispunished much more harshlybut it does justify the tougher approach lawenforcement agencies take in general today as compared to two decades ago
