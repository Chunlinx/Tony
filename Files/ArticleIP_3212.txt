                                 Sex Drive            Like some smutty art film ofa bygone era Crash arrives on American screens preceded by luridheadlineshailed at Cannes banned in England its US release nearly abortedby Ted Turner The rumors started even before the movie went into productionwithout the benefit of hired publicists After all the first American editionof the  novel by JG Ballard on which the film is based was pulped intoto its second publisher announced it and then balked and the house thatfinally undertook it seems to have dispatched most of the run directly to theremainder tables I bought my copy not long after publication for  cents Itconcerns of course the eroticism of automobile accidents Could you conceiveof anything more sickoweird But cars are sexual objects obviously and iftheir essence is speed consummation can be achieved only through impact Everycar commercial on television is an invitation to a Liebestod             Ballardscomplex imagedriven fiction partakes of surrealism hovers within the orbitsof scifi and laps at the outr Change fiction to movies and the sameformula can apply to David Cronenberg whose best work  Videodrome Dead Ringers  is as disturbing as any avantgarde literature you care toname even as it has been commercially viable Cronenbergs films have goneplaces and done things that todays gutless independents could never imagineWho else could have filmed Crash  Who else would have wanted to            His adaptation is extremely faithful to the novel Itsprotagonist James Ballard the books hero played by James Spader bears thesame name as its author is a producer of TV commercials He and his wifeCatherine Deborah Kara Unger have one of those open marriages Driving homefrom the set one day James skids into oncoming traffic and crashes headoninto another car killing its driver whose widow Dr Helen Remington HollyHunter stares in shock During their respective hospital sojourns bothsurvivors encounter Vaughan Elias Koteas a scientist who had been awellknown TV personality until a nearfatal motorcycle accident made himobsessed with the erotic possibilities of highway crashes            Vaughanspreoccupation leads him to not only ponder the sexually charged road deaths ofthe famous James Dean Jayne Mansfield Albert Camus but to hang aroundaccident sites photographing them and later replicating the contorted posturesof the victims in his trysts with prostitutes As James Helen and eventuallyCatherine are drawn into Vaughans world they discover that he leads a cult ofsorts which includes Gabrielle Rosanna Arquette who gravitated towardVaughan after an accident that left her encased in a complicatedleatherandsteel body brace The votaries smoke pot watch testcrash footageread journals of pathology and reenact celebrated accidents            In the movie as in the book much of the actionthereafter consists of an increasingly intense spiral of couplings among theseparties punctuated by tearing metal and shattering glass and inevitablyclimaxing in death The book however is internally powered by Ballardspatented transformation of cold into hot turning medical and automotive jargoninto spectacularly baroque metaphors Thinking of the extensor rictus of herspine during orgasm the erect hairs on her undermuscled thighs I stared atthe stylized manufacturers medallion visible in the photographs the contouredflanks of the window pillars A movie cant really do that sort of thing            Ofcourse comparisons dont get any more invidious than those between movies andtheir source novels and critics should abjure the temptation I purposelyhadnt reread the book before seeing the film and furthermore resolved toforget Cronenbergs previous adaptation of a famously impossible work ofliterature the contrived mess he fashioned from William S Burroughs NakedLunch  But as much as I enjoyed Crash the movie I found that mykeenest pleasure came from imagining the potential reactions of others Ipictured say its eventual payperview screening being accidentally beamedout on the wavelength of a devotional network Although the frissonswere all present and accounted for there was something missing            This isnt the fault of the cast Spader is a bit toosincere and boyish to play the jaded libertine Ballard but hes a fine actorand unquestionably game Unger and Arquette are well cast and the proteanHunter extraordinarily so Koteas was born for his role just the right mix ofcrudity and sophistication The cinematography is surgically precise theediting crisp the music moody and unobtrusive The dialogue much of itstraight from the book is full of terse humor when a cop comes by tointerrogate Vaughan about a hitandrun Catherine brushes him off Vaughanisnt interested in pedestrians Nevertheless the movie seems all tooreducible Despite such calculated outrages as the scene where James fucks thewound in Gabrielles leg the films darkest images are the views of endlesstraffic on the arterial roadways that make up the entire landscape around theBallards highrise flat            One majorreason for this is that carcrash erotica has become so routinely available inthe quarter century since the book was written Many people who wouldnt dreamof seeing Crash derive the very same thrills covertly from aninexhaustible supply of PG titles ranging from The French Connection tothe latest generic Lethal Weapon  they will of course hotly deny anytumescence And Crash can often seem like Lethal Weapon  plussodomy minus plot For a filmmaker who in Videodrome and DeadRingers so elegantly broached the unspeakable Cronenberg has here made apicture that is all surface For purposes of comparison rent the video ofJeanLuc Godards Weekend amid all the chatter is a brief scene ofMireille Darc emerging from a flaming wreck that as a crashsex icon beatsanything in Crash  And in the mostly ludicrous  operavideo movieAria is a sequence by Ken Russell of all people that conveys sheerrococo horror A young woman sees herself being anointed and bedecked withjewels but we then see that she is in an emergency ward and that her jewelsare in reality carcrash wounds            In his book Ballard was not only toying withsome kind of ultimate transgression he was also responding to the argumentsadvanced by pop art James Rosenquists paintings and Richard Hamiltonsdrawings of rearranged car parts could hardly be more explicitly sexual afinger poised by a dashmounted gearshift a talk balloon filled with anorgasmic Aah Hamilton  Another pop artist John Chamberlainexhibited the actual voluptuous hulks of wrecks It is tempting to imagineCrash as if it had been made a generation ago starring Laurence Harveyand Vanessa Redgrave The pop works still look great but their implicit textis no longer news having filtered down to the pure stimulusresponse of allthose Lethal Weapons  Ballards novel goes further forcing the readerto acknowledge complicityevery consumer a pervert The movie though is onlya movie and Cronenberg lets the viewer walk away momentarily stunned butunscathed                           Autoeroticismexplained  seconds
