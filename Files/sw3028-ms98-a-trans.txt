                are you ready   umhum   she didnt announce that to you   oh i didnt i didnt quite hear all of it   oh i see thats fine um i think uh thats pleasurable for all of us  if we  choose the right restaurant   right     so what are your thoughts on dining out   well i i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else   not for the price   well a little bit for the price but uh i think that as far as quality of food goes the most some of the most expensive places ive been had the the really the the worst quality of food   okay uhhuh the really okay   really um a lot of places that even dont look dont look like much some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like   umhum   im not eating in there  are you nuts and uh we went in and it was the most it was the most wonderful food     my word its like mama in the back kitchen huh   yeah im serious   oh yeah   um a lot of uh one place that we went just recently uh was to Atchafalaya no thats not right thats not right thats not right  whats the name of that restaurant   umhum   okay   the Hari Krishna Kalachandjis its all vegetarian and it was just fabulous i mean my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it   wow and where was that at   um Kalachandjis its uh its a Hari Krishna run restaurant   where is it in Dallas   yes   is it in the phone book   uh i think so it should be   do you know how to spell it   uh it starts with a K   okay Kalli K A L L I   so K A L A i think C H A N D that should get you close enough to   okay   to be able to find it i think its uh probably listed in the restaurants you know   uhhuh section yes uhhuh   but its uh its just fabulous food   what about fast foods do you have a preference if you were going to eat a fast food   well we like Arbys   you do like Arbys see i dont like Arbys   as far as fast food goes oh really why   no because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever they use the they use the insides of the animals heart and liver and they they form it and they make it look like roast beef and i said no thank you   oh no no no someone has been lying to you what they use is roast beef   well thats not what i heard from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about   thats what oh my goodness   uhhuh   im surprised my dad worked for Arbys for several years   really   yeah   unless somebody is trying to blackball them   well thats happened before but we like good uh we were we like Mexican food   umhum okay   and stuff like that so um   how about the health food uh restaurants well like this one but its probably not advertised as such is it or   a health food   uhhuh health food uh restaurants that   like like name one  im not sure what youre talking about   well well like um well i cant really think of any off the top of my head right now because theres so few and far between but they ought there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious you know as far as their cholesterol levels and their their fat content and you know the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them now theres one restaurant that does that and its called Rodolfos over on Preston Road and Royal Lane i believe and they  have very good food over there   hum i dont guess ive ever been to anything like that so i really dont have anything to compare it to   uhhuh uhhuh they do list um you know list the fat   it would be good i think uh i dont know how expensive they are it sounds like that it would probably   uhhuh uhhuh well it was pretty reasonable i it was around ten dollars for lunch okay which which is kind of high for lunch i guess   for one person   yes   oh   yes uhhuh yeah   a bit   uh but um you were served by maitre ds and and uh um men waiters   see i i wont really be interested in going to going there because i feel like im im paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without   well if youre looking for a nice uhhum well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadnt seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant its a special occasion type thing yeah   yeah maybe maybe that yeah yeah i could see that then maybe   uhhum and now the Red Lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime   yeah i like the the seafood that they when they had it you know the broiled   because theyre well they have lunch specials that you cant you cant beat that price uh if you went to a cafeteria   yeah probably thats true but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you cant really get away from the fried   well i had the i had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent it was a marinated broiled chicken breast and it was excellent   now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken thats one of my husbands pet peeves he doesnt understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know   oh it was well ive never had catfish either in a restaurant because im from the north and that was a no no and i havent gotten over that from the north   oh really oh catfish is wonderful oh really   i know they say that that is but im   really   but theyve got all these caution signs now on fish and so i kind of stay away because of all the pollution in the lakes and the   why oh   everywhere i mean there isnt any safe haven anymore for fish   hum   i and especially uh in Wisconsin and Michigan they say dont buying of our fish   thats too bad because im probably not going to stop eating it   i   well yeah so you i and the the best brand of chicken to buy is the uh Pilgrim Pride because they dont use all these hormones to promote uh unnatural growth in their products   uhhuh yeah   so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy   thats true   so im i you know i   oh on one hand i see that and on the other hand uh my older sister   umhum   remembers when uh at one point they were taking radioactive wastes   yeah   and storing them in tin barrels which i i guess had a halflife of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land   corrode hum   so theyre putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more   umhum well id like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good   oh and then they wouldnt sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born   oh dear wow   so i mean were taking thirty years ago this happened and   sure yeah   and whos you know the tuna is radioactive   thats right everything we eat everything   to a certain extent you cant get away from it so i think   everything we eat should have a label on it  yeah   to some point yeah you know so theres you know theres some things i think we can avoid we you know we cant avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control   well you know   so im either going to be im either going to starve to death or im going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know   umhum well Becky you know even if you lived off your own land that you would have to put caution signs
