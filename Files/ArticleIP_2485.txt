beratejournalists for their ignorance of economics particularly his economics buton this occasion I fear his logic is more addled than usual I am reluctantto dignify his hatchet job with a lengthy reply but some of his claims are sodefamatory that they should be addressed if only for the record             Krugman claims that myopening sentenceIn a way Bill Gatess current troubles with the JusticeDepartment grew out of an economics seminar that took place thirteen years agoat Harvards John F Kennedy School of Governmentis pure fiction Perhapsso but in that case somebody should tell this to Joel Klein the assistantattorney general in charge of the antitrust division When I interviewed Kleinfor my piece about the Microsoft case he singled out Brian Arthur as theeconomist who has most influenced his thinking about the way in whichhightechnology markets operate It was Kleins words not those of Arthurthat prompted me to use Arthur in the lead of the story             Krugman wrote Cassidysarticle tells the story of how Stanford Professor Brian Arthur came up with theidea of increasing returns I wrote no such thing and Arthur has never to myknowledge claimed any such thing The notion of increasing returns has beenaround since Adam Smith and it was written about at length by Alfred Marshallin  What I did say in my article was that increasing returns was largelyignored by mainstream economists for much of the postwar era a claim thatsimply isnt controversial As Krugman notes one reason for this wastechnical not ideological Allowing for the possibility of increasing returnstends to rob economic models of two properties that economists cherishsimplicity and determinism As long ago as  Sir John Hicks one of thefounders of modern economics noted that increasing returns if toleratedcould lead to the wreckage of a large part of economic theory             Pace Krugman Ialso did not claim that Arthur bears principal responsibility for therediscovery of increasing returns by economists in the s and s AsKrugman notes several scholars himself included who were working in thefields of game theory and international trade published articles incorporatingincreasing returns before Arthur did My claim was simply that Arthur appliedincreasing returns to hightechnology markets and that his work influenced howother economists and government officials think about these markets Krugmanapart virtually every economist I have spoken to including Daniel Rubinfelda former Berkeley professor who is now the chief economist at the JusticeDepartments antitrust division told me this was the case Rubinfeld alsomentioned several other economists who did influential work and I cited threeof them in the article             Krugman appears tosuggest that I made up some quotes a charge that if it came from a moreobjective source I would consider to be a serious matter In effect he isaccusing Brian Arthur a man he calls a nice guy of being a fabricator or aliar The quotes in question came from Arthur and they were based on hisrecollections of two meetings that he attended some years ago After Krugmansarticle appeared the Santa Fe professor called me to say that he stillrecalled the meetings in question as I described them Krugman as he admitswasnt present at either of the meetings             For a man who takes hisown cogitations extremely seriously Krugman is remarkably cavalier aboutattributing motives and beliefs to others Cassidy has made it clear inearlier writing that he does not like mainstream economists and he may havebeen overly eager to accept a story that puts them in a bad light hepronounces I presume this statement refers to a critical piece I wrote in about the direction that economic research principally macroeconomic researchhas taken over the past two decades In response to that article I receiveddozens of messages of appreciation from mainstream economists including fromtwo former presidents of the American Economic Association Among the sourcesquoted in that piece were the thenchairman of the White House Council ofEconomic Advisers Joseph Stiglitz a governor of the Federal Reserve BoardLaurence Meyer and a wellknown Harvard professor Gregory Mankiw Toclaim as Krugman does that I dont like mainstream economists and that I amout to denigrate their work is malicious hogwash The fact of the matter isthat I spend much of my life reading the work of mainstream economistsspeaking to them and trying to find something they have written that mightinterest the general public In my experience most economists appreciate theattention             Imight attach more weight to Krugmans criticisms if I hadnt recently rereadhis informative  book Peddling Prosperity  in which he devotes achapter to the rediscovery of increasing returns by contemporary economistsWho are the first scholars Krugman mentions in his account Paul David aneconomic historian who wrote a famous paper about how the QWERTYUIOP typewriterkeyboard evolved and you guessed it Brian Arthur Why QWERTYUIOP Krugmanwrote In the early s Paul David and his Stanford colleague Brian Arthurasked that question and quickly realized that it led them into surprisinglydeep waters  What Paul David Brian Arthur and a growing number of othereconomists began to realize in the late seventies and early eighties was thatstories like that of the typewriter keyboard are in fact pervasive in theeconomy Evidently Krugman felt four years ago that Arthurs contribution wasimportant enough to merit a prominent mention in his book Now he dismissesthe same work saying it didnt tell me anything that I didnt already knowDoubtless this change in attitude on Krugmans part is unconnected to the factthat Arthur has started to receive some public recognition The eminent MITprofessor whose early academic work received widespread media attention isfar too generous a scholar to succumb to such pettiness                           John Cassidy                                                         Paul Krugman replies to JohnCassidy                                       I think that David Warshs in the Boston                Globe says it all If other journalists woulddo as much homework as he did I wouldnt have had to write that article                                             Letter from M Mitchell Waldrop                                       Thanks to Paul Krugman forhis lament about credulous reporters who refuse to let facts stand in the wayof a good story TheLegend of Arthur As a professional journalist I found his points welltakeneven when he cites my own book Complexity as a classic exampleof the gullibility genre            Among many other thingsComplexity tells the story of the Irishborn economist Brian Arthur andhow he came to champion a principle known as increasing returns The recentNew Yorker article explains how that principle has since become theintellectual foundation of the Clinton administrations antitrust case againstMicrosoft Krugmans complaint is that the popular pressincludingComplexity and The New Yorker is now hailing Brian Arthur as theoriginator of increasing returns even though Krugman and many others hadworked on the idea long before Arthur did            I leave itfor others to decide whether I was too gullible in writing Complexity For the record however I would like to inject a few facts into Krugmansstory which he summarizes nicely in the final paragraph            When Waldrops book cameout I wrote him as politely as I could asking exactly how he had managed tocome up with his version of events He did to his credit write back Heexplained that while he had become aware of some other people working onincreasing returns trying to put them in would have pulled his story line outof shape  So what we really learn from the legend of Arthur is that somejournalists like a good story too much to find out whether it is reallytrue            Now I will admit to manysins not the least of them being a profound ignorance of graduateleveleconomics I spent my graduateschool career in the physics department insteadwriting a PhD dissertation on the quantumfield theory of elementary particlecollisions at relativistic energies However I am not so ignorant of thecanons of journalism and of common sense that I would take a plausible fellowlike Brian Arthur at face value without checking up on him During my researchfor Complexity I spoke to a number of economists about his workincluding Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow cocreator of the General EquilibriumTheory of economics that Brian so eloquently criticizes They generally agreedthat Brian was a maverick in the fieldand perhaps a bit too much in love withhis own selfimage as a misunderstood outsiderbut basically sound None ofthem warned me that he was usurping credit where credit was not due            Which brings me to ProfessorKrugmans letter and my reply I remember the exchange very well Obviouslyhowever my reply failed to make clear what I was really trying to say So Illtry again            a During our interviewsBrian went out of his way to impress upon me that many other economists haddone work in increasing returnsPaul Krugman among them He was anxious thatthey be given due credit in anything I wrote So was I            b Accordingly I included apassage in Complexity in which Brian does indeed describe what othershad done in the fieldPaul Krugman among them Elsewhere in that same chapterI tried to make it clear that the concept of increasing returns was alreadywell known to Brians professors at Berkeley where he first learned of itIndeed I quote Brian pointing out that increasing returns had been extensivelydiscussed by the great English economist Alfred Marshall in             c So when I receivedKrugmans letter shortly after Complexity came out I was puzzled Hewas complaining that I hadnt referenced others in the increasingreturnsfieldPaul Krugman among themalthough I had explicitly done so            d But when I checked thepublished text I was chagrined to discover that the critical passagementioning Krugman wasnt there            e Only then did I realizewhat had happened After I had submitted the manuscript my editor at Simon Schuster had suggested a number of cuts to streamline what was already along and involved chapter on Brians ideas I accepted some of the cuts andrestored othersincluding I thought the passage that mentioned Krugman Inthe rush to get Complexity to press however that passage somehow woundup on the cuttingroom floor anyway and I didnt notice until too late            Thatoversight was my fault entirely not my editors and certainly not BrianArthurs I take full responsibility I regret it andif Simon  Schusteronly published an errata columnI would happily correct it publicly Howevercontrary to what Professor Krugman implies it was an oversight not a breezydisregard of facts for the sake of a good story                           M MitchellWaldrop Washington                                             Paul Krugman replies to M MitchellWaldrop                                       I am truly sorry that TheNew Yorker has not yet established a Web presence so that we could includea link directly to the Cassidy piece However you can get a pretty good ideaof what the piece said by reading the summary of it presented in Tasty Bitsfrom the Technology Front Cassidy did not present a story about one guyamong many who worked on increasing returns On the contrary He presented amorality play in which a lonely hero struggled to make his ideas heard againstthe unified opposition of a narrowminded profession both intellectually andpolitically conservative As TBTFs hostnot exactly a naive readerput itThese ideas were anathema to mainstream economists in  when Arthur firsttried to publish them            That morality playnot thequestion of who deserves creditwas the main point of my column because it isa pure and malicious fantasy that has nonetheless become part of the storyline people tell about increasing returns and its relationship to mainstreameconomics            The fact which is easilydocumented is that during the years that according to the legend increasingreturns was unacceptable in mainstream economics papers about increasingreturns were in fact being cheerfully published by all the major journals Andas I pointed out in the chronology I provided with the article even standardreference volumes like the Handbook of International Economicspublished in  the year Arthur supposedly met a blank wall of resistancehave long contained chapters on increasing returns Whatever the reason thatArthur had trouble getting his own paper published ideological rigidity hadnothing to do with it            How did this fantasy come tobe so widely believed I am glad to hear that you tried to tell a more balancedstory Mr Waldrop even if sloppy paperwork kept it from seeing the light ofday And I am glad that you talked to Ken Arrow But Nobel laureates who havewide responsibilities and much on their mind are not necessarily on top ofwhat has been going on in research outside their usual field I happen to knowof one laureate who circa  was quite unaware that anyone had thoughtabout increasing returns in either growth or trade Did you try talking toanyone elsesay to one of the economists who are the straight men in thestories you tell For example your book starts with the story of Arthursmeeting in  with Al Fishlow at Berkeley in which Fishlow supposedly saidWe know that increasing returns cant existand Arthur went away in despairover the unwillingness of economists to think the unthinkable Did you callFishlow to ask whether he said it and what he meant Since by  PaulRomers  papers on increasing returns and growth had started an avalancheof derivative work he was certainly jokingwhat he probably meant was Oh nonot you too And let me say that I simply cannot believe that you could havetalked about increasing returns with any significant number of economistsoutside Santa Fe without Romers name popping up in the first  seconds ofevery conversationunless you were very selective about whom you talked toAnd oh by the way there are such things as libraries where you can browseactual economics journals and see what they contain            The point is that its notjust a matter of failing to cite a few more people Your book like the Cassidyarticle didnt just tell the story of Brian Arthur it also painted a pictureof the economics profession its intellectual bigotry and prejudice whichhappens to be a complete fabrication with some real named people cast asvillains that somehow someone managed to sell you I wonder who            Even more to the point Howdid Cassidy come by his story Is it possible that he completely misunderstoodwhat Brian Arthur was sayingthat the whole business about the seminar atHarvard where nobody would accept increasing returns about the lonely struggleof Arthur in the face of ideological rigidity even the quotation from Arthurabout economists being unwilling to consider the possibility of imperfectmarkets because of the Cold War give me a break were all in Cassidysimagination            Let me say that I amactually quite grateful to Cassidy and The New Yorker  A number ofpeople have long been furious about your bookfor example Victor Norman whomyou portrayed as the first of many economists too dumb or perhaps narrowmindedto understand Arthurs brilliant innovation Norman emailed me to say that Ihave read the tales from the Vienna woods before and had hoped that it could becleared up by someone at some point Yet up to now there was nothing anyonecould do about the situation The trouble was that while heroic rebel defiesorthodoxy is a story so good that nobody even

Arthur TheLegend of Arthur requires a correction of its misrepresentations of factArthur is a reputable and significant scholar whose work is indeed havinginfluence in the field of industrial organization and in particular publicpolicy toward antitrust policy in hightech industries Krugman admits that hewrote the article because he was just pissed off not a very good state for ajudicious statement of facts as his column shows            His theme is stated in hisfirst paragraph Cassidys article in The New Yorker of Jan  tells thestory of how Stanford Professor Brian Arthur came up with the idea ofincreasing returns Cassidy however said nothing of the sort The concept ofincreasing returns is indeed very old and Cassidy at no point attributed thatidea to Arthur Indeed the phrase increasing returns appears just once inCassidys article and then merely to say that Arthur had used the term whileothers refer to network externalities Further Arthur has never made any suchpreposterous claim at any other time On the contrary his papers have fullycited the history of the field and made references to the previous papersincluding those of Paul Krugman See Arthurs papers collected in the volumeIncreasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy especially his prefaceand my foreword for longer comments on Arthurs work in historic perspectiveClick to see the foreword Hence Krugmans whole attack is directed at astatement made neither by Arthur nor by Cassidy Krugman has not read Cassidyspiece with any care nor has he bothered to review what Arthur has in factsaid            What Cassidy in fact did inhis article was to trace a line of influence between one of Arthurs earlyarticles and the current claims of the Department of Justice against MicrosoftIt appears that Cassidy based his article on several interviews not justone            The point that Arthur hasemphasized and which is influential in the current debates about antitrustpolicy is the dynamic implication of increasing returns It is the concept ofpathdependence that small events whether random or the result of corporatestrategic choice may have large consequences because of increasing returns ofvarious kinds Initial small advantages become magnified for example bycreating a large installed base and direct the future possibly in aninefficient direction Techniques of production may be locked in at an earlystage Similar considerations apply to regional development and learning                           Kenneth JArrow Nobel laureate and Joan Kenney professor of

fellow economist Brian Arthur inThe Legend ofArthur I couldnt help wondering whose reputation he was out to trashArthurs or his own Krugman seems to fear a plot to deny economists theirintellectual due If one exists Arthur is not a likely suspect In a series oflong interviews with me a year ago for Worth magazine I tried vainly toget Arthur to tell me how his ideas about increasing returns have encouraged anew strain of economic investigations Despite much prodding Arthur obligedonly by placing himself in a long line of theorists dating back to Adam Smithand Alfred Marshall I also found him disarmingly generous in giving credit tothe biologists physicists and fellow economists who have helped advance hisown thinking Savvy to the journalists quest for heroes Arthur urged me tofocus on his ideas not his rank among his peers Krugman has made a career outof telling other economists to pay better attention to the facts yet as achronicler of Arthurs career and inner life Krugman seems to
