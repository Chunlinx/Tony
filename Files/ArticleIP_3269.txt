                                 Ravioli Bartoli            Connoisseurs of singingrarely hold moderate opinions and there is hardly a singer who elicits moreadulation and disapproval at the same time than mezzosoprano Cecilia Bartoliwho opens Oct  in a new madetoorder production of Rossinis LaCenerentola at the Metropolitan Opera            Bartoliis more than a singer She is a marvel of marketing She sells out any houseshe appears in and moves enough CDs to qualify as a pop star million sinceher first recording appeared in  Her recordings outsell those of everyother classical artist except Luciano Pavarotti At  she has already hadmore ad hoc laurels lavished on her than many legends receive evenposthumously A chef in a San Francisco restaurant has created RavioliBartoli One of the Chunnel trains that link England and France is called theCecilia Bartoli There is a spate of worshipful Web sites devoted to her anda breathless and wildly premature biography by Kim Chernin and Renate StendhalCecilia Bartoli The Passion of Song  which describes her as asensuous embodied angel standing quietly on a concert stage as she reportsback to God about the mysterious joys and sorrows of human existence Anotherbook about Bartoli and her contemporaries is being written by ManuelaHoelterhoff the former opera critic of the Wall Street Journal  who isnow a member of its editorial board            Does Bartoli live up to the hype She is certainly a finetechnician who never sacrifices passion to precision Listen to herrouladesvirtuosic runs of notes on a single syllableand youll hear eachnote as a distinct link in a long twirling chain and each word being accordedits proper weight Her new CD An Italian Songbook  for instance openswith one of dozens of settings Rossini made of two short verses by the th century poet Pietro Metastasio Mi lagner tacendo I willcomplain silently It is a jovial anthology of trills runs grace notesmordents and melismas with a section of operatic recrimination Bartolifinesses the tension between glum words and sprightly notes right up to theend when the musics exuberance finally overwhelms selfpity            Bartoliscritics have argued that her voice is too petite to reach the outer spaces ofthe cathedrallike Met and that her repertoire is too narrow fusty andobscure She has sung no more than a handful of operatic roles onstage mostlyMozart and Rossini and she has made a specialty of the songs that kept Rossinibusy after his operacomposing career had ended Bartolis style of fussingover every syllable has been called twitchy belabored and selfconsciouslyadorable Critics also draw ominous comparisons to Kathleen Battle the sopranowhose gifts have been eroded in recent years by an uncontrollable tendency tosimper Like Battle Bartoli has allowed her stage manner to become downrightweird On the video of her Houston Cenerentola  from  her eyes popout her dimples deepen her chin recedes unflatteringly against her neck herhead springs forward and back from her shoulders as if she were doing the FunkyChicken Bartoli does not have a divas sense of dignity            After years of disarming girlnextdoornormalcy however Bartoli may have begun indulging in the clichs of divanaughtiness such as a habit of canceling appearances including amuchpublicized Battlelike spat with the Metropolitan Operas general managerJoseph Volpe Bartoli has consistently said she is just protecting her healthHoelterhoff recently told the New York Times that at least some of thecancellations had to do with the condition of Bartolis brother Gabriele whohas had surgery for a brain tumor            There isa certain irony to the accusation that Bartolis voice and repertoire lacksubstance Bartoli has said that she finds the wry humor of the  thcentury more modern than the grandiloquence of Verdi and Puccini Her voicematches her sensibility It is better suited to the humanscaled works shesings than to the colossal operas that todays colossal houses were built forOpera houses have long been designed to be onesizefitsall but Rossinisdomestic comedies inevitably seem dwarfed by a stage ample enough to containthe struggles in Wagners Valhalla It is not Bartolis voice but the operasthemselves that are too small for houses like the Metor rather the Met istoo big for all but the grandest of grand opera Under James Levine the Methas barely dabbled in bel canto the finespun singer vehicles of the early th century favoring instead the titans of opera If LaCenerentola Rossinis version of the Cinderella storyhas made it to theMet for the first time in the companys history it is only because Bartolibrought it there            For now people seem willing to allow Bartoli to performrepertoire that would otherwise seem destined for the remainder bin She haschampioned the music of Pauline ViardotGarcia herself a Rossini mezzosopranoin the  th century and led a campaign to rehabilitate Haydnsalmostmythological cantata Arianna a Naxos and his virtually unknownopera Orfeo ed Euridice  One reason she can get away with this is thatshe is a dazzlingly expressive singer guiding the listener through theemotional landscape of a piece with every small push of her voice She colorsthe first recitative in her recording of Haydns Orfeo ed Euridice withmore brilliant hues of grief than Ive ever heard before Sventurata she cries Unhappy me in a voice full of pain A thousand dismalthoughtsher tone darkensconstantly cloud my mind and the notes acquirea ravishing mistiness that is partly unsung air            To mymind Bartolis breathiness is central to her appeal She can command a fullchesty holler when she needs to but in quiet passages she tends to produce agentle haze of breath around each focused note This hiss the noise level inher voice like Glenn Goulds humming as he played the piano or the squeakingof Andrs Segovias fingers on the strings of his guitar makes her unusualtoday when most singers are trained in the discipline of steely perfection andwhen our ears have become accustomed to the sharpedged sounds of a compactdisc surrounded by undiluted digital silence It is as if by this deliberatesmudging Bartoli were giving old songs an antique timbre            Bartolis effort to cast herself as anantidiva at least in her stage performances has worked Some critics werescandalized but more were charmed when she made her Met debut two seasons agoas Despina the servant girl and fifth wheel to four malicious and befuddledlovers in Mozarts Cos fan tutte  She did not enter down a curvingstaircase but rather toting a house on a rope like a bargeand made itimmediately clear that she was carrying the whole production            Bartoli is a wildly popularsinger of relatively unpopular music a singer who could probably fillstadiums but prefers to keep her audiences at close quarters Last year sheopted to give a recital in Lincoln Centers Alice Tully Hall rather than inthe larger Avery Fisher Hall to the chagrin of the presenter She has beenleaning on the Met to find a more intimate venue for her projects She hasgravitated toward the strippeddown aesthetic of originalinstrument ensemblesWhile Pavarotti and his two sidekick tenors have been turning opera into amassappeal juggernaut Bartoli has been trying to shrink a bloated genreThats the effort for which she really deserves megastardom
