                                 Matisse vs Picasso            Therelationship between the artists Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso is the subjectof a new exhibition at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth Texas calledMatisse and Picasso A Gentle Rivalry The theme of this show and of thebook that accompanies it by the Harvard art historian YveAlain Bois is thatthe two masters of modern painting were playing a kind of chess game all theirlives Picasso the younger artist was constantly trying to get Matissesattention by showing off stealing from his work and rudely parodying himMatisse envious of Picassos success tried to ignore him until the s whenhe needed Picassos influence to bring himself out of an artistic funk Afterthat they traded paintings visits and little notes But they were toocompetitive to really be friends            I dont think Bois takesthis implication of this creative tension quite far enough The MatissePicassorivalry is more than just the great artistic competition of the  thcentury Its a scheme for dividing all art into two parts Side by side aMatisse and a Picasso can look amazingly similar Yet at a deeper level theyare fundamentally radically incompatible Although its possible to admireboth artists something impels you to choose sides At the end of the dayeveryone is either a Matisse person or a Picasso person            Matisse is a cool calm Northern European artist Picassois a hot temperamental Spaniard Matisse famously said that a painting shouldbe like a comfortable armchair His paintings are harmonious luxurious andsoothing Picasso can virtually copy a Matisse tableau without producinganything like the same effect In his rendition the same fruit on a pedestalcontains an element of dissonance disturbance and even violence WhereMatisse is sensuous Picasso is sexual Matisse loves fabric Picasso lovesflesh            The division seems like aversion of the one drawn by Friedrich Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedybetween Apollonian and Dionysian art The Apollonian comes from the Greek godApollo the god of light who was associated with rationality and itssubspecialties law medicine and philosophy The Dionysian comes fromDionysius the god of wine and fertility who was worshipped with drunkenorgies in the woods at which nonparticipants were ripped to pieces TheApollonian spirit is one of measure reason and control the Dionysian is oneof abandon irrationality and ecstatic release The clash between the twoprinciples was what produced Greek tragedy according to Nietzsche ThatMatisse is essentially an Apollonian artist and Picasso a Dionysian is evidenteven from the backhanded compliments they paid each other Matisse calledPicasso capricious and unpredictable Picasso described Matisses paintingsas beautiful and elegant            In dividing all art into two categories Nietzsche renderedthe service of coming up with one of the great intellectual parlor games of alltime Critics love to devise variations for their fields Richard Martin thedirector of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New YorkCity divides the world into Giorgio Armani vs Gianni Versace Armani withhis serene muted tones and clean lines is the Apollonian designer The lateVersace with his Miami colors outrageous impracticality and explicitsexuality is the Dionysian And its true The models in Armani ads look likeGreek statues In Versace ads they look like drugged bacchants The Apollonianspirit is about good taste elegance and beauty The Dionysian mixes bad tastewith good taste pain with pleasure            You canapply Nietzsches dichotomy to just about any set of contemporaries or creativerivals With artists you might start with Leonardo vs Michelangelo Leonardothe scientific rationalist and inventor is an Apollonian his work is ownedby among others the archrationalist Bill Gates Michelangelo though heworked principally in the Apollonian medium of marble expresses a moreanimalistic violence and passion work owned by the pope Mark Rothko is aMatisse type Jackson Pollock is a Picasso type The Beatles with theirwellcrafted melodies are the Apollonians The Rolling Stones darker moresubterranean and with a deeper rhythm section are more in touch withDionysius Only Dionysians have sympathy for the devil You might like bothbands but ultimately youre with one or the other Youre either a Beatlesperson or a Stones person just like youre either a Matisse person or aPicasso person            In American literature Phillip Rahv devised the classicdivision into two categories in a famous essay titled Paleface and RedskinAmerican writers were either Europeanized literary wimps like Henry James orcelebrants of the native animalistic spirits like Mark Twain The Apollonianline begins with Washington Irving the Dionysian with James Fenimore CooperIn the ApolloMatisseArmaniBeatles column we find Emily Dickinson Oppositeher in the DionysiusPicassoVersaceStones column is Walt Whitman NathanielHawthorne is a Matisse Herman Melville is a Picasso In the  thcentury we come to F Scott Fitzgerald Matisse vs Ernest HemingwayPicasso and John Updike Matisse vs Norman Mailer who wrote a biography ofPicasso            You can in fact apply the division to just aboutany natural pairing and then use that pairing to redivide the world Of courseyou can Whos going to arrest you Ive been
