   Who Cares if Johnny CantRead by Larissa MacFarquhar is a truly stupid article whose only pointis that there is a big difference between basic reading and highbrow readingBut this is not a crucial distinction for people concerned about literacy inthis country There has been a palpable decline in literacy in America over thelast  years Even the average university student both knows less and bycommonsense measures is less intelligent than his or her predecessors Andeven if IQ has not declined on a mass scale and I suspect that it has thereis a point at which lack of curiosity and sheer ignorance are indistinguishablefrom a deficiency of intelligence This article was a good example ofsupposedly skeptical and revisionist garbage                           HarveyScodel                                       LyingIlliterates                        Who Cares if Johnny CantRead by Larissa MacFarquhar is so off base that it is difficult to fathomthat she really believes what she is saying I am the president of the LiteracyCouncil of Garland County Ark and I know that the functional illiteracy ratein our state is  percent            Her datais obviously faulty It is nonsense to ask an illiterate person if hes readinga book Of course hes going to say yes The last thing an illiterate personwants to advertise is the fact that he cant read Our culture is filled withways to help people hide their illiteracy Restaurants like Shoneys andDennys feature pictures of their entrees on the menu so those who cant readcan still order their meal And people know who wrote Huckleberry Finnand other books because they have learned from television and the movies                           Ann WSchmidt                                       Lay Offthe Lama                        Thanks toDavid Plotz for giving me the link to the Dalai Lamas Web site in hisAssessment The Ambassador From ShangriLa But other than that it was acomplete and utter waste of my time Plotz thinks the Dalai Lama is merelycashing in on the Wests romance with Eastern spirituality The Dalai Lama isthe only world religious leader who acts the way many feel a world religiousleader shouldspeaking inclusively to people about his faith instead of tryingto ban women from the priesthood and gays and lesbians from humanity ingeneral Maybe he is a feelgood optimist or maybe the answers are reallysimpler than our unnecessarily complex world would like to believe but eitherway the Dalai Lama is one of the few people in the world whom I canlegitimately not feel cynical about And David Plotz has dismally failed tochange my mind                           AlCotton                                       Uncle Samthe Mooch                        Jodie T Allens articleI Like theIRS is based on an extremely dangerous and faulty premise All incomebelongs to the government and the portion we are allowed to keep is some sortof present The flaw is best expressed when she refers to last week aswindfall week As we all know the money in a tax refund is money that thetaxpayer earned and was kept by the government for up to a year withoutinterest Windfall Incredible            Allens comments about taxshelters are similarly puzzling Can she possibly mean that we should pay morein taxes than the law requires She then goes on to extol the virtues of ourbeloved IRS distracting us from the actual percentage of our income that isbeing taken            As for herdiscussion of the graduated tax and the flattax proposal she blithely opinesthat taxing higherincome individuals is OK because the dollars are lessprecious but she knows that we are talking about percentages of their totalincome not a fixed amount I think Slates articles are usually insightfulthe authors informed and the viewpoints balanced but Allens articlepossesses none of these virtues             CharlesVan Cleef                                       Amen tothe IRS                        I agree with Jodie TAllens argument in I Like the IRS The present tax system is pretty fair and iscertainly more democratic than a flat tax The system of exemptions anddeductions although perhaps a little complicated really means that ones taxobligations are custom tailored to ones specific circumstances Paradoxicallythe more we try to simplify the code and the more one size fits all we tryto make it the less conforming to our individual needs the system becomes            The problem is we arealways trying to have it both ways We want all the breaks and we want asimple system The two approaches unfortunately are mutually exclusive If wego to a flat tax and then people find out that theyre paying more than othersthey perceive as less deserving they are going to scream like stuck pigs Ifpeople are unhappy nowthanks to contentious selfserving news writers whoare more bent on garnering attention through controversy than they are throughenlightenmentthey are going to be miserable when they realize what they havedone to themselves            My onlycomplaint with the IRS is that they seem to be lagging in the computer area aproblem I attribute to the politicization of the IRSs top management We get anew top person with each administration and then its a whole newballgameagain and again The heads of the IRS ought to be like the heads ofthe FBI or the chairmen of the Fed above party serving terms that transcendincoming and outgoing administrations                           Collingwood Harris                                       TaxingAmbition                        I beg to differ with Jodie TAllens I Likethe IRS As a yearold college graduate recently married I was one ofthose  percent that you spoke of who didnt get money back But even if Ihad this should not be viewed as a source of income or bonus How about thefact that the government has held that money over the course of the yearpreventing you from collecting interest or circulating it throughout theeconomy There is no positive outlook in having the government hold on to yourmoney so you can get a bonus check at the end of the year            Moreover your definition ofrich is concerning You feel that you can judge who values a dollar more basedon community standards However we live in America a country that was builton individualism Taxes do not empower the individual they empower thegovernment and sucker people by taking their extra income to fundgovernmentprogram flops            Whatcontinues to baffle me about progressive taxing is why people care so much whatSteve Forbes Bill Gates or I pay in taxes We should trust the businessmenwho turn  into  and make our economy stronger improve our overallstandard of living and even provide jobs These are the people that drive oureconomy The more money you take out of their hands the more money you take outof the economy Our current method only penalizes people for making more moneyWe have turned monetary success into a crime It is no wonder our society isfloundering around and the current generation is called Generation X                           TonyStanich                                       PutDworkins Argument out of Its Misery                        In the Dialogue onassistedsuicide Ronald Dworkin holds that neither a woman aborting her fetus nora terminally ill patient killing himself involves either important interestsof other people or an action horribly against the actors own interests Idisagree            The definition of humanityis not intrinsically questionable For some it is clear From conception untildeath human life is sacred Dworkin reduces the ontological status of thefetus to an issue of ownership by calling it her fetus using an assumptioncentral to the validation of the masterslave relationship He implies thatkilling is justified when it releases a willing victim from pain a maxim thatcould lead to a justification of slaying the innocent to avoid any otherpainful social or personal dilemma            Dworkinwishes to replace the moral teleology of law with obeisance to culturalprejudices informing us that unjust acts may be countenanced when popularideology asserts them to be personal and hence putatively free of legalrestraint But the better part of Western thought has always affirmed that theprinciples of law are ineluctably related to the principles
