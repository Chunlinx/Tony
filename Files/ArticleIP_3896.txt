                       A Needfor Speed                        If were going to have adebate lets at least get the facts right For starters in Speed Trap Paul Krugmanmisspelled my name Ill get over it More important he is just as careless indepicting the arguments of those of us who think the economy is now capable ofdecent growth without reigniting inflation            My essay The NewEconomy What it Really Means in Business Week was much morebalanced and modest in its claims than Krugman suggests I invite                  Slate                readers to reread my piece rather than accept Krugmanscaricature of it then decide for themselves Business Week hasgenerally been right about the performance of the economy in recent yearsandright in urging the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates If the Fed hadraised rates in order to hold growth down to  percent over the last months as Krugman seems to prefer we would have given up  billion ineconomic output The unemployment rate would have been at least a halfpercentage point higher putting more than  people out of work             was awonderful yearstrong growth declining inflation declining unemploymentrising

Week                           PaulKrugman replies                                       First of all my extremeapologies for the spelling mistake                                       As for substance We nowsee just how helpful an Internet magazine can be By all means read theoriginal Shepard essay in Business Week notice that I did includea link to that essay in my original piece as well as the earlier articles onthe site and ask yourself whether they did or did not appear to claim that ourfavorable measured growth and inflation performance can be explained byunmeasured productivity growth If they did claim or even suggest thatthen Business Week has indeed been saying something very silly Oh andby the way Reread myown piece and ask whether I actually say that growth over the past months should have been held down to  percent as Shepard claims I seem toprefer                                       What I do know is that anumber of Business Week readers have contacted me since reading my pieceand told me that the explanation of the speedometer fallacy was new tothemthat they were under the impression from reading BW  among othersources that a hidden productivity boom was not only a possible explanation oflow measured inflation but indeed the leading candidate                                       I guessmy question is whether Mr Shepard is willing even now to concede that it isa fallacy to invoke unmeasured productivity as the source of our good numbersAnd I dont mean a judicious acknowledgment that there may be something towhat I saywe are talking    here with no wiggle room whatsoeverExtremism in the defense of arithmetic is no vice If he is then I am atleast prepared to consider the possibility that I and everyone else I knowhave been misinterpreting all those articles But I would like to have thepoint acknowledged                                       OptionPass                        I thoroughly enjoy                  Slate                but I find Michael Kinsleys assertion of                  Slate               s journalistic integrity as regards Microsoft Readme to be withoutmerit            Consider the case where ajudge discovers that he is presiding over a case involving a close relativeThe only ethical course of action is to step down and have some other judgehandle the case Even if the judge tries his best to be fair and unbiased hecan never be sure of his own motives In addition the judges own reputationis at risk as people will not know if the relative in question was foundinnocent due to subtle manipulation by the judge                                             Slate                employees receive Microsoft stock options and thereforehave a vested interest in Microsoft beyond their own paycheck If                  Slate                wants to prove its integrity it should either refuse theoptions or stop covering Microsoft altogether             Robert DGraham                                       TheGreatest of Sleaze                        In DearMicrosoft Jacob Weisberg seems to assert that lobbyists and lobbyingare somehow sleazy            The First Amendment to theConstitution guarantees the right to petition the Government for a redress ofgrievances Thats lobbying  Exercising that right is no more sleazythan exercising the right to speak or to worship Clearly there are sleazy andunethical ways to go about it but lobbying itself is vital to our democraticprinciples            The bestsolution to the problem of corporate money in politics is to reduce the role ofgovernment in all our lives Until that happens corporations are irresponsibleif they fail to pursue the interests of their shareholders employees andcustomers by lobbying Beltway bureaucrats             David C

importantlyher assertion that the audience is unclear about Cagneys true state of mind atthe end of Angels With Dirty Faces is just plain wrong The entire heartof that character was his utter fearlessness at the prospect of dying Rockygoes yellow only so that his reputation will be sullied among the youthfulwannabe gangsters who idolize him It is an act of renunciation that ennobleshim in death and is undertaken solely due to the entreaty of his old pal JerryConnelly Pat OBrien who knows that asking Rocky to pretend hes acoward is the hardest favor hes ever sought For Kerr to imagine anything atall ambiguous in the ending of this movie not only calls into question herjudgment but forces one to wonder if shes even seen the damned thing             David Murray LosAngeles                           JavanileHumor                        Andrew Shuman clearly has noidea what he is talking about when it comes to the question of Java Weak Java            Java although this hasclearly escaped Shumans keen eyesight is not a programming language at allIt is in fact a mountainous island in the South Pacific part of the verypopulous and highly authoritarian archipelago nation of Indonesia It alsohappens to be the site of one of the worlds most important archeologicaldiscoveries known as Java Man and of vast coffee plantations hence thecommon usage of the term java to mean coffee These simple facts getlost in Shumans clutter of technical language With his preposterouscharacterization of the whole Java conflict as a matter of convenience forpersonalcomputer owners and programmers Shuman completely obscures the realstruggles of the Javanese people            There is in fact nosurprise here since Shuman works and lives in Seattle home of innumerablecoffee shops and some of the nations largest defense contractors who reapbillions annually from arms sales to the repressive regime of PresidentSuharto Workers on Javanese coffee plantations suffer endlessly
