                okay um what do you think   well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house   well that makes a big difference doesnt it   weve weve gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van   its kind of like well if right a little more domestic there   yeah   yeah i i guess the biggest factor for me lately is American versus non American and while id really like to buy American i dont know it just it really depends on reliability for me   yeah   uh i have a Ford right now and its been a pretty good truck but some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of customer uh customer service at least for me so its i dont know its its kind of disappointing   well well when we  i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought itd be nice to buy American and i went and looked at all the American ones   but yeah   and the doors didnt close right and the i mean and this is on the lot and youre thinking to yourself if its not right now what is it gonna be like after ive had it for six months   yeah   right   so   well one of the good i guess one of the good things that i have to work on is my my father hes a pharmaceutical rep and he he gets a new car about once every three years   yeah uhhuh   and hes been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years   yeah   and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van   yeah   um its the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but i dont know i guess i guess for my next car id probably have to probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick up starting to get into that im a college student right now im a doctoral student   uhhuh   and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so  you know probably one of those things where i really dont need the the hauling capacity much ill be a little more stable but   yeah   well i guess i dont know im i i think ill probably buy American but im just not real sure you know   you have to go out of here go talk to dad yeah well um i know ive ive always looked for mileage   umhum   uh you know cause i figure the the better miles it gets the better but the less pollutants its putting out cause the better job its doing burning stuff up   sure and i yeah   uh   and that opens up a whole another can of worms i guess Ford is suppose to start out with theyre gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in California   yeah doesnt that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving   you know yeah umhum oh thatd be a definite yeah thatd be the way to go for sure i think theres no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i   go away from here   sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation   just a minute       David remove Jeffrey from my presence im on the telephone     i bet theyd have something to say about buying cars huh   well my my kids oh my kids think its great weve  unfortunately our convertibles have been retired for lack lack of time on our part to um to work on them but we have a Fiat an old Fiat and an old MGB   yeah oh really   sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that thats going to be their cars       Jeffrey hasnt figured out yet just you know its like who want oh Jeffreys only three you know and the but the other ones arent very old either   how old are they oh i see uhhuh   so its like whos going to inherit you know Jeffreys like well you know station wagon a mini van you know you got to go get another old convertible my husband well my husband would love to buy next is a Miata   right     yeah oh yeah   you know is the Mazda Miata   yeah ive heard some good things about that car actually   its suppposed to be   yeah   really solid car we have a a Mazda right now   yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design thats thats what im going into for my degree   yeah oh neat   and so thats thats something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do but   well it they have something that you know i theres some things i like better about my Subaru and some things i like better about the Mazda and uh you know and im always looking at that kind of thing at other peoples cars and   umhum yeah   yeah it it   its amazing how much spot light its gotten lately you know it seems like everyone thats a big concern now you know its   well its not just you know but like i have one car that tells me which door is open and the other one only tells me that a door is open   yeah uhhuh   so when it only tells me that a door is open i have to get out of the car and go around slamming doors until i mean thats a nuisance thats a real pain     yeah   yeah um and one of them only has the standard full to empty gauge and the other
