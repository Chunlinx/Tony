                                 Galluping Off to War                           USAToday leads with new poll results indicating that Americans are evenmore hawkish about Iraq than the White House The Washington Post and New York Timesgo with US maneuvers to limit UN SecretaryGeneral Annans ability toindependently negotiate with Saddam Hussein And the Los AngelesTimes leads with the Clinton administration push for tighter regulationof managed care            In the latest USAT CNNGallup Poll  percent of respondents approveof air strikes while  percent go beyond the Clinton administration and alsosupport the use of ground troops against Iraq And by two to one thosesurveyed support the idea of removing Saddam from power over PresidentClintons goal of merely substantially reducing his ability to use weapons ofmass destruction The NYT front seems to find a more conflicted publicWhile most people seem to believe the United States should take action againstIraq there is plenty of doubt and almost universal exasperation that Americanforces might once again be placed in harms way But USAT does findthat support for removing Saddam falls significantly when questions assumedsubstantial US or Iraqi casualties or damage to US ties with Araballies            The NYT  WP  and USAT leads all report that the USwas instrumental in keeping the five permanent members of the UN SecurityCouncil from endorsing Annans goal of going to Baghdad to independentlynegotiate a settlement The US position is to accept nothing less than totalweapons inspection access            The Wall Street Journal and WP fronts continue thedailies rather unprecedented disclosure of the current thinking of US warplanners The Journal says that even with a new wavelet of improvedweapons the top brass doubts that the air attacks theyre planning candestroy all of Iraqs most terrible weapons or even change Saddams behaviorAmong the grounds for doubt ticked off by the Journal  US targetersarent really sure where the special weapons plants are and dont know what todo about dual use targets like hospitals that are also used to producebiological weapons The Post reports based on several unnamedwellplaced Pentagon sources that unlike in the Gulf War the preponderance ofplanned strikes are now targeted against socalled leadership targets not so much air defense sites or depots asfor example secret police headquarters The paper says the administrationdoesnt want to advertise this            The LAT lead about managed care reform covers groundfirst staked out by a NYT lead a few months ago The reason its back inthe news is that legislation drafted by Democrats that requires federalstandards for health insurance plans and an appeals process to enforce themwill be taken up when Congress returns from recess next week The managed careindustry and the nations largest employers will fight this vehemently theLAT says            Despite Bill Clintons public pledge to cooperate fully with Ken Starrsinvestigation the LAT front reports that the president has been usingone of the best tools available for frustrating a criminalinvestigationnamely entering into joint defense agreements with others beinginvestigated in the case Such agreements says the paper have allowed thepresidents defense team to learn what questions are being posed and whatanswers given during grand jury sessions The paper suggests that bothClintons secretary Betty Currie and White House steward Bayani Nelvis haveentered into such agreements with BC Presidential lawyers tell the LATthat they expect Starr to challenge these agreements            All too often the contemporary newspaper correction resembles one of thosejoke business cards that say See other side on both sides Witness todays correction in the WP  In an article Sundayformer CIA director Robert M Gates said that during the  Persian Gulf WarUS officials were hoping that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would bekilled in a bombing raid The headline on the story incorrectly characterizedUS policy regarding Saddam Husseins death Notice that this doesnt includeeither the original headline or an explanation of the way in which it wasincorrect in its characterization Its only when the reader digs out theSunday article that he learns the headline referred to Saddams death as a GulfWar goal By hiding the ball this way the Post misses the chance toexplore the intelligence community sophistry at work here Ordinarily if youhope for something and do things that ordinarily could be expected to bring itabout then it would count as one of your goals But because the USgovernment operates under a presidential executive order forbidding theassassination of foreign leaders US military planners who want to eliminatea foreign leader have to perfect the mental trick of hoping for eg Saddamsdeath as they plan to eg bomb the building where they know he sleeps but atthe same time being genuinely surprised if he were to die as a result
