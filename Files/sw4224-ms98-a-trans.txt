        hey um generally i am majority majority majority of the news that i get is from uh AM radio in the mornings but going to and from work i we have like uh a a WCBS station which which just kind of fires through all the top topics     umhum   how do you uh how do you generally find out whats going on in the world   oh i dont know oh i listen in the car but my commute is only only a mile so       uh but uh you know i have the uh radio wake me up in the morning so i get i get some headlines there   oh okay   i read the usenet news   okay   uh really im not getting the good quality news that i want and i i bought a TV last year       but but i dont really watch it   youre behind yeah   oh and i dont i dont believe i dont get any in depth stuff   i used to have uh i used to have cable and uh the thing that i really miss um since uh since i lost cable and theres that not that much on there that i miss but uh       Headline News was always good because i could get a quick roundup of whatever the top topics were in in like a half hour span and in Around the World in Thirty Minutes i think was their big thing and the other thing i used to i uh i miss is CNN um CNN used to go a little bit more in depth um you would get uh like Crossfire you would get you know different different perspectives from usually from like the left and the right liberal and conservative arguing the various uh   oh Crossfire yeah i saw that a couple of times     i think Patrick Buchanan whos now running for president used to be the uh conservative side for that   who did they have ive my friends who watch CNN all the time they like knew these guys   i cant think of the name of the guy that represented the left   yeah uh i saw the uh McLaughlin had a similar type of a program on   yeah   i guess Buchanan retired from that also   umhum   that thats a good show i like that one a lot   yeah thats actually on a network isnt it   yeah its on i guess it was on PBS for a while   thats exactly right   probably still is   and and uh see because ive run into that a couple of times on accident and uh ended up watching it for like extended periods of time but thats how i get most of my news is is   yeah yeah PBS PBS PBS uh you know MacNeil Lehrer or uh NPR usually have some decent in depth stuff   i tried listening to NPR but uh uh i mean in the mornings i dont in the mornings i want i want a little i want you know the the yeah the USA Today feed you know  give me a couple of color graphs and uh and ill be happy   headlines   oh God i hate that yeah we have uh you know the local newspaper is is pretty weak   uh umhum   but uh and i once in a every once in a while like every six months or every three months i read the Times   umhum   the Times is pretty good   the only thing that scares me about um the way i do news is getting it from like these pre digested sources you know like the like the typically what ive heard maybe its just the people i hang around with but typically i hear people saying that like uh the news on TV and what not tends to be um more on the left hand side it tends to be a little bit more liberal and if nothing else it does tend to be more editorialized than these are the facts   well not only that but its so little theres no background   true too   uh you know i rely a lot to tell you the truth on uh you know when i was growing up i learned geography id read the Times a lot so you know and every every day thered be an article on some country you know whats doing in that country this week   umhum   you know because theres enough countries that uh you know thered be something interesting happening       pretty much and i got a pretty good feel for you know and um that and taking some economics classes you get a pretty good feel for how the world works   umhum   so when you hear a story then you say well what arent they telling you   yeah   and then you start conjecturing and thats where i hate i hate it because you know i can guess whats happening but i dont know the real truth and uh they just they leave out so much     but see i think you and i perhaps i i think uh well i get the feeling that that you and i perhaps might might take the time to try and figure out exactly what really happened as opposed to what theyre telling us even though they maybe close   yeah     but i wonder how much of the rest of America takes the time to to stop with just the the straight spoon fed you know   huh you can stop wondering       they dont care   yeah yeah well especially when you figure what a third of the people that bother to vote always vote Republican a third of the people that always that bother to vote always vote Democrat and
