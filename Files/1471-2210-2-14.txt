                    Background        Prostaglandin E          is a major cyclooxygenase metabolite        of arachidonic acid which exerts diverse effects on        vascular smooth muscle tone and epithelial solute transport        via Gprotein coupled receptors      At least four        distinct Gprotein coupled PGE          receptors have been cloned the EP           EP           EP           and EP              Pharmacological studies        suggest PGE          relaxes vascular smooth muscle through        two of these receptors the EP          and EP          receptors which couple to cyclicAMP        generation     In contrast PGE          constricts other vascular smooth        muscle through EP          receptors which inhibit cAMP        generation via G         i or EP          receptors which increase Ca        mobilization     Although both EP          and EP          receptors relax smooth muscle EP          receptors are uniquely sensitive to        the agonists butaprost and AH      Previous        studies have shown that PGE          increases the cAMP concentration in        many tissues including kidney intestine and uterus but        the relative contribution of EP          versus EP          receptors to these effects is        incompletely defined      Recent studies in mice with        targeted disruption of these receptors have suggested an        important role for EP receptor in regulating systemic        hemodynamics Deficiency of the EP receptor is associated        with a defect in counteracting vasopressor effect of PGE           and the development of salt sensitive hypertension            suggesting a predominant normal vasodepressor role of        EP receptor in blood pressure regulation        The vasodepressor action of PGE may also play an        important role in the kidney It has been previously shown        that PGE not only directly dilates renal arteries             but also attenuates the AngIIinduced increase in        renal vascular resistance    through inhibition of        AngIIelicited intracellular Ca increase in vascular        smooth muscle cells of preglomerular vasculature            Based on the fact that PGE stimulates cAMP generation in        freshly isolated preglomerular renal arterioles            the cAMPstimulating EP or EP receptor has been thought        to mediate these effects of PGE on renal resistance        vessels        There is also evidence suggesting that intrarenal EP        and EP receptor activates cAMPstimulated salt and water        transport along the nephron        Although the        localization of EP EP and EP has been determined in        human kidney by in situ hybridization segmental        distribution of cAMPcoupled EP receptor along the nephron        was not detected by this method     To more clearly        define the physiologic role of this cAMP coupled EP        receptor we cloned the rabbit EP          receptor characterized its        pharmacology and signaling These studies also defined the        tissue distribution with a focus on vascular intrarenal        and reproductive localization of the rabbit EP receptor        mRNA                    Results                  Receptor isolation          Screening of    plaques from a rabbit genomic          library using a fulllength human cDNA for the EP            receptor resulted in isolation of          two independent clones designated B  kb and A           kb A  coding exon of EP            receptor was contained in clone B          while a  coding exon was contained in clone A          Sequence data indicated that the entire coding region was          present in these two exons A potential translation          initiation codon in the NotIBamHI fragment  kb of          clone B starts an open reading frame that encodes a          polypeptide sequence highly homologous to the first six          transmembrane domains of the human EP receptor              The amino acid sequence of the open reading frame in the          NotI fragment  kb of clone A was homologous to the          seventh transmembrane domain TMD VII followed by a          short Cterminal tail and an inframe stop codon An          intron with a donor and acceptor splice site was located          following the coding region corresponding to the sixth          transmembrane domain of the protein          A functional cDNA clone was obtained by screening a          rabbit uterus cDNA library using a  bp AvaII cDNA          fragment from clone B Two types of positive          overlapping clones A and REP             were isolated Of the           positive cDNA clones isolated  belonged to the type          designated REP            A and  clones belonged to the          type designated REP Sequence analysis indicated          that these two cDNAs possess an identical open reading          frame and  bp of downstream  untranslated region          UTR however clone REP            A possesses an  additional          base pairs in the UTR compared with REP It is          also noted that there are  and  AUUUA motifs in  UTR          of REP and REPA respectively suggesting an          instability of rabbit EP receptor mRNA in vivo          Because both rabbit EP cDNA clones A and REP             lacked  codons          corresponding to the  end of the human EP receptor and          which were present in the rabbit genomic sequence a          fulllength sequence of the rabbit EP            was constructed by ligating a          SacIIXhoI cDNA fragment nucleotide  from the          cDNA clone A with the upstream Hind IIISacII fragment          nucleotide  of the rabbit genomic clone This          created an open reading frame of  base pairs with an          inframe TGA stop codon The existence of this  UTR          sequence in native cDNA was confirmed by RTPCR on RNA          isolated from rabbit uterus data not shown The          predicted polypeptide is comprised of  amino acids          with a calculated molecular weight of  kDa Its          hydrophobic profile reveals the presence of seven          hydrophobic stretches characteristic of Gproteincoupled          receptors    Fig  Comparison of the deduced          amino acid sequence of rabbit EP            with human and mouse EP            shows  and  sequence identity          respectively Fig                           Ligand binding properties of the EP          receptor          The putative rabbit EP            receptor was pharmacologically          characterized using membranes from COS cells          transiently transfected with a rabbit EP expression          vector pcDNAREP             Membranes from EP            receptor transfected COS cells          exhibited saturable  HPGE            binding with a dissociation constant          of    nM and a maximum binding capacity B           max  of  pmolmg of membrane          protein Radioligand binding studies were performed using          various prostanoids and EPreceptor subtypespecific          agonists to compete for PGE binding Competition binding          experiments revealed a rank order affinity consistent          with an EP receptor PGE             iloprost  PGD             PGF            Fig A  HPGE            binding was partially displaced by          the EP            agonist misoprostol and was not          displaced by the EP            agonist sulprostone Fig B          Furthermore the EP            selective agonists butaprost free          acid and AH competed for  HPGE            binding with K           i values of  M and  M          respectively suggesting this receptor is the rabbit EP            receptor                               Signal transduction properties of the EP          receptor          Incubation of EP            transfected COS cells with          butaprost free acid produced a concentrationdependent          increase in cAMP accumulation with an EC            of  nM Fig  Cells          transfected with the vector alone demonstrated no          significant increase in cAMP in response to butaprost          free acid                          Tissue distribution of the rabbit EP          receptor          Solution hybridizationRNase protection assays with a          radiolabeled antisense EP            riboprobe resulted in a          RNaseresistant fragment of the appropriate size  bp          Fig  EP            receptor mRNA was detected in          several tissues including ileum spleen and liver Lower          expression was found in kidney uterus lung heart          liver adrenal gland brain urinary bladder and skeletal          muscle Furthermore EP            receptor mRNA was detected by RNase          protection assay in all blood vessels examined Fig           including arteries and veins of large and small caliber          Fig A C and renal preglomerular vasculature          Fig B The expression level of the EP            receptor mRNA in these vessels was          comparable to that of the EP            receptor Fig  EP            receptor mRNA was also detected in          vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from rabbit aorta          Fig A                          Intrarenal localization of the rabbit EP          receptor                    In situ hybridization was performed          to examine the distribution of the EP            receptor gene expression in the          kidney and uterus Sections of rabbit renal and uterine          tissues were hybridized with the  Slabeled riboprobe          from the same cDNA probe used in RNaseprotection assays          As observed for the mouse EP            in the uterus a significant          hybridization signal was detected mainly in the          endometrial epithelium of the rabbit uterus with less          expression in myometrium Fig  Consistent with          previous observation in man     only a diffuse weak          EP mRNA signal was detected in the rabbit kidney Figure           To further elucidate the distribution of EP receptor          along the nephron nephron segments were dissected and          expression of EP was determined using RTPCR As shown          in figure  PCR products with expected sizes were          obtained for both EP receptor  bp and GAPDH           bp Identity of the amplified products was confirmed by          Southern hybridization not shown and sequencing As          positive control RTPCR was performed using  g of          total RNA isolated from rabbit spleen figure  As          negative control PCR were also performed in the absence          of reverse transcription without identifiable product          indicating the origination of PCR products were from mRNA          other than genomic DNA figure  EP receptor mRNA was          easily detected in glomeruli and medullary collecting          ducts MCD Detectable EP mRNA was also present in thin          descending limbs of Henle tDL and cortical collecting          ducts CCD          In cultured cells RNase protection assay detected EP          expression in renal medullary interstitial cells MICs          while no signal was detected in cultured cortical          collecting ducts or glomerular mesangial cells Fig          B C EP mRNA was also detected in cultured          rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells Figure          A                            Discussion        The present studies describe the cloning and        characterization of the rabbit EP          receptor With this information cDNA        sequence for all four rabbit EP receptors is now available              Several similarities between the rabbit and        mouse EP          receptors exist      The rabbit        EP          genomic clone contains an intron with        consensus splice donor and acceptor sites near the end of        transmembrane domain TM VI The relative position of the        intron to the coding regions is also identical to that        found in the human TP the human and mouse DP and the        human EP          gene     This provides further        evidence that the prostanoid receptor family arose from a        common ancestral gene The rabbit EP          gene contains a  bp open reading        frame coding for a  amino acid polypeptide with a        calculated molecular weight of  Daltons Its amino        acid profile reveals the presence of seven hydrophobic        regions which likely represent transmembrane domains        Unlike the TP and EP          receptors no alternative splicing in        the EP          receptor was found in the coding        region      Diversity of EP          mRNAs in the mouse was found in both        the  UTR and the  UTR     Similar diversity in the         sequence of the rabbit EP          receptor cDNA clones isolated from the        uterine library was observed in the present studies The        significance of this mRNA splicing is not yet known but it        might play a role in stability or translation efficiency of        EP          transcripts            Ligand binding studies confirm that the rabbit EP        receptor preferentially binds PGE          with significantly higher affinity        than other endogenous prostanoids Its low affinity for PGD                  PGF           iloprost misoprostol and        sulprostone suggest it is not an EP           EP          or IP receptor      As        demonstrated for the EP          receptor in other species              butaprost free acid and AH  two synthetic PG        agonists with selectivity for the EP          subtype efficiently and dose        dependently compete for  H PGE          binding to this newly cloned rabbit        receptor Inhibition of PGE          binding to the rabbit EP          receptor by AH is about  times        greater than that to rabbit EP          in transfected COS cells        unpublished data Finally the EP          selective agonist butaprost free acid        dosedependently stimulated cAMP generation in COS cells        transfected with the rabbit EP          receptor These results are in        agreement with observations with human rat and mouse EP        receptors       which also couple to cAMP        generation Taken together these results clearly        demonstrate that the pharmacology of this receptor        corresponds to an EP          receptor rather than an EP          receptor        The expression level of rabbit EP receptor mRNA is        relatively low Nuclease protection analysis demonstrated        rabbit EP          expression is highest in ileum liver        and spleen with a lower expression in kidney uterus        brain adrenal gland lung heart bladder stomach and        skeletal muscle This mRNA expression pattern is similar to        that of the EP          in the mouse      PGE          has been reported to stimulate cAMP        formation in many tissues including intestine        microdissected renal tubule segments and uterus via        butaprost sensitive and insensitive receptors                The mRNA expression results are consistent with        these functional studies and suggest that the EP          receptor plays important roles in        mediating PGE stimulated cAMP generation in these tissues                            The presence of the rabbit EP          receptor mRNA in the uterus also        support a role for this receptor as an important mediator        of PGE          action in this organ This is in        agreement with previous studies which demonstrate that EP          is expressed and highly regulated in        uterine luminal epithelium cells by ovarian steroids during        the periimplantation period        The change in        level of the EP          receptor expression in the uterus may        contribute to the increase in G         S protein content and cAMP concentration        in midgestation and the decrease at term             Because the EP          receptor is a G         S coupled cAMPstimulating receptor        the EP          receptor may participate in the        physiological regulation of uterine relaxation during        pregnancy and the transition into uterine contraction at        the onset of the labor Lack of normal uterine EP          expression may also contribute to        implantation defect reported in EP          mice             PGE          also plays a critical role in        regulating systemic blood pressure      Although the        receptor mediating the predominant vasodilator effect of        PGE          remains only partially defined recent        gene targeting studies suggest that the EP          receptor may be an important        vasodilator         in vivo      The rabbit ear        artery has been used as a classic pharmacological model of        an EP          responsive tissue while the rabbit        jugular vein has been proposed to be an EP          bearing target tissue              however in the present studies EP          receptor mRNA was detected in both        vessels EP          mRNA expression was also detected in        the rabbit aorta and inferior vena cava thus providing        further evidence that the EP          receptor is functionally expressed in        both arteries and veins Expression of this G         S coupled cAMPstimulating PGE          receptor in cultured vascular smooth        muscle cells isolated from the aorta supports a direct role        of the EP          receptor in mediating vascular        relaxation        PGE          has also been shown to stimulate cAMP        formation in several renal tissues notably preglomerular        microvasculature     renal glomeruli     thin        descending limb     medullary and cortical thick        ascending limb and collecting duct      Although EP                 receptor mRNA expression was detected        in the kidney and this was more pronounced in the renal        cortex than in the medulla no specific regions of EP          receptor mRNA expression could be        detected in rabbit kidney by         in situ hybridization            Nonetheless low levels of EP          receptor mRNA expression were detected        by RTPCR or RNase protection assay in nephron segments        within the kidney including preglomerular vasculature        glomeruli thin limbs of Henles loop and collecting ducts        The expression of EP receptor mRNA in medullary collecting        duct is distinct from functional studies in the cortical        collecting duct where butaprost had no functional effect             These data suggest a possible unique role for the        EP receptor in the medullary collecting duct as opposed to        cortical collecting duct Alternatively the PCR detection        of EP receptor expression in these microdissected segments        might result from the adherent renal interstitial cells        other than collecting duct itself since nuclease        protection analysis revealed a relatively high EP level in        cultured intersitial cells but failed to detect EP        expression in cultured collecting duct cells It is notable        that glomeruli and collecting ducts are distinguished from        other segments by high number of adherent cells Selective        expression of the EP receptor in interstitial cells is        consistent with a lack of segmental localization by in situ        hybridization Whether the EP          receptor participates in PGE          stimulated cAMP generation in        epithelial cells along the nephron awaits further        investigation                         Conclusions        In summary we have cloned and expressed a butaprost        sensitive rabbit PGE receptor that stimulates cAMP        formation and is present in many rabbit tissues        Physiological effects of PGE          through the EP          receptor may mediate important        physiological actions in these tissues EP expression in        uterus vasculature and the kidney suggests that this        receptor may play important roles in the functions of
