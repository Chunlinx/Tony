        well im having a hard time remembering  the last movie i saw   well i was too  i i thought i saw a lot of movies but i guess i i havent seen any really recently   yeah i guess uh i can remember seeing Dances With Wolves that was uh well thats uh thats an excellent film i i highly i highly recommend that in fact i guess theyre bringing that back out   well i havent seen that thats what everybody says oh are they   and uh theyre adding fifty minutes to it or something like that   see thats why i dont want to go see it because its three hours just to start of it i cant   thats right   i cant sit through a movie that long   so its going to be almost four hours before its over   i know i dont think ill see it   or beyond yeah beyond that uh   well i hear its a mans movie anyway   oh i wouldnt say that no because i my wife my my wife and i went and i think she enjoyed it even more than i did   really oh really   so uh unlike Field of Dreams i guess the last Kevin Costner movie wed seen before that was Field of Dreams i i guess id have to admit that probably was more of a guys movie than a   oh was it yeah   than a than a ladys movie   well its kind of like you know Steel Magnolia is to me was a womans movie   yeah yeah thats what we we saw that and i have to agree with you i think thats more of a ladys movie than a than a guys movie     yeah uh i was trying to think of the last movie i saw oh i saw i saw Ghost that was good   but uh oh okay yeah we saw that on video thats thats thats another thing i guess that uh its kind of   oh did you   kind of curbed uh us going out so much is that uh there was so many movies i didnt see when they came out beforehand that uh i know are coming out on video that you   yeah going out yeah   you look in the paper and you and you go well i can either see this or i can see this movie that i really wanted to see three years ago and didnt see   right i want to see Silence of the Lambs have you seen that   i havent and and i   i hear its excellent   i i hear its excellent and its probably something id id enjoy but i i heard that it was so uh kind of gruesome in scenes that that and that was the part i probably wouldnt like but i heard that uh the acting was was great and it was a really thrilling movie   yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh   and that in fact i read something in the paper here the other day that uh Anthony Hopkins i guess the guy who plays the the psycho or the villain that   uhhuh right   that uh hes getting letters from just all over you know the world and all that and and he suddenly become uh like a real screen idol or a uh   oh really     like a a leading man you know he thinks its funny but i guess uh woman in particular think its such a scary movie and that uh that   uhhuh oh yeah   that they just identify with not identify with him but they they like his character i i wouldnt say like like his character but theyre so fascinated by his character that uh they write him letters and and say how much they liked him and things like that   yeah thats what it is umhum well this guy at work told me not to go see it by myself at night or see it by myself at night  so i     thats probably thats probably a good idea unfortunately i think i i dont really enjoy movies with a whole lot of blood in them so uh   i dont either i myself i like romantic comedies myself but uh   yeah yeah ill ill go see a drama like uh when the Untouchables came out which is another Kevin Costner movie well this is going to be a rut isnt it   yeah my gosh youre you must be a big fan of his   i just so happen i guess we just see those but my wife actually talked me into going to see that and i didnt really want to go see it and it was you know it was kind of a a bloody movie but uh it was done in such a way that you know   uhhuh   and with gangsters and guns and all that i mean you are not going to avoid that so wasnt as   yeah i   it wasnt like they spent you know long shots relishing every drop or something like that   yeah i guess the last movie i saw was at Scenes From the Mall with Woody Allen and Bette Midler and i i guess you just have to be a big Woody Allen fan which im not i think you either hate him or like him   yeah yeah we we we did in fact i think that is the last movie that we saw was Scenes from Mall and   and i thought i thought it was terrible   yeah so did we we thought it was really lousy and it   yeah i i like her but i really dont like him for some reason in the first place trying to pass him off at age forty just almost was too much more than i could handle you know   and yeah he hes not forty anymore thats for sure   Lord no he hasnt seen forty in ten years has he   plus uh plus theres something about seeing those two walking through a mall just like and nobody paying attention is just like no no and especially with him carrying a yellow surfboard that was just like   yes huhuh isnt that the truth   this this is real realistic and you know if i saw Woody Allen and Bette Midler go by and hes still carrying a yellow surfboard i wouldnt notice him i wouldnt even see him       i believe i would too but and then the money they spent on that food that shrimp or or that sushi or something like hundred i mean eleven hundred dollars or something ended up spending nobody spends that kind of money i dont think   and oh yeah it was just a it was just a   yeah and i i just cant believe uh that you could use up two hours watching two people go from store to store in a mall   huhuh   you know just uh in fact that was the funny part of it was sitting there and just seeing mall shots going you know i could go to North Park or i could go to Collin Creek or something like that and see that so   no   right right that was a terrible   so uh it was just not really fun at all   no i came i had asked my neighbor to go with me and she decided to she had to fly so i thought ill go see it by myself   umhum   and im glad i didnt ask her to waste her time now because     or money   yeah i didnt i mean that was a horrible movie i   and we went to an early show on that one so we didnt uh   in fact i think i went to one of the early shows i didnt have to spend a bunch of money on it i think i got in for two seventy five or something i would have hated to have spent seven dollars on that   yeah oh gee yeah tell the truth but that   but she usually plays some pretty cute movies like that one with Nick Nolte that was Beverly Down and Out in Beverly Hills wasnt she in that   yeah yeah yeah i didnt get to see that i didnt get to see that but uh but   she was cute in that and uh i think i hear she was good in Beaches i didnt see that   i didnt see that either that was something well probably rent a video on one of these days but uh   i want to see that movie uh A Kiss Before   oh Kiss Before Dying or something like that ive just seen advertised but i guess i havent kept up on the movies that are out right just coming out right now   you die before yeah something like that i know i just see it advertise on TV and it really looks like it is going to be a thriller a good thriller   umhum umhum that uh sounds sounds like you are pretty much split between romantic comedies and thrillers then   yeah yeah i am i really dont like to see thrillers by myself but uh i will go see them i   yeah yeah i guess i guess the only real movie that we we wanted to go see and havent gone to see yet is is Class Action II with Gene Hackman   yeah i want to see that thats another good one   because uh hes usually i hear hes good in it but thats i guess hes good in almost everything he does so   yeah yeah i know it ive never seen him in anything bad yet   and uh so were were looking for one of these days to to see that   and another person i used to i really did like was Barbara Streisand and then i saw her in that movie Nuts and that was a wasted dont waste your even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad oh   i didnt see that no   that good i think thats what everyone said that it was a pretty lousy movie     oh it was horrible and i really did like her until that   uhhuh uhhuh   but gosh not any more ooh   yeah yeah boy she hasnt been in a movie well maybe thats why she hasnt been in a movie in a long time   yeah and thats right i dont think shes made one since then either as a matter of the fact that i know   yeah i i guess i guess i dont tend to even though it seems like weve been to a lot of Kevin Costners movies maybe thats my wifes uh input more than i but uh but i guess i dont rely on anymore on   uhhuh   star value i dont really go see movies because its like Robert Redford was in Havana and and boy that looked like a bad movie just in the coming attractions and i said and i said boy   yeah yeah i know it how about did you see uh Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and   i havent seen that i havent was that good   oh thats good yeah i liked that that was a good movie   and  that i heard that uh and i dont particularly like Richard Gere i guess the only movie that i that i liked that he was in was Officer and a Gentleman and even then you know that was kind of pushing it   yeah   but uh but i heard every even if you didnt like Richard Gere you probably wouldve liked that movie   oh im a fan of his yeah he is good i really i really did like him im a fan of his   uh okay   yeah hes uh hes okay in my book     okay okay     and of course Julia Roberts is cute too but i i didnt really know i hadnt heard of her too much until i saw this movie and uh   umhum umhum   then i saw Dick Tracy did you see that   i havent seen that no no we didnt go see that   nah it was   i heard that was more of a kids movie and uh   well the kids wouldnt appreciate it because they theyve never heard of Dick Tracy other than you know like ive heard of him all my life but   yeah when you when he was actually in the funny paper and   yeah but they dont know him except for uh probably uh the movie you know so i dont think they would appreciate it as much as as older people would because they you know grew up with him but i was kind of disappointed in it a little bit uh   yeah thats true that probably yeah i i probably couldnt get my wife to go see that i think the last time i got to see her something like that was Batman it took me a it took me a   yeah and i didnt like that you know why i didnt like that movie it was so dark i couldnt see   well thats true i think that was the feel that they they were after was everything was really dark and and and kind of foreboding and   i guess and i dont like to have to strain my eyes and try to see the characters on the screen that that was one i i watched on a video at home and i maybe that was it maybe   yeah uhhuh that that might have been something because i think that i dont think thats movie that would have been as good on a on a small screen   no   i mean you really it really had to be on a big screen i think especially for Jack Nicholson to come across because because i mean what he did was so corny   yeah yeah     you know like it its like they they spent a half hour setting up that line about bats in the belfry you know its where Batman is climbing up to save whats her name and   uhhuh uhhuh   and hes up there and its like all these things are are falling on him and its like they they work all this time just when he gets to the top that the Joker can say something about well looks like we got bats in the belfry and its like       well i think theyve been pushing to try to get this joke in for a long time yeah i hear a i hear a second Batman movie is getting ready to come out too yeah i guess Danny De Vitos in it   uhhuh yeah oh is it oh now that would be good i like him oh did you see uh War of the Roses   i guess hes yeah i no   i loved it but most people that i knew didnt like it but i thought i was funny   i i liked it till about a half hour from the from the end it looked it looked like it was going to be a funny movie and and until about until it got to be almost too much   uhhuh oh well now that was the first movie i or the first movie in ages that i have seen twice i went back to see it and when i saw it the second time it wasnt as cute but it was i just roared through it the first time and thats why i probably   you know when they were really yeah it i again i think the first hour was really everyone was laughing and and my wife and i were really enjoying it   umhum   and then i think it was when he finally drove the car over the yard or something like that and she finally trying uh i mean it gets from from little things like throwing things at him and dropping things on him to to where shes actually     yeah trying to kill him   trying to kill him and then i almost got real furious and and it was like a whole mood change right here and that whole chandelier scene at the end it was like     yeah i k now it oh i know it and i was so shocked at the ending i didnt think they would die   yeah   i really didnt i was so shocked   and and and it was funny because we usually like Michael uh Douglas and and Kathleen Turner i think weve weve liked everything like uh   Douglas yeah he plays i have too   like Diane saw Jagged Edge you know my wife   uhhuh oh yes that was good oh that was good   and and i and i didnt but i guess you know she i mean she shes seen a lot more Kathleen Turner movies than i have and she  the only ones i ever saw were Romancing the Stone and and and those kind of movies but she likes them and   oh you didnt thats a good one uhhuh oh okay shes a good actress   and uh she i was really disappointed i think we we were both disappointed in fact for some reason although it looked like it was going to b e funny   oh yeah well i did i dont know maybe i got a warped sense of humor because i like i said i just roared through it the first time and then the second time when i saw it but it see it was a month later that i saw it the second time maybe if i had waited longer and seen it a second time   umhum umhum
