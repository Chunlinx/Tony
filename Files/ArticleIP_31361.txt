friend and it is as true to the original text as it can be in ourpolitically correct times A more feminized society is not the repressedhorrible existence Lind portrayswhy are less violence less aggression lessmachismo less extremist Darwinism and greater sensitivity bad things Letsface it people like Hitler took their survival of the fittest theory out ofhand and the result was far from pretty            And anyway a guy whoknows how to treat his mother well is way sexier than a guy who thinks hes toocool and manly to care for his family Maybe Lind is grumpy because he wouldntlook quite so hot in a loincloth by conventional standards of beauty             Ann Stanton Euclid Ohio                           BookClubbing                        Might I respond to EricAltermans sarcastic remark  that I graciously declined to reply to acolumn by him in The Nation attacking my New Republic Diariston Yale University Press and its series on communism For the second timethefirst was in a letters exchange in The Nation Alterman has somehowinferred that my silence connoted acquiescence with his article Since Altermandid not point out any factual inaccuracies in my Diarist and since he defendedthe notion that Russians were sent to the Gulag legally I thought his articletoo trivial and silly to merit a response But because Alterman ungraciouslypersists in depicting me as having repudiated my own article I feel obligedfor what its worth to note that I think it holds up perfectly well             Jacob Heilbrunn Senior editor the NewRepublic Washington                                             Eric Altermanreplies Jacob Heilbrunn has messed up yet again I intended no sarcasm increditing him with sensibly refusing to defend what was clearly a shoddy andindefensible piece of work I thought he was showing some class                                       Heilbrunn calls myobjections to his Diarist trivial and silly Lets say hes right Whythen did conservative historians Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes feel a needto condemn Heilbrunn as well in letters published in TNR s own letterssection Why did the equally conservative Richard Gid Powers call Heilbrunnsaccusations against Yale absurd and existing only in the minds of thepathologically suspicious on the same page Why did even the veneratedantiStalinist historian Robert Conquest call Heilbrunns article unfair andexaggerated Why did the director of Yale University Press John Rydeninsist in a letter to more than a hundred people that TNR sEditorinChief Martin Peretz has admitted that Heilbrunns piece is unfoundedand should not have been published Peretz denies this Are the criticismsof Harvey Klehr John Earl Haynes Robert Conquestand if Ryden is to bebelievedeven Heilbrunns boss Marty Peretz among many others all tootrivial and silly to merit a response as well Or was a strategic silencereally the right response for Heilbrunn after all                                       Criticizing theKosovo Critics                        Thank you for William Saletans brilliant analysis of the war As a lifelong conservative and Republican who feels thatPresident Clinton defamed the office of the presidency I was amazed that allthe major conservative commentators and politicians were against the USaction After all the previous Republican administrations had sent troops intoSomalia for humanitarian reasons and yet the operation was largely afailure            I believe the prevailingRepublican opinion was largely generated from an antiClinton feelingparticularly after a failed attempt at removing him from office Onecommentator said that we should have provided the Kosovo Liberation Army withweapons but not sent our troops Imagine if the United States had adopted thisisolationist policy during World War II The face of Europe might look quite abit different             Gary Spiegel Los Angeles                           Retire the WorldsPoliceman                        William Saletan showed more than a little bias inthe piece about the Republican condemnation of the Clinton administrationsactions in Kosovo             What were we really doing bombing Serbia Maybeextending the ideas of a New World Order in which hardworking Americans areexpected to pay the price not only of our freedom but of the freedom of thewhole world We had no business in any of the NATO actions there was no realpossibility of this expanding throughout the region as everyone in theadministration was spouting It didnt concern our energy supplynot much oilcomes out of Kosovo They were not a direct threat to our national securityThey were not a world threat such as Germany or Japan was in World War II Sowhat were we really doing there            And what of theatrocities Were they going on before the bombing started Do we have proof ofthat Maybe these atrocities began from the outrage of the Serbians knowingthat their cities homes and factories were getting bombed and their brothersand sisters being killed             Gary W Meadows Spring Texas                           Buckley BarksBack                        Last week William FBuckley Jr read

EricAlterman had called Buckleys book a lumbering themeless pudding of a novelthat forces ones eyelids shut like an invisible vise The other RonaldRadosh had described it as heavy and plodding without any real juice to itBuckley weighed in defending his work against all charges aesthetichistorical and ideological and quoting a critic writing in Buckleys ownNational Review  who deemed the book wonderfully readable  awitty fastmoving yarn Now Buckley has asked                   Slate               to run the following excerpt from the book so that readers can judge forthemselves We are
