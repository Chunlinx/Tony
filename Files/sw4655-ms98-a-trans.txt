        okay       well ill just briefly um i worked in a nursing home so i kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run and i think theres been definite changes of nursing homes but i think uh if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off to where i couldnt take care of them at all it would be something that  you know i would certainly  if theyre forgetting things or whatever id prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care   uhhuh   where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence and not reliable you know they dont have to be in a nursing home situation but uh i dont think the nursing homes when i was working in them were very much understaffed very much uh in need of good personnel um i think the patients werent given the quality of care that i wouldnt have you know i look at it and say thank God i got out of that kind of situation but uh they they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help and   yeah uhhuh   i can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help its either let leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up and i would have preferred to get them up than  than to leave them in bed all day but uh um so i think nursing homes are have changed im not quite sure but hopefully they have   yeah well the i guess i havent had that much experience ive only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home but   umhum yeah   i have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties and then she she got sick and she ended up in a nursing home   sure umhum   and my parents went to visit her and it got to the point where the nursing it seemed like the nursing home didnt want to deal with  her anymore   sure   and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep   yeah i i think thats that can happen and i think in the nursing home that i worked for i wasnt quite sure of it but im sure that some of the patients were uh given medication to keep them in uh quiet and and   nice sedative state   yeah yeah and they would just lay all day long and uh the ones that they also put mentally ill patients in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh you know age uh the mentally ill patients could walk right in into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically because if you werent there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they could they had freedom to just walk around and a lot of them were i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and i remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on i dont know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but   uhhuh   she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset that person woman actually pulled uh the other persons hair i mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair you know and it was a guy that was just really upset i mean hes what the hell are you think youre doing you know and i laughed at it then but then im thinking God you know if i had to put my parents in that nursing home i wouldnt want them there   yeah   so i think theres laws now that kind of protect that nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities even though theyre aging mentally ill they are still mentally ill and a lot of these older people have their you know theyre not insane or anything like that they dont have these tendencies to to lash out   be violent   but  seeing that kind of made me think twice about jeez i wouldnt put my mother father in that nursing home at all   was this in a big town or a little town   a small town   oh really   yeah yeah   it seem like the small town nursing homes   i dont know   i theres a lot more personal attention   i dont know i i kind of look at it this way i think if you have a big city area i think theres more people to keep watch on it   uhhuh you have more options   and yeah yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when theres one nursing home for a whole community and this is back in nineteen seventy seven that i worked there   uhhuh   and i look back at it and say jeez you know i it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there but my grandmother uh later on got cancer and uh could no longer well actually she
