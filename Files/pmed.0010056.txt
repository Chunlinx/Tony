                            Only about  of newly developed drugs are for tropical diseases such as African        sleeping sickness dengue fever and leishmaniasis  While patent incentives and        commercial pharmaceutical houses have made Western health care the envy of the world the        commercial model only works if companies can sell enough patented products to cover their        research and development RD costs The model fails in the developing world where        few patients can afford to pay patented prices for drugs        It is easy and correct to say that Western governments could solve this problem by        paying existing institutions to focus on cures for tropical diseases But sadly there does        not appear to be enough political will for this to happen In any case grants and patent        incentives were never designed with tropical diseases in mind        Two main kinds of proposals have been suggested for tackling the problem The first is        to ask sponsorsgovernments and charitiesto subsidize developingcountry purchases at a        guaranteed price  The second involves charities creating nonprofit venturecapital        firms Virtual Pharmas which look for promising drug candidates and then push drug        development through contracts with corporate partners In this article we discuss the        limitations of these two approaches and suggest a third open source approach to drug        development called the Tropical Diseases Initiative TDI We envisage TDI as a        decentralized Webbased communitywide effort where scientists from laboratories        universities institutes and corporations could work together for a common cause see        wwwtropicaldiseaseorg                    Why Open Source        The idea behind asking sponsors to subsidize developing country purchases at a        guaranteed price is that this will prop up drug prices and restore incentives for        developing new drugs  In other words it is a way of fixing the patent problem        However subsidies have an important weakness it is almost impossible to determine        correctly how large the subsidy should be In principle the most costeffective solution        is to set a subsidy that just covers expected RD costs But how large is that RD        costs are very poorly known with the published estimates quoting uncertainties exceeding         to  million per drug If the subsidy is set too low companies cannot cover their        RD costs and nothing will happen Set the subsidy too high and the sponsors costs        skyrocket To date no sponsor has tried to implement these proposals        In the Virtual Pharma approach governments and philanthropies fund organizations that        identify and help support the most promising private and academic research Examples        include the Institute for One World Health wwwiowhorg a notforprofit pharmaceutical        company funded mainly through private sources and the Gates Foundation and the Drugs for        Neglected Diseases Initiative wwwdndiorg a public sector notforprofit organization        designed to mobilize resources for RD on new drugs for neglected diseases        Virtual Pharmas have clearly started to bear fruit and are responsible for most        candidate treatments for tropical diseases currently under development For example the        Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative has a portfolio of nine projects spread out across        the drug development pipeline for the treatment of leishmaniasis sleeping sickness Chagas        disease and malaria  But Virtual Pharmas face three important problems The first is        similar to the problem faced by subsidy proposals guessing privatesector RD costs        One needs to understand what a product costs in order to negotiate the best possible        priceand guessing wrong is likely to be expensive Second Virtual Pharmas development        pipelines will run dry without more upstream research Research has been particularly weak        in exploiting genomic insights  Third tropical disease research is badly underfunded        For this reason Virtual Pharma cannot succeed without rigid cost containment        We believe that a new communitywide consortium the Tropical Disease Initiative can        help solve these problems Its success would help keep Virtual Pharmas RD pipeline        full Furthermore it would use opensource licenses to keep its discoveries freely        available to researchers andeventuallymanufacturers As we explain below welldesigned        opensource licenses are the key to containing Virtual Pharmas RD costs        While we expect the final choice of license to be made by TDIs members the guiding        principle should be to pick whatever license lets developing country patients derive the        most benefit from TDIs work Possible choices are shown in Box                     How It Works        To date opensource methods have made little headway beyond software  However        computing and computational biology are converging In the same way that programmers find        bugs and write patches biologists look for proteins targets and select chemicals        drug candidates that bind to them and affect their behavior in desirable ways In both        cases research consists of finding and fixing tiny problems hidden in an ocean of        code        What would opensource drug discovery look like As with current software        collaborations we propose a Web site where volunteers use a variety of computer programs        databases and computing hardware Figure  Individual pages would host tasks like        searching for new protein targets finding chemicals to attack known targets and posting        data from related chemistry and biology experiments Volunteers could use chat rooms and        bulletin boards to announce discoveries and debate future research directions Over time        the most dedicated and proficient volunteers would become leaders        Ten years ago TDI would not have been feasible The difference today is the vastly        greater size and variety of chemical biological and medical databases new software and        more powerful computers Researchers can now identify promising protein targets and small        sets of chemicals including good lead compounds using computation alone For example a        SARS protein similar to mRNA cap methyltransferasesa class of proteins with available        inhibitorswas recently identified by scanning proteins encoded by the SARS genome against        proteins of known structure  This discovery provides an important new target for future        experimental validation and iterative lead optimization More generally existing projects        such as the University of California at San Franciscos Tropical Disease Research Unit San        Francisco California United States show that even relatively modest computing        chemistry and biology resources can deliver compounds suitable for clinical trials         Increases in computing power and improved computational tools will make these methods even        more powerful in the future        Just as they do today Virtual Pharmas would choose the best candidates The difference        is that opensource drugs could not be patented in developing countries This would not        stop Virtual Pharma from developing promising discoveries S Nwaka V Hale personal        communications Importantly TDI would be a great boost to the efforts of Virtual Pharmas        because it would help to contain the costs of discovering developing and manufacturing        drugs                    Cost Containment        TDI would contain costs in three important ways First TDI would ask volunteers to        donate their time and any patentable discoveries to the collaboration Instead of        financial incentives TDI would offer volunteers nonmonetary rewards such as ideological        satisfaction the acquisition of new skills enhancement of professional reputation and        the ability to advertise ones skills to potential employers Software collaborations have        demonstrated that these incentives are a good way to attract and motivate programmers         Similar incentives should work equally well for biologists chemists and other        scientists        Second we have already pointed out that existing proposals have difficulty containing        costs The root cause is patents Normally society relies on competition to keep prices        low Patentsby designshortcircuit competition by giving the owners the legal right to        prevent others from using or even developing their invention TDI on the other hand        would restore competition by making drug candidates available to anyone who wanted to        develop them We expect sponsors to exploit this advantage by signing development contracts        with whichever company offers the lowest bid Such competitive bidding is a powerful way to        contain costs and is also a good way to develop drugs Virtual Pharma has extensive        experience supervising contract research        Third the absence of patents would continue to keep prices low once drugs reached the        market The generic drug industry shows what happens once drug makers are allowed to        compete US drugs frequently fall to about onethird their original price when patents        expire                     Intellectual Property Rights        Would universities and corporations really let their people volunteer Wont they insist        on intellectual property rights The practical answer is that sensible managers do not care        about intellectual property rights unless they expect to earn a profit This explains why        sophisticated university licensing offices seldom bother to interfere with opensource        software projects that are not commercially valuable  The same logic would apply to        opensource drug discovery We would hope that life sciences companies would make a similar        calculation But permitting employees to participate is only the beginning We think that        universities and companies will also donate the data research tools and other resources        needed to make TDI even stronger The reason once again is that they have little to lose        The value of their intellectual property depends almost entirely on US and European        diseases For this reason it costs very little to share their information with tropical        disease researchers In fact drug companies already do this  TDIs main challenge        will be to show donors that an opensource project can keep members from diverting donated        information back into the commercially lucrative diseases that affect patients in the        West        Finally there are precedents for private companies developing drugs off patent During        the s March of Dimes see wwwmarchofdimescom developed polio vaccines without any        patents at all  It then signed guaranteed purchase contracts with any drug maker        willing to develop commercialscale production methods The incentive may not have been        conventional but it worked And why not The contracts made good business sense contract        profits may have been small compared to the profits on patented drugs but so was the risk        Fifty years later contract research still makes sense Generic drug companies developing        world drug manufacturers contract research organizations and biotech firms have all said        that they would consider contracts to develop opensource drug candidates M Spino S        Sharma F Hijek and D Francis personal communications                    Next Steps        So far we have described a shoestring operation that exists mainly on the Web Except        for computer time budgets would be more or less the same as existing software        collaborations Computing would be expensive but manageable Todays biologists routinely        scrounge resources from university machines or borrow time on home computers   This        Webcentric approach would be a good start but not a complete solution Computational        biology works best when it can interact with experimental chemistry and biology        Nevertheless a lowbudget computational approach is probably enough to generate new        science suggest ideas for followup experiments and make new drug candidates available        under licenses designed to yield maximum benefit to the developing world        In practice an opensource drug discovery effort is likely to include modest        experiments Many academic scientists control discretionary resources and in some cases        tropical disease grants Furthermore good science generates its own funding We expect        experimentalists to turn the collaborations Web pages into grant proposals        That said TDIs volunteers will be most productive if sponsors back them Charities        could support opensource drug discovery by making wet chemistry and biology experiments a        top priority Corporations could also help by donating funds laboratory time or        previously unpublished results One low costhigh value option would be for companies that        have already tried a particular research direction to warn TDI if the collaboration was        about to investigate a known dead end R Altman personal communication                    Conclusion        Opensource drug discovery is feasiblethat is no known scientific or economic barrier        bars the way But what are the risks Experience with software collaborations highlights        the main social and economic challenges First the project will have to find and motivate        volunteers Based on existing software collaborations we estimate a required minimum        critical mass of a few dozen active members Second modest chemistry and biology        experiments will be needed to increase the chances for success Resources of several        hundred thousand dollars per yearmostly in the form of inkind donations of databases        laboratory access and computing timewould make opensource drug discovery much more        powerful By most standards such risks are real but acceptable        The largest uncertainties are scientific Can a volunteer effort based on computational        biology and modest experiments produce the highquality drug candidates that Virtual Pharma        needs A successful program must  make a significant contribution toward supplying the        genomic insights that tropical disease research needs to move forward and  make useful        drug candidates available for development and production under opensource licenses        Opensource drug discovery looks feasible The only way to be sure is to do the        experimentand we invite you to
