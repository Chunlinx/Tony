                                  The Peril of Faith            For years it has been anAmerican article of faithas cherished as our belief in free enterprisethatpoliticians are corrupt venal and incompetent This was established byWatergate left unshaken by Jimmy Carter and reinforced by IranContraImpeachment was supposed to affirm it once and for all But now the unthinkablehas happened Americans have regained their faith in politicians            Fully  percent ofAmericans now trust the federal government to handle domestic problems andmore than  percent trust the feds on foreign policy President Clintons jobapproval ratings remain near record levels            Nowhere is this Great Awakening more alarming than ingovernors offices A March Washington Post poll pegs job approvalratings for governors nationwide at  percent up from  percent in Republican governors are especially favored While Republicans in Congressstruggled in the  elections most Republican governors routed Democrats byrecord margins Some Republican govs such as George W Bush of Texas nowscore approval ratings above  percent            This faith in Republicangovernors has two consequences for the GOP The first relates to the presidential campaign Desperate for a hot candidate the GOP hasas LamarAlexander jokesall but carved Bushs image onto Mount Rushmore already Andthe happy numbers have made any Republican who lives in a governors mansionthink he deserves a promotion to vice president Among those touted aspotential Bush running mates are New Yorks George Pataki Wisconsins TommyThompson Pennsylvanias Tom Ridge Michigans John Engler Massachusetts PaulCellucci Kansas Bill Graves New Jerseys Christine Todd Whitman Utahs MikeLeavitt and Montanas Marc Racicot            The second consequence of the govs popularity is that itis persuading Republicans that the governors have found the Holy Grail Thegovernors Republicans believe have invented a brilliant new politics thattranscends ideology The admirers of the governors who include not least thegovernors themselves use the same phrases over and over to describe them Thegovs are a third party and a new breed They have a distinct approach anda new way of governing            What is this magical newway They combine fiscal conservatism and softer social policy They haveturned deficits into gigantic surpluses while still cutting taxes They haveslashed welfare rolls and unemployment They have increased funding for popularsocial policies teacher training health care for kids environmentalcleanups George W wants to spend  billion more on teacher salaries and anextra  million on child care for the poor Pataki just boosted educationspending by  million            Unlike the savage congressional Republicans the governorshave perfected the soothing language of politics Bush for example hasabjured Englishonly education He calls his program EnglishplusEnglishonly says you dont count youre not important Englishplus sayswe recognize the treasures of your language and heritage the governors presssecretary told the National Journal  The policy is the same  butthe tone is different emphasis added            The governors havelearned how to form multicultural coalitions another feat that has eludedtheir congressional confreres Floridas Jeb Bush won a majority of theHispanic vote in his run his brother George W polls extremely well amongblacks and Hispanics The governors have allied with moderates in theDemocratic Party and borrowed their best ideas They are even willing to offendthe diehards of their own party Few of the governors talk much aboutabortion Bush has irritated conservatives by emphasizing public education andlargely eschewing vouchers            So essentially the new form of government invented byBush Pataki  Co is  Clintonism fiscal conservatism deficits intosurpluses welfare reform sweeteners for social programs lots of euphemizingand a willingness to coopt the other side            Not that there is anything wrong with what thegovernors have done Their accomplishments are genuine and their states arethriving But the GOPs eagerness to embrace them does suggest a certainhypocrisy Conservatives after all have spent the last year creditingClintons polls to alchemy He has lucked into the best economy in history Butif Clintons popularity is alchemical then so is the governors Likewise ifthe governors popularity is legitimate then so is Clintons All of them owetheir skyhigh poll ratings to the economy and a few ounces of good sense Ofcourse the governors and the president managed to turn deficits into surplusesOf course they cut welfare rolls Of course they have delighted voters bygoosing popular social programs with extra millions You would have to be amoron not to have been a popular governor while tax revenue surgedunemployment vanished and crime fell            Its easy to be a statesman when all the optionsare good The test of the governors new wayand the test of Americasrediscovered political faithwont come till the lean years follow Clintonsseven fat ones
