                                 Black Brainpower            Theres been a lot of talkabout black intellectuals recently in such places as The New Yorker the Atlantic Monthly  and the Village Voice  Much of it haspicked up on the even more considerable chat about intellectuals in general andthe public intellectual in particular Many of us got our first sense of thatterm reading about the Left BankSartre and de Beauvoir and Camus in darksweaters and a haze of Gaulloises quaffing rough red wine and arguing aboutAlgeria and the Absoluteor the slightly less outre Partisan               Review crowd of the s and s in the United States Given thewhiteness of those images and the long history of denying intellectual aptitudeto AfricanAmericans its surely good news that in America today the wordintellectual is as likely to evoke Cornel West as Susan Sontag            Thereason for this is obvious Theres a longer list now than ever before ofAfricanAmerican scholars and writers ensconced in the old centers ofprestige producing scholarly works and discussing with a popular audiencequestions about race in American life In the past the disciplinary heart ofthis activity lay in the social sciences Now the rise of black studies hasproduced a new wave of AfricanAmerican scholars in the humanities many ofwhom share the engagement with the work of contemporary artists thatcharacterized the Left Bank milieu Some like Adrian Piper at Wellesley aphilosophy professor and conceptual artist or Toni Morrison at Princeton areboth serious scholars and substantial artists So it might seem that the timehas come for Black Intellectuals by William M Banks a professor ofAfricanAmerican studies at Berkeley a book that claims to be the firsthistorical survey of its subject from the colonial period to the present            Some of the people Banks discussesbell hooks or mycolleagues Henry Louis Gates Jr and West for exampleare intellectuals inthe stricter sense of the word Like the Left Bankers they had eliteeducations like them they address questions about our public life And theywrite hard bookspoststructuralist literary criticism feminist theorypostanalytic philosophyas well as memoirs and essays for an audience outsidethe academy            But Bankschooses to begin with the medicine men and priests in Africa who are heasserts the ancestors of contemporary AfricanAmerican intellectuals I amleery of this desire to extend the category of intellectual in all sorts ofdirections away from those with a vocation to scholarship or writing Bankschoice of a starting point seems to invoke an expansive notion of theintellectual that includes some but not all academics novelistsjournalists composers artists programmers pundits and poetsan idea Ithink muddies more than it clarifies            Ive been at conferences where gangsta rappershave been characterized as intellectuals apparently on the theory that theterm is apt when celebrating anyone who ever had and expressed an idea someother intellectuals liked The problem here isnt that rappers dontthinkalthough sometimes that is a problembut that only an academicwould suppose that calling people intellectuals is the best way to take themseriously Some scholars nowadays use the term intellectual as an honorificand often as little more            Moreimportant all the different ways of using your intellect in differentinstitutions for different audiences in different social circles withdiffering degrees of selfconsciousness do not it seems to me produce thekind of person you can shoehorn into a single group There are societies likePoland where such people constitute a selfconscious class with a sharedsocial lifewhat is called an intelligentsia There are societies likeFrance where writers artists and some scholars speak to the nation as mileZola did in the course of the Dreyfus affair which is the context in which theword intellectual was first used in its modern sense But the United Statesis not in these ways like Poland or France The current fashion for talkabout intellectuals will leave some readers to expect a few clear definitionsfrom Banks But this is something Banks avoidswisely in my view            In fact Banks concession to this academic vogue is almostentirely limited to the medicine men and priests of his first chapter Thedecision is a reflection I think not of his catering to fashion but of theproblem facing anyone whose aim is to write the first full history ofAfricanAmerican intellectuals namely that since the first AfricanAmericanswere slaves introduced largely for manual labor intellectual activity isnaturally not a large part of their record Other societies had used slaves asteachers Greece and Rome and bureaucrats the Ottoman Empire but Africanslaves were brought to the New World to use their muscles not their minds            Stillmany of the slaves transplanted to North America came from Muslim societiesand could read and write Arabic Their narratives now translated offer alongwith the medicine men and priests examples of African slaves who cared aboutthe cultivation of knowledge Does it matter that Banks omits them from hisstory That depends on whether your interest is in the past or in the presentThe intellectual traditions encoded in African religion and Arabic literacyplayed little role in shaping the later intellectual life of Americans blackor white the great contribution of the African inheritance to black andAmerican religion came from elsewhere Attempts to connect AfricanAmericanChristianity with African traditions stem from the more recent ideas of blackpower Banks heart it seems to me is in the present He is tracing theancestry of contemporary black intellectuals to claim for them the title to asubstantial tradition The Muslim slaves would be a distraction            In discussing a time when black men and womenwith an intellectual vocation were deprived of the chance to make a livingthrough the pen there is a case for looking in American black life for theplaces to which those thwarted thinkers diverted their energies But as blackcolleges developed after the Civil War and increasingly since thedesegregation of elite universities intellectual life for blacksas foreveryonehas come to be centered for better and for worse in universitiesMany of Americas most important novelists from Morrison to Saul Bellow arenow professors It is not surprising then that as Black Intellectualsreaches into the  th century it is increasingly about academicsBanks does not in the end succumb to the desire to include everyone who everhad an idea            IndeedBanks has written a useful survey of AfricanAmerican scholars and writers andthe ways in which they have worked throughout the history of the republic Hiscentral themes are debates over the meaning of race and how black intellectualswhoever they may be have negotiated their relationship with ordinary blackpeople As the book discusses the fate of the black college or the HarlemRenaissance or the participation of AfricanAmerican intellectuals ingovernment during World War II it draws a sharp picture of the fate of blackswith brains forced whatever their real interests to deal with the questionof race His later chapters ask whether in a new world where blacks arepresent if still in small numbers in our societys most powerful intellectualinstitutions black thinkers might be free to spend less time thinking aboutwhat it means to be black            The book ends with a reflection on the argument betweenthose intellectuals who advocate an organic relationship with the blackcommunity and those who aspire to transcend ethnic considerations suggestingaffably that the choice must be left in our individualist culture for eachof us to make for ourselves This is a little too simple These are not afterall the only options Some of us who dont want to be the organicintellectuals of the inner city or of anywhere else are not disposed simplyto transcend our racial identities either And even if the choice were up toeach of us it would be a choice we make in a community that still placesstrong constraints on what a black thinker can do The individualist ideal inAmerica lives side by side with powerful notions of racial obligation            A survey of this sort allowslittle time for mining the substantial debates among black intellectuals butthe main ones get at least a mention Only one general issue is curiouslyabsent Afrocentrism If as Banks normally assumes any AfricanAmericanacademic who has an engagement with the fate of the race is part of the storyI am not sure why he thinks Professor Molefi K Asante who can make areasonable claim to having invented Afrocentrism as an academic subjectdoesnt merit discussion I suspect Banks choice reflects his own commitmentto a sensibly conventional vision of the intellectual life one that casts morelightand less heatthan much of the heady verbiage in the current debatesabout the Black Intellectual
