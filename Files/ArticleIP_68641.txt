                                 Question the Question            In thefirst five minutes of Fridays Republican presidential debate in SouthCarolina three of the six candidates refused to answer questions as posedThey rephrased queries rejected scenarios and chose options other than thoseoffered by the moderators When politicians revise questions this way as theydo with increasing frequency journalists accuse them of ducking But ifsomeone swings a bottle at your head whats wrong with ducking If the answeris fair game for scrutiny and dispute why isnt the question            Thinkabout how politicians manipulate discussions of issues They insert hiddenassumptions to rig the dialogue in their favor They narrow the range ofoptions under discussion to force their opponents into embarrassing dilemmasThey frame lopsided yesno questions and squelch attempts to articulate amiddle ground When reporters use these tactics why shouldnt they too becalled to account Thats what the Republicans did Friday For every artfullyframed question they demonstrated a way to escape and counterframe it                            Reject the premise The first question of the debate wentto Alan Keyes If you had a choice between eight more years of a Democraticpresident or eight years of a prochoice Republican asked comoderator DavidStanton of WISTV which would you choose Keyes replied I dont think thathas to be our choice  We have to choose to stand forthrightly for theprolife position  So your hypothetical is of no matter to me We will notface that alternative            Ahypothetical question is no more important than the likelihood of the scenarioit assumes Imagine that Al Gore were asked to choose between a Republicanpresident and a prolife Democrat who had pledged to appoint Supreme Courtjustices who would overturn Roe vs Wade  Since no leading Democraticpresidential candidate is prolife Gore could reasonably dismiss the questionarguing that the Democratic Party is too principled to nominate a proliferWhy cant Keyes make the converse argument about the GOP                            Add an option The third question of the debate went toGary Bauer Stanton asked If someone in your family was raped and becamepregnant and wanted an abortion and at the discussion with you they wereadamant in their decision to have an abortion would you support that decisionOr would you try to prevent it Bauer replied If my daughter or somebodythat I loved was raped that would be the most horrible thing  I wouldcomfort her I would pray with her I would explain to her that she couldntmake right the terrible thing that had happened to her by taking the life ofher innocent unborn child But the most important thing sir is not what Iwould do under those circumstances but what I would do as president And aspresident I would throw rapists in jail for a long time so Americas womenwouldnt have to worry about it            Thequestion is designed to make Bauer choose between two terrible answershypocrisy hed allow the abortion because the woman is in his family orcruelty hed force the victim to suffer the lifelong consequences of herrape In his answer Bauer begins by amending what he deems the less awful ofthe two options He wouldnt just prevent the abortion he would comfortand counsel the woman Then Bauer steps outside the twooption scenario forcedon him and argues for a third option which he claims would prevent thescenario The efficacy of the third option can be debated But until Bauerenlarged the question this option wasnt even on the table                            Choose a process not a position The fourth question wentto George W Bush A few blocks from here on top of the state Capitolbuilding the Confederate flag flies with the state flag and the US flagsaid comoderator Brian Williams of NBC The question is Does the flag offendyou personally Bush replied What youre trying to get me to do is toexpress the will of the people of South Carolina Williams persisted No Imasking you about your personal opinion Bush elaborated I dont believe itsthe role of someone from outside South Carolina  to come into this state andtell the people of South Carolina what to do with their business when it comesto the flag Williams repeated As an American citizen do you have avisceral reaction to seeing the Confederate flag And Bush concluded As anAmerican citizen I trust the people of South Carolina to make the decision forSouth Carolina            Theprolonged exchange made Bush look evasive and he was criticized afterward fordodging the question But why is Williams formulation of the issue better thanBushs Suppose Williams were to ask Bill Bradley A few blocks from herewomen are walking into a clinic every day and receiving abortions Doesabortion offend you personally And suppose Bradley were to reply I dontbelieve its the role of a politician to go into that clinic and tell thosewomen what to do with their bodies I trust the women of South Carolina to makethat decision Most people would agree that the process Bradley is endorsinglet the woman decide is more relevant than his visceral reaction as towhether abortion offends him personally Why cant Bush make the sameargument                            Insert a caveat Halfway through the debate Williamsannounced a brief phase of short questions and rapidfire answers  We willsettle for one to two sentences in length if you must  All gentlemen willanswer this first question Has affirmative action made America a betternation McCain answered first Yes but quotas have made it worse Baueranswered second The idea behind affirmative action was legitimate and decentBut when you start counting by race you divide America you dont bring ittogether Bush answered third Only if affirmative action means equalopportunity for everybody            Thequestion seems to demand a yesno answer Instead the candidates reply withbut and only if This kind of qualification is often ridiculed asevasiveness by those who demand no ifs ands or buts But why is a policy ofifs and buts worse than a policy of no ifs and buts Most people prefera morality of ifs and buts and most reallife laws and regulations are riddledwith ifs and buts Affirmative action in particular cries out for such moraland legal nuance What voters really needed from the candidates on thisquestion were longer answers not shorter ones For example what does Bushmean by equal opportunity                            Change the question By the time the affirmative actionquestion got to the sixth candidate Keyes it was being completely rewrittenIt may be more important to ask whether its helped the people it was supposedto help he began And I think it has actually hurt them by damaging thereputation of many minorities in this country and not giving them credit fortheir real achievements            Keyesanswer didnt precisely address the question but which was more interestingand enlightening When the question is more specific than the answer acandidate can be accused of evasion But whats wrong with an answer thatsmore specific than the question Keyes wasnt ducking the pitch He was tossingback a weak hanging slider and demanding a fastball so he could hit itharder                            Reject the topic A few minutes later Stephanie Trotter alocal NBC reporter asked the candidates Gentlemen Im curious As an adultwhat is the biggest mistake that youve made and what lesson did you learnfrom it The crowd booed and when Trotter was asked to repeat the questionshe rephrased it Our viewers are curious On a personal note what is thebiggest mistake you made as an adult and what lesson did you learn fromit            Othersanswered the question but Keyes stuffed it The biggest mistake I might makeas an adult would be to treat that as if its a question that is appropriate tobe asked he said There ought to be in our public life a certain decorum acertain dignity There are things that Ill tell my priest in the confessionalthat I will not tell you or any other American However Keyes added Interms of what I think we believe to be relevant for the purposes of running forpresident  maybe the biggest mistake I had made in my public life  wasnot to have spoken out on the issue of the right of the unborn before Idid            Keyesoverreacted but his answer illustrated three lessons First sometimes thepropriety or significance of a question is a more important and instructivetopic than the question itself Whether the question was improper can bedebatedas it turned out Keyes comments about his mistake on abortion weremore interesting than his comments about the questionbut viewers benefitedfrom considering both            Second challenging questions is a healthy way to hold the press accountableQuestions are instruments of power Who gets to choose them Notice how Trotterchanged her question after the crowd booed her First she said Im curiousThen she said Our viewers are curious Obliged to account for her questionshe appealed to the notion of a popular mandate Whether her stations viewerswanted her to ask that question can be checked What questions should be askedwhy they should be asked and who gets to choose them are now open subjects forscrutiny            Third even if thequestion was really about Keyes public life he ended up answering itBelieving that it was framed too personally he didnt just dismiss it Hereframed it the way he thought it should have been asked and he answered itQuestions dont have to be answered with a yes or no Neither does the questionof whether to answer them
