                okay do you have a boat   no   do you like to boat oh yeah   oh yeah yeah i went and saw boat today i about flipped over it   what kind   im not im not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road   oh a ski boat though   yeah oh yeah no doubt about it     we have a seventeen foot invader   yeah oh yeah   and yeah its weve only had it a couple of years but its so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because i mean God you felt every wave but the uh the invader is really neat i really like it its got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so its kind of fun   that sounds neat   yeah so we ski every weekend     well at least you have weekends off   yeah       we didnt i think id go nuts   oh i know i know i dont have that luxury yet   oh really   yeah i am in the restaurant business i run restaurants and uh didnt really dont really have that time off yet so   oh yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat   it was out out in  out in Garland   oh well theres been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days thats really neat its a Baja but its huge i think itd be more boat than id want right now   yeah this ones big too   huh well eventually my husband thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a boat in the Caribbean   oh thatd be great   yeah i think wed kill each other           i think i could probably handle that   well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah   for awhile   but id i mean id have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that theyre just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way   well thatd be great   yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat   who cares about sanity though   well i know what could make you insane floating around in the middle of the Caribbean     i know it no telephone no fax machines nothing nothing   exactly well thats another thing good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least we are forced to talk to each other and theres nothing to interrupt us and its just so relaxing   oh thats true   so even if we do not ski but now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little seven year nephew is coming next week so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski   well thats good seven thats about the right age     yeah i think thats about when i learned   yeah   do you ski   oh yeah   oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything   yeah i sure do   oh yeah its a lot of fun my husband has a wet suit so he can ski pretty much year around if he if he has the guts to       but uh it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a a a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast   oh really   yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool   huh   so anyway   thats kind of different   yeah i was amazed   yeah i kind of i kind of enjoyed that boat i looked at today its nice and clean it wasnt yeah it was not that old   really did it have a cabin   no it didnt its open open up front had a little and it was open in the back too in the back kind of had a little   yeah   deck in the back of it also   oh really   yeah it was kind of different i thought   huh it mustve been pretty big   yeah it was   huh   rather large i do not know how big it was or anything i was just looking at it and until i got around to the for sale sign   how much was it     uh fourteen thousand   oh my i wonder how old it was was it very old   yeah uh pardon me no it couldnt have been that old its   huh was it inboard outboard   yeah   you dont know how big the engine was   no i did not even i did not even look at it i got around the price tag and said okay       i said thats enough   yeah well ours will be paid off in ninety three and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but   yeah i know it   its pretty nice its nice to have its a good way to get away Kyle is afraid that he doesnt want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is theres like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to   um where do you all where do you all go skiing   we go to Lewisville and but its really nice i mean weve talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because now it does not get dark until nine oclock but   oh i know it   its really nice having it in the garage because then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place its just there and we can load up and go   yeah thats true   so plus i dont have any idea how much slip rental is it probably probably get a little expensive i would think   uh somebody was talking about that at one time they were talking about uh was it one hundred fifty a month   whoa   something a hundred twenty a hundred twenty a hundred fifty a month oh i know it   i think ill keep it in the garage   thats outrageous   well it yeah it is and   just to have a place to park you boat   yeah especially on water even   yeah   with some wood going around it   thats pretty wild   yeah ev erybodys got to make a buck though   oh thats true   the name of the game i think   well thats what we were coming back from Arkansas i guess last October and there was a marina for sale and he said now that would be a fun job       but yeah i can probably do that for a while   working around the working around the water and take off on the boat anytime you wanted to   yeah yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign   yeah  in its truest sense right   really i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but weve been real fortunate we have not had any problems so but Kyles real good with the maintenance i think that thats real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there   well thats good does he know how to work on them or just minor stuff   well just the minor stuff uh we took it in for its hundred hour check up and all that stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good   yeah yeah thats true   so thats fine i can live with that   took took it in and got it got all of its shots right   yeah  its kind of like our only child now     right   well hopefully someday you will get that dream boat and   oh i know it or that time off one of the two   yeah really yeah you kind of need need them to go hand in hand i guess     yeah it helps it helps   yeah because i mean i theres times you know even our weekends where we dont have time to go and its sad because you think God you are paying all that money for the boat and its just sitting there     oh i know it   so but its well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go   man its supposed to be   i hope so well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right byebye   myself all right take care byebye
