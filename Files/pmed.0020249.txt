                    Introduction        Worldwide approximately  million people are infected with HIV and more than  million        people died of AIDS last year alone  Unfortunately numerous obstacles to providing        effective antiretroviral treatment to the majority of infected individuals in resourcepoor        countries exist The development of a vaccine or other preventive biomedical intervention        therefore bears the greatest hope to curb the rampant HIV epidemic         Research on HIV vaccines and prevention relies strongly on preclinical studies in        macaque models for the identification and evaluation of potential vaccines or prophylactic        treatment strategies  Initially the goal was to use animal trials to screen for        preventive interventions that induce sterilizing immunity ie protection against        infection since this would clearly be the most effective way to contain the AIDS pandemic        Unfortunately most of the vaccine approaches assessed to date in animal studies have        failed to induce sterilizing immunity  although some prophylactic approaches were        found to reduce susceptibility to infection  As a result of this shortcoming        vaccine candidates are at present primarily examined with regard to their effects on set        point viremia disease progression and their general immunogenicity rather than with        regard to the degree of protection against infection they confer However the inference as        to the degree of sterilizing immunity from the level of immunogenicity is limited by our        lack of knowledge about the mechanisms of protection against infection as such         The inability of most vaccine candidates to induce protection against infection in        animal studies may be due at least in part to unintended consequences of the design of        the animal trials rather than to problems inherent in the vaccination approaches        themselves In most animal studies that seek to test the efficacy of a given preventive        intervention very high challenge doses are used typically of approximately  times        the infectious dose at which  of the animals become infected         ID          The motivation for using such high challenge doses is mostly        practical the experimenter wants to ascertain infection success in unvaccinateduntreated        animals which can then be compared to the hopefully lower infection success in        vaccinatedtreated animals There are however concerns with using high challenge doses        Firstly the extremely high probability of infection in highdose challenge studies        conflicts with the low transmission rate of HIV per sex act  Although it has been        argued that transmission rates may be higher under some circumstances such as during acute        infection or when other infections of the genital tract are present than the estimates        obtained from discordant couple studies suggest eg the recent study by Pilcher et al         transmission of HIV during one sex act surely does not occur with certainty        Secondly protection against highdose virus challenges may be more difficult to achieve        because the use of high challenge doses makes stochastic extinctions that can play an        important role in early control of the infection  very unlikely Thus standard        highdose challenge studies may rule out preventive intervention strategies that could        protect against infections following real life exposures        The problems of using high virus doses in animal studies can be illustrated by the        discrepancy between the protection zidovudine AZT confers in animals and humans Whereas        macaques  and mice  were not protected from infection with high challenge doses        by zidovudine a relatively weak antiretroviral drug when used in monotherapy clinical        studies surprisingly showed that twothirds of perinatal infections ie mothertochild        transmissions during birth can be prevented by zidovudine administration  It is        important to note that the use of zidovudine to prevent perinatal HIV infection is a        biomedical intervention aiming to protect from infection whereas zidovudine is most        commonly used as a therapeutic agent after infection This example suggests that there is a        need for experimental designs that allow the assessment of the protection against infection        with lower and thus more realistic challenge doses        The belief that experiments involving realistically low challenge doses require        unfeasibly large numbers of animals has prevented the development of lowdose challenge        models In this theoretical study we show that contrary to this widely held belief        lowdose challenge experiments can be designed such that they do not require large numbers        of animals Using statistical power analysis we compare two experimental designs see        Figure  i a single lowdose challenge design in which each animal is challenged only        once and ii a repeated lowdose challenge design in which each animal is challenged        until it is infected or a predetermined maximum number of challenges is reached We find        that the repeated lowdose challenge design does not require unfeasibly large numbers of        animals        In the following we are going to discuss the case of assessing whether a vaccine        candidate induces sterilizing immunity All the considerations in this article however        apply equally to other preventive interventions such as microbicides                    Methods        To assess the quality of the single and the repeated lowdose challenge designs we        conducted a statistical power analysis The statistical power of an experimental design is        defined as the probability that an effective vaccine or treatment is correctly determined        to be effective This analysis consists of simulating the experiments evaluating them and        then repeating this procedure thousands of times to estimate the statistical power of a        given experimental design                  Simulation of Single LowDose Challenge Experiments          In our simulations of the single lowdose challenge experiments we assume that we          have           n unvaccinated control animals and           n vaccinated animals          In the control group we simulate single challenges of each animal with the           ID           by performing           n Bernoulli trials with a probability of success of           p          c   The probability of success corresponds to the          probability with which an animal becomes infected after a single challenge By assuming          the same probability           p          c for each animal we ignore potential betweenanimal variation          of the susceptibility to infection This assumption will be relaxed below The results          of these trials can be written as a vector                       x                              c  the entries of which were either zero uninfected or one          infected                    By summing over the elements of                       x                              c  we obtain the number of infected animals in the control group                              c                     In the vaccinated group we simulate single challenges with the           ID           similarly to the control group by performing Bernoulli trials          However we assume that because of vaccination the probability of infection or          success in the vaccinated group           p          v  is lower than that in the control animals           p          c  The relation of           p          v to the effect of the vaccine on the susceptibility of the host                    VE          S  is given by                    The results of these Bernoulli trials can again be written as a vector                       x                              v  and summing the elements of                       x                                v          we obtain the number of infected animals in the vaccinated group                     v           The outcome of the simulated experiment can then be summarized in a contingency table          as shown in Table  On this contingency table we perform a standard onetailed Fishers          exact test  to assess whether the fraction of infected animals in the vaccinated          group is significantly lower than that in the control group                          Simulation of Repeated LowDose Challenge Experiments          In our simulations of the repeated lowdose challenge experiments we once more assume          that we have           n unvaccinated control animals and           n vaccinated animals          We again simulate challenges of each control animal with the           ID           by performing Bernoulli trials with a probability of success of           p          c   Unlike in the simulations of the single lowdose          challenge experiments however we now repeatedly challenge each animal until it is          infected or until a maximum number of challenges           C          max  has been performed We assume that the probability of          infection           p          c is independent of how often an animal has been challenged          before The results of these repeated Bernoulli trials can be written as two vectors                       y                              c  which contains the number of challenges that have been          performed on each animal                    and                       s                              c  which contains information on whether a given animal is          uninfected zero or infected one                    By summing over                       y                              c  we obtain the total number of challenges performed in the          control group                     c                     And by summing over                       s                              c  we obtain the number of infected animals in the control group                              c                     To simulate repeated lowdose challenges in the vaccinated group we perform repeated          Bernoulli trials with a probability of success           p          v  For a given vaccine efficacy           VE          S           p          v is determined by equation  Analogously to the control group          the results of these repeated Bernoulli trials can be written as two vectors                       y                                v          and                       s                              v  and summing the elements of these two vectors yields the total          number of challenges performed in the vaccinated group                     v  and the number of infected animals in the vaccinated group                     v           As in the case of the single lowdose challenge design the outcome of the simulated          experiment can be summarized in a contingency table Table  To assess whether the          fraction of infected animals in the vaccinated group is significantly lower than that in          the control group we again perform a onetailed Fishers exact test  In general          the number of challenges                       c          and                     v  is larger than the number of animals per group           n  This increase of numbers in the contingency table leads to          increased statistical power of the repeated lowdose challenge design To analyze the          outcome of the simulated repeated lowdose challenge experiments we chose to use          Fishers exact test rather than a more obvious Cox proportional hazards model because the          latter depends on large sample asymptotics while we were interested in cases of small          numbers of experimental animals                          Heterogeneity in Infection Probabilities          In our mmlmathematical description of challenge experiments we have assumed that          animals within each group have equal infection probabilities          p          c and           p          v  for the control and vaccinated groups respectively To          simulate potential animaltoanimal variation in susceptibility to infection we relaxed          this assumption and assigned individual infection probabilities to each animal          The individual infection probabilities are drawn from a distribution which is often          used as a prior distribution for binomial proportions The distribution has two shape          parameters  and  Its probability density is given by                    and its mean and variance are                              We assume that             p          c in the control group and             p          v              VE          S           p          c in the vaccinated group Further we assume that the          coefficients of variation           CV   of the distributions in the two groups are equal With these          assumptions we can rewrite the two shape parameters of the distribution  and  in          terms of the infection probability           p and the coefficient of variation           CV                              Hereby           p  p          c for the control group and           p  p          v              VE          S           p          c for the vaccinated group          To incorporate potential heterogeneity in susceptibility into the virtual lowdose          challenge experiments we replaced the probability of success in the Bernoulli trials          see above with the individual infection probabilities                          Power Analysis          To calculate the statistical power of the single and the repeated lowdose challenge          designs we performed  such simulated experiments for a given number           n of animals per group The statistical power can be estimated as the          fraction of simulated experiments in which the vaccine is found to be significantly          efficacious significance level    We estimated the statistical power for the          number of animals per group           n ranging from one to  and for vaccine efficacies           VE          S    and  The power analysis outlined above was          implemented in the R Language of Statistical Computing  An Rscript that performs          the power analysis presented here is provided as Protocol S          For large numbers of animals per group           n the statistical power can be approximated using asymptotic theory          For the single lowdose challenge design the power is approximately eg  p                              Hereby  denotes the cumulative normal distribution                    and           z           is the standard normal deviate associated with the onetailed          probability  the significance level Furthermore           p          c and           p          v denote the infection probabilities of animals in the control          and vaccinated groups respectively and           n the number of animals per group The term           n in the numerator is the continuity correction           For the repeated lowdose challenge design the number of challenges is not the same          as the number of animals           n but is a random variable The number of challenges for each          individual is geometrically distributed with a maximum of           C          max  The expected number of challenges in the control group           and the vaccinated group are                    and                    Substituting the expected number of challenges for the actual number we can          approximate the statistical power of the repeated lowdose challenge design as                    Hereby             c             v  is the continuity correction For           C          max   equation  reduces to equation  Because the          approximation in equation  involves the substitution of a random variable with its          expectation it is less accurate than the approximation for the power of the single          lowdose challenge design in equation  The Rscript provided as Protocol S also          contains a function that calculates the statistical power using equation                             Results                  Single LowDose Challenge Design Requires Large Numbers of Animals          How would we measure protection against infection in a lowdose challenge model The          most straightforward design would involve a large number of hosts some vaccinated and          some unvaccinated After challenge with a low dose one would determine the fraction of          infected hosts in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and assess whether there is a          statistically significant difference in the fractions see Figure A          To assess how many animals would be required in a single lowdose challenge          experiment we performed a statistical power analysis see Methods The statistical          power of an experimental design is defined as the probability that in an experiment with          an effective vaccine the vaccine is correctly determined to be effective Obviously the          power depends on the efficacy of the vaccine which is called the effect size in the          context of power analysis and the number of host animals used in the experiment In the          power analysis we performed we assumed that we had equal numbers of unvaccinated and          vaccinated animals and that all animals within a group were equally susceptible to          infection Lastly we assumed that the vaccine was leaky  ie that the          susceptibility of vaccinated animals was by a constant factor lower than the          susceptibility of the unvaccinated control animals          In virtual experiments we then challenged each virtual animal once with a challenge          dose of one           ID            the dose at which on average  of the unvaccinated animals          become infected after a single challenge Using a onesided Fishers exact test we          tested whether the fraction of infected animals in the vaccinated group was significantly          lower than in the control group Performing  such virtual experiments for a given          number           n animals per group we estimated the statistical power as the fraction          of virtual experiments that yielded significant results significance level                      The result of this power analysis is shown by the green curves in Figure  We          calculated the power for vaccine efficacies of   and  We found that even for          the highest vaccine efficacy of  the single lowdose challenge design required more          than  animals per group to reach a statistical power of  Thus the single lowdose          challenge design is not feasible or at least not practical to assess the efficacy of a          vaccine or other preventive interventions in animals                          Repeated LowDose Challenge Design Does Not Require Large Numbers of Animals          We propose an alternative design involving repeated challenges of individual animals          with low doses which circumvents the disadvantage of the single lowdose challenge          design that large numbers of host individuals are required Repeated challenges          effectively recycle host animals thus increasing the statistical power of the          experiment In addition to increasing the statistical power of the experimental design          repeated challenges recapitulate much more realistically the circumstances of human          exposure than single challenges In this alternative design the efficacy of a vaccine          can be estimated by measuring the difference in the number of challenges needed to infect          vaccinated versus unvaccinated hosts see Figure B          To show that this alternative design does not require unfeasibly large numbers of          animals we performed a statistical power analysis see Methods As for the single          lowdose design we assumed that we had equal numbers of unvaccinated and vaccinated          animals and that all animals within a group were equally susceptible to infection We          further made the important assumption that the susceptibility of an individual animal was          independent of how often the animal was unsuccessfully challenged previously This          assumption is commonly adopted in statistical models that are used to estimate the          transmission rate of HIV  By making this assumption we ignored that an          unsuccessful challenge may induce some degree of immunity against subsequent challenges          We would like to emphasize however that this assumption is not crucial for our          argument unless the degree of induced immunity is very high Lastly we again assumed          that the vaccine was leaky           In virtual experiments we then challenged the virtual animals repeatedly with a          challenge dose of one           ID            We allowed for a maximum number of  challenges of each          individual animal Table  shows the outcome of one such virtual experiment We analyzed          the outcome of the virtual experiments with a onetailed Fishers exact test see          Methods We again estimated the statistical power by performing  such virtual          experiments for a given number           n animals per group          Figure  shows the statistical power of the repeated lowdose challenge design as a          function of the number of animals per group for varying vaccine efficacies black lines          and compares it to the statistical power of the single lowdose challenge design green          lines The statistical power achieved with the repeated lowdose challenge design is          generally higher than that achieved with the single lowdose challenge design If the          vaccine is  effective           VE          S   ie it reduces the susceptibility by a factor of ten          the number of animals per group could be as low as five to achieve more than           statistical power In contrast in single lowdose challenge experiments with the same          number of animals per group the statistical power is only  Thus repeated lowdose          challenge experiments are expected to require far fewer animals than single lowdose          challenge experiments                          How Often Should Virus Challenges Be Repeated          To investigate how the maximum number of challenges affected the statistical power we          plotted the power against           C          max for trials involving six and  animals per group Figure           We found that the power increases with           C          max  but for high           C          max the returns diminished considerably The lower the number of          animals per group           n the higher the maximum number of challenges           C          max  for which the power effectively saturated Even for low          numbers of animals per group           n however the maximum number of challenges           C          max  needed to unfold the full potential of the repeated lowdose          challenge design was in a feasible range                          Impact of AnimaltoAnimal Variation in Susceptibility          To study how potential heterogeneity in susceptibility affected the power of lowdose          challenge trials we simulated experiments in which each animal was assigned an          individual infection probability see Methods In these simulations the degree of          heterogeneity was measured by the coefficient of variation           CV of the susceptibility distributions Figure A shows susceptibility          distributions for three different values of           CV           We extended our power analysis by considering the impact of the heterogeneity          parameter           CV on the statistical power Figure B We found that the statistical          power of the single lowdose challenge design was almost unaffected by animaltoanimal          variation in infection probability whereas for the repeated lowdose challenge design          the power decreased with increasing heterogeneity Importantly however the power did          not decrease linearly with heterogeneity it was sufficiently stable in the range             CV   and dropped mainly for           CV   Thus over a wide range of potential animaltoanimal          variation in susceptibility lowdose challenge designs are sufficiently powered and the          power of the repeated lowdose experiments is superior to that of single lowdose          challenge experiments                            Discussion        Preclinical studies assessing the efficacy of potential vaccines microbicides or        systemic chemoprophylaxis are usually conducted with very high virus challenge doses which        result in infection with certainty Since these high challenge doses do not reflect the low        probability of HIV transmission in humans vaccines or prophylactic treatment strategies        that are effective against real life exposures may go undetected in highdose challenge        experiments For example zidovudine was found to prevent a large fraction of perinatal HIV        infections  even though studies in animal models conducted with high challenge doses        could not establish any protection against infection by zidovudine         In this paper we investigated how efficacy trials of vaccines and preventive treatment        could be conducted with low challenge doses in animal models We showed that the repeated        lowdose challenge design is expected to require far fewer experimental animals than        commonly believed It may therefore be feasible to conduct trials with low challenge doses        which more realistically simulate exposures of humans to HIV allowing us to more directly        and sensitively assess vaccine or treatment efficacy than with highdose challenge        experiments        Owing to the concerns with high challenge doses several research groups including our        own have started to develop lowdose challenge models  In these preliminary        studies infection could be achieved by challenging macaques intrarectally         intravaginally  or orally         Since adopting lowdose challenge approaches has farreaching consequences for the        design of efficacy trials of vaccines or preventive treatment in animal models we would        like to discuss how some important aspects of trial design such as transient infections        the challenge schedule the route of infection and the phenotype and dose of the challenge        strain should be dealt with and could be optimized        Using virus challenge doses that do not give rise to infection with certainty one has        to carefully define what one means by successful infection This question is of particular        importance in the repeated lowdose challenge design because the efficacy of a preventive        intervention is estimated on the basis of the number of challenges needed to infect an        individual animal Lowdose challenges have been observed to give rise to transiently        detectable viremia  Since transient infection is much more likely to lead to        immunization  thus leading to lower probabilities of infection in subsequent        challenges we suggest considering transient viremia as successful infection and not to        rechallenge animals that were transiently infected        The time interval between challenges is also an essential parameter in the design of        repeated lowdose challenge experiments In the four ongoing repeated lowdose challenge        studies  different approaches have been taken with time intervals ranging from        hours to a week There may be logistical reasons for choosing short time intervals between        challenges but from a statistical standpoint the time intervals should be large enough to        allow the identification of the challenge that gives rise to infection Otherwise the        statistical power of the experimental design will be suboptimal and a beneficial effect of        the vaccine candidate may be missed        In parallel to using more realistic lower challenge doses other crucial parameters of        the experimental infection process such as the route of transmission and the coreceptor        usage of the challenge virus should also be chosen to be as realistic as possible Thus        we propose infecting intravaginally or intrarectally in experiments that aim to assess a        vaccine or prophylactic treatment against sexual transmission of HIV Further we suggest        using challenge viruses that utilize CCR as coreceptor such as for example SHIVSFP         rather than the standard strain SHIVP which has been found to use mainly CXCR         These more realistic choices of the route of infection and coreceptor usage will        permit the assessment of the efficacy of the preventive intervention in a setting that more        accurately reflects HIV exposures of humans and will enable us to carefully investigate        the processes that give rise to infection        The challenge dose in a lowdose challenge study is another parameter of crucial        importance Although the most realistic choice would be a challenge dose that gives rise to        infection with a probability of approximately   such extremely low doses        would require unfeasibly large numbers of repeated challenges per animal Moreover there        is substantial variation in transmission rates due to differences in factors such as virus        load or the presence of other infections of the genital tract  and theoretical        studies suggest that preventing the transmission events that occur with higher probability        would have a disproportionately large effect on controlling the epidemic  To maximize        their epidemiological relevance lowdose challenge experiments should therefore involve        challenge doses that reflect transmission probabilities at the upper end of the spectrum        As a compromise between the practicality of high doses and the sensitivity associated with        realistically low doses we propose the         ID          The         ID         can be estimated using wellestablished nonparametric methods like        SpearmanKrber  or singleparameter methods  and there is software available        such as a freely distributed package called ID developed by John Spouge        httpwwwncbinlmnihgovCBBresearchSpougeVirology which allows an automated        estimation of the         ID         from data generated in titration experiments        The inability to detect sterilizing immunity in highdose challenge experiments led to a        shift of focus towards indirect effects of vaccine candidates on the pathogenicity of the        infection and the infectiousness of the vaccinee This shift of focus required the        development of novel statistical models that allowed the estimation of these indirect        effects  Will the estimation of vaccine efficacy in repeated lowdose challenge        studies also require the development of novel statistical techniques The answer to this        question depends on how much the realities of the infection process deviate from our        idealized model There are three potential deviations First we assumed in large parts of        this study that the susceptibilities to infection were equal for all animals within each        group This is almost certainly not the case Although we have shown that lowdose        challenge experiments are sufficiently powered even if there is substantial        animaltoanimal variation in susceptibility we did not develop the statistical techniques        that would allow the estimation of this variation The extent of animaltoanimal variation        in susceptibility can in principle be estimated but this will probably require larger        numbers of animals than the estimation of vaccine efficacy Second the vaccine may affect        the susceptibility of individual animals differently While we assumed in the present study        that the vaccine is leaky ie that the susceptibility is reduced by a constant factor in        each animal other modes of action of a vaccine are possible In particular some animals        could be completely protected by vaccination while others may remain completely        susceptible This mode of action is referred to as allornone  Statistical methods        based on maximum likelihood approaches exist that allow the determination of the mode of        action of a given vaccine However these methods are based on large sample asymptotics        and exact methods will have to be developed to analyze the outcome of lowdose challenge        experiments that involve small numbers of animals Last it will have to be determined        whether the probability of infection changes with the number of challenges performed in a        given animal or to put it differently whether the animal has a memory of previous        challenges In our analysis we assumed that the susceptibility of an animal did not change        from challenge to challenge If the probability of infection changes significantly with the        number of challenges however the development of novel statistical models that take such        changes into account will be necessary to adequately estimate vaccine efficacy        In addition to the potential to assess the vaccine or microbicide efficacy more        sensitively and in a more realistic setting a lowdose challenge approach may enable us to        answer questions that cannot even be asked in highdose challenge models Some of the most        relevant of these questions relate to the effect of challenges that do not lead to        infection If a lowdose challenge does not give rise to infection where was the virus        blocked Did the virus fail to establish an infection at all Or did it replicate        transiently but was cleared by the hosts immunity And very importantly is an        unsuccessfully challenged animal partially immunized against further challenges or        alternatively do unsuccessful challenges facilitate future infection by seeding animals        with defective proviruses that may recombine with complementing viruses upon subsequent        exposures         The answers to these questions would greatly enhance our understanding of HIV        transmission and pathogenesis and thus would provide further guidance toward an effective        vaccine or microbicide Furthermore by assessing the protection against infection        directly we may be able to discern the specific types and levels of vaccineinduced        cellular and humoral immune responses associated with sterilizing immunity  This would        provide important benchmarks by which to judge new vaccine candidates and could also allow        retrospective analysis of vaccine candidates evaluated earlier in highdose challenge        studies        In conclusion the repeated lowdose challenge approach may enable us to assess the        potential efficacy of vaccines and prophylactic treatment strategies more realistically        and more sensitively than the standard highdose challenge approach The increased        sensitivity may allow us to more rapidly identify interventions that significantly reduce        the transmission of lowdose infections that characterize the natural spread of HIV                    Supporting Information
