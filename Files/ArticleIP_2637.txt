                                 The Asian AboutFace            Its good I suppose alwaysto be right Its so good in fact that its worth revising your pastpositions when they suddenly look wrong The key to success in this endeavorof course is never to let on that youve changed your mind at all For anobject lesson in how to do this look no further than whats happened to ourunderstanding of Asia in light of its seven months of economic chaos Themeaning of the Asia crisis has been selfevident to those who believe that thefree market can do no wrong The collapse of Asian stock markets and bankingsystems has proven that industrial policy doesnt work that protectionism is aroute to disaster and state control of credit allocation encouragesinefficiency and corruption In other words whats happened in Asia is proofthat until the rest of the world becomes more like us its bound tostruggle            ThusPaul Craig Roberts argues in a recent issue of Business Week thatindustrial policy fostered appalling investment banking and monetarypractices and that Asias woes prove that Ronald Reagan was right and hiscritics were wrong Of course everything Roberts writes purports to show thatReagan was right and his critics were wrong The Economist holds upKorea as an example of the inevitable failure of any economy bossed by civilservants while economist Rudi Dornbusch describes Koreas problems as acrisis of statism The oped pages of the Wall Street Journal meanwhile have wallowed in triumphalist glee with freemarketeers dancinghappily on the grave of what used to be called the Asian miracle            Even on its own terms this analysis is startlingly cynicalAfter all until June the worlds investorswhich is to say the marketsawnothing but blue skies ahead for these economies They showed their faith byshoving billions into Asian equity markets while foreign banks contentedlyhanded out billions in loans If Asias problems are systemic and the result ofthese countries statist policies then investors failure to recognize thisearlier is a strike against the market not for it Still more perverseis that even as the freemarketeers conclude that history is rendering itsverdict on the Asian model of capitalism they seem to forget that until therecent crisis they themselves took great pains to deny that such a modelexisted Until Asia fell apart supplysiders happily held it up as proof thatthe only recipe for economic growth was open markets and nonintervention on thepart of the state Asian economies werent like those feeble Latin Americaneconomies with their high tariffs easy credit and corruption Instead theywere models of macroeconomic stability marketdriven pricing and disciplinedborrowing In  the Heritage Foundation released its index of economicfreedom Four of the top seven countries were Asian including Japan andTaiwan All the Asian countries now struggling qualified as free            Taiwan andKorea succeeded the Economist explained at the start of this decadebecause they had among the least pricedistorting regimes in the worldWithin the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund similar conclusionsabout the sources of Asian growth prevailed The chief economist of the WorldBanks East Asian desk authored a  book downplaying the presence ofindustrial policy in the region while a concluded that rapid growth in eacheconomy was primarily due to the application of a set of commonmarketfriendly economic policies Just last year economist called the EastAsian economies highly market oriented with a long period of relatively freetrade  and limited distortions from government regulations while arguingthat most East Asian countries did not rely on industrial policy at all Themarketfriendly interpretation of Asias success was intended to counter thethesisoffered by the Japanese by US protectionists and by certainneoinstitutionalist economiststhat trade barriers subsidized credit andstrong state support for exportdriven industries had been essential to thedevelopment of Asian economies            Up till now everyoneright and lefthas beenanxious to claim the Asian example for their own for one reason Since WorldWar II the Asian tigers are the only examples of successful sustaineddevelopment over many decades Well OK Mauritius and Botswana have donewell too If they achieved that success through targeted subsidies andcontrolled credit that certainly puts a crimp in freemarket theorists plansfor Latin America and Africa Alternatively if theyve done so through freetrade and low government spending then Milton Friedman can applaud            Thatcertain of these countriesmost notably Korea Japan and Taiwanreliedheavily on marketdistorting devices is indisputable That these countries grewat historically rapid rates for more than two decades is also indisputable Butthe conclusion that the one led to the other is not indisputable It may verywell be wrong Similarly while Hong Kong and Singapore have been remarkablyopen freemarket countries the fact that this is responsible for their rapidgrowth is hardly indisputable either            The problem is that as economist Alwyn Young has pointedout in a thesis popularized by                   Slate               s own Paul Krugman whileAsias growth rates in total production have been incredibly high its growthrates in worker productivity have Japan aside been surprisingly low In thepostwar years all the Asian tigers have enjoyed enormously high savings ratesrapid increases in the percentage of people participating in the work forceexcellent education and enormous investments in physical capital In otherwords theyve done a brilliant job of mobilizing resources but not abrilliant job of mobilizing resources efficiently But you can mobilizeresources under very different regimes and just how the Asian tigers did itturns out to be hard to answer within the confines of anindustrialpolicyvsfreemarket argument Click for some examples of thecomplexity            Whatsappalling is not that supplysiders once argued that the tigers were proof ofthe free markets virtues There was a reasonableif hardly decisivecase tobe made for that point Whats appalling is rather that now that their heroeshave stumbled they have disowned them so utterly The irony is that ifanything Asia is much more integrated into the global marketplace today thanit was  or even five years ago After all it was foreign capitalists andnot Asian governments who lent all those nowfloundering companies billion in the last five years For more on that point click             But what Asias newfound critics once lovedthey now despise One can only imagine the heads I win tails you losecontortions these thinkers would have offered for Americas woes in  Andwhile the comparison may be a bit facile it helps illuminate the crucial pointabout revisionist interpretations of Asia which is that they fail to recognizethat one can believe in the virtues of the market while still understandingthat markets sometimes fail
