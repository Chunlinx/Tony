i dont know is there a limit on it   well i thought ten was the maximum   okay i didnt know that because i got to be pushing ten some where i lost count around six or seven   yeah yeah ive been writing mine down just in case anything you know just   yeah i should have been and i just i just forgot to uh so uh were going you work at TI   hm i did i dont any more my husband does   oh i i i do but im not going to be at the end of this month  so   oh well where you going   im an ex TIer im uh im officially retiring unofficially im going to go to work for a supplier of ours   oh how neat well thats a good choice   uh i a company called Onum uh it it yeah its located in Korea   oh Onum yeah i know them i used to work with them   oh you you you you did   i was a mechanical engineer i did uh package design and i uh when we first contacted Onum years ago   oh   i was part of the Gene Rickey   oh okay well you worked with a whole bunch of friends of mine then   was part of that yep probably   yeah yeah i know Genes in Sherman now   yeah hes been there for since i left   oh okay and i was in the Philippines for about three or four years and Gene used to come out and visit us uh when i was in the Philippines and   well i worked up there for a year oh yeah he made a lot of trips   yeah well the the vice president for operations for Onum stationed in Korea is a guy named Michael Bryant   um i dont know him   the he used to be a a vice in fact he started four of the TI plants   hum   and he left TI about eight or nine years ago and went elsewhere and hes he came through town and visited with me and bottom line is im going to retire and go to work for him   thats sound like a good deal   so uh were going to talk about about advice giving uh giving parents to kids uh selecting colleges you about ready to talk   yeah go ahead   okay  you said youre Judy   yes   okay Judy   okay im i feel im like im almost an expert on this subject ive got two in college and if one doesnt graduate im going to have three there by September     well how did they decide which colleges to go to and what did whatd you tell them   well its its interesting because it sort of fits their it sort of fits their personality uh my oldest whos a senior at UTD now she uh uh always our house borders Richland College i mean you walk out our back door and youre on the campus and she uh has always uh never really wanted to leave home and uh it turns out that when she came time to go to college well were in the Philippines in fact she stayed out there with us for a year then uh uh we brought her back and set her up in an apartment she went to Richland and then moved back in the house when we got back but she just kind of went to from Richland to UTD and its too bad shes never lived on a campus and she has a younger sister whos a freshman at Saint Edwards in Austin who is living on a campus   hum because   and she sees what what shes missed out of college now wishes that shed done something like that   well now   but at at eighteen you know uh uh i i wanted i wanted her to go away but she was just too much of a home kid   yeah thats uh thats kind of the way i was when i started school i was in Midland and when i was looking for things and and and what i would probably recommend to other people was something that i was comfortable with and i wasnt quite ready to be a long ways off   uhhuh um   and maybe and i knew i wanted to be in engineering so i was looking for a good engineering school so i ended up going to Tech in Lubbock   oh okay   so i was there i was you know two hours away from home so any weekend i wanted to come home i got in the car hopped you know i was home in a couple of hours and so that worked out real well and   yeah oh yeah that that yeah yeah thats not a bad deal well my my middle daughter whos a freshman she has always wanted to live on campus and shed been kind of a home body i mean this is the kid who who uh when she was little and went to stay over at somebodys house at night id always know id get a call at ten oclock to come get her   umhum     uh i mean because it when it came bedtime she wanted to be in her own bed but uh she uh   yeah   uh i was raised in New England and went to school in New England and she always thought she wanted to go to school in New England she and i took an interview trip last year and she was accepted by several of the of the good schools there but when it came down time to make a decision she said dad i dont think i want to go that far away ive never been away before       so uh uh she wanted to go to a small school so uh UT like a place like UT was out of the question because she needed to be in a more of a small smaller school environment so uh we went down one uh uh i took a day off from work and   umhum umhum   and we went down uh to Saint Edwards and interviewed and it it just kind of met her her criteria its a school of about twenty five hundred undergraduates on a gigantic big campus and its in Austins a nice city   umhum   uh and its and shes pretty happy i mean shes here shes finishing up her freshman year and shes pretty happy and likes Austin and i got a son though who is a senior at Berkner he is not academically inclined at all hes very uh kind of unacademically inclined he wants badly to go to Tech because thats where all all his friends in the neighborhood are going   um   and he uh i dont think he didnt apply i dont think hed get admitted there but hes starting to get enough motivated he wants to go there that i think hell go to Richland and take what he needs to have to take to qualify in Tech and then try to go to Tech the next year   oh well thatd be good i think hed enjoy a lot its a its a good school its a good place to grow up   yeah oh sure yeah right and and he went out there and spent a weekend with some friends here back a month or two and and what i like is that when he saw it i think hes now motivated to to to go to work   umhum oh so those the academic standards will improve yeah   yeah yeah yeah and the uh uh in in you know one thing you know in in terms of how how i i would advise people is of course you got to look at what you can afford too and the state school system in Texas uh is probably one of the least expensive in the world   umhum absolutely   uh again i mean people think its expensive but you my goodn ess state schools in Massachusetts and the other New England states cost more than private schools do here   and he yeah yes and and a lot of people that i knew had would go to school in some really you you know Rochester and some of these really nice these uh name schools and and of course they would get out but they got they ended up getting more or less the same job i did and then they but theyre thirty thousand in debt from student loans   yeah they end up yeah yeah you end up getting the same degree and its its uh uh now i i think that that what happens is the prestige you you cant you you cant sell that too much   no   uh beca use after all the degree just gets you in the door   yes and its what you do afterwards   its its what you do after that that that that that uh it that really judges how far youre going to go with a degree   yeah   and i think that uh its getting so darned expensive now i went to a school in Maine Bowden College in Brunswick Maine and uh its a a small at that time all male school there are more uh uh males uh mens schools than womens schools in those days theyre all all the old New England traditional schools are now coed   umhum   but uh and you know im im talking about the early nineteen fifties and you know tuition was six hundred dollars a year my goodness its eighteen thousand now   hm yeah its incredible now   and i dont know how and uh i mean they always have a waiting list a mile long for students and the only thing i did notice is about seventy percent of the students are on some kind of financial aid   yeah yeah and theyre all going to have to pay it back theyre going to be in debt for the rest of their lives   and and theyre going to be in theyre going to be in debt for the rest of their lives yeah uh uh   i guess the the main thing if i was recommending to someone like you said youve youve got youve got do something you can afford but then to go to a school that also is is somewhat well known at least in the state for what you want to do   yeah yeah   because like Tech is known to be a good engineering school and A and M maybe is known more for computers   right   and that kind of thing i would i would if if you know what youre going to do i think that would be important to deal with too because when you then when you do try and get your foot in the door at the various companies the companies that you would possibly want to work for tend to interview more heavily at those locations because they know that that particular school had a good department you know in in computer science or in engineering or in business or or whatever   yeah i i i i think thats exactly right and you know a lot of girls that go into engineering know what they want to do uh you know ive got two daughters that started off going well well well my oldest thought she wanted to major in psychology and shes carried through on that uh uh Tracy is what in April of her freshman year and shes gone from political science to international studies to bilingual education to elementary education and fortunately as a as a freshman everything shes taken has has been uh is applicable   umhum will transfer so thats good yeah   yeah its its its applicable to those degrees and and and those are strong degrees all of them in in the school that shes going   umhum   and and i i think you made a very good point though that somebody that is really has some direction and knows what they want to do uh then they need to go go to a school thats got a good reputation in that field   yeah   and uh uh but i would guess a very very small percent of college freshmen know what they want to do   i i think to some extent youre right most people have a general idea   yeah yeah i   and then theres theres probably that probably fifty percent have a general idea and the other fifty percent are waiting to see what hits them when they get there   yeah yeah i i went i went off to school wanting to either be a high school algebra teacher or high school French teacher because my two favorite people in the in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher and uh and i was going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors and i had taken chemistry for the first time that year and surprised myself i did well in it   hum   and and sort of made a decision as we were walking me and a friend of mine were walking over to campus uh to to sign up for our majors it was just sort of an off the wall decision       and uh uh but i had no earthly i didnt do well in chemistry in high school and had no earthly idea that id get my degree in chemistry   hm   on on the way in so its uh but i i think uh a person who has some idea like you did is is is well uh you you know that that helps a lot were you uh well prepared for Tech in in your school did you go to public school in Midland   yes i had yeah i was in public school i was in all honors classes i was also a a National Merit Scholar   oh okay well you you you had a lot of things going   and i had the i think the other thing that a lot of kids would benefit from in high school is taking an aptitude test   umhum   because there are some good ones out there and i know in in our high school at least they offered several different ones where you went through and you know you answer all these questions back and forth and things it it ended up being things that you liked versus things that you had an aptitude
