                                 London Calling            On Broadway wheredistinguished American writers complain that its nearly impossible to gettheir plays produced the British dramatist David Hare has opened no fewer thanfour in the past  months Last spring Hares play about Oscar Wilde TheJudas Kiss  came from London It was followed this winter by his adaptationThe Blue Room  which made the cover of Newsweek on the backsideas it were of Nicole Kidman At the moment Hare occupies two stages in NewYork Amys View  starring Judi Dench is playing to full houses at theEthel Barrymore Theatre while Hare himself is performing a monologue aboutIsrael Via Dolorosa  at the Booth Theatre            It shouldnt come as anysurprise that American audiences have a taste for British drama Stage envy isa welltrod Anglophilic path which has in the last few years widened into amostly oneway superhighway stretching from Londons West End to the New YorkTheater District Current productions that have breezed down it include TheWeir  by the young Irish playwright Conor McPherson and Closer  byPatrick Marber Lately we Americans even seem more interested in our ownplaywrights when we see them reflected back at us by the Brits Revivals ofTennessee Williams early work Not About Nightingales and EugeneONeills The Iceman Cometh  starring Kevin Spacey are both Englishimports In a recent discussion in the Sunday Arts  Leisure sectionthree New York Times drama critics discussed this phenomenon Basicallythey all concluded that British is better            But Hare who now dominates Broadway in a way Tom Stoppardnever has may illustrate a somewhat different phenomenon There is of coursean element of Anglomania in his success here But I think it may also speak tosomething more interesting Hare feeds an appetite for a theater engaged withsociety which our domestic dramatic economy isnt satisfying at the moment Heis in almost every way an oldfashioned playwright who uses dramatic form toamplify questions of politics religion society and relations between thesexes And while I think that even Hares best work falls short of greatnessthe combination of his seriousness and his success bode well for theater as aform on both sides of the Atlantic            Hares early work has thereputation for being leftwing agitprop In fact while less skillful than hislater efforts his early plays are not mere polemics Hares first producedplay Slag  is a kind of dystopian fantasy about radicalfeminism in which the attempt to run a girls school dissolves into absurdinfighting It is true that the authors Labor Party socialism originally tookthe notverynovel form of negative portrayals of establishment institutionsand the residue of British imperialism But what soon began to distinguish himfrom a lot of his likeminded contemporaries were a lowkey wit and an abilityto write memorable roles for women Hares first play to open at the NationalTheatre in London in  and currently being revived there wasPlenty  later made into a film with Meryl Streep Streep plays the roleof Susan Traherne a woman who works undercover in France during World War IIand subsequently finds herself unable to cope with postwar British lifeDespite her craziness we see that she has a point            His radicalism mellowed with time and success Where oncehe proposed a debate between between socialism and capitalism between theThird World and the First as in Map of the World  Hares laterplays posit a subtler conflict over personal and political values The firsttime he really demonstrated this maturity was in The Secret Rapture a work Hare himself has pointed to as an important departure Itsabout two sisters who have to deal with the messy legacy of their departedfather One is generous and impractical The other is ruthless andselfinterested in a Thatcherite vein but nonetheless sympathetic in the endFrank Rich then the lead drama critic for the New York Times  who likedthe play when it debuted in London wrote a harsh review of the New Yorkproduction and especially of the performance by the authors thengirlfriendBlair Brown An embittered Hare pledged not to bring another play to New Yorkuntil Rich stopped reviewing            In following years Harebecame more interested in the soul of Britain under Thatcherism In the earlys he wrote a trilogy of State of the Nation plays Racing Demon about the Church of England Murmuring Judges  about the legal systemand The Absence of War  about the Labor Party All opened to acclaim atthe National Theatre and provoked national debate in Britain RacingDemon a play about Anglican priests even came to New York once Rich movedon Why you have to ask is it so seldom that importantseeming American playsaddress societal issues such as these You might start with the fact that theUnited States unlike Britain has no centralized national theater eitherliterally or figuratively What occurs on the New York stage doesnt resonatearound the country or even down the Amtrak corridor to Washington And youmight add that the political interests of American playwrights tend to revolvemore around issues of identity and less around national institutions            We also have a different kind of theatrical traditionwhich is less talky and intellectualized than the British one The playwrightwhom Hare harks back to most directly is George Bernard Shaw Though his wit isnot of Shavian sharpness his plays are in another sense more sophisticatedWhere Shaws characters tend to represent views pitted against each otherHares cannot resist becoming genuine characterscontradictory quirky andimperfect both as heroes and villains The play where one sees this mostclearly is Skylight  for my money his most successful work Itsthe classic Hare setup a collision between two people who see life differentlybut are nonetheless connected a successful Thatcherera businessman and hisformer mistress a schoolteacher in Londons East End You know where Harecomes down in the debate between their values But the play does not exist forone characters worldview to vanquish the others Both are by turnspersuasive flawed and poignant            The recent offerings onBroadway show not only Hares gift for the exposition of issues but also hislimitations The Blue Room  which I saw in its London production lastfall was probably the weakest of the bunch Arthur Schnitzlers original playLa Ronde  was a scandalousforitstime depiction of empty sexualpromiscuityso scandalous it wasnt meant to be performed But with the shockvalue lost the play needed something more than Hares topical amendmentsadded His adaptation didnt provide much food for thought which is unusualfor him A bit of hackwork it suggested that he might be spreading himself toothin            V ia Dolorosa  which I also saw in London is morestimulating intellectually but only a bit Based on a visit to Israel itsjournalism by other means of the sort that Anna Deveare Smith has done sobrilliantly But Hare is no Smith His performance adds little to his scriptand his script adds little to the subject arriving mostly at familiarplatitudes about Israel Nonetheless one has to admire his guts for trying toentertain an audience singlehandedly with a talk about Middle East politicsno less And the work is somewhat interesting despite its inherent limitationsWe see how Hare can turn even a monologue into a kind of dialogue ofperspectives as he pits the passionate commitment of West Bank settlersagainst the humanism of the Israeli culturati Are we where we live or what wethink he asks at the end of the play What matters Stones or Ideas                           Amys View  the best of the recent worksto show up here is a more familiar and successful exercise It is a play withclear imperfections such as an excessively shrill third act But one forgivessuch flaws because of the way Hare draws his audience into the plays issuesHere the debate he sets up is a threeway among mother daughter and thedaughters boyfriend Esme played by Judi Dench is an actress who lives forthe theater Her daughter one of Hares ethereal women a little too good forthis world lives for love The daughters boyfriend Dominic is a cynic wholives only for himself            Within this conflict of values is a clash aboutart Dominic a director of exploitative films and television contends thatthe theater is a dead form Esme stands in for the continued vitality of thestage The final act finds her having lost everythingher home her financialindependence and her daughterbut performing brilliantly in a new play thatshe describes as sincere We see her failings redeemed through commitment toher craft The same might justly be said of the man who wrote the play
