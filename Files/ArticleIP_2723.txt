                                 Since Diana            The headline in theGlobe reads Sharon Stone Cellulite Shocker The photoan enlargedpatch of thighis highlighted with a circle and an arrow a graphic like onethe New York Times might use to indicate the Bosnian village where amassacre took place Together headline and image signal that the tabloidsfinally have returned to form            Yes theDiana hagiography continues Last week the Star did a story on TheReal Princess Di with such unlikely revelations as the alleged fact that shedid her own ironing and joined the help in washing dishes The article alsostated In an age when so many celebrities put on one image in public and hidean ugly private side Diana was just who she was wherever she went Ofcourse a chance to look at that ugly private side is the reason readers pickup the tabs in the first place So it was comforting this week to be told bythe Star that Melanie Griffiths beestung lips appear to be the resultof collagen overload and by the Globe that Shaquille ONeal supposedlyjust had breastreduction surgery            Both the Star and the National               Enquirer proffered written manifestoes denying that publications such astheirs were responsible for Dianas death or even for harassing celebrities ingeneral The Enquirer  which is staking out the strategicallyquestionable territory of the tabloid with taste explains that manycelebrities ask us to interview them and take their pictures However othercelebrities are furious because they cant stop us from telling the trutheven with their powerful publicity machines The statement ends on aconstitutional note You live in America You have a right to buy The               Enquirer             But for a few weeks theEnquirer seemed to lose its way There was a strange celebritythinissue full of stories such as one about a nurse who was fired for trying toperform CPR on a dying baby chimp and another about a ring lost for  yearsthat was found embedded in a potato And then there was this shocking headlinelast month JonBenet Top Cop Mom and Dad Are Innocent Could it be thatafter almost a year of relentless accusations against John and Patsy Ramseythe Enquirer was having second thoughts No as it turned out Thearticle alleged that the retired detective brought in to work on the case wasnot admired by the other cops And this week the story was back on track withMommy and Daddy to Be Arrested by ChristmasCops Convinced            Viewersare tired of Fran Drescher the Enquirer reveals pluckily this weekTheir targetthe star of the sitcom The                Nanny and one of thetabs noisier criticshas turned off too many viewers especially with hercomplaints about the tough lives of superrich celebs The Enquirerpredicts her show will be canceled On the other hand do we detect a defensivenote in a story about singer Merle Haggard which finds it necessary to explainwhy the Enquirer had chosen this moment to portray Haggard as abad husband and father Haggards son Marty is speaking out the articleexplains because his famous father is working on a biographical feature filmthat Marty says will be an outrageous whitewash of the truth            The Star has maintained a morepugilistic pose since Dianas death It too has attacked celebrities whoattacked it George Cluelesssorry Clooneyused to beg us to run stories onhim  when he was a struggling nobody appearing in such schlocky movies asReturn of the Killer Tomatoes  The Star rewards celebrities whounderstand its rules Sylvester Stallone even signed up for an

one celebrity who reallyknows how to act like a star as she happily smiles for our photographer Hinthint            TheStar also has taken to congratulating itself for the people it gets tospeak

industry the one between surgically enhanced former flight attendantSuzen Johnson and football commentator Frank Gifford perhaps now better knownas the cheating husband of talkshow host Kathie Lee During the Diana mourningperiod the Globe went supernatural with this exclusive Princesssmiles down from Heaven on her Brave Boys But it returned to Earth last weekinterviewing an unnamed psychiatrist who had treated Dodi Fayed The shrinksdiagnosis Fayed suffered from something called Borderline PersonalityDisorder When I first heard Di was dating my former patient I wanted tophone Kensington Palace and scream Run Di run             In theweeks following Dianas death it appeared that even the Globe wastrying to find the pretty side of things Take this October story on thevolatile marriage of John F Kennedy Jr and his wife Carolyn Lets StartOver read the headline on an account of how the battling lovebirds werevowing to put passion and togetherness back in their marriage The logicaloutcome said the story was an heir for Camelot But all that togethernesswas apparently a mistake judging from this weeks Globe headline JFKJr I married the wrong woman The Globe has him telling a friendSome nights I wake up shuddering and bathed in sweat            The differences among the three publicationsare probably best illustrated by their varying explanations for the mysteriouscast that recently appeared on JFK Jrs arm According to the Enquirer the editor of George slammed down his hand during an argument with astaffer and broke a bone The Star s version is that he injured his handwhile kayaking Leave it to the Globe to conclude JFK Jr SlashedEmergency surgery after wild brawl with Carolynsay sources            This week all three havecover stories about plastic surgeon to the stars Dr Steven Hoefflin the manwho takes credit for Michael Jacksons nose and whether he exposed anddiscussed the genitals of his celebrity patients while they were underanesthesia Its a natural story for the tabloids but it caught them all withtheir pants down when it first appeared in a long entertaining piece in theWashington                Post
