                                 Clintons Last Laugh                           Frame Game is anoccasional Slate department based on the premise that who wins inWashington is often determined by how the issue is framed The author neitherendorses nor condemns any of the views expressed however laudatory orrepellent                        Is President Clintonfinished Lots of Washington journalists think so Evidence suggests thatClinton committed and suborned perjury in the Monica Lewinsky affair Justicethey say demands that the president be held accountable to the law            Its aperfectly logical argument But so what In politics logic is just a smallpart of the art of framing While Clintons critics reason carefully aboutjustice honesty and criminal behavior the president is playing an entirelydifferent game He is turning the scandal into a debate about sex politicalwarfare and the disruption of the nations business Thats how hes going tosurvive                            Perjury vs sex Independent CounselKenneth Starr wanted the Lewinsky case to be about perjury and coverup Hetook it up and Attorney General Janet Reno approved his investigation becausewhat had happened to LewinskyVernon Jordan found her a plum job after shethwarted prosecutors efforts to incriminate Clintoneerily resembled what hadhappened to Whitewaterscandal figure Webster Hubbell Through Lewinsky Starrhoped to unravel a pattern of coverup Indeed he hoped to wire Lewinsky andthereby catch Jordanand perhaps even Clintonasking her to lie            Starr never got his chanceThe Lewinsky story leaked and the press besieged White House spokesman MikeMcCurry with questions about the alleged affair Reporters initially preservedan air of dignity by couching their questions in terms of perjury but theysoon tossed aside that fig leaf and pounced on the subject everyone wanted toknow about Did Clinton and Lewinsky have sex If so what kind McCurryanswered evasively as did Clinton in an interview with PBSs Jim Lehrer Byevening the whole country was gossiping about the randy president and thenubile intern            Jordanissued a statement the next day denying that he had encouraged Lewinsky to lieWith that the question of perjury vanished trampled by the medias sexualfeeding frenzy Reporters hounded McCurry about details of the alleged affairand nuances in Clintons denials Networknews anchors and Sundaymorningmoderators parsed the semantics of oral sex Reports that Clinton had confessedto an affair with Gennifer Flowers compounded the titillation            All these tales about Clintons sex life arehumiliating but they wont get him booted from office Polls show that thepublic is far less willing to impeach Clinton for having an affair withLewinsky than for committing or suborning perjury about it Whats moreoutrage over consensual sex is unsustainable The public soon tires of thesubject Disgust with the sordid sex curdles into disgust with the sordidinvestigation and coverage of it Clintons spokesmen have accelerated thisspin cycle accusing Starr of launching what Clinton adviser James Carvillecalls a scuzzy investigation to dig up some kind of sleazy sex            Critics assume that Clintonhas to explain or repent his sexual sins But maybe the public doesnt need toforgive or understand them Maybe it just needs to get used to them as it hasdone before Everybody knew Clinton was an adulterer in  argued WhiteHouse strategist Paul Begala on ABCs This Week With Sam and Cokie responding to the Lewinsky scandal According to Begala voters elected Clintonnot because he was pure but because he had good ideas that are helping thecountry Who cares if hes taken another spill off the chastity wagon All thistalk about White House sex is already losing its shock value Pundits arepointing out that lots of presidents fooled around that not one of them wasimpeached for it and that citizens of many other countries dont care abouttheir leaders mistresses            Now thatthe Lewinsky affair has been reduced from a perjury scandal to a sex scandalHillary Clinton can shut the bedroom door on it The only people who count inany marriage are the two that are in it Hillary argued on the Todayshow Jan  We know everything there is to know about each other and weunderstand and accept and love each other Unless Starr manages to push theperjury issue back to center stage Mrs Clintons defense of her husband willstifle the publics appetite for further investigation                            Legal inquiry vs political war Mostjournalists who think Clinton is doomed assume that he eventually has to tellthe truth about his relationship with Lewinsky Says who A political scandalisnt a Socratic scientific or legal investigation To get reporters to stopasking about Lewinsky Clinton doesnt have to give them the truth he just hasto tire them out His advisers call this their ropeadope strategyreferring to the boxing tactic of shielding your head with your gloves andmaking your opponent exhaust himself by uselessly pummeling you against theropes Its effective On This Week  Cokie Roberts asked Begala sixtimes whether an extramarital physical relationship was improper Six timesBegala responded by making the case for Clinton in his own terms EventuallyRoberts gave up            White House strategists havealso taken the heat off Clinton by defining the investigation as a politicalfight obliging the press to scrutinize both sides equally Like JohnnieCochran Clintons defenders are putting the prosecution on trial Carvillelaunched the attack on Starr months ago This week he declared allout warbetween Starr and the Clinton camp The real focus here is on the methodsand motives of the independent counsel said Carville accusing Starr ofwiring women in hotel bars and plying them with whiskey Two days laterHillary Clinton called Starr a politically motivated prosecutor who is alliedwith the rightwing opponents of my husband Clintons partisans have linkedStarr to Jesse Helms Jerry Falwell and other bogeymen Polls indicate thatthe public is buying this argument A plurality blames the scandal on Clintonsenemies not Clinton            The war metaphor has changedthe nature of media coverage Investigative reporters strive for truth butpolitical reporters strive for balance As political accusations against Starrand the right have escalated the press has devoted a greater share of itsscandal coverage to questioning the methods and motives of those who gatheredthe evidence against Clinton And ethics aside reporters like to prolongfights by keeping them even The more Clinton is afflicted the more the presscomforts him by afflicting Starr            Thepsychology of war also causes reporters to focus less on each sides evidencethan on its posture Clintons Jan  denial of the sex allegations addednothing but anger to his Jan  denial yet the press called it morepersuasive When White House aides and congressional Democrats reflexivelyexpressed confidence in Clintons denials their assurances were portrayed asbolstering Clintons case When Clinton lawyer Bob Bennett requested that thePaula Jones trial begin sooner than scheduled reporters construed it as adisplay of confidence                            Justice vs business To depriveDemocrats of the political fight they crave Republican leaders have kept quietabout the Lewinsky case and confined their comments to topics such as Iraqtaxes and Social Security But this plays into Clintons third strategy Evenif Starr focuses public attention on the perjury issue and represents hisinvestigation as a search for truth Clinton can defeat him by persuading thepublicwithout explicitly saying sothat impeaching the president for perjuryin a civil suit is less important than getting on with the nations businessAs Clinton put it on Jan  These allegations are false And I need to goback to work for the American people            The press will milk the sexscandal for as long as possible but the relentless influx of new issues worksin Clintons favor Skeptics said Clinton wouldnt be able to pull off hisState of the Union speech with the scandal hanging over him He proved themwrong and in the process pushed the issue of Social Security to center stageMilitary confrontation with Iraq would instantly supplant the Lewinsky storyand would convert Clintons image from lecher to leader            Idealiststhink the public wont accept Clintons disjunction between justice andbusiness between his private vice and his public service But polls show thatthe public does accept the disjunction Clintons jobapproval rating has heldsteady even as his personal favorability and trustworthiness ratings havedeclined Americans will overlook his squalid conduct because he makes thetrains run on time Theyre not going to shut down the recovery suggestedBegala last week just to start asking about whether somebody made a phonecall How cynical And how true
