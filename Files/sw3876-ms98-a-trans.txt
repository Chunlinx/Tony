              okay so what now what are your opinions on recycling   well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it its gonna be too late   yeah   you know ive heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand   yeah ive heard that too   and thats not too far away but i dont know how it is there it is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take   umhum   plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them and theres some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile   well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them and uh thats i cant remember where i went to take them but they wouldnt they wouldnt take them   umhum yeah its very hard to find a spot and then i dont know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to   oh i know theres no really recycling facilities   no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where theyre having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out   i think thats a good idea   and i think thats what it is gonna have to come to where were just forced to   besides well like a law or whatever and thats how it is in New York or isnt it   yeah i think so its just because they have to you know   umhum you get ticketed if you dont do it right   right uhhuh and i think its going to come to that because some people will just not go to the its its trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but   yeah plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment   yeah yeah its very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and so i dont know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state im from   umhum   uh i believe its gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether its a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back   yeah uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle   youre forced to and uh you also dont see the litter there people just   yeah thats true   it makes it worthwhile to take it back and ive just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i dont know if youve tried it   yeah ive seen them   and they have on the back its five cents okay its still five cents and it even shows the states that   umhum that take them back   yeah well what some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now   is Texas one of them   Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass   yeah   so   no i dont think that theres enough being done now i work at JC Penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling   uhhuh   program thats um company wide and i do the recycling for that   okay do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper good because there is a lot of waste there isnt there   yeah yeah i know theres a lot of computer paper though that you cant use   right right   but um we use to have uh i mean i i dont even remember how much money that theyve um mean i mean the money that theyve made from the recycling program theyve donated it to charities but i mean theyve made a substantial amount of money from it   right yeah something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like ive decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton   yeah   you add water ill i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am gonna stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business   yeah   and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that   well now you see some of this stuff and youre and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didnt you think of that before   yeah yeah and i think that its just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just dont care and they dont wanna think about it   yeah thats true   and uh i just look at it as i dont want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didnt you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried   yeah   and i dont know it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it then well be forced to it may be too late   do they not ever i mean i dont know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like   very little thats another thing and if you ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well   then thats pollution   that doesnt do me any good because i dont have any place to burn it   yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor   yeah and then just like the glass bottles that that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and theres no place i can take glass to   yeah   so i still throw away a lot of glass      truly sad   yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something its got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
