                                 Theres No Worm in This Apple                        Its not too often that the market takes it as good news when a companyannounces that its revenues and profits are going to fall well short ofexpectations And in the case of Apple Computer which made precisely thatannouncement after the closing bell yesterday the market in fact did not takeit as good news In the midst of a broadif relatively mildselloff intechnology stocks today Apple was a notable loser with its shares fallingnine points or better than  percent            In the context of the past year which has seen Apples stock soar becauseof all the buzz about the iMac the iBook and the new Power Mac G Tuesdaystumble was unsurprising But there were two interesting things about itnonetheless The first is that the stock fell sharply despite the fact thatpretty much every serious analyst who covers the company said that if the stocksold off investors should treat it as a buying opportunity So we were greetedwith odd headlines on the newswires today like Apples Stock Tumbles StreetSays Its Time To Buy Considering the heavy volume in Apple its clear thatlots of people on the Street were in fact thinking it was time to sell Butthis is one case where it wasnt the brokerage houses that overreacted even ifa couple of analysts did trim their estimates for next year            The more interesting thing about Apples announcement is that from one angleit really was good news at least if you looked at things from the perspectiveof the longue dure  What Apple said was that its revenues and earningswere going to be down because Motorola which is the sole manufacturer of themicroprocessor for the G hadnt been able to deliver enough chips to satisfya much heavier than expected demand for the G Apple said it had alreadyreceived  orders for the G in the three weeks since it went on salebut that Motorola was not going to be able to produce anywhere near that manychips            The obvious point here is that if youre going to have a problem itsbetter to have one thats the result of too much demand rather than too littleThough there is something deeply ironic about Apple which initially ran intotrouble because its founderand now interim CEOSteve Jobs wanted it tobuild everything that went into the machines is now having problems becauseits sole supplier is struggling But theres also something else which isthat Apple said its profits in this quarter would be  to  percent less thanthey were a year ago            On the face of it thats strange Even if the company were having troublewith the G which is a new product why would that make it earn less moneythan it did a year ago when the G didnt even exist But theres actually agood reason for this and it has to do with the way Apple has pared back itsoperations concentrated on its best products and placed a new premium ontechnological innovation            A year ago there were still Apple products in the pipeline and on storeshelves that were older models or that served markets in which the company wasnever going to thrive Today thats not true The best thing that Apple hasdone in the past year and a halfactually the best thing its done in morethan a decadeis return to its core competence as a company that makes sharplydesigned userfriendly highperformance products for consumers who arewilling to pay a premium for those characteristics The best thing about theG in that sense is that there are no sub Gs As a result Applesreturn on invested capital is improving its profit margins are improving andeventually assuming Motorola gets its act together its profits will improveas well Apple will never be what it once was But it has a chance to do agreat job of being what it is
