              there you go okay   now im sorry excuse me and uh i do that we recycle uh newspapers we take you know the Dallas Morning News daily and the Plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers   right oh i know it builds up really fast   it really does i do recycle newspapers and uh glass   yeah  yeah uhhuh   we dont really have enough plastic to mess with we dont you know like we dont drink milk and we dont have children so we dont have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know   yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us   yeah right but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container   yeah   and uh Plano has plans i believe its tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at peoples home and they can   oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah   it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up   yeah   which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who cant or dont drive you know they cant get to the these centers   yeah or it just builds up so often yeah   and im sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know   yeah yeah   but i think thats probably a good idea   they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasnt profitable   uhhuh right   so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic   uhhuh uhhuh   and put it in front of the WalMart store in town and they they it just really every every every time you went by there it was just over flowing   uhhuh thats right   and so WalMart complained   uhhuh yes   so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be   yeah great   oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and they they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there   i bet it was uhhuh   so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it   uhhuh sure   you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area   uhhuh uhhuh   in one neighborhood and they have pickup there its uh i think once or twice a week   right uhhuh   and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message   yeah its just a matter of education i think   yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going   uhhuh   theyll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but its not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and its not going to be i dont think   uhhuh yeah yeah thats right   yeah   i think basically its a good idea you know i hope it works   yeah i do to because its amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little   absolutely absolutely right   um seedling to plant you know  you could take the the   uhhuh right   mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought   uhhuh sure absolutely and theres just you know the two of us my wife and i and its amazing how much stuff just just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five   yeah oh yeah its really it adds up so fast yeah   it really does as far as new stuff to recycle you know i dont really i dont really know i really hadnt thought about it to tell you the truth   yeah well  theyre working on  diapers which would be great ive read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful   thats right i was uhhuh uhhuh   but now their saying that theyre there really not that much in comparison to the others because you dont have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so   thats right   the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off   uhhuh yeah   so i dont know whats the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those   uhhuh i see   but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so   oh im sure it must yes you know im not personally involved because i dont you know i dont have any  children that wear diapers but im sure it creates a large amount of you know uh refuse   yeah yeah it does and you just feel guilty if you dont do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives arent to great either   thats right thats right absolutely thats right absolutely absolutely   yeah i dont know what else they could recycle more of i guess we dont really use that many tin cans i guess theres some places where you can recycle aluminum but i dont know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i dont know if those are recyclable or   uhhuh i think theyre made out of aluminum   um   yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we dont we dont generate that much so we dont   yeah yeah we dont either   yeah   we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we dont really have much of that but   thats right that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass   yeah well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car   uhhuh   or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say its not safe to put those things in the regular trash   uhhuh thats right car batteries   yeah yeah   uhhuh i dont you know i dont change my own oil so i dont i dont uh dont have that problem     yeah well other than that im not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes   yeah uhhuh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact     our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so   right yeah yes we have one of those in town uhhuh   yeah yeah   you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and theres a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the uh   oh   its called the clothes closet thats what its called here in Plano right uhhuh and they distribute them to the people that need them   uhhuh kind of like a Goodwill kind of place yeah yeah yeah thats thats real helpful too   uhhuh yeah   well im not sure of anything i cant really think of anything else that we could recycle   no i cant either  i really cant um   yeah   no i i really cant either   okay   okay well it was nice talking to you   you to take care byebye   okay uhhuh byebye
