                    Background        Soluble sugars such as glucose and sucrose have been        postulated to act as signaling molecules that help regulate        a wide variety of plant developmental and physiological        processes                 These        processes include flowering        seed        germination      and photosynthesis      One        of the most thoroughly characterized sugarregulated        processes is the breakdown of starch by germinating cereal        seeds Starch metabolism by germinating seeds must be        tightly controlled to ensure an adequate supply of sugar to        the developing seedling             As alphaamylases play a critical role in starch        metabolism the regulation of alphaamylase activity has        formed a major focus of studies on starch metabolism        Increasing sugar levels have been shown to repress        expression of alphaamylases in rice seedlings    and        suspension culture cells     Studies using barley        embryos provide evidence for the existence of independent        glucose and disaccharide signaling mechanisms in the        regulation of alphaamylase expression     Sugar        regulation of alphaamylase expression has also been shown        to occur at multiple levels Sugar levels affect not only        alphaamylase transcript levels      but also mRNA        stability     and protein transport and turnover            Sugarsignaling pathways may also interact with other        signaling pathways in the control of alphaamylase        activity For example sugars repress a        gibberellindependent pathway for alphaamylase expression        in barley embryos            Little is known about the signal transduction pathways        for sugar responses Proteins postulated to act in control        of at least some sugarregulated processes include        hexokinases       and SNFrelated protein        kinases      Hexokinases have been suggested to play        a role in sugar repression of alphaamylase activity This        hypothesis is based on findings that only those glucose        analogs that are believed to be substrates for        phosphorylation by hexokinases are effective in repressing        alphaamylase expression     However the role of        hexokinases in sugar responses remains under debate                     Genetic approaches are being used to identify additional        components of sugarresponse pathways Arabidopsis mutants        that are defective in sugarregulated expression of the        genes encoding patatin     betaamylase             plastocyanin    and the ApL subunit of ADPglucose        pyrophosphorylase    have been isolated Additional        sugarresponse mutants have been identified by taking        advantage of the fact that high concentrations of exogenous        sugars glucose or sucrose inhibit early seedling        development of wildtype Arabidopsis Several groups of        Arabidopsis mutants that are resistant to the inhibitory        effects of high sugar concentrations have been isolated                Characterization of these mutants        reveals that the         sis             sun             gin    and         isi    mutants are allelic to        the abscisic acid insensitive mutant         abi    and the         sis             isi    and         gin    mutants are allelic to        the abscisic acid biosynthesis mutant         aba     In addition the        ethylene constitutive response mutant         ctr     as well as the        ethyleneoverproduction mutant         eto     display sugarresistant        phenotypes     Conversely the sugarresponse mutant         sis exhibits an ethylene        constitutive response phenotype and is allelic to         ctr     The         prl mutant which exhibits increased        sensitivity to exogenous sugars      carries a        mutation in a gene that encodes a WD protein that interacts        with SNF protein kinases            Although a large number of studies have been conducted        on sugar regulation of starch breakdown by germinating        cereal seeds very little work has focused on determining        whether lipid breakdown by germinating oilseeds is also        sugar regulated Findings that the expression of at least        two genes involved in lipid metabolism is sugar regulated           and that sucrose can affect total lipid content in        germinating seeds    suggest that lipid metabolism may        also be sugar regulated Work presented here indicates that        storage lipid breakdown is significantly delayed in        germinating Arabidopsis seeds exposed to exogenous        glucose                    Results                  Seedlings growing on media containing glucose          exhibit reduced rates of seed storage lipid          mobilization          Exposure to exogenous sugars such as glucose and          sucrose has long been known to retard rates of starch          mobilization in germinating cereal seeds               Therefore it was of interest to determine whether          exogenous sugars also affect rates of lipid mobilization          in germinating seeds of plants such as           Arabidopsis thaliana  that store          their energy reserves in the form of lipids Seed storage          lipid levels were monitored by measuring eicosenoic           fatty acid levels Eicosenoic fatty acid          represents approximately  of seed lipid reserves but          is present in only very low amounts in membrane lipids          For example in one study  fatty acid was found to          constitute only  of the fatty acid present in          Arabidopsis roots and was below the detection threshold          in shoots     Therefore the rate of decrease in           fatty acid levels reflects the rate of decrease in          seed storage lipid levels          Seeds of wildtype           Arabidopsis thaliana var Columbia          were sown on plates containing solid minimal Arabidopsis          media     supplemented with glucose andor sorbitol          Seedsseedlings were harvested at different time points          after the start of imbibition As shown in Figure           seeds sown on media containing  M glucose metabolize           fatty acid at a significantly slower rate than seeds          sown on media lacking sugar The effect of  M glucose          on  mobilization is not solely due to the increased          osmotic potential of the media as equimolar and even          twice equimolar concentrations of sorbitol have little          effect on  mobilization Figure                           Growth on mannose but not Omethylglucose leads          to reduced rates of seed storage lipid          mobilization          Mannose is a glucose analog that has been postulated          to affect seed germination    and sugarregulated          gene expression     via a signaling pathway that          requires hexokinase activity For reasons that remain          unclear mannose inhibits seed germination and early          seedling development at concentrations that are           fold lower than the concentrations of glucose required to          exert similar effects         As shown in          Figure  growth on low  mM concentrations of          mannose also leads to a significant reduction in           breakdown In contrast            O methylglucose has little effect          on  levels Figure             O methylglucose is a glucose          analog that in at least some organisms is transported          by hexose transporters       but is          phosphorylated very inefficiently if at all by          hexokinases     Seedlings grown on media containing                     O methylglucose have  levels          that are similar to the  levels of plants grown on          approximately equimolar concentrations of sorbitol but          that are much lower than the  levels of plants grown          on equimolar concentrations of glucose Figure                           High concentrations of glucose or sorbitol almost          eliminate breakdown of seed storage lipids          Growth on high  to  M concentrations of          glucose or sucrose has been shown to severely inhibit          development of Arabidopsis seedlings                    Most seedlings grown on highsugar media lack true          leaves and have cotyledons that have undergone little          expansion even after two to three weeks of growth As          more moderate sugar concentrations slow  mobilization          Figure  it was of interest to determine whether          seedlings arrested by growth on highsugar media are able          to mobilize any of their seed storage lipid As shown in          Figure  seedlings arrested by growth on  M glucose          retain approximately  of their seed storage lipid          even after  days of growth In contrast day old          seedlings grown in the presence of equimolar sorbitol          retain only  to  of their seed storage lipid          The effects of high glucose concentrations on lipid          breakdown could be due to a nonspecific inhibition of          developmental andor metabolic processes Consistent with          this possibility are findings that seedlings arrested by          growth on very high concentrations of sorbitol  M          sorbitol   M Glc also retain almost all of their           Figure  However although the effects of  M          sorbitol   M Glc on lipid mobilization are          comparable to the effects of  M Glc  M sorbitol            M Glc inhibits lipid accumulation to a significantly          greater extent than  M Glc Table  For example          seedlings grown for  days in the presence of  M Glc          accumulate approximately twice as much membrane fatty          acid as seedlings grown on  M sorbitol   M Glc          These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of           M sorbitol   M Glc on lipid breakdown are less          specific than the effects of  M Glc Both  M Glc          and  M sorbitol   M Glc also retard seed          germination rates Figure  However both these media          supplements delay seed germination by only  to  days          In contrast storage lipid mobilization is retarded for a          significantly longer time period For example whereas          seedlings growing in the absence of added Glc or sorbitol          mobilize approximately  of their  within  days of          the start of imbibition Figure  seedlings grown on           M Glc or  M sorb   M Glc mobilize only  to           of their  after  days Figure                           Seedlings become resistant to the inhibitory          effects of glucose on fatty acid metabolism within three          days of the start of imbibition          Previous work indicates that wildtype Arabidopsis          seedlings become resistant to the inhibitory effects of          high concentrations  to  M of exogenous sugars          on seedling development within  to  days of the start          of imbibition     Therefore it was of interest to          determine whether seedlings become resistant to the          inhibitory effects of high sugar concentrations on seed          storage lipid mobilization within the same time frame          Seeds were either sown on low  M glucose media and          then transferred after  days to high  M glucose or          sorbitol media or were sown directly on high glucose or          sorbitol media As shown in Figure  seedlings sown          directly on  M glucose exhibit little shoot          development after  days of growth In contrast          seedlings grown on  M glucose for  days and then for          an additional  days on  M glucose produce very          significant shoot systems In fact these plants have          slightly larger average shoot systems than seedlings          grown continuously on  M glucose Figure           Interestingly whereas seedlings sown directly on  M          sorbitol   M glucose produce larger shoot systems          than seedlings sown directly on  M glucose seedlings          transferred to  M sorbitol   M glucose after           days on  M glucose produce smaller shoot systems than          seedlings transferred to  M glucose Figure           As shown in Figure  seedlings sown directly on media          containing  M glucose metabolize only a small          percentage of their  fatty acid after  days of          growth In addition these seedlings exhibit a          significant reduction in accumulation of membrane fatty          acids In contrast seedlings shifted from  to  M          glucose metabolize almost all of their  fatty acid          within  days of the shift despite the fact that only           of the seed storage lipid is metabolized prior to          the shift In addition these seedlings actually show          increased accumulation of membrane fatty acids relative          to seedlings grown continuously on  M glucose As an          osmotic control seedlings were grown on  M sorbitol            M glucose for  days or on  M glucose for           days followed by an additional  days on  M sorbitol            M glucose As shown in Figure  both the          seedlings grown continuously on  M sorbitol   M          glucose or transferred to that media after  days on           M glucose metabolize almost all of their  fatty          acid In contrast seedlings transferred from  M          glucose to  M sorbitol   M glucose exhibit a          significant reduction in accumulation of membrane fatty          acids whereas seedlings sown directly on  M sorbitol            M glucose exhibit only a slight reduction                          The sisabi mutant is resistant to the          inhibitory effects of glucose on seed storage lipid          mobilization          Several groups of Arabidopsis mutants that are          resistant to the inhibitory effects of high          concentrations of exogenous glucose or sucrose on early          seedling development have been isolated                  A representative           sugarinsensitive            sis  mutant the           sisabi mutant was          analyzed to determine whether mutants of this type can          also exhibit altered responses to the effects of          exogenous glucose on lipid metabolism As shown in Figure                     sisabi seedlings          metabolize significantly more  fatty acid than          wildtype plants when grown on media containing  M          glucose In contrast mutant and wildtype plants          metabolize similar amounts of  fatty acid when grown          on  M sorbitol Figure                             Discussion        Although numerous studies have shown that high        concentrations of exogenous sugars repress the ability of        germinating cereal seeds to mobilize the starch they use as        energy reserves      little work of a similar nature        had previously been conducted on oilseed plants such as        Arabidopsis Among the few studies done previously is one        showing that expression of two genes involved in lipid        metabolism is negatively regulated by sugars     In        addition a study of glyoxylate cycle mutants showed a        small inhibitory effect of sucrose on total lipid content        in germinating seeds     Results presented here        indicate that mobilization of seed storage lipid by         Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings is        significantly retarded in the presence of exogenous        glucose For example seedlings grown for  days on  M        glucose retain approximately five times as much seed        storage lipid as seedlings grown in the absence of        exogenous glucose This effect is not due to osmotic        stress as equimolar or even twice equimolar        concentrations of sorbitol have little effect on lipid        breakdown        Growth of seedlings on media containing higher  M        concentrations of glucose results in almost complete        elimination of lipid breakdown For example seedlings        grown in the presence of  M glucose retain approximately         of their seed storage lipid even after  days of        growth The effects of high glucose concentrations on lipid        breakdown could be relatively specific or could be due to a        nonspecific inhibition of developmental andor metabolic        processes Interestingly sorbitol can also inhibit seed        storage lipid breakdown However the effect of sorbitol on        seed storage lipid breakdown is only manifested at sorbitol        concentrations eg  M sorbitol   M glucose that        also almost completely eliminate seedling growth In        addition the effects of sorbitol on seedling growth appear        less specific than the effects of glucose as  M        sorbitol   M glucose exerts a similar effect on        storage lipid breakdown as  M glucose but has a        significantly greater effect on accumulation of membrane        lipids In addition although glucose and to a lesser        extent sorbitol retard seed germination rates both        additives retard mobilization of storage lipids to a        significantly greater extent than seed germination        The effects of glucose analogs on lipid breakdown were        also determined Seedlings grown on media containing        mannose but not          O methylglucose exhibit decreased        rates of seed storage lipid breakdown In many organisms        mannose has been shown to be a substrate for hexokinases        whereas          O methylglucose is metabolized        poorly if at all by hexokinases      As a result        processes that are affected by mannose but not by          O methylglucose have been postulated        to be regulated via a hexokinasemediated pathways              By this logic the fact that seed storage lipid        breakdown is repressed by the presence of mannose but not        by          O methylglucose could also be        interpreted to mean that inhibition of seed storage lipid        breakdown occurs via a hexokinasemediated pathway        However alternative explanations cannot be ruled out at        this time First the extent to which mannose and          O methylglucose are metabolized by        hexokinases and other enzymes has yet to be determined for        Arabidopsis In addition a recent report indicates that        mannose may affect some processes by sequestering        phosphate rather than by stimulating a hexokinasemediated        sugarresponse pathway     Although the mechanism by        which mannose acts is uncertain at this time the fact that        it retards lipid breakdown when present at concentrations        of only  mM indicates that the effects of mannose cannot        be attributed to osmotic stress        A number of Arabidopsis sugarresponse mutants have been        isolated that unlike wildtype plants are able to develop        substantial shoot systems in the presence of  to  M        sucrose or glucose         Analysis of a        representative mutant of this type the         sisabi mutant            reveals that it is resistant to the inhibitory effects of        exogenous glucose on seed storage lipid breakdown This        result indicates that mutations that alleviate the negative        effects of exogenous sugars on early seedling development        can also reduce glucosemediated inhibition of seed storage        lipid breakdown        Mediashift experiments indicate that wildtype        seedlings become insensitive to the inhibitory effects of        exogenous glucose on seed storage lipid metabolism within         days of the start of imbibition Interestingly wildtype        Arabidopsis seedlings were shown previously to become        insensitive to sugarmediated inhibition of early seedling        development within  to  days of the start of imbibition            In addition seedlings of         Brassica napus  a close relative of        Arabidopsis undergo a dramatic metabolic shift during the        same time period     Approximately  days after the        start of imbibition         B napus seedlings shift from being        dependent on lipid breakdown to being dependent on        photosynthesis for sugar formation The similar timing with        which these events occur suggests that completion of the        metabolic transition from lipid breakdown to photosynthesis        as the primary source of sugars results in loss of        sensitivity to the negative effects of sugars on lipid        breakdown and early seedling development However        exogenous sugars can completely compensate for mutations        that disrupt the glyoxylate cycle     This finding        suggests that the negative effects of high concentrations        of exogenous sugars on early seedling development and seed        storage lipid breakdown are not the result of        sugarmediated inhibition of the glyoxylate cycle Further        experiments will be required to clarify the relationship        between inhibition of early seedling development and seed        storage lipid breakdown by exogenous sugars                    Conclusions        Although many studies have examined the effects of sugar        levels on rate of starch breakdown by germinating cereal        seeds little effort has been devoted to characterizing the        effects of sugar levels on lipid breakdown by germinating        oilseed plants Work presented here demonstrates that        growth in the presence of exogenous glucose significantly        retards mobilization of seed storage lipid in germinating        seeds from wildtype Arabidopsis In contrast the         sugarinsensitive mutant         sisabi is resistant to the        inhibitory effects of exogenous glucose on lipid breakdown        The effect of glucose on seed storage lipid breakdown is        not solely due to the osmotic potential of the media as        substantially higher concentrations of sorbitol than of        glucose are required to exert significant effects on lipid        breakdown Mannose but not          O methylglucose also inhibits lipid        breakdown This result suggests that phosphorylation by        hexokinase may be required for inhibition of lipid        breakdown However as metabolism of these glucose analogs        remains to be characterized in Arabidopsis alternative        explanations cannot be ruled out at this time The        inhibitory effects of glucose on lipid breakdown are        limited to a narrow developmental window Within        approximately three days of the start of imbibition        germinating Arabidopsis seeds become insensitive to the        inhibitory effects of exogenous glucose on seed storage        lipid mobilization This result suggests that completion of        some critical metabolic transition results in loss of        sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of glucose on lipid        breakdown                    Materials and Methods                  Materials and growth conditions          Seeds of wildtype           Arabidopsis thaliana var Columbia          were

C per min          C for  min The pressure program for the column          was  kPa for  min ramp to  kPa at  kPa per min           kPa for  min The temperatures of the injector and          the flame ionization detector were C and C          respectively Helium was used as the carrier gas                          Fatty acid identification and quantitation          Gas chromatograph peaks were identified by comparing          their column retention times with the retention times of          fatty acid methyl ester standards Sigma St Louis MO          USA The quantities of all major fatty acids in each          sample were determined by comparing the sizes of the gas          chromatography peaks produced by each sample with the          sizes of the peaks produced by fatty acid methyl ester          standards of known concentration This data was used to          calculate the net amounts of membrane fatty acids          produced by the seedlings in each sample In oilseeds          such as Arabidopsis the bulk of the fatty acids present          in seeds and very young seedlings are found in storage          lipids For example storage lipids comprise  of the          total lipid found in ungerminated seeds of           Brassica napus     a plant          species that is closely related to Arabidopsis The          remaining  of seed lipids consist of nonstorage          lipids such as membrane lipids To calculate the          increase in the amount of membrane fatty acid in a          particular group of seedlings it is necessary to          subtract the amount of seed fatty acid both storage and          nonstorage remaining in those seedlings from the total          amount of fatty acid present in the seedlings          The amount of seed storage fatty acid remaining in          seedlings harvested at day x can be calculated using          the following equation          g seedstorage fatty acid at day x  g fatty          acid in seeds g  at day xg  in          seeds          As approximately  of seed lipids consist of storage          lipids     the total amount of fatty acid found in          ungerminated seeds is multiplied by  to determine the          amount of fatty acid present in the storage lipid of          ungerminated seeds This number is then multiplied by the          fraction of  eicosenoic fatty acid remaining at day          x to account for the percentage of storage lipid that          has been metabolized by day x Assuming that different          seedstorage fatty acids are metabolized at similar          rates eicosenoic fatty acid levels will reflect seed          storage lipid levels as eicosenoic fatty acid is present          in significant amounts in seed storage lipids but is          almost entirely lacking from nonstorage lipids such as          membrane lipids              The amount of seed nonstorage fatty acid present in          seedlings can be calculated using the following          equation          g seed nonstorage fatty acid  g fatty acid in          seeds          As approximately  of seed lipids consist of          nonstorage lipids     the total amount of fatty          acid found in ungerminated seeds is multiplied by  to          determine the amount of fatty acid present in the          nonstorage lipid of ungerminated seeds          Finally the increase in the amount of fatty acid          present in the membranes of seedlings harvested at day          x after the start of imbibition can be calculated using          the following equation          Increase in membrane fatty acid by day x  total          g fatty acid at day x  g seedstorage fatty acid          remaining at day x  g seed nonstorage fatty          acid                          Seed germination          Seeds were surface sterilized and sown on the          indicated media Seeds were scored for germination at          regular intervals Seed germination is defined as the          emergence of any part of the seedling from the seed          coat                          Mediashift experiments          For mediashift experiments  MW Gel Blot Paper was          placed on top of solid media in
