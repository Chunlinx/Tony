                                 Do Statutes of Limitations Apply to DNA Cases                        Last week the New York Times reported that Milwaukee Wisprosecutors had filed rape and kidnapping charges against a John Doedefendant identifiable only by the DNA code of his semen DNA likefingerprints is unique to each individual The prosecutors took this stepbecause the statute of limitations for the crime was about to expire and theyhad no better way of identifying their suspect In cases where DNA evidence islocated will statutes of limitations become irrelevant            Statute of limitations laws require plaintiffs to take legal action within aspecified time in order for their claim to be valid Murder is the one crimeexempted from statutes of limitations The purpose is to guarantee defendantsSixth Amendment right to a speedy trial and to ensure that they will not haveto defend themselves against stale evidence It would be difficult forexample to find witnesses to corroborate an alibi many years after thefact            In general a warrant must be signedor in a civil case a complaintfiledbefore the statute of limitations expires In Wisconsin where thestatute of limitations in rape cases is six years a warrant requires a namean alias or a physical description of the suspect that would allow him to bearrested with reasonable certainty This ensures that prosecutors are charginga specific suspect It also prevents them from bringing charges in secretwhich would violate Fifth Amendment due process rights            Some defense attorneys say that allowing prosecutors to charge suspects bytheir DNA would effectively suspend the statute of limitations because DNA isrecovered in a very large percentage of criminal cases And if a suspect can becharged by his DNA why not charge other John Does by their fingerprints whichare ubiquitous at crime scenes too            The Milwaukee case does not necessarily imply such an expansion ofprosecutorial discretion In most crimes where DNA comes into play itspresence does not definitively prove guilt A trace of DNA on a murder weaponfor example only demonstrates that the suspect touched itnot that heactually committed the crime But the Milwaukee suspects DNA was extractedfrom semen swabbed from the victims genitals on the nights of the attacksArguably few fingerprints or other identifiers would be sufficientlypersuasive for a warrant to be issued on their basis alone The Milwaukee casewould likely set a precedent only for the small set of cases where DNA isoverwhelming proof of guilt Defense lawyer Barry Scheck took this position onCNNs Burden of Proof  Click here to read a transcript of the discussion            It could also be argued that charging an individual by his DNA amounted tocharging him in secret because few people would recognize their own geneticcode even if they read it in a newspaper In any event the statute oflimitations questions surrounding the Milwaukee case will be moot untilprosecutors apprehend a suspect match his DNA to John Does charge him withthe crime and his lawyers protest the prosecutors strategy                         Next question
