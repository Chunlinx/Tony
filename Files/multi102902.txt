multipollutant control strategies Theimplementation timing and reduction stringency of such strategiesaffect the quantity of resources required to complete the controltechnology installations and the ability of markets to adjust andto provide more resources where needed Using the IntegratedPlanning Model IPM the US Environmental Protection AgencyEPA estimated the number and size of facilities that need toinstall new emissions control equipment to meet the implementationdates and emission reductions set forth in the Clear Skies ActThis study provides an estimate of the resources required forthe installation of control technologies to obtain emissionreductions of sulfur dioxide SO nitrogen oxides NOx andmercury under the Clear Skies Act More innovative controltechnologies and compliance alternatives requiring fewer resourcesthan those considered for this study are likely to be developedwith the implementation of the Clear Skies Act Market basedapproaches reward firms for finding costeffective measures thatexceed emission reduction targets For example improved scrubberperformance and the ability of some firms to switch to lower sulfurfuels under the Acid Rain Program were reasons the cost of thatprogram were less than projected The development of controltechnology alternatives to selective catalytic reduction SCRunder the NOX State Implementation Plan SIP Call is anotherexample of how alternative solutions may require fewer resourcesthan the projected approach In addition to innovativetechnologies the time allowed for installation of significantnumbers of control technologies is an important factor to considerespecially for the near future While it is expected that marketsfor the materials and labor used in the construction and operationof the control technologies will respond to increased demand thisresponse will not be instantaneous It is likely that the strengthof this market response will increase as time progresses It isexpected that the market would have sufficient time to respond tophase II of the program as the more stringent emission targets forphase II are set for  Even though this analysis looks at theresource availability beyond  these projections are of limitedvalue as they do not take into account this market responseHowever it is projected that there are sufficient resourcesavailable to complete the projected control technologyinstallations for phase I by  It should also be noted thatdecreasing the amount of time provided to install controltechnologies to meet a given strategy has the potential to affectthe cost of compliance as this will accelerate theirinstallationThe control technologies considered by this report as candidatesto be used for multipollutant control strategies include limestoneforced oxidation LSFO flue gas desulfurization FGD for thecontrol of SO SCR for the control of NOX and activated carboninjection ACI for the control of mercuryInstallation of LSFO presents a conservatively high estimate ofanticipated resources and time to provide additional control of SOemission since LSFO systems commonly are more resource intensivethan many other FGD technologies Conservatively high assumptionswere made for the time labor reagents and steel needed toinstall FGD systems For LSFO installation timing it is expectedthat one system requires about  months of total effort forplanning engineering installation and startup with connectionsoccurring during normally scheduled outages Multiple retrofits atone plant would take longer to install eg approximately months for theretrofit of three absorbers for six boilers Limestone is thereagent used in LSFO to remove SO from the flue gas stream Steelis the major hardware component for FGD systems and is usedprimarily for the absorber ductwork and supportsOther elements of FGD installations such as constructionequipment requirements are typically modest particularly giventhat systems are installed at the back end of the facility andclose to the ground More recently improvements in technology havebeen implemented where space requirements were an issue forconstruction and accommodating the FGD system including fewer andsmaller absorbers and more efficient onsite use and treatment ofwastes and byproductsSCR is currently the predominant technology to be used for NOXcontrol and is also the most demanding in terms of resources andtime to install when compared to other NOx control technologies Itis expected that one SCR system requires about  months of totaleffort for planning engineering installation and startupMultiple SCR systems at one facility would take longer to installeg approximately  months for seven SCRs Ammonia and ureaare the reagents used along with a catalyst to remove NOX from theflue gas stream Experience in installing SCRs for the NOX SIP Callhas shown that the SCR equipment can be installed on the facilitiesin the space provided In some cases some moving of equipment hasbeen necessary One of the primary pieces of specializedconstruction equipment that can be useful for SCR installations aretall heavylift cranes and these appear to be in adequatesupplyACI was presumed to be the technology that would be used toreduce mercury where dedicated mercury controls were neededPlanning engineering installation and start up of one ACI systemis only about  months Multiple ACI systems at any one facilityare assumed to take longer to install eg approximately months for two ACI ACI hardware is comprised of relatively commonmechanical components and is largely made of steel An ACI systemrequires much less in terms of steel labor or other resources toinstall than either FGD or SCR technology Therefore the impact ofACI hardware on resource demand is much less than that of FGD orSCR technologies for SO or NOX control respectivelyThe resources required for the installation of controltechnologies to achieve the emission reductions under the ClearSkies Act were estimated and compared to their current marketavailability For the Clear Skies Act control technologyinstallations have been looked at for the periods between now and  and   and  and  and  For thefirst period it is assumed that all controls need to be installedin a month period This will provide a conservatively highestimate of the required resources because many of the necessarycontrol installations have already begun For the other fiveyearperiods it is conservatively estimated that all installationswill be completed within three years However the estimatesindicate that there is ample steel and general construction laborto support the installation of these technologies over these timeperiods As noted above projections beyond  are of limitedvalue as market conditions could change significantly between nowand  in response both to demand for resources for amultipollutant program and because of other market factors Skilledlabor requirements specifically for boilermakers were estimatedand have the potential to be the more limiting resource requirementin phase I of the program The demand for boilermaker labor due tothe NOX SIP Call over the next few years is likely to be limitingbut through the implementation of the Clear Skies Act additionalrecruiting and training of new boilermakers would create a strongermarket for skilled labor ultimately increasing the supplyWith regards to reagents and other consumables it is projectedthat there is sufficient supply of limestone for additional FGDsystems It is estimated that there is also enough SCR catalystcapacity to supply this market Ammonia and urea supply is alsoplentiful although it is expected that NOX reduction will cause amoderate increase in US demand Bolstered by the fact that thereis currently a worldwide excess capacity problem for suppliers ofthese globally traded commodity chemicals it is projected thatthere will be an ample supply of ammonia and urea US demand foractivated carbon is expected to slightly increase as a result ofthe Clear Skies Act Activated carbon is traded on a global basisand there is currently substantial excess capacity that can readilyprovide for this increase in demandAcknowledgementsivExecutiveSummaryvList of FiguresxiList ofTablesxiiList ofAcronymsxiiiChapter  BackgroundChapter  SO Control Technology Retrofits SystemHardwareReagents Construction Equipment

electricgenerating units further reductions of emissions of multiplepollutants from electric power sector are being considered Becausethe largest portion of emission reductions are expected to comefrom the coalfired electricitygenerating segment of the electricpower sector this report considers environmental improvement forcoalfired electricity generating power plants Strategies enablingthe control of multiple pollutants multipollutant controlstrategies from these plants have recently been receivingincreased attentionCurrently power plants are required to reduce emissions ofnitrogen oxides NOX and sulfur dioxide SO The revisions ofthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS aimed atreducing haze may require electric utility sources to adoptadditional control measures In addition the US EnvironmentalProtection Agency EPA has determined that the regulation ofmercury emissions from coalfired power plants is appropriate andnecessary Concurrently legislation has been proposed in previousand current Congresses that would require simultaneous reductionsof multiple emissions and the Administrations National EnergyPolicy recommends the establishment of mandatory reduction targetsfor emissions of three main pollutants sulfur dioxide nitrogenoxides and mercuryThe administrations multipollutant proposal a far reachingeffort to decrease power plant emissions was introduced as theClear Skies Act in the US House of Representatives on July  and in the US Senate on July   This legislation isintended to reduce air pollution from electricity generators andimprove air quality throughout the country The Clear Skies Act isdesigned to decrease air pollution by  percent through anemission capandtrade program using a proven marketbasedapproach that could save consumers millions of dollars The ClearSkies Act calls for Decreasing SO emissions by  percent from current emissionsof  million tons to a cap of million tons in  and  million tons in   DecreasingNOx emissions by  percent from current emissions of  milliontons to a cap of million tons in  and to  million tons in  and Decreasing mercury emissions by  percent by implementing thefirstever national cap on mercuryemissions Emissions will be cut from current emissions of tons to a cap of  tons in  and tons in Therefore it is timely to review the engineering and resourcerequirements of installing

SO are examined for existing coalfired electricutility boilers The FGD technology most commonly installed in theUS and worldwide is LSFO Material labor and constructionequipment resource estimates presented in this chapter are for LSFOsystems and are a conservative estimate compared to less resourceintensive magnesium enhanced lime MEL or lime spray dryer LSDtechnologies Typically MEL and LSD technologies rely uponincreased reactivity of reagents with flue gas and require fewerresources for installation Advances in FGD technology designmaterials and expertise available for retrofit installations madeover the last decade form a sharp contrast to earlier retrofitsystems Technology to remove SO is anticipated to continue alongcurrent trends and rely heavily on wet FGD and other advancedtechnologies This chapter examines the experience and issues forthe retrofit installation of LSFO technologyThe chapter focuses on the resources needed for typical ornormally constrained wet FGD specifically LSFO retrofitinstallations Wet FGD retrofit technology generally provides aconservatively high estimate of most resources However it islikely that other SO removal technologies as well as upgrades orenhancements to existing FGD systems will compete in the marketunder a multipollutant strategy Upgrades to existing FGD systemswould include a casebycase examination of the absorber towerflue gas inlet absorber gas velocity reagent preparation upgradepumps and potential changes to some internals the type ofreagent and to the chemical processes to increase performanceScrubber upgrades were not considered in this analysis in order toprovide a conservative estimate of the resource demand for amultipollutant strategy This is because upgrades to existingretrofits will generally consume fewer resources than fullretrofits regardless of the technologyOKN peThe wet FGD process operates by reacting SO in the flue gaswith a reagent in an absorber FGD systems are typically positionedafter the particulate control device FGD retrofits are positioneddownstream typically at the back end of the facility and are notintrusive to the boiler Typical configuration is shown in Figure At the typical unit hot corrosive flue gases leaving theparticulate control device   C are cooled or quenchedbefore entering the main absorber device Quenching cools andsaturates the flue gas with absorber slurry Quenching can occur ina prescrub area or more commonly an area integral to the absorberAfter quenching the less corrosive flue gases entering theabsorber decrease to temperatures of    C with pH valuesbetween  and  Some higher efficiency boilers may haveincreased flue gas velocities and can result in corrosive flue gasblow through to the absorber The chemical reactions that occurwith the limestone reagent form a corrosive environment requiringmany of the system components to be corrosion and abrasionresistant The quenching area is typically a highly corrosiveenvironment and the reagent slurries are highly abrasive Thehandling and processing of the reagent commonly limestone isoften done onsite as is the treatment of the effluent as waste orprocessing into a saleable product eg gypsum handlingfacilityFGDStackDisposalFigure  Gas path for coalfired boiler with FGDThe major systems and components of a wet FGD limestone reagentsystem includeReagent Feed Limestone conveying and crushing egball mills equipment Slurry preparation tank and reagent feed equipmentSO  Removal Absorber tower or reactor tray optional Absorber slurry recirculationreaction tank and optionalair sparger forced oxidation operation Mist eliminator wash system Slurry bleed Pipes pumps and valves Gas reheatersFlue Gas Handling Ductwork Support steel Fans blowers and dampersWasteByProduct Dewatering system settling tanksvesselshydrocyclones andor vacuum filters Stacking equipmentMajor wet FGD system components are shown in Figure  Thehardware and equipment to support wet FGD technology involves fivemajor systems Two systems are primarily responsible for the directscrubbing and handling of flue gases and three systems areinvolved with delivery of reagents processing of wastes airsolids and water and the processing of wastes into saleablebyproducts Typically the greatest hardware requirements involvethe systems for SO removal primarily the absorber vessel andflue gas handling particularly ductwork and support steel Much ofthe equipment for these systems will be unique to the site andproject requirements although the equipmentspecifications may be repeated if multiple absorbers areinvolved Typically an FGD retrofit can use an existing chimney orstackThe material used in the largest quantity for an FGD retrofitaside from reagent is steel In general the amount of structuralsteel for a typical FGD retrofit system is equal to or less thanthe steel requirements for a SCR retrofit of the same size Thereduced requirement for structural steel is due to the FGD absorberusually being selfsupporting weighing less and being installedcloser to the ground In contrast a typical SCR installation isheavier elevated and adjacent to the boiler The majority ofstructural steel in modern FGD installations is dedicated toductwork and supports Other steel may be needed to reinforceexisting steel at a facility In addition to structural steeladditional light or gallery steel may be used in the limestonepreparation area and for the processing of waste or byproductseg buildings Modern FGD systems are more attuned to thecorrosive SO scrubbing environment and therefore increasinglyutilize fiberglass rubber lined steel and alloys in constructionIn addition because of existence of corrosive zones preference isoften given to the use of largesized sheets that minimizewelding Largesized sheets are used to fabricate the absorbervessel the ductwork and supports Particularly over the pastdecade there has been greater availability of plate steel for FGDprojects due to the global sourcing of carbon steelTotal steel requirements for retrofitting a typical  megaWatt electric MWe FGD system are in the range of  to tons of steel or between  and  tons of steel per MWe Thisrange assumes approximately  percent of the structural steel isfor ductwork and supports and  percent is required formiscellaneous steel such as reagent conveying equipment buildingsand solids handling systems An assumption of  tons of steel isa conservatively high estimate since  MWe FGD retrofitinstallations have been completed with as little as  to  tonsof steel or  tons of steel per MWe Often a single absorberwill serve multiple boilers and reduce much of the steel that wouldbe required if absorbers had been fed by individual boilersCurrently the installed maximum single absorber capacity in theUS is  MWe being fed by  boilers at Tampa Electrics Big BendStation It is likely that two  MWe boiler units will use acommon single absorber with commensurate reduction in requiredsteel from efficiencies gained by common areas For example a MWe system is estimated to use approximately  tons of steel orabout  tons of steel per MWe rather than a combined maximum of tons for a situation in which the boilers required separateabsorbersIn general a better understanding of the chemical processes inan FGD system allows designers to maximize mass transfer in aminimum amount of space More efficient designs can also reducethe amount of steel needed for the absorber and ductwork Otheradvanced design factors reduce steel requirements including thevirtual elimination of redundant absorbers the ability todownsize absorbers without sacrificing performance eg byincreasing flue gas velocity advanced placement of spray nozzlesenhancing limestone characteristics and material changesincluding wallpapering with alloys and utilizing fiberglass A newgeneration of wet FGD systems pioneered in the mid to late simproved mass transfer which resulted in the usage of more compactabsorbers that are estimated to require  percent less materialcompared to an older generation of wet FGD systems In additiontypical MEL absorber units need less steel due to the use ofsmaller absorbers enabled by shorter residence time requirementsthan for LFSO systemsIn this report the estimate of typicalLFSO FGD system hardware requirements provides a conservativelyhigh estimate of installation resources compared to other SOcontrol technologiesThe majority of hardware required for FGD systems is commonlyavailable Storage tanks nozzles and piping for the reagentstorage and delivery system are also common and therefore widelyavailable The major hardware for an FGD system includes the fluegas duct system limestone storage including loading and conveyerequipment gypsum dewatering and wastewater treatment gypsumstorage piping valves pumps and tanks electricity supplycontrols instrumentation pipe bridges and cable channels andfoundations and buildings as needed FGD systems also includehardware such as inlet fans dampers absorber internalsrecirculation pumps and oxidation blowers that are commonly usedin other large industries Because this hardware is usedextensively throughout industry availability should not be anissue except that supply of this type of equipment needs to beintegrated into the overall project schedule so it does not causebottlenecks Early FGD systems were designed with separatequenching or prescrubber systems to cool the flue gas coming offthe particulate control device Modern systems take the hot fluegas directly into the absorber where quenching occurs Limestoneand gypsum handling also includes milling conveying andwastewater treatment systemsOKO oWet FGD systems require a continuous feed of reagent to removeSO Generally if pH of scrubbing liquor falls below a range of to  additional reagent is required to maintain thereactivity of the absorbent Limestone is the most commonly usedreagent with the quantity of its consumption depending primarilyon coal sulfur levels For example even in the range of  percentto  percent coalsulfur levels a  percent sulfur coal can increase consumptionby about onethird It is not uncommon for modern FGD systems toachieve  percent utilization of limestone Generally higherpercent utilization equates to higher reactivity of the reagentand therefore less reagent is needed to achieve a given level ofSO removal The production of gypsum requires a minimum of percent limestone utilizationA  MWe plant uses roughly  tons per hour of limestone Acoal with  percent sulfur conservatively will require  tonsof limestone per hour or  tons per MWe per hour Thisestimate is based on an  percent load factor  BtukWhstoichiometry of  for limestone SO removal rate of  percentand a minimum purity of  percent for CaCO Any enhancement ofthe reagent ie magnesium or buffering agents will reduce theamount of limestone needed MEL sorbent consumption for a  percentsulfur coal is approximately  tons per hour These estimatesare conservatively high given that recent FGD systems are operatingat near stoichiometric levels and additives are commonly used toachieve higher SO removal particularly to enhance the performanceof existing retrofits Limestone stoichiometry is the number ofmoles of Ca added per mole of SO removed Typically the requiredstoichiometry of a wet FGD limestone system is in the range of to  with  to  typical for modern wet FGD systems Astoichiometry of  is typical when the FGD process is producinggypsum byproduct while a stoichiometry of  is needed toproduce waste suitable for a landfill Grinding limestone to anultrafine particle size improves dissolution rate of limestone inthe slurry and can decrease the size requirement of the reactiontankOKP bThe construction equipment required for typical FGDinstallations is standard construction equipment  weldersexcavation equipment concrete pouring equipment cranes etcCrane requirements for FGD technology retrofits are generally sitespecific although these requirements are generally less demandingthan requirements for SCR retrofits Generally FGD systems tend tobe constructed closer to the ground compared to SCR technologyretrofits Lift at a site rarely exceeds  meters  feet and tons The use of modular and fabricated absorbers shifts muchof the construction offsite reducing the need for specializedcranes and equipment The usefulness and appropriateness of usingcranes in an FGD installation is dependent on several factorsincluding the ability to physically place a crane on site oradjacent to the site eg on a barge and the use of modularconstruction of major FGD technology components Prefabrication hasbeen used since the early s notably on two large retrofitprojects the  MWe Zimmer Station and the  MWe Gavinstation Both facilities had limited laydown area to perform theretrofit installation In these two retrofits the absorber moduleswere fabricated in two pieces shipped by barge and assembled onsite Often modular units can be transported via barges or trucksto the site for assembly Component modularization andprefabrication offsite can reduce the amount of time cranes areneeded on a site as well as provide opportunities to reduceproject schedules and construction costs and to concentrate jobslocally at the prefabrication facilityOKQ fqImplementation of an SO control technology at a plant involvesseveral activities contingent upon each other These activities maybe grouped under the following phases of an implementation project EPA cost modeling for wet scrubber installations estimate tons of limestone required to achieve  percent SO removal whileburning a  percent sulfur coalconducting an engineering review of the facility and awarding aprocurement contract  obtaining a construction permit installing the control technology and  obtaining an operatingpermitModular construction can minimize field labor and constructiontime on a site by prefabricating at a shop and then transportinglarge sections such as ductwork or absorber modules by barge ortruck For example the  MWe boiler at Kansas City Power Light Companys Hawthorne Generating Station required rebuild andNOX SO and PM simultaneous control retrofits To expediteplacing the facility back into use large sections were fabricatedoff site and transported by barge to the site Shop fabrication hasalso been used outside of the US For example ten absorbermodules handling a combined capacities of  MWe and  MWe attwo facilities were installed during December  order placedthrough March  The ten absorbers were mostly installedsequentially with startup of the units staggered over  monthsThe  MWe FGD systems at the Taean facility in South Korea werefabricated offsite in three modules shipped by barge and thenassembled onsiteFGD installation plans and experience have been extensive in theUS and abroad To date there have been approximately  GWe ofscrubber capacity built on coalfired power plants in the US Over GWe of capacity has been built worldwideExhibits A and A in Appendix A depict the timelines typicalto complete a single absorber module and a three absorbermoduleinstallation of FGD respectively The three absorbermoduleinstallation assumes each absorber module can treat up to  MWeof boiler capacity Currently approximately  MWe of singleabsorber capacity has been successfully installed in the USHowever greater absorber capacities are being offered outside ofthe US While the sum of the time estimated to completeindividual tasks generally exceeds the overall estimatedinstallation time the overall installation schedule accounts foroverlap in these tasks These timelines also indicate thatcompletion of some of the activities is contingent upon completionof some other activities In general the FGD implementationschedule appears to be driven primarily by the prehookupconstruction activities Multiple absorber installations willtypically add a few months to the implementation scheduleparticularly to connect additional absorbers during scheduledoutages Prefabrication of absorber modules can reduce the overallconstruction schedule The major phases of the implementationschedule are discussed belowboAs shown in Exhibits A and A in Appendix A in the firstphase of technology implementation an engineering review andassessment of the combustion unit is conducted to determine thepreferred compliance alternative During this phase thespecifications of the control technology are determined and bidsare requested from the vendors After negotiating the bids acontract for implementing the SO control technology is awardedThe time necessary to complete this phase is approximately fourmonthsmBefore the actual construction to install the technology cancommence the facility must receive a construction permit from theapplicable State or local regulatory authority The constructionpermit process requires that the facility prepare and submit thepermit application to the applicable State or local regulatoryagency The State or local regulatory agency then reviews theapplication and issues a draft approval This review and approvalprocess is estimated to take about six months The draftconstruction permit is then made available for public commentAfter any necessary revisions a final construction permit isissued The estimated time to obtain the construction permit isapproximatelynine months but can vary with State and localpermitting procedures as well as other interests in theprojectqfIn the second phase the control technology is installed Thisinstallation includes designing fabricating and installing thecontrol technology In addition compliance testing of the controltechnology is completed in this phase Since FGD technology is notinvasive to the boiler most of the construction activities suchas earthwork foundations process electrical and control tieinsto existing items can occur while the boiler is in operation Thetime needed to complete this phase of an implementation project isabout  monthsAn important element of the overall control technologyimplementation is the time needed to connect or hook up thecontrol technology equipment particularly in relationship to theplanned outage time for the unit On average it takes about fourto seven weeks to connect FGD  For example the Homer City andCentralia facility FGD retrofit connections were performed duringthe scheduled outages in approximately five weeks Based onexperience in Germany in response to a compliance directive asignificant quantity of SO and NOX control installations wereperformed within outage periods consisting of less than fourweeks Electricity generating facilities often plan theconnection to occur during planned outages to avoid additionaldowntime Additional downtime leading to loss of a unitsavailability to supply electricity is atypical for FGD technologyinstallations Because peak electricity demand generally occursduring the summer months May through September typically controlconnections occur during months of other seasons notably thespring or fall For example FGD connections to the two Centraliaunits were performed outside of the peak electricity demand periodSources located where peak demand does not occur during the summermonths may be less timeconstrained to connect the FGD controlsHowever FGD connections for single and multiple systems cantypically be performed during planned outage times Multiplesystems normally are installed in sequence and overlapping tomaintain a high level of activity at the site Installation of thecontrol device hookup on a sequential basis usually involves anoverlap of compliance testing of FGD system on one unit with hookupof an FGD system with the next unit The total implementation timefor sequential hookup for multiple systems is estimated at between months for two absorber modules and  months for three absorbermodules Although not as common multiple systems installed at asingle facility can be performed simultaneously Generallyscheduled outages will govern which method can be used for multipleFGD system installationslmFacilities will also need to modify their Title V operatingpermit to incorporate the added control devices and the associatedreduced emission limits In some States an interim airoperatingpermit may need to be obtained until the Title V permit ismodified The operating permit modification process consists ofpreparation and submission of the application to the applicableState or local regulatory agency This process can occursimultaneously with the processing of the construction permitapplication The process of transitioning from the constructionpermit to the operating permit varies among States but theapplication review process is estimated to take between   months The Title V operating permit must also be made availablefor public comment The Title V operating permit is then not madefinal until compliance testing on the control device is completedTherefore the total estimated time to modify the Title V operatingpermit is about  months plus the additional time to completecompliance testingBased on the estimated time periods needed to complete each ofthe four phases described above the estimated time period tocomplete the implementation of a single FGD installation isconservatively  months For the Clear Skies Act EPAsprojections reflect that the majority of FGD installations willinvolve a single absorber unit installation per plant however themaximum projected number of scrubbers retrofitted at any facilityis three absorber modules serving six boilers with a maximum ofMWe of boiler capacity Changes in FGD technology andreliability have resulted in planning for smaller and fewerabsorbers per retrofit installation For example the Zimmer andGavin station FGD retrofits performed in the early s bothinvolve three absorbers on each  MWe unit If these retrofitswere being planned today these stations two  MWe units wouldlikely require only two absorbers per unit rather than threeAverage FGD installation times have commonly been within months For example recent FGD retrofit systems installed at HomerCity September  and Centralia July  were both completedwithin approximately  months Although these FGD systeminstallations are considered typical the Homer City FGD retrofitinstallation was performed during the same time frame as theinstallation of three SCR units Both of these units provide morerecent insight into the ability and scheduling to install FGDsystems during a period of high demand for SCR installationsOne factor that can increase the time to install a scrubber iscompetition for resources with other emission control projectsDuring the first time period analyzed through the end of EPA projects that a large number of SCRs will be installed to meetthe requirements of the NOX SIP Call However SCR installationsdesigned to comply with the NOX SIP Call are generally already intothe installation process or at a minimum into the engineeringphase of the project Furthermore construction has already begunor been completed for  GWe of the scrubbers that EPA projects willbe built by  under current regulatory requirements Typicallythe overall engineering fabrication and construction resourceswould remain the same as the scenario analyzed above with theexception that these resources are reallocated over an extendedschedule One estimate is that as demand for installationresources increase for FGD and other air pollution controlinstallations planned FGD retrofit installations could be between and  months while another source estimates FGD installationsat  months It should be noted however that some recentcontracts have been signed to install scrubbers between now and that would be installed in less than  months For instancea contract to install a scrubber on a  MWe unit at the ColemanStation in Kentucky is scheduled to be completed in early approximately  months after the contract was announced which isseveral months shorter than the installation schedule set forth inExhibit A This suggests that labor demands to install SCRs forthe NOX SIP Call may not lead to increased installation time forscrubbersSingleunit FGD installations have occurred in as little as months and multiple FGD systems have been installed within months In addition owners of new or greenfield powergeneration facilities often request  months for completion ofthese projects including installation of the boiler FGD systemand SCR Primarily as a cost cutting option more relaxedinstallation schedules of up to  months for a single FGD retrofitinstallation may be planned but are not common Despite changes inoverall installation schedules efficient utilization of labor andsequencing the installation during planned outages will continue tobe planning issues In summary the total time needed to completethe design installation and testing at a typical  MWe facilitywith one FGD unit is  months  months at a facility with twoboilers being served by a single absorber module and approximately months at a facility with three absorber modules six boilerunits For the multiple installation of three absorber modules atone plant six boiler units an additional four months may beneeded to schedule the outage for the FGD hookup outside of thehigh electricity demand months Typically multiple absorbers willbe installed sequentially with some overlap to conserve andschedule continuous use of labor as well as keep associatedinstallation costs downOKR iThe installation of an FGD system requires a significant amountof labor Approximately  percent of the labor is for constructionof the system and   percent of the labor is for engineeringand project management The installation of the FGD controltechnologies may require the following types of labor general construction workers for site preparation and storagefacility installation skilled metal workers for specialized hardware andor othermaterial assembly and construction other skilled workers such as electricians pipe fittersmillwrights painters and truck drivers and unskilled labor to assist with hauling of materials andcleanupA typical turnkey  MWe unit FGD system retrofit requiresmanhours or approximately  personyears of which percent or  manhours are dedicated to engineering andproject management and roughly  percent of manhours are forboilermakers The labor required to install an absorber vesseland ductwork is a major portion of the system installationmanhours Generally construction labor is proportional to theamount of steel used in the system The greatest labor requirementoccurs for FGD on a single unit ie  MWe and additionalefficiencies in incremental labor occur when scheduling multipleunits at one facility particularly when combining multiple boilersinto a single absorber In general large numbers of boilermakershave been used in this industry however it is not expected thatthis demand will impact other industries A more thoroughdiscussion of boilermaker labor demand is given in Chapter There are some efficiencies that result when multiple systemsare installed at one site In engineering alone there is a percent savings in engineering and project management laborcommonly realized when installing multiple units of similar designIn addition other increases in project management and laborproductivity and efficiencies in using resources and equipment canoccur with multiple system installations on one site Whilemultiple systems on one site are common the number of requiredsystems to serve large MWe of capacity has been decreasing Forexample in the past FGD systems for  MWe stations includedsix absorbers however today these systems would likely bedesigned for four absorber systems or approximately  MWe ofboiler capacity per absorber Using the methodology described for MWe of capacity today a sixabsorber system could serve asmuch as  MWe of capacity or more than double the capacityserved in installations in the early sA reasonable estimate of multiple FGD installations at one siteincludes  manhours for the initial  MWe of capacity or manhoursMWe and an additional  manhours per MWe up to atotal of  MWe for any combination into a single commonabsorber Therefore a  MWe system requires the initial  MWeat  manhours and the second  MWe at about  fora combined labor requirement of  manhours or approximately personyears or the equivalent of about  manhours per MWeAs another example a  MWe system retrofit using   MWeturnkey systems requires  manhours or only  manhoursper MWe Generally extending FGD installation schedules mayreduce the number of persons on a job at one time but will notreduce the overall labor requirementWhile it is likely that installation of multiple systems willbenefit from economies of scale to reduce labor requirements therange for manhours per MWe for multiple systems is bounded by and  manhours per MWe It is also clear that boiler capacitiesof at least  MWe can be served by a common absorber and aminimum  percent reduction in engineering and project managementlabor will result from multiple absorbers being installed at asingle site For example procurement contracts only need to benegotiated once and common site issues need only be addressedonce Therefore manhours is a conservative estimate of labor requiredto install FGD at a  MWe facility Because no additionalefficiencies in engineering and project management are assumed forlarger installations multiple  MWe absorber systems each addanother  manhours A  MWe facility requiresapproximately  manhours for the retrofit installationThis produces a conservatively high estimate bounding theuncertainties of labor and how many boilers or units will becombined into a single absorberThe above estimates of labor are conservative particularly givenefficiencies realized in recent retrofit installations In manycases portions of retrofit construction can be performed offsiteparticularly with modular designs For example at the Gavinscrubber retrofit installation the absorber modules were fabricatedat the vendors shop and then shipped by barge to the site forhookup To take advantage of offsite fabrication requires that ashop and facility are available and collocated with an adequateshipping and transport facilities ie water accessible facilityand a barge When the requirements are met the fabrication has thepotential to employ and retain a skilled work force as well asopportunity to save time and reduce field labor requirementsBased upon the discussion from sections  through  thetotal resources needed for a single  MWe FGD retrofit andmultiple FGD retrofits are shown in Table OKS poGenerally acre onsite will allow the installation of an FGDretrofit The need for additional space for support systems rangesfrom no additional space needed to  acres typical for upfrontreagent processing and  acre for dewatering when reagentprocessing and dewatering operations are selected as part of theFGD system design Space issues also include the positioning of theFGD after the particulate control device and before the stack Thisarea of the power unit is generally referred to as the backend an area where there is typically ample space for retrofitinstallationsThe FGD retrofit on the Cinergys Gibson Unit  is an example ofan extremely space limited retrofit Gibson Unit  is a  MWeinhibited oxidation limestone FGD retrofit designed for  percentSO removal and completed in late  In the case of thisscrubber retrofit the congestion at the site did not allow for aclean pick by a standard sized crane With upfront planning onemodule was raised by less conventional means jackingconstruction allowing for the second module to be constructedusing more conventional methods Because of the difficulty due tocongestion of the site this retrofit required additional time andlabor but worked within space constraints This method of jackingconstruction has been used in other retrofits The wet FGD retrofitat the Bailly Generating Station Units    is an examplewhere a full service system single limestone absorber for combined MWe capacity  percent sulfur coal  percent SOremoval was able to significantly reduce space requirements whilealso decreasing cost by about onehalf and creating no new wastestreams Much of the success of this publicprivate projectDOEoperator and vendors was due to a more compact andmultifunctional prequenching absorption and oxidationabsorber vessel that used a cocurrent flow design As a resultthe FGD system required only modest space requirements In mostlocations connection space is not a problem since there is usuallyadequate space behind the flue gas stack to perform the scrubberretrofit If connection space is limited additional ductwork maybe

the needfor redundant absorbers have decreased the footprint needed for amodern FGD retrofit installation Where space for the FGDinstallation is an issue reducing the overall absorber size can beaccomplished by using multiple absorber trays within one absorberand improving mass transfer with the use of a fan Improvedabsorption at higher velocities has contributed to smaller morecompact absorbers For example designers are continually improvingabsorber efficiencies by increasing absorber gas velocities in therange of  ms  feets and greater Velocities of  ms feets have been demonstrated By contrast earlier systemsdesign capacities were based on absorber flue gas velocities of ms feets In addition to smaller absorbers single absorberscommonly serve multiple boilers reducing the overall footprint ofthe FGD retrofit To date a single absorber has been successfullyinstalled to serve up to  MWe of capacity in the US while evenlarger absorber modules ie  MWe and greater are now beingoffered for purchase overseasSpace for an FGD installation may also include areas for reagentprocessing and treatment of the waste or byproduct Completelimestone processing delivery crushing slurry preparationreagent feed equipment etc requires as much as  to  acreshowever this space is a onetime requirement and does not increasewith increasing FGD capacity being served Conservatively whenonsite reagent processing is selected an additional  acres foran entire facility will be sufficient While limestone processingcan be performed at the facility purchased powdered limestone isan option that also reduces or eliminates the requirement foronsite reagent preparation and other equipment as well as thespace these processes would occupy Ultrafine limestone has beendemonstrated as an optional enhancement over typical limestonereagent feed In areas where the ability to deliver limestone ona continuous basis during winter months may be limited storage oflimestone may be needed For example a day supply of limestoneto feed a  MWe FGD system  percent control efficiency percent capacity  percent sulfur coal will require approximately by  m  by  foot storage area to handle approximately tons of limestoneTraditionally FGD systems have produced a solid waste productthat can be sent to a landfill or an increasingly attractivealternative is to treat the byproduct for the manufacture and saleof gypsum If dewatering is required typically acre will beneeded for an entire facility regardless of the amount of FGDcapacity being served One approach to improving sorbentutilization is recycling the spent sorbent for multiple exposure tothe SO in the flue gas The result is less unreacted sorbent andsmaller quantities of end product Improved performance andalternative reagents are becoming common By the mids atleast one FGD vendor was supplying a system that took advantage ofa water treatment systems precipitated calcium and magnesiumcarbonates that produced a high quality fine calcium and magnesiumcarbonate FGD reagent In addition to reducing the facilitysdependence on limestone this process also reduced equipmentrequired for limestone handling and millingMore efficient use of water in modern systems has almostcompletely removed the need for dewatering and containment pondsTypically purge streams are used if the wastewater contains highlevels of chlorides However usually water is either evaporatedfrom the system or remains in the byproduct or waste Techniquesfor wastewater minimization or elimination are commonly availableFor example many FGD systems repeatedly cycle the cooling towerblowdown before being treated in the wastewater system As aresult the wastewater has a high solids content as well as highalkalinity for improved performance Since large amounts of waterare evaporated during this cycling this method also benefits fromreduced effluent that requires treatment by a wastewatersystemWhile water treatment of FGD effluent was once a concerncontemporary FGD systems are much more effective in limitingproduction of waste water and can achieve zero or nearzerowastewater discharge Many of the wastewater advances being usedoutside of the US including conserving blowdown in the absorbervessel primarily for chloride control are now being used orconsidered in the US For example the  MWe Hunter Unit operated by PacifiCorp installed a wet FGD limestone reagentsystem in  and by use of mechanical draft cooling towers theplant is zerodischarge for waste water The FGD system operates at lb SOMMBtu and is designed for  percent SO removal Anadditional example of zero wastewater discharge is the  MWeCraig Units    installed  that are designed for percent SO removal and also employ limestone reagent andmechanical draft cooling towersPkluqoIn this chapter retrofit of SCR will be assessed for coalfiredelectric utility boilers that would be affected by a multipollutantregulation SCR is the NOX control technology that is expected tohave the greatest impact on future utility boiler NOX emissions andis the most difficult NOX control technology to install It istherefore the most important NOX control technology to understandfrom both a NOX reduction and resource requirement perspectivePKN peThe SCR process operates by reacting ammonia with NOX in theexhaust gas in the presence of a catalyst at temperatures of around to  C For most applications this temperature range makesit necessary to locate the SCR reactor adjacent to the boiler immediately after the boiler and before the air preheater as shownin Figure  An infrequently used alternative approach is tolocate the SCR after the FGD This approach however increasesoperating costs as it requires additional heating of the gas Bylocating the SCR reactor as in Figure  it is often necessary toinstall the catalyst reactor in an elevated location which mayresult in a structure hundreds of feet tall Figure  shows theconfiguration of the SCR that was retrofit onto AES SomersetStation a  MWe boiler already equipped with an electrostaticprecipitator ESP and wet FGD system In this common installationthe SCR reactor is installed on structural steel that elevates itabove existing ductwork and the ESP designated precipitator inthe Figure  In the lower right corner of Figure  an imageof a person provides a perspective of the size of the SCRinstallationFigure  Gas path for coalfired boiler with SCR ESP andFGDThe SCR system reduces NOX through a reaction of ammonia and NOXin the presence of oxygen and acatalyst at temperatures around  to  C  to F The products of this reaction are watervapor and nitrogen The catalyst is mounted inside anexpanded section of ductwork and is configuredfor the gas to pass through it as in Figure The major components of an SCR system include Ammonia or urea storage Ammonia vaporization system if aqueous ammonia is used Urea to ammonia converter if urea is used Ammonia or urea metering and controls Dilution air blowers Ammonia injection grid Catalyst Catalyst reactor ductwork and support steel Catalyst cleaning devices soot blowers sonic horns etc InstrumentationExcept for the catalyst most of the materialequipment used toassemble an SCR system is either standard mechanical and electricalcomponents pumps blowers valves piping heaters pressurevessels temperature and pressure sensors etc or is largelymanufactured for other power plant applications and has beenadopted for use in SCR systems cleaning devices such as sootblowers or sonic horns gas analyzers etc The catalysthowever is a specialized product designed specifically for thispurposeThe catalyst is typically a ceramic material that in mostcases is either extruded into a ceramic honeycomb structure or iscoated onto plates as shown in Figure  The catalyst isassembled into modules at the factory The modules are shipped tothe site and installed into the SCR reactor in layers Each layerof catalyst is comprised of several individual modules that areinstalled sidebysideThe material used in the largest quantity aside from a catalystor reagent is steel The amount of steel required for an SCR inthe range of  MWe is about  to  tons or about to  tons per MWe About  tons of steel is necessary forretrofit of two  MWe units  MWe total or about tons per MWe The steel used for an SCR includes large structuralmembers plates and sheets These steel pieces are used tofabricate the catalyst reactor the ductwork and the supportsteel There is typically less of a requirement for corrosiveresistant alloys for an SCR installation when compared to ascrubber installation Steel is also needed for boilermodifications In this case large pieces of steam piping or otherlarge steel boiler components may need to be replaced The catalystreactor is often fabricated onsite Sections of the catalystreactor and ductwork may be fabricated offsite and shipped inpieces to the site for final assembly or they may be fabricatedonsite into subassemblies and lifted into place duringerectionIf more than one boiler at a facility is to be retrofit withSCR then some but not all equipment can be made common Forexample it may be possible and is probably preferable to have acommon ammoniaor urea storage facility Reagent storage is probably the onlymajor equipment item that lends itself to sharing between adjacentboilers Therefore there is some gained efficiency in the use ofequipment at a site with multiple units However this gain inefficiency is generally small compared to the total project Themajor synergy will be in construction equipment and in labor aswill be discussed in Sections  and  respectivelyPKO oAn SCR system requires an initial and ongoing supply ofcatalyst It also requires reagent The reagent can be ammonia orurea Most facilities to date have used ammonia however urea isbecoming an increasingly popular reagent due to its inherent safetyand the recent availability of systems to convert urea to ammoniaonsiteThe amount of catalyst required for an SCR system is directlyproportional to the capacity or gas flowrate of the facility ifall other variables are equal The actual amount of catalyst forany specific plant depends upon several parameters in particularthe amount per MWe measured in m per MWe for a given level ofreduction and lifetime will fall within a general range Thereforeit is possible to make an estimate of how much catalyst would benecessary to retrofit a particular facility or a large number offacilities if the total capacity is known It is assumed that mostSCR systems to be retrofit onto electric utility boilers will bedesigned for about  percent reduction For most boilers thislevel of reduction may initially require about  to  m ofcatalyst for each MWe of coalfired boiler capacity Forexample a  MWe plant would be expected to have about  to m of catalyst The amount of catalyst for a particular situationwill vary somewhat depending on the catalyst supplier and thedifficulty of the application At the  MWe AES Somerset Boiler percent NOX reduction was achieved with SCR using  m ofplate catalyst or about  m per MWe This unit fires percent sulfur coal At each of the  and  MWe Montour Units  m of ceramic catalyst were used or about  mper MWe This unit fires  percent sulfur coal that can havearsenic levels as high as  ppm limestone injection is used toreduce gaseous arsenic concentration in the furnace The amount ofcatalyst will tend to be lower in situations that are lesschallenging such as with lower sulfur coals or situations expectedto have lower gaseous arsenic concentration gaseous arsenic is acatalyst poison that originates in the coal it will reduce thelifetime of the SCR catalyst Hence less than  m per MWe maybe sufficient in some casesThe catalyst is typically loaded in three or more layers Thispermits replacement of sections of the catalyst as activity isreduced The advantage of this approach is that it permits loweroverall catalyst usage over the economic lifetime of the plantNormally room for an extra layer is provided so a fourth layercan be added if necessary At the first catalyst additiontypically after about  operating hours the fourth layerwill be filled or half filled Once the SCR reactor is full layersof catalyst are replaced after catalyst activity drops to a minimumlevel At the first catalyst replacement new catalyst will replacethe original first layer at the next catalyst replacement newcatalyst will replace the original second layer and so on EPAmodeling projections conservatively assumed that one layer ofcatalyst is replaced for every    hours of operationfor coalfired units Therefore after the initial installationthere is a need to replace roughly one fourth of the total catalystreactor volume every   months or so  or conservatively about of the installed volume should be replaced each year for thecoalfired installationsThe catalyst may also be regenerated rather than replacedThis will reduce the amount of new catalyst that must be purchasedHowever due to the limited experience with this method it will beassumed that the catalyst is replaced according to the catalystmanagement plano The amount of reagent consumed in the SCR process isdirectly proportional to the amount of NOX reduced Althoughammonia is the chemical that actually participates in the chemicalreaction some suppliers have developed equipment to convert ureato ammonia onsite According to one supplier of ureatoammoniaconverters each mole of urea within the conversion system isconverted to two moles of ammonia For example reducing onepound of NOX will require roughly  kg of ammonia or about kg of urea This includes a  percent increase in reagentdemand due to ammonia slip and a five percent increase to accountfor a small amount of nitrogen dioxide NO in the flue gasTherefore for any given plant size the amount of catalyst andreagent consumption can be estimated For a  MWe plant reducingNOX from  lbMMBtu to  lbMMBtu and  percent capacityfactor this is conservatively high for most coal boilersapproximately  tonsyr of ammonia anhydrous equivalent orabout  tonsyr of urea as  percent urea would be neededThe same  MWe plant would have around  m of catalystwith roughly  m replaced about every three years This isif a third of the initial catalyst loading must be replaced onaverage every  to  operating hours then  to cubic meters per MWe per  hours must be replacedPKP bConstruction equipment needed for installation of an SCRincludes standard construction equipment  welders excavationequipment concrete pouring equipment cranes etc In some casesinstallers may use tallspan heavylift cranes These cranes arecapable of lifting heavy loads as much as  tons or moreseveral hundred feet The advantage of this crane type is realizedwhen lifting assembled sections of catalyst reactor or other largepieces high off the ground If lower capacity cranes are usedsmaller pieces must be lifted which means that lessprefabrication is possible and more assembly must be done inplace Less prefabrication could lengthen the necessary boileroutage somewhat Although the availability of the largest cranes isreported to about  or more about  new cranes can be suppliedevery six months It has been reported that in some cases ithas been necessary to go further away from the plant to sourcecranes with adequate lift and reach capacity In other casesengineers found that by changing the designfabrication method tomeet the available crane the project could be managed with lowercapacity cranes lifting smaller pieces If more than oneboiler is retrofit at one facility then the crane can be used forboth boilers saving cost and time when compared to boilersretrofit separately It is important to note that in many cases theerection method is not limited by the available crane but islimited by the access to the plant For example can large sectionsbe delivered by barge rail or roadway and by the availablelaydown area for material and construction equipment on site Atmany facilities there is inadequate area to prefabricate largesections In some instances transportation routes to the facilitydo not permit transporting large preassembled equipment to thesite In such cases it will not be possible to do muchpreassembly and a smaller less expensive crane may be adequateAs a result the type of crane that is best for a particular SCRinstallation frequently is not the largest crane available Thecrane selected for a project will be determined as part of anoverall construction plan developed to optimize all of theavailable resources  labor material and equipment  for aparticular projectThe need to lift material to high elevations is a result of thelocation of the SCR  often above existing ductwork and adjacent toexisting equipment Figure  provided one good example of thisIt may be necessary to move existing equipment such as the airpreheater in order to accommodate the addition of the SCR reactorAs a result every retrofit is a custom fit However engineershave been very innovative when installing these systems even onfacilities that apparently had little room available for the SCRHence the physical size of the technology has not beenlimitingPKQ fqImplementation of a NOX control technology at a plant involvesseveral activities contingent upon each other These activities maybe grouped under the following phases of an implementation project conducting an engineering review of the facility and awarding aprocurement contract  obtaining a construction permit installing the control technology and  obtaining an operatingpermitExhibit A in Appendix A depicts the timeline expected forcompleting a single unit installation of SCR Completion of some ofthe activities is contingent upon completion of some otheractivities For example construction activities cannot commenceuntil a construction permit is obtained In general the SCRimplementation timeline appears to be driven primarily by theengineering activities ie design fabrication andconstructionboAs shown in Exhibit A in Appendix A an engineering review andassessment of the combustion unit is conducted in the first phaseof technology implementation to determine the preferred compliancealternative During this phase the specifications of the controltechnology are determined and bids are requested from the vendorsAfter negotiating the bids a contract for implementing the NOXcontrol technology is awarded The time necessary to complete thisphase is approximately four months for SCRmBefore the actual construction to install the technology cancommence the facility must receive a construction permit from theapplicable state or local regulatory authority The constructionpermit process requires that the facility prepare and submit thepermit application to the applicable state or local regulatoryagency The state or local regulatory agency then reviews theapplication and issues a draft approval This review and approvalprocess is estimated to take about six months The draftconstruction permit is then made available for public commentAfter any necessary revisions a final construction permit isissued The actual time needed will depend on the size andcomplexity of the project and the local procedures for issuing apermit Exhibit A in Appendix A shows that nine months areallowed for the construction permit This is expected to be ampletime In one case only about  months were needed for obtainingthe construction permit and only six months were needed toobtain the construction permit for retrofit of two  MWe boilersin another case Shorter periods for construction permitauthorization would allow earlier commencement of constructionactivities and could potentially shorten the overall scheduleqfIn the second phase the control technology is installed Thisinstallation includes designing fabricating and installing thecontrol technology In addition compliance testing of the controltechnology is also completed in this phase Most of theconstruction activities such as earthwork foundationsprocesselectrical and control tieins to existing items can occurwhile the boiler is in operation The time needed to complete thisphase of an implementation project is about  months for SCRAn important element of the overall control technologyimplementation is the time needed to connect or hook up thecontrol technology equipment to the combustion unit because theboiler typically must be shut down for this period SCR connectioncan occur in a three to five week outage period In some caseslonger outages are needed When Babcock  Wilcox retrofittedthe  MWe AES Somerset boiler the outage began on May  andthe boiler was returned to service on June   about a sixweekoutage One major SCR system supplier in the US stated thatthey would want in the range of one to two months of boiler downtime and have never required more than two months Difficulty isincreased as the extent of boiler modifications necessary to fitthe SCR into the facility is increased A German SCR systemsupplier installed SCR on a significant portion of the Germancapacity within outage periods consisting of less than fourweeks Based upon outages in this time range for SCR connectionelectricitygenerating facilities would normally be able to planthe SCR connection to occur during planned outages to avoidadditional downtime Some facility owners have been innovative intheir construction plans to minimize down time At the TennesseeValley Authoritys TVAs  MWe Paradise Unit  it wasnecessary to demolish the existing ESP with the unit on line TVAinstalled a construction bypass to send gas from the air preheateroutlet directly to the FGD while the ESP was being demolished andthe SCR reactor erected in its place However in more difficultretrofits down time might be impacted in a significant way Insome cases it may be desirable to plan a brief outage in advance ofthe hookup to install structural steel through sleeves placed inexisting equipment such as the ESP or to relocate existingequipment that would otherwise interfere with erection of the SCRThis permits erection of the catalyst reactor above existingequipment while the unit is on line However because an SCRproject is expected to extend close to two years see Exhibits Aand A in Appendix A it should be possible to incorporate thiswork into planned outages which would have occurred regardless ofwhether an SCR was to be installedlmFacilities will also need to modify their Title V operatingpermit to incorporate the added control devices and the associatedreduced emission limits In some states an interim airoperatingpermit may need to be obtained until the Title V permit ismodified The operating permit modification process consists ofpreparation and submission of the application to the applicablestate or local regulatory agency As shown in Exhibit A inAppendix A this process can occur simultaneously with theprocessing of the construction permit application The process oftransitioning from the construction permit to the operating permitvaries among states and appears to be somewhat unclear due to theinfancy of the Title V operating permit process Nonetheless basedon discussions with several states the application review processis estimated to take approximately  months The Title Voperating permit must also be made available for public commentFollowing public comment the Title V operating permit is not madefinal until compliance testing on the control device is completedTherefore the total estimated time to modify the Title V operatingpermit is about  months plus the additional time to completecompliance testingBased on the estimated time periods needed to complete each ofthe four phases described above the estimated time period tocomplete the implementation of SCR on one combustion unit is about months This time period is shown in Exhibit A in Appendix AHowever depending upon the specifics of the project the timeneeded could vary by a couple of months For example at AESSomerset station the time to complete the retrofit from the pointof contract award was nine months Assuming four months of workprior to contract award a total elapsed time of  months wouldhave been necessary to retrofit this  MWe boiler Anotherfacility Reliant Energys Keystone plant hastwo  MWe corner Tfired combustion engineering units thatburn approx  percent sulfur bituminous coal Reliant intends toreduce the NOX from a baseline of  lbMMBtu to  lbMMBtuThe permit to construct was received in approximately six monthsThe time from placing the order to completion of commissioningactivities is  weeks for both units However preliminaryengineering was accomplished earlier Even if preliminaryengineering and contract negotiation took as long as six to eightmonths the total time for completing two  MWe units would beabout  to  months For the New Madrid plant units    MWe each the specifications were released to turnkeycontractors in February  the project specification wasreleased in March  the contract was awarded on June  and the first unit was in operation by February  In thisproject an option for a second unit was available and wasexercised and air preheaters were replaced Therefore months should be a reasonable and in some cases a conservativeestimate of the total time necessary to retrofit a single utilityboilerUnder the Clear Skies Act EPA does not expect that SCR will beimplemented at every facility For those plants where EPA projectsSCR retrofits will occur EPAs projections reflect that thesefacilities will typically have  to  boilers retrofit per siteHowever for one facility seven SCR retrofits are projected to beinstalled by  Exhibit A in Appendix A examines a schedulefor retrofitting a facility with multiple seven SCR retrofitsThis examines the installation of the control device hookup on asequential basis Installation is staggered by two to three monthsbetween sequential units to enable more efficient utilization ofmanpower and project management than if multiple units wereconnected at one time This approach also assures that at leastabout  percent of the plant capacity is available at any giventime only one boiler is shut down and during most of the timethere is no impact to the plant availability at all This approachrequires a total time of  months for seven SCR retrofits Analternative approach might be to schedule outages to avoid anyoutage during high electricity demand periods This might extendthe total elapsed time by about four months However because thereis a substantial amount of work that can be accomplished with theboiler on line the additional time would be much less than thenumber of high electricity demand months that are accommodated bythis approach Another alternative approach would involve retrofitof more than one unit at a time during lowdemand periods andavoiding any outage during high demand periods This alternativecould result in a faster project completion but would have lesseven labor utilization which is an important costbenefittradeoffIn summary the total time needed to complete the designinstallation and testing at a facility with one SCR unit is about months at a facility with multiple SCR seven units totaltime is approximately  months Based on these timelines it isestimated in principal that the NOX controls needed to complywith a multipollutant strategy can be met provided that  anadequate supply of materials and labor is available and  thecontrol technology implementation process begins at least about months prior to the date controls must be in place Howeverideally longer than  months would allow for all of the retrofitsto occur over a period of several years so that facility owners canproperly plan outages and suppliers can properly plan for resourceavailabilityPKR iThe installation of an SCR system requires a significant amountof labor Most of the labor is necessary for the construction ofthe facility However engineering and project management labor arealso needed for the project The total construction labor for anSCR system of  MWe is in the range of  to manhours Typically approximately  percent of the laboris for boilermakers However the percent of labor forboilermakers will vary from one project to another with percentbeing an average for several projects Some projects require ahigher degree of boiler integration and less erected steel andtherefore have a higher percentage of boilermaker labor Otherprojects require extensive steel erection with less boilerintegration and will therefore have a lower percentage ofboilermakers versus other trades For a  MWe plant theconstruction labor would be about  manhours of thisroughly  manhours would be boilermaker activityEngineering and project management are about  percent of the totalcost while construction is about  percent of the total costIf labor rates for engineering and project management is   percent greater than construction labor then about  to about manhours of engineering and project management are neededfor the project Total labor manhours of construction andengineering labor are then about  manhours for a single MWe unitConstruction manhours are approximately proportional to thetons of steel fabricated As noted earlier the material needed formultiple boiler installations is generally not reducedsignificantly over the projects if they were installed separatelyHowever if more than one system is installed at a site somesignificant efficiencies resultWhen there are multiple units retrofit at one site only onemobilization is needed for all of the boilers only oneconstruction supervisor is required and equipment is moreefficiently used As a result  percent efficiencies can berealized from these activities and can be planned into theproject Longterm projects such as retrofits of more than oneunit at one site also lend themselves to additional efficienciesfrom learning curves Learning curves result from productivityimprovements over the duration of the project Productivitymeasures the actual manhours used versus those planned Aproductivity value over  indicates that fewer manhours areneeded to accomplish the goal than expected A labor productivityvalue of  means that  percent more work was accomplished forthe level of labor expended than if a productivity value of  wasachieved There are examples of productivity improvements of  to percent during the project due to additional efficiencies gainedfrom learning curves If only  percent or less improvedefficiency results from planned reduced labor and from productivityimprovements that occur after the project commences the labor foreach additional  MWe plant might be reduced from manhours to about  manhours or about construction manhours for seven  MWe units at one plantFor a site with multiple units the total engineering andproject management manhours are likely to be significantly lessthan the total if each unit were addressed separately This isbecause there will be many common site issues that need to beaddressed and engineered only once Procurement contracts need tobe negotiated only once and only one project management team isneeded over the duration of the contract However it is difficultto say how much engineering will be reduced because adjacent unitsmay be very similar or very different One approximation is to maketotal engineering project management and testing proportional tothe project duration Thus a sevenunit facility would requireabout  manhours of engineering and project managementBased upon the discussion from sections  through  thetotal resources needed for a single  MWe plant and a site withseven  MWe plants is shown on Table qPJNKbokpjpoo r l po eo c morklu klu kl oLupJqJppimabLmKjKqi EFrb ON PR J

This is because the SCR isfrequently installed in an elevated position near the boiler andwell off of the ground The choice of installing the SCR reactornear the ground level or elevated well above ground level dependsupon which configuration is viewed as most cost effective whileconsidering installation cost and operating cost Locating the SCRin an elevated location near the boiler economizer and airpreheater is frequently done to minimize the length of ductworkwith the associated pressure loss and because no additional realestate is necessary for the SCR reactor When this type ofinstallation is performed the SCR reactor is installed atop asteel structure that must be erected above existing equipment suchas the electrostatic precipitator This is an approach that isfrequently used because engineers have developed cost effectivemethods to install the SCR reactor while addressing potentialinterferences from existing equipment Section  of this documentdiscussed how brief outages in advance of the outage to connectthe SCR were taken to address interferences and permit SCRreactorconstruction with the unit on line In some cases however thepreferred approach has been to locate the SCR reactor on the groundnear the boiler and to route the ductwork to and from the SCRreactor This is the approach that was taken on the retrofit ofPSNH Merrimack Unit  the first retrofit of a coalfired boiler inthe United States In this case there was a large amount of spacenear the boiler to permit this approach Regardless of where theSCR reactor is located ductwork from the economizer outlet to theSCR reactor and back to the air preheater inlet must beaccommodated In cases where space for this ductwork was extremelylimited the air preheater was relocated However relocation ofthe air preheaters usually is not necessary Only a fewinstallations have required the relocation of the airpreheaterThe other item that must be located is the reagent storagesystem This usually does not take up as much room as the SCRreactor itself However the storage and unloading system must belocated near rail or truck access to permit delivery of reagent Insome cases long piping is run from the storage and unloading areato the SCR reactor In these cases the piping may be insulated andheat traced to prevent condensation of the ammonia vaporQ jqoUnder a multipollutant control scenario mercury emissions wouldbe controlled from coalfired power plants by equipment thatreduces emissions of other pollutants eg scrubbers and SCR andthe use of sorbent injection Other methods are being investigatedsuch as oxidation and scrubbing technologies which utilizeozone barrier discharge and catalyst andor chemical additives incombination with existing technologies To the extent that othertechnologies are developed these would provide more options forcompliance so their introduction would serve to reduce issuesrelated to resource requirements of installing controls Similarlywith regard to sorbent injection sorbents other than activatedcarbon AC may ultimately prove to be superior for thisapplication in terms of cost or collection efficiency performanceand may reduce the likely demand for ACI from what is projectedhere Nevertheless all of the sorbentbased approaches use similarhardware to inject sorbent as ACI Therefore the assumption of ACIas a control method will provide a fairly representative indicationof the demand for hardware and construction resources regardless ofwhich sorbents are used in the market The assumption of ACI as amercury control method will be more conservative with regard tosorbent consumption since it will assume that all of the facilitiesinstalling sorbent injection for mercury control require ACQKN peThe AC is typically injected at the lowest temperature availablethat is upstream of a particlecollectingdevice because experience has found that mercury collectionis most efficient at lower temperatures Ona boiler equipped with an ESP or a fabric filter FF forparticle collection the configuration would lookas in Figure  Collection of mercury is somewhat moreefficient when a FF is used for particlecollection because of the higher gassorbent contact in thefilter cake Another approach is to haveinjection downstream of an ESP which would collect most ofthe coal fly ash and upstream of a fabricfilter FF which would mostly capture sorbent Thisapproach is shown in Figure  The advantagesof this approach are that greater mercury capture occursbecause of the additional mercury capture thatcan occur on the FF filter cake and because the ash islargely separated from the sorbent more efficientsorbent utilization is possible through sorbent recyclingThis approach could be implemented throughaddition of a Pulse Jet Fabric Filter PJFF when ACI isinstalledThe ACI System consists of the following components as shown inthe simplified schematic of Figure A silo for storing the sorbent A metering system for metering the amount of sorbentinjected into the ductwork  typically a rotarymetering valve  A pneumatic or mechanical conveying system formoving the sorbent to the injection location An injection system for dispersing and distributing thesorbent in the boiler ductwork For many facilities injection ofsorbent will occur after the air preheater and upstream of the ESPor FF This injection system is principally made from piping thatmay split off to manifolds for injecting in multiple locationsSpecial nozzles or other hardware are generally not required A blower to provide a carrying medium Associated piping for the blower and the distributionsystem A humidification system may be used in some cases to reducetemperature and improve mercury capture The humidification systemwill typically consist of water spray injectors possibly airatomized located upstream of the ACI injectors a grid for thespray injectors and a water supply system that will includepumping and metering systems A control system that may utilize a programmable logiccontroller PLC or may be accommodated by the plant distributedcontrol system DCSStackActivated Carbon Sorbent Storage SiloFrom air preheater Exhaust Gas DuctTo ESP Or FFRegardless of boiler size an ACI system will require the sameequipment The principal differences will be the size of thesorbent storage silo the size of the metering and conveyingsystem and the size and number of injectors for the sorbentinjection systemThere are also several other combinations that may be usedincluding combinations of ACI with spray dryer and FF andcombinations of ACI with FGD The various combinations will bediscussed further in Section  In each of these combinationsthe actual equipment associated with the ACI system is similar Theparticular combination of equipment chosen for mercury reduction ata particular facility is largely determined by the existingequipment and conditions at the facility However most facilitiesare currently equipped with ESPs and some are equipped with FFsThus the most likely scenario for application of ACI is in aconfiguration with ESP or FFMost existing facilities have ESPs for particle emission controland do not have any SO removal technology Therefore injection ofsorbent and possibly water for humidification will most often beperformed downstream of the air preheater and upstream of theelectrostatic precipitator where the gas temperature is typicallyin the range of  F In this part of the boiler ductworkthere are no water wall tubes Therefore the mechanical interfacebetween the ACI system and the boiler is through the duct wallsand highpressure boiler tubing will not be affected by theretrofit of ACISome companies offer other sorbentbased methods for reductionof mercury emissions however the equipment used is very similarin scope to the equipment used for ACIThe majority of the equipment used for an ACI system is producedfrom standard mechanical or electrical hardware that is sold for awide range of purposes The total amount of steel is relativelysmall in comparison to an SCR or an FGD for a  MWe plant Theestimated steel requirement for a  MWe ACI system is indicatedin Table  Since the largest item contributing to the steelrequirement is the storage silo it will be assumed that the totalsteel requirement is proportional to the capacity of the unit asthe storage requirement would be proportional to the capacity Formultiple units at one site all but the silo would certainly needto be duplicated It is possible that there might be one large siloserving several units with more than one feed off of it or thatindividual silos may be needed In any event the synergies inreducing total steel requirement over what would be needed forindividual units is expected to be smallqQJNKbpoRMMjtfpPPf btEFNpKQMmINRMM QIMMM ONRMM QIRMMjppp RIMMMmbEF NRIMMM pp POMIMMM qPRMIMMMENTRFQKO oAC is assumed to be the principal reagent used to absorb themercury in the exhaust gases Most of the information on the ACinjection requirements for a coalfired power plant is from pilotstudies and demonstrations of ACI technology Table  shows ACinjection rates

performed due to risk of acid condensation Table summarizes estimated injection rates for a  MWe boiler undervarious scenarios As shown the injection rates varysubstantially based upon the circumstancesBecause combination of SCR and FGD are expected to have highmercury removal due to the SCR and FGD systems those facilitiesthat are so equipped are not expected to add ACI systemsThere are really no synergies in consumption if multiple ACIunits are installed at one site Therefore the total ACconsumption at a plant will be roughly proportional to the totalplant capacity equipped with

construction equipment  welders excavationequipment concrete pouring equipment cranes etc Since an ACIsystem is much smaller and uses substantially less steel than anSCR or FGD system cranes and other lifting equipment can be of lowto moderate lifting capacity Blowers the sorbent storage siloand other equipment will be mounted on concrete pads orfoundations In most cases the sorbent storage silo will be fielderected however for some facilities that require less sorbent asmaller prefabricated silo may be installed Steel erection andminor excavation and concrete work is necessary for an ACI systemand this work should not require any more than very commonconstruction equipment Piping for sorbent transport will typicallybe welded steel and can be erected in the field in many cases Itshould not be necessary to relocate any existing boiler equipmentto install an ACI system Therefore the construction effort andneed for equipment is relatively modest compared to the moreinvolved SCR and FGD projectsQKQ fqImplementation of a control technology at a plant involvesseveral activities contingent upon each other These activities maybe grouped under the following phases of an implementation project conducting an engineering review of the facility and awarding aprocurement contract  obtaining a construction permit installing the control technology and  obtaining an operatingpermitExhibit A in Appendix A depicts the timeline expected forcompleting a single unit installation of ACI Completion of some ofthe activities is contingent upon completion of other activitiesFor example construction activities cannot commence until aconstruction permit is obtained In general the ACI implementationtimeline appears to be driven primarily by the engineeringactivities ie design fabrication and constructionboAs shown in Exhibit A in Appendix A in the first phase oftechnology implementation an engineering review and assessment ofthe combustion unit is conducted to determine the preferredcompliance alternative During this phase the specifications ofthe control technology are determined and bids are requested fromthe vendors After negotiating the bids a contract forimplementing the control technology is awarded The time necessaryto complete this phase is approximately four monthsqfIn the second phase the control technology is installed Thisinstallation includes designing fabricating and installing thecontrol technology In addition compliance testing of the controltechnology is also completed in this phase Most of theconstruction activities such as earthwork foundations processelectrical and control tieins to existing items can occur whilethe boiler is in operation The time needed to complete this phaseof an implementation project is expected to be less than threemonthsAn important element of the overall control technologyimplementation is the time needed to connect or hook up thecontrol technology equipment to the combustion unit As a result ofthe minimal mechanical interface between the sorbent injectionsystem and the boiler retrofit of an ACI system will typicallyrequire a fairly short outage  one week or less This briefoutage is necessary to install injection hardware and to make anycontrol system connections that may be necessary between the ACIcontrol and the boiler control Other equipment associated with theACI system can be installed with the boiler on line as it does notrequire any interfacing with the boiler and should not requiremoving any essential boiler equipmentIt should be possible to complete a project in less than months from receipt of order If construction and operatingpermits are included in the analysis the project is likely to takelonger than would be necessary only for engineering supplyinstallation and startup of the ACI system This is because thepermitting activities might become the timelimiting steps In somelocalities it is possible that the permitting activities will notbe the limiting steps In this case a faster execution is possiblethan shown on Exhibit A in Appendix AlmFacilities will also need to modify their Title V operatingpermit to incorporate the added control devices and the associatedreduced emission limits In some states an interim airoperatingpermit may need to be obtained until the Title V permit ismodified The operating permit modification process consists ofpreparation and submission of the application to the appropriatestate or local regulatory agency As shown in Exhibit A inAppendix A this process can occur simultaneously with theprocessing of the construction permit application The process oftransitioning from the construction permit to the operating permitvaries among states and appears to be somewhat unclear due to theinfancy of the Title V operating permit process Nonetheless basedon discussions with several states the application review processis estimated to take approximately  weeks  months TheTitle V operating permit must also be made available for publiccomment and is not made final until compliance testing on thecontrol device is completed Therefore the total estimated time tomodify the Title V operating permit is about  months plus theadditional time to complete compliance testingBased on the estimated time periods needed to complete each ofthe four phases described above the estimated time period tocomplete the implementation of ACI on one combustion unit is about months as shown in Exhibit A in Appendix A Since thepermitting process limits the timeline a faster permitting processwill shorten the time necessary to install ACI on a singleunitUnder the Clear Skies Act EPA does not expect that ACI will beimplemented at many facilities due to the cobenefit of mercuryremoval from other control technologies For those plants where EPAprojects ACI retrofits will occur EPAs projections reflect thatthese facilities will either have  to  boilers retrofit per siteExhibit A in Appendix A examines a schedule for retrofitting afacility with multiple two ACI retrofits This examines theinstallation of the control device hookup on a sequential basisInstallation is staggered by one month between sequential units toenable more efficient utilization of manpower and projectmanagement than if multiple units were connected at one time Thisapproach requires a total time of  monthsIn summary the total time needed to complete the designinstallation and testing at a facility with one ACI unit is about months at a facility with two ACI units is approximately months Based on these timelines it is estimated that inprinciple the mercury controls needed to comply with amultipollutant strategy can be met provided that  an adequatesupply of materials and labor is available and  the controltechnology implementation process begins at least  months priorto the date controls must be in place However ideally longerthan  months would allow retrofits to occur over a period ofseveral years so that facility owners can properly plan outages andsuppliers can properly plan for resource availability Erection ofa PJFF would typically take  to  months from award of contractto start up If  months is added for precontract effort and months is provided for start up and commissioning the totalproject duration would be anywhere from about  months to months However EPAs modeling under the

necessarilybe lengthened beyond this month period to allow for theinstallation of the PJFF As stated in section  the totalduration for a PJFF retrofit is estimated to be anywhere from about months to  months including precontract effort and start upand commissioning Since the Clear Skies Act provides much morethan  months of notice for any mercury control regulation thereshould be adequate time for compliance even if some facilitiesinstall PJFFsqQJQKbmokpfor bN bO bP bQ bRbS bTkWURKeKpimgccIKqQJRKbmokpjfoEbRqQKQFk r N O b eoces qjt qef mcc j rjrj mci foci  eiebmfVMMjtKkWURKeKQKS poMost of the equipment and piping associated with a sorbentinjection system is fairly small and can be easily accommodated onany facility The only piece of equipment that could potentially bea challenge to locate on site is the sorbent storage silo theother equipment largely being piping and a blower The storage silois by far the largest part of the ACI system It is estimatedthat a storage silo that is sized for  days of AC storage at fullload for a  MWe plant firing bituminous coal and with only anESP would be about  m in diameter and about  m high Thissized piece of equipment while large should be readilyaccommodated on most sites large enough for a  MWe boiler Forboilers with fabric filters the size of the silo would be lessbecause of the lower sorbent injection rate Some facilityoperators may choose to install a PJFF in order to reduce sorbentconsumption and to segregate carbon from the ash In this casemore space would be needed for the PJFF The dimensions for a PJFFon a  MWe plant would be roughly  feet wide x  feet long x feet highRpoprThis chapter will explore the combination of these technologiesand how deployment of more than one technology at a unit couldpotentially result in improved resource utilization It is assumedthat the ACI FGD and SCR would not be necessary at a single unitbecause of the high mercury removal efficiencies expected throughcombination of FGD and SCR Hence the synergies of combining allthree technologies were not exploredRKN pocdaEpFfIn some cases facility owners may choose to retrofit theirplants with both SCR and FGD technology to achieve both NOX and SOreduction Combination of SCR and FGD will also result insignificant reduction of mercury emissions thereby mitigating theneed for the addition of ACI However both SCR and FGD are verycapitalintensive projects which require a substantial level ofmaterial and construction Therefore it is worthwhile to considerif both SCR and FGD installations can be combined efficientlyAn SCR project involves retrofitting in the boiler and itsimmediate area Therefore an SCR retrofit project may requirerelocation of equipment in the boiler area An FGD system isinstalled farther downstream in the plant after the ESPOccasionally it is necessary to install a new smoke stack and itmay be necessary to add more fan capacity However an additionalsmoke stack is normally unnecessary The FGD connection with thefacility is generally less difficult than with SCR because it doesnot require modification of the boiler just connection to ductworkin the vicinity of the stack As a result the constructionactivities would normally be in different locations at the plantreducing the interference between the two projects The SCR mightbe the limiting item on the boiler outage because of its morecomplex connection In any event the tiein of the SCR and the FGDsystems could be done in the same outage and it has been confirmedthat the installation of SCR and scrubber could be performedsimultaneously without interference Therefore installing theseat the same time on a boiler is preferable to doing them separatelyas they may be able to use the same outage and projectefficiencies result from a single mobilization a singleconstruction manager and sharing of large construction equipmentfor the two projects At Kansas City Power and Lights HawthornPower Station Unit  was replaced excluding turbine in under months This included the boiler an SCR and an LSDFFAlthough in this case the equipment did not have to be erectedadjacent to an operating boiler the erection included demolishingand erecting a complete boiler island and demolishing the existingelectrostatic precipitator Hence this was a very complex projectthat was completed approximately within the time frame estimatedand shown in Exhibit A in Appendix ARKO jqpfAs noted in Chapter  ACI entails a much smaller constructionproject than either an FGD or an SCR Moreover the ACI is locatedin a different part of the plant than FGD or SCR and activatedcarbon injection occurrs in the ductwork between the air preheaterand the ESP or FF One benefit of combiningthese two projects is that the ACI hookup can be completedduring the outage for the scrubber hookup since the installationeffort necessary for the FGD will far outweigh that of the ACIsystem A second benefit is better planning of material storage andhandling equipment Both FGD and ACI require a substantial amountof material limestone and AC respectively and associated storageand handling facilities Installing both technologies at the sametime will permit better planning of material storage and equipmentlocations thereby avoiding interference Other benefits such as asingle mobilization a single construction manager and sharing oflarge construction equipment for the two projects exist but theyare not expected to make a significant difference due to thedifference in size between the portions of the combined FGD and ACIproject Therefore as shown in Exhibit A in Appendix A theschedule for a combined FGD and ACI project is expected to be thesame as the schedule of an FGD projectRKP jqpofAs noted in Chapter  ACI entails a much smaller constructionproject than either an FGD or an SCR The primary benefit ofcombining these two projects is that the ACI hookup can becompleted during the outage for the SCR hookup

ormultiple retrofits of control technologies this chapter willassess the resource availability in the United States for retrofitof control technologies for the Clear Skies Act This analysisconsiders the current availability of resources for theconstruction of control technologies and does not consider anypotential increase in production of resources due to the demandcreated by the Clear Skies Act Because this effect will be morepronounced in the period following  and because other marketfactors may also change over time the longer term projections areof less value than those out to  EPA has made preliminaryestimates of the retrofits of each technology that would resultfrom the Clear Skies Act Tables a b and c list the expectedtotal MWe of facilities that would be equipped with SCR FGD orACI after response to a multipollutant rule It is important tonote that the Current Air Quality Rule Retrofit MWe row of thetable includes only the projected retrofits under the current airquality rules The control technology retrofits estimated to resultfrom the Clear Skies Act including the retrofits from current airquality rules is listed in the Multipollutant  CurrentRetrofits MWe row of the tables The Cumulative Total MWe shownin Table  includes facilities that currently are equipped withthe technology or are expected to be equipped with the technologyas a result of current air quality rules such as SCRs resultingfrom the NOX SIP Call as well as the projected retrofits under theClear Skies Act EPA estimated that up to  GWe of SCR wouldresult from the NOX SIP Call and an additional  GWe fromindividual state multipollutant rules with approximately  GWecurrently installed However facilities are responding to the NOXSIP Call at this time and it is uncertain exactly how manyfacilities will ultimately be equipped with SCR in  when theNOX SIP Call deadline arrivesEPA projections estimate that it would be cost effective for MWe of FGD retrofits to be installed under the Clear SkiesAct by  even though the first phase of the SO cap is not ineffect until  These retrofits would be early installationsthat sources initiate due to the economic benefits of banking SOallowances It is estimated that there are about  MWe of FGDcapacity being constructed or just recently completed Based onavailability of resources particularly labor it is projected thatan additional  MWe of FGD capacity could be built for a totalof  MWe by  Because the FGD estimate based onavailability of resources is much less than the amount of FGDcapacity that would be cost effective to build EPA ran modelsensitivities constraining the amount of scrubber capacity thatcould be installed by  at  MWe This estimate for thepotential number of FGD retrofits considers the resource and laborrequirements of the simultaneous installation of SCRs which isfurther discussed under the labor section  of this chapterThe  MWe difference between the number of FGDs which wouldbe cost effective to build and the estimated number based onresources would be pushed back a few years to be completed by Therefore the  MWe of FGD retrofits projected to bebuilt by  for Clear Skies and current requirements remains thesame under both scenarios It is likely that additional FGDretrofits could be completed by  but there would be thepotential for an increase in the cost of construction due todecreased implementation timeA typical unit size of  MWe was selected for each technologyIn previous sections capacity factors of  percent were assumedIn reality coalfired facilities on average have lower capacityfactors For example in   percent of  GWe ofgenerating capacity in the US or  MWe was coal fueled Inthat same year coalfired US plants produced about  percent of billion kWh or billion kWh This corresponds to a capacity factor of percent Data is from Energy Information Administration WebSite Capacity Factor is total MWeh produced divided by the totalMWeh that would be produced if the plant were run at full capacityfor  h in the year As a result assuming a capacity factorof  percent will result in a much more conservative highestimate of resources needed than is likely to be the caseIn estimating the resources necessary to put new controltechnology capacity in place labor steel etc theMultipollutant  Current Rule Retrofits MWe values of Tablesa b and c are of greatest interest For estimating theconsumables necessary for the technologies such as limestoneammonia catalyst or activated carbon the Cumulative Total MWevalue is most important The multipollutant and total MWe ofcontrol technology retrofits are given for    and To provide a conservative estimate of required resources thefollowing analysis looks at implementing the retrofits for  in months prior to  and retrofits for   and three years prior to each fiveyear period For example itestimates the resource requirements from the period between and  over three years prior to  instead of five yearsThirtyone months was used for  because the analysis for was based on the projected number of retrofits needed by  lessthe amount of capacity installed by May  It should also benoted that most of the retrofits needed by  are being installedto meet existing requirements under the NOX SIP Call or otherregulatory requirements as opposed to the requirements of amultipollutant program such as the

construction employment and unemploymentSource Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe available construction labor in the United States about million will provide a large labor pool for the trades that arenot unique to the power industry such as iron and steel workerspipe fitters and electricians In other words that the estimateddemand of under  fulltime workers represents only about percent of the current total labor poolBoilermakers are a skilled labor source that is fairly unique toutility work Sixty percent of the demand for boilermakers in theconstruction division is from the utility industry Otherindustries requiring boilermaker labor include refinery percent chemical  percent paper  percent and metals percent These are the industries where boilers and highenergyvessels are most likely to be found Retrofit of equipment onutility boilers often requires a significant number of boilermakersdue to the integration that is needed with the boiler that oftenrequires modification of steam piping or other boiler equipmentAlso in response to the increase in demand for boilermakers overthe last few years their ranks have increased from  activemembers in  to  members in   an annualized growthrate of  percent Employment level also increased during thistime from  percent to  percent employment level is equalto the total manhours worked in the year divided by total activemembers time  hyr During much of the s the number ofactive boilermakers had been declining due to very low employmentlevels resulting from very low activity in the utility power plantconstruction business Therefore the increased activity of thelast few years has been a welcome change to boilermakersSeveral sources have mentioned that the availability ofboilermakers has been tight for the SCR projects underway for theNOX SIP Call  However where shortages have been experiencedin manning SCR construction projects with adequate numbers ofboilermakers manpower planning had been done with short noticeMany boilermakers travel to work sites that are out of their localarea A large project may require mobilization of several hundredboilermakers to a site which will frequently require pulling It is assumed that this number is for journeyman boilermakersand does not include persons in apprenticeship programsmembers from other parts of the country In the currentcompetitive environment for utilities power plant owners arereluctant to provide much advance notice of when outages willoccur Therefore in some cases contractors must find manpower onvery short notice The boilermakers union The InternationalBrotherhood of Boilermakers Iron Ship Builders BlacksmithsForgers and Helpers attempts to provide the necessary manpower tothe contractors However with very short notice it is sometimesdifficult to move the manpower to the site in the short timedesired Nevertheless the union has been successful in providingsufficient manpower to the project sites where they have hadadequate advance notice Therefore although there is littleslack in the availability of boilermakers better coordination mayhave avoided the labor shortage problemsIt is worthwhile to consider the expected future state of thesupply of boilermakers The total number of members in theboilermakers construction division is currently about journeymen and apprentices The union has about  members inCanada These numbers are up from the s when a severe droughtof work for boilermakers caused many boilermakers to seek otherlines of work Due to the current workload the boilermaker ranksare growing However the average age of the work force is about Because of the aging workforce and because of the anticipateddemand for work at power plants the union has made it an objectiveto have at least  members in the construction division by or at least a  percent annual growth rate Theboilermakers union is working to recruit new members into theirapprenticeship programs which takes four years to complete Alsoskilled workers from other trades may choose to work as aboilermaker so a shorter apprenticeship may be possible dependingupon the experience and skill level of the individual For exampleiron and steelworkers who had been boilermakers in the past couldmove back into boilermaker work very quickly Since boilermakersearn somewhat more than ironworkers it is reasonable to expectthat with increased job stability in the boilermaker trade someironworkers might choose to move to the boilermaker trade for thehigher pay especially if they had worked as boilermakers in thepast The iron and steelworkers union has  members Evenwithout prior boilermaker experience some of these iron andsteelworkers could choose to move to boilermakers with much lessthan a full fouryear training requirement because of theirknowledge and skill level In addition the boilermakersshipbuilding division has about  members who dependingupon industry conditions could move over to the constructiondivision quicklyAs noted earlier the number of boilermakers dropped quicklyduring the s when little work was available Converselyincreasing demand for boilermakers that would result from amultipollutant rule should stimulate more workers to enter thetrade The overall employment outlook for boilermakers should bequite good considering the work created by a multipollutantinitiative and the work on new power plants that is projected overthe next  years As stated in the National Energy Policy MayOver the next  years the United States will need  to new power plants Electricity demand is expected to increase at arate of  percent per year over the next  years creating theneed for  MWe of generating capacity At a  percentgrowth rate that number is reduced by between  to  MWeto about  MWe of new generating capacityA large quantity of new generating capacity consisting mostlyof gas combined cycle units has been built within the last severalyears Since  close to  GWe of new capacity have been builtor is currently under construction with an even larger quantitybeing proposed This excess in capacity is projected to create anoverall reserve margin greater than  percent in the US over thenext few years By comparison this is a significant increase inthe reserve margin since it dipped below  percent in the lates As the demand in electricity grows the need for newgenerating capacity will not be feltuntil the excess capacity is worked off Assuming new capacitywill be needed when the reserve margin approaches  percent it isexpected to push back the need for additional capacity beyond and in some regions as late as Due to the installation of SCR units for the NOX SIP Call asignificant percentage of the boilermakers who are currentlyworking in the utility industry would be needed to complete thoseretrofits by  Integrated Planning Model IPM projectionsindicate that it would be cost effective to install  GWe ofscrubbers by  in addition to the projected SCR installationshowever boilermaker labor is not expected to be sufficient to meetthis demand even if their numbers grow at the projected  percentannual growth rate Figure  shows the boilermaker laborrequirements out to

constructed it isconservatively assumed than an additional  GWe could be completedby  This estimate of  GWe of scrubber retrofits by  wasdetermined from the difference between the boilermaker labor hoursavailable from the boilermaker membership working in the electricutility industry and the labor hours needed to complete controltechnology retrofits and other electric utility projects Thisestimate is supported by the number of orders of FGDs for  andprojected orders through  by the electric utility industrywhich totals over  GWe and over  GWe of announced scrubberswhich are scheduled to start up by  Orders for scrubbers suchas the recent order for the Coleman Station in Kentucky arecontinuing to be received in spite of the concerns raised about theavailability of boilermaker labor during the simultaneousinstallation of SCRs for the NOX SIP Call The other electricutility projects that boilermakers work on include such projects asroutine maintenance at operating plants and new plant constructionwhich account for approximately  manhours ofboilermaker labor per year Figure  compares the availableboilermaker labor to the demand from the electric utility industrywhich includes the retrofits from the Clear Skies ActSince boilermakers earn more money than most other crafttrades and the demand for boilermakers should be steady andincreasing it is reasonable to expect that the growth inboilermaker numbers experienced these last few years shouldcontinue for many more years To assess the impact of this it wasassumed that the boilermakers in the US continued to grow at the percent pace that the International Brotherhood ofBoilermakers Iron Ship Builders Blacksmiths Forgers and Helpershas set as a minimum growth target Based upon the estimates ofTable  and the assumed growth rates the annual boilermakerdemand created by the Clean Skies Act can be estimated and is shownin Table  Table  was derived considering that  GWe of SCRshave already been installed for the NOX SIP Call so the remaining GWe of SCR and  GWe of scrubber installations were consideredfor  According to Table  if the retrofit of the FGD SCRand ACI systems for  occur over thirtyone months prior to and over a threeyear period for each fiveyear increment after to  the maximum demand would be about  percent of thejourneyman boilermakers or about  percent for journeymen andapprentices combinedConsidering only the boilermakers who are currently in demand bythe utility industry the demand would be about  percent of thejourneyman boilermakers or about  percent for journeymen andapprentices combined These percentages of demand are expected tobe experienced prior to  but with growth in the boilermakernumbers out to  the percent of boilermakers affected dropsoff The number of boilermakers in demand for retrofitinstallations under the Clear Skies Act is spread fairly evenly outto  when the demand begins to decrease However there maystill be significant demand for boilermakers after  from otherpower plant construction programsqSJQKbapv OMMM OMMR OMNM OMNR OMOMkNWRKPSKTKfIOMNMJKqOUIMMMOMMROMMOOQIMMMRKPKkOWfOMMRJOMMRJOMMROMOMKpoURdtOMMRTNdtNQdtpojOMMOKThe actual impact on the demand for boilermakers could be lowerfor several reasons Due to the longer increments of time that theClear Skies Act provides facility owners to comply than was assumedin this analysis installation of these technologies will extendover more than three years spreading out the demand As statedearlier this analysis does not consider any of the synergies orefficiencies that have been demonstrated to occur on multiple unitretrofits or multipletechnology retrofits The boilermakerpopulation has been growing at a faster rate  percent annually in recent years than the unions minimum target of  percentthat was assumed Therefore the number of boilermakers mayactually grow more quickly than what was assumed This analysisalso neglects overtime which would reduce the demand for workerssomewhatSKP bMost of the construction equipment necessary for theinstallation of SCR FGD and ACI technology is standardconstruction equipment that is used for most constructionactivities The piece of equipment that is not standard that may beneeded for SCRs and possibly for FGD systems is a tallspanheavylift crane These cranes are necessary to lift heavy piecessometimes over  tons several hundred feet and are not neededfor all projects When the largest piece to be lifted is determinedfrom the construction plan the necessary crane can be determinedIn some cases the available crane or the crane pricing may limitthe largest piece to be lifted and the construction plan may bemodified to accommodate a smaller crane by lifting smaller piecesIn many instances the best crane for the job isnot the largest because the large cranes are very expensive torent one size up could double or triple the monthly charges forrenting the crane As a result it may be more cost effectiveoverall to use a smaller crane and lift smaller pieces This maylengthen the installation time slightly but it will reduce cranerental fees Therefore an economic trade off must be assessed foreach projectAs discussed in Section  utility engineers reported thatwhile installing SCRs for the NOX SIP Call crane availability hasbeen an issue that can be accommodated with proper planning Theconstruction plan could be modified to employ the available or mostcosteffective crane Therefore sufficient supply of constructionequipment is expected to be available for installing air

critical part of the SCR system that ismanufactured on a worldwide basis by some of the largest companiesin the world Manufacturing is largely in the United StatesEurope and Japan and the worldwide capacity is used to supportworldwide sales The current and planned capacity of SCR catalystsupply available to the US market for coalfired boilers isnearly  myr Table  shows the results of a survey ofmajor suppliers of SCR catalyst to coalfired boilers Thesuppliers provided EPA their current capacity and the capacity thatwill be on line in the year  The estimated capacity of othersuppliers of catalyst to coalfired boilers that could not bereached in time for this study is listed also Suppliers that haveoffered catalyst for coal applications in the past but currentlyfocus strictly on gas and oil fired applications were notincluded However it is recognized that these companies couldshift their product mix if the market conditions justified it sothe capacity value shown could be quickly increased ifmanufacturers simply changed product focusThe current capacity was originally built overseas to meetoverseas demand or was subsequently built to meet US demand forcatalyst spurred by the NOX SIP Call and the build up of gasturbine power plants in the US Except for a moderate demand forreplacement catalyst much of this capacity will be available after because these large demand peaks will have mostly passedBecause most of the companies that supply catalyst are divisions ofvery large companies with the resources to rapidly expand theirmanufacturing capacity to meet increases in market demand it isreasonable to assume that this manufacturing capacity could beexpanded if the market demand justified it In fact recentcapacity expansions provide strong evidence of thisqSJTKpocJ s

current cumulative production capacity for SCRcatalyst to the cumulative annual demand for SCR catalyst from thetotal SCR installations in  and  This approach assumesthat the annual production of

in Figure the cumulative demand from the Clear Skies Act plus the worldwidedemand can be met with the total cumulative confirmed capacityConsequently adequate capacity of SCR catalyst supply is availableto satisfy the demand that may result from the projectedinstallations Of course as demonstrated by the catalystsuppliers if more capacity was desirable to satisfy the market itcould be added given sufficient lead time for the construction ofthe catalyst production facilityThe ability to retrofit a large number of SCR systems over ashort period of time was exemplified in Germany during the lates Figure  shows the number of systems installed over aneightyear period with most of these systems  of  installedduring two consecutive years  This pattern ofinstallations exhibits that the catalyst market demonstrated theability to respond to the surge in demand resulting from a dramaticincrease in SCR installationsrThe installation and operation of SCR systems is not expected tobe constrained by the future availability of ammonia or urea Theproduction of anhydrous ammonia in the US in  wasapproximately  tons equivalent anhydrous with apparentconsumption of  tons and about  met through netimports as shown in a  edition of US Geological SurveyMinerals Commodity Summaries Ammonia demand is directlyproportional to the tons of NOX reduced The increased ammoniademand from a multipollutant rule is estimated to increase to about tons per year by  This  percent increase in demandover a nearly year period can easily be met Moreover the USand worldwide ammonia business is struggling because of slumpingdomestic demand and increased global capacity for the product andother nitrogen fertilizers derived from it such as ureaNevertheless more capacity is scheduled to come on in the USduring the near future In addition  million tons of capacityis being built in Trinidad and Venezuela Algeria and the formerSoviet Union have also added significant capacity Another problemis the withdrawal of China as an importer of ammonia Chinatraditionally bought  to  million tons of urea annually which isproducedfrom ammonia but in  the country launched a drive tobecome selfsufficient in urea a move that has displaced  to million tons of ammonia Based on these estimates theability to supply of ammonia will continue to exceed its demandeven with the additional demand from newly installed SCRsystemsSCR systems can also use urea as a reagent and it is becomingpreferred to ammonia in many cases because of its safety Urea is acommonly available chemical with approximately  tons ofdomestic annual production capacity For SCR purposes this addseffectively another  million tons of ammonia annually availableas SCR reagent Additionally US urea manufacturers anddistributors routinely trade within a  tons worldwideannual production capacity Based on total world urea tradeincreased demand due to a multipollutant regulation would be wellunder  percent of world trade if all SCRs used urea rather thanammonia And like ammonia the urea market is currentlyexperiencing an oversupply situation Urea prices have fallenprecipitously since China formerly a major buyer decided tostrive for selfsufficiency From  to  China opened ninenew urea plants and raised its domestic production by  percentUS producers knew China would bring on the new moreefficientplants but they did not expect that country to continue runningits smaller lessefficient ones Thus it is expected that thisworldwide supply will provide additional flexibility in meeting anysignificant increases in demand Since urea production is performedon a worldwide basis plants producing urea would be able to expandtheir capacity if needed Based on these considerations adequateurea supply is expected to be available for the SCR systems of Installations Per Year It takes about  lbs of urea to make one lb of ammoniareagent in a urea to ammonia conversionfpAC is produced in the United States and abroad for

Capacity in the US is equal to  millionpoundsyr or  tons Both of these numbers include bothgranular and powdered carbon powdered being preferable to granularfor ACI applications US demand is projected to grow to million pounds or about  tons in  However largeunderutilized capacity overseas will provide a ready supply ofpotential imports which will tend to limit price increases formost grades The competition from Chinese and SouthEast Asianproducers remains strong Chinese exports quadrupled from tons in  to  tons in  with the average product costdropping by  percent to ton Therefore growth in demandexperienced in the s has not been reflected in the value ofthe market due to overcapacity and the continued rise in Asianexports AC producers are concentrating increasingly on theAsiaPacific region to exploit growing markets and take advantageof lower production costs reported capacity expansions of over tonsyr are all planned for AsiaPacific and RussiaAccording to Norit the largest supplier of AC for air pollutioncontrol purposes there is currently adequate excess capacity toaccommodate significant growth in the demand tens of millions ofpoundsyr or roughly tens of thousands of tonsyr Howeverdepending upon how much growth occurs as a result of regulationadditional capacity may be necessary It would take  years toadd a plant and this would only be done after a regulation was putin place the technical advantages of ACI for mercury removal wereproven relative to other approaches and a clear timeline forcompliance was mandated Therefore even if a multipollutantstrategy implementation causes a large increase in demand for ACprovided that the timing of compliance was clear and far enough inthe future adequate supply of AC should be assuredEPA estimated that of the total  MWe to be retrofit by with ACI all of that capacity would have existing fabricfilters  As mentioned before EPAs modeling indicates that noneof the total MWe of ACI retrofits will include a PJFF AC usagenationally for mercury control from power plants should be roughlyproportional to the total MWe of coalfired facilities that areequipped with the technology this assumes an average capacityfactor of  percent and other assumptions of Tables  and Table  shows the results of this analysis Based upon thisanalysis it is possible that existing excess capacity in ACproduction could adequately address the increased demand for ACAnd even if ACI is more broadly used than anticipated by EPA morethan  MWe it is clear that with at least  years ofpreparation time to build more production capacity the AC industrycan accommodate any additional demandqSJVKmaajfEjtbmfmjFv OMMR OMNM OMNR OMOMbpmHfIG M M M M ccHfI M MRRM TOM qI M M RRM TOMGloISKRgpqfThe Clear Skies Act is

using the IPM thenumber and size of facilities that will have to install newhardware The control technologies considered by this report ascandidates to be used for this multipollutant control strategyinclude LSFO for the control of SO  SCR for the control of NOX and ACI for the control of mercuryBased upon the IPMgenerated information from EPA and thecharacteristics of the technologies listed above the totalresources needed to comply with the multipollutant control strategywere estimated and compared to the available resources Theavailability of resources was based on their current market demandand does not reflect the increased production capacity that amultipollutant strategy may create It is likely that the marketfor materials labor construction equipment and other resourcesused in the construction and operation of air pollution controltechnologies would respond by increasing production to meet demandwhere neededInstallation of wet FGD specifically LSFO presents aconservatively high estimate of anticipated resources and time toprovide additional control of SO emissions LSFO systems commonlyare more resource intensive than many other FGD technologiesConservatively high assumptions were made for the time laborreagents and steel needed to install FGD systems Although FGDinstallations are time and labor intensive they are typicallyplanned and installed within normally scheduled outages It isexpected that one FGD system requires about  months of totaleffort for planning engineering installation and startup ModernFGD systems typically use fewer and smaller absorbers andincreasingly control greater amounts of generating capacity usingcommon absorbers fed by multiple boilers Under the Clear SkiesAct three absorber systems for six boilers are anticipated tohandle  MWe of capacity The estimate of labor includesplanning and engineering general labor and skilled boilermakersConstruction of absorbers offsite is one way that projects cancontrol project resources schedules and laborSteel is the major hardware component for FGD systemsStructural steel is used primarily for the absorber ductwork andsupports and secondarily in miscellaneous components includingreinforcement of existing structures at a facility FGD systems areinstalled on the back end of a facility are usually built close tothe ground and do not require the amounts of structural steelgenerally associated with elevated installations such as SCR Bycomparison the conservative estimate of the amount of steelrequired for a full FGD system is less than or equal to thatrequired for an SCR retrofit Corrosion and abrasion resistantmaterials are increasingly being applied with success in modern FGDsystems to improve reliability and longterm performance The totaldemand for additional FGD installations will be modest and isexpected to be well within the anticipated steel capacity evenwith demands from other applicationsConstruction equipment requirements for FGD installations aretypically modest particularly given that systems are installed atthe back end of the facility and close to the ground Howeverexperience has indicated that project planning can surmount evendifficult situations eg prefabrication and jacking upcomponents Experience has also shown that specific site issueswhile often a planning challenge have not prevented installationsof FGD systems More recently space requirements for constructionand accommodating the FGD system have been addressed with theimplementation of improvements in technology including fewer andsmaller absorbers and more efficient onsite use and treatment ofwastes and byproductsLimestone was used as an estimate of reagent for FGD systemsExperience indicates that the quantity of limestone isconservatively high compared to other enhanced reagents such asfineground limestone and MEL Even with the assumption that allnew FGD capacity will require limestone the amount of limestoneneeded as a reagent is projected to be within availability ofsupplySCR is the technology that will primarily be used for NOXcontrol Since it is also the most demanding in terms of resourcesneeded for installation it was assumed to be the only technologyused for NOX control SCR systems are primarily made from steelstandard mechanical hardware and catalyst Conservatively highassumptions were made for steel catalyst reagents and the laborand equipment necessary to install the systems projected by the IPMthat result from a multipollutant control strategy The amount ofammonia or urea reagent needed can be estimated with goodconfidence as constituting a small portion of available supplyExperience in installing SCRs for the NOX SIP Call has shownthat the SCR equipment can be installed on the facilities in thespace provided In some cases moving of equipment has beennecessary but this has not proved to be limiting The onlyspecialized construction equipment that can be useful for SCRinstallations are tall heavylift cranes These appear to be inadequate supply and are not essential since the erection plan canbe modified to accommodate the use of smaller cranes which arefrequently more economical The only specialized labor necessaryfor SCR installations are members of the boilermakers trade andestimates of boilermaker demand were made It is expected that oneSCR system requires about  months of total effort for planningengineering installation and startup Experience has shown thatmany installations have been completed in much shorter timesTherefore  months appears to be somewhat conservativeACI was presumed to be the technology that would be used toreduce mercury where dedicated mercury controls were needed becausethe hardware is representative of most sorbent injectiontechnologies Also other sorbentbased approaches in developmentmay prove in time to be preferable to ACI making the use of ACIonly a conservative assumption ACI hardware is comprised ofrelatively common mechanical components and is largely made ofsteel An ACI system requires much less in terms of steel laboror other resources to install than either FGD or SCR technologyTherefore the impact of ACI hardware on resource demand is muchless than that of FGD or SCR technologies for SO or NOX controlrespectively The only piece of equipment of any consequence interms of size is the storage silo and this piece of equipment isnot so large as to pose a problem with regard to location for mostfacilities Planning engineering installation and startup of anACI system is only about  months and could be done in much lesstime if administrative matters such as permitting occur morequickly than assumed Figures for consumption of AC were based onprior peerreviewed EPA work and conservative operatingconditions were assumedIn summary this study found that the expected demand forresources resulting from a multipollutant control strategy could bemet However the market is expected to adjust to changes in boththe demand for resources under a multipollutant program and othermarket factors For this reason the longer termprojections are of less value than those for the  and time period Table  shows a summary of resource demand and itseffect on current supply In Table  the Supply Basis may becurrent US demand capacity available to US users or otherbasis as appropriate and described in the table notes For allresources needed for installation it is assumed that theseresources are required over a month period prior to  and athreeyear period prior to   and  This is a veryconservative assumption because the most complex FGD installationswill require three years while the actual available time tocomplete the projected retrofits for each period except prior to is five yearsAs shown in Table  there is ample steel and generalconstruction labor to support the installation of thesetechnologies assuming a month period of installation prior to and a threeyear installation prior to   and Moreover the demand assumptions do not consider any efficienciesthat can be achieved at multiple unit installations orinstallations of multiple technologies at a site As discussed inthis document these efficiencies can reduce steel requirementsomewhat and labor needs substantially Demand for boilermakerlabor is significant when compared to the boilermaker labor supplybasis However most boilermakers  percent work in the electricpower industry so it should not be surprising that the percentageis high It should also be considered that the value in this tableassumes conservatively high proportion of boilermaker labor andthat the boilermaker trade grows at its minimum target rate of percent In fact the boilermaker trade has been growing at about percent annually in recent years due to the improvingemployment prospects for boilermakersThere is also ample SCR catalyst capacity to supply this marketSCR catalyst manufacturing is almost entirely dedicated to powergenerating applications Thus it should not be surprising thatdemand for initial fill and periodic replacement catalyst shouldaccount for a significant portion of the supply basis Moreoverthe US market for catalyst is currently larger than all of theother national markets combined With regard to reagents and otherconsumables clearly there is ample supply of limestone foradditional FGD systems especially in light of conservatively highassumptions that were used to make these estimates Ammonia andurea supply is also plentiful although it is expected that NOXreduction will cause a modest increase in US demand In factthere is currently a worldwide excess capacity problem forsuppliers of these commodity chemicals that are traded globallyAlthough US demand for activated carbon is expected to increaseby a small amount as a result of a multipollutant strategyactivated carbon is traded on a global basis and there iscurrently substantial excess capacity that can readily provide forthis increase in demand Suppliers have also indicated that newplants could be brought on line within  years if needed tosatisfy increased demand Additionally there are othertechnologies under development that potentially could reduceactivated carbon demand from what is estimated hereqTJNKbokflqfo  GopoURdtOMMRTNdtNQdtpojOMMOKU o Personal Communication with R
