                okay Bill right   yes   okay Bill have you done much camping   uh yes im a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts   ah ha   i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year   oh well that that sounds good   id say i camp quite a bit   yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you dont have mountains in Texas do you where do you find places to camp     well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping     oh   and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us   uhhuh   and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the uh sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again     oh oh my word well that sounds adventuresome       well um ive done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i   how about yourself   um we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isnt as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so weve tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains   well thats good   and then the boys are our boys are old enough now theyre twelve and eleven and so theyre involved involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts   umhum     and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and so this year theyll both be going and so thats been real enjoyable for them   great   so   what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves   um yes theyve well no actually theyve i remember they have taken the the Dutch the heavy cast iron Dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire   umhum   and i dont think theyve taken the stoves um last year they camped in tents and this year i believe it will be in tents also   uhhuh of course i imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah   so uhhuh yeah   it doesnt get very cold in Texas       so lots of times we dont even take tents   oh is that right   we just use trail tarps   oh and what does that consist of   uh its just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of       uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent   oh uhhuh   uh like a uh theyre very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh theyre not very heavy see so you carry them with you and   uhhuh oh   theyll keep you dry or whatever   yes uh see when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and  lots of tents and i like to sleep on the air mattresses i dont am not  my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses   umhum   um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that   yes yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer   oh   uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere   my word jeez   uh  so uh but it  even though uh it wasnt hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so of course we dont uh want to go hunting   uhhuh     but we got to see a lot of deer   oh   um out and about and theres of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the foods put away and so forth   oh   because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is   oh uh theyre covered with like a heavy armor   umhum   type stuff uhhuh   and possums and uh raccoons   my word   and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack     uhhuh     and so that that uh that can be a problem if you dont put all your equipment away   oh but they wont necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything   they will if you attack them   oh   but most time they run away from you   uhhuh   if if they if they see youre up you know   uhhuh   but they dont have any problem walking right by you if youre asleep   oh my word     so   well that sounds a little less fierce than bears we       we want to go
