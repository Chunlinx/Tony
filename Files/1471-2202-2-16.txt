                    Background        The synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine        ACh in cholinergic neurons is dependent on the        availability of its precursor choline most of which is        derived from the circulation reviewed in     and        enters cholinergic neurons via a process catalyzed by a        specific transporter      Some of the choline used for        ACh synthesis is stored in membrane phosphatidylcholine        PC Previous studies have shown that this choline is        liberated from PC in a onestep reaction thus indicating        that it is produced by a phospholipase D PLD EC         an enzyme that hydrolyzes the phospholipid into choline        and phosphatidic acid PA     However the molecular        identity of this PLD remains to be determined        There are two distinct PCspecific mammalian PLDs        designated as PLD and PLD and encoded by separate genes             The two enzymes share  aminoacid identity        however regulation of their activity and cellular        localization are different PLD is an extracellular        signalactivated phospholipase its activity rises when        receptors for certain hormones growth factors        neurotransmitters cytokines and other mediators are        activated and upon treatment of cells with phorbol esters        reviewed in      Studies using recombinant PLD        tagged with green fluorescent protein or Fluepitopes        indicate that it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum        Golgi apparatus late endosomes and plasma membrane             reviewed in     In vitro basal PLD activity is        usually low and can be stimulated by a variety of factors        including phosphatidylinositol  bisphosphate PIP           protein kinase C PKC and several        small GTPases eg ADP ribosylation factors ARF and Rho        reviewed in      Regulation of PLD is less well        understood The enzyme exhibits a high constitutive        activity in vitro but it too can be activated by ARF        reviewed in     and by phorbol esters in intact        cells      Several reports have suggested that PLD is        mainly localized to the plasma membrane      possibly        in lipid rafts and caveolar membrane microdomains             Most studies on the physiological functions of PLDs have        focused on the product PA a second messenger involved in        mitosis cellular morphological changes and vesicular        trafficking reviewed in      However the        downstream events that occur as a consequence of        PLDgenerated PA production and the identity of target        proteins that are directly regulated by PA remains to be        determined PA can be further metabolized to diacylglycerol        DAG and lysophosphatidic acid by PA phosphohydrolase and        phospholipase A           respectively DAG is an activator of        certain isozymes of PKC and lysophosphatidic acid acts as        an intercellular messenger for many cell types        The second product of PLDcatalyzed PC hydrolysis        choline is used by all cells as a precursor of PC and        uniquely by cholinergic neurons as precursor of ACh        Previous studies have shown that choline derived from PC is        indeed used for ACh synthesis       and that this        choline is generated by a PLD      This pathway may        become particularly important when extracellular        circulating choline concentrations are low eg during        dietary choline deficiency or when ACh synthesis and        release are accelerated by high neuronal activity thus        generating a high demand for choline            In the present study we used a cholinergic cell line        SN     which is derived from the fusion of septal        neurons of postnatal day  mice with NTG murine        neuroblastoma cells as a model for cholinergic neurons in        order to determine the possible role of PLD  and PLD in        generating choline for ACh synthesis We found that the        cells express exclusively PLD and that downregulating PLD        expression reduces ACh synthesis while overexpressing        andor stimulating PLD activity increases the synthesis of        the neurotransmitter indicating that PLDcatalyzed        hydrolysis of PC generates choline for ACh synthesis in        cholinergic cells                    Results        PLD mRNA was present in SN cells Fig A while PLD        message was undetectable either by Northern blot Fig A        or RTPCR data not shown Consistent with these results        an approximately  kDa PLD protein was found in SN        cells by Western blot however no PLD protein could be        detected Fig B Positive controls for these studies        showed that our PLD probe and antibody were robust in        detecting this PLD isoform in rat brain Fig  These        data show that SN cells express exclusively PLD and thus        experimental manipulations of the activity of this PLD        isoform were subsequently employed to determine if this        enzyme is capable of producing choline for ACh synthesis in        cholinergic cells In order to reduce PLD activity in SN        cells we sought to inhibit its expression The cells were        treated with a mer antisense oligonucleotide at        different concentrations and PLD mRNA levels were        measured Northern blot showed that PLD mRNA expression        was reduced by the antisense oligonucleotide in a        concentrationdependent manner Fig A and that at the        maximallyeffective concentration of the oligo  nM        this inhibition reached  Fig BC In contrast the        control oligomer was inactive Fig BC Consistent with        these findings Western blot showed that the antisense        oligomer decreased the PLD protein level by about         whereas the control oligomer had no significant effect on        PLD protein expression Fig DE Given the fact that        the transfection efficiency obtained in these experiments        was approximately  as determined with fluorescent        dyelabeled oligonucleotides data not shown the results        indicate that in cells that had taken up the antisense        oligomer the inhibition of PLD expression was        complete        Treatment of a variety of cell types with phorbol esters        activates PLD        Thus we hypothesized that        activation of PLD with PMA in SN cells would elevate        intracellular concentrations of its product choline and        result in increased ACh production We tested the effects        of PMA on PLD activity and ACh content in SN cells        incubated in a cholinefree medium Under these conditions        the choline precursor used for the synthesis of ACh is        derived entirely from the intracellular pool which        includes the choline in PC      Consistent with        previous studies treatment of the cells with PMA activated        PLD Fig A The maximal effects of PMA  fold        increase in the amount of its product         Hphosphatidylpropanol relative to controls was observed        after  minutes data not shown a time period employed        in subsequent studies Free choline accumulation was also        significantly increased by PMA The magnitude of this        effect tended to be small approximately  presumably        because free choline is a rapidly turning over metabolic        intermediate that does not accumulate in cells Fig B        Moreover PMA stimulated ACh accumulation by  Fig C        in the cells The fact that PMA increased both PLD activity        and ACh content provided the initial evidence for a        relationship between the endogenous PLD activity ie        PLD and ACh production In control studies performed in        the presence of choline  M in the medium PMA had no        effect on ACh levels data not shown indicating that it        did not stimulate the process of ACh synthesis but only the        supply of choline        Next the effect of downregulation of PLD activity on        ACh levels was studied in cells transfected with either        control or antisense oligomer and treated with PMA In the        absence of PMA the antisense oligomer decreased PLD        activity by  Although small this change was        statistically significant p   In the presence of        PMA antisense oligomer decreased PLD activity by         Fig A Concomitantly the cellular choline content was        decreased by  both in the presence and absence of PMA by        the antisense oligomer Fig B Moreover the antisense        oligomer decreased the cellular ACh content by        approximately  compared to control oligomer treated        cells both in the presence and absence of PMA Fig C        These results indicate that downregulation of PLD activity        by antisense oligomers in SN cells decreases not only the        endogenous PLD activity but also the intracellular choline        and ACh content These results are consistent with the        hypothesis that PLD can generate choline for ACh synthesis        in SN cells        To further confirm this hypothesis we transiently        transfected the cells with a mouse PLD expression plasmid        Overexpression of PLD for  hours in the cells caused a         increase of basal PLD activity and this activity was        further increased by PMA by fold Fig A To examine        the ACh synthesis and choline turnover in these PLD        transfectants the cells and the media were collected and        ACh and choline content were measured In the absence of        PMA overexpression of PLD alone increased intracellular        ACh levels by  and choline concentrations in the medium        by  In the presence of PMA intracellular ACh levels        and choline concentration in the medium rose further in the        PLD transfectants reaching values more than twofold        higher than those in the control cells Fig BC        Together with the data presented above these results show        that upregulation of PLD activity by overexpression        andor stimulation with PMA increases intracellular ACh        levels        A recent immunohistochemical study of PLD expression in        rat brain showed that this PLD isoform was expressed in        neurons in medial septum cranial motor nuclei and ventral        spinal cord     all areas of the central nervous        system enriched with cholinergic neurons These data raised        the possibility that certain populations of cholinergic        neurons may express PLD in addition to or instead of        PLD Therefore we transfected SN cells with PLD        expression construct in order to determine if choline        generated by this enzyme could be used as ACh precursor        Transfection of PLD into SN cells resulted in increased        PLD activity and ACh synthesis in a fashion similar to that        observed in PLD transfectants Fig  indicating that        choline generated by PLD was converted to ACh                    Discussion        In the present study we sought to establish which PLD        isoform is the endogenous enzyme that generates the choline        precursor for ACh synthesis in cholinergic neurons using        as a model the SN basal forebrain cell line We found        that these cells expressed exclusively PLD a property        that facilitated subsequent experiments First antisense        oligonucleotides were used to downregulate endogenous PLD        activity Although only  of the cells took up the        oligonucleotides PLD mRNA protein expression and        activity were reduced proportionally to the transfection        efficiency of the antisense oligomer demonstrating high        efficacy of this technique in the transfected cells        Significantly intracellular choline and ACh content were        similarly decreased by the antisense oligonucleotides        indicating that PLDcatalyzed hydrolysis of PC provides        choline for ACh synthesis Next PLD activity was        upregulated by either overexpressing a mouse PLD protein        andor by stimulation with PMA Both PLD overexpression        and stimulation with PMA increased PLD activity choline        production and ACh accumulation Moreover PLD        transfection and PMA treatment had a synergistic effect on        PLD activity and ACh levels        Our observation that PLD but not PLD was present in        SN cells raised the possibility that the former might be        preferentially expressed in cholinergic neurons The data        are consistent with the report that a variant of PC cells        also express exclusively PLD    and this expression is        stimulated by nerve growth factor     a treatment        known to upregulate the cholinergic phenotype of PC cells             PLD mRNA is abundant in many regions of the        adult rodent central nervous system      including        cerebellum frontal cortex hippocampus hypothalamus        midbrain brainstem striatum and spinal cord     The        latter three regions are enriched with cell bodies of        cholinergic neurons PLD is also highly expressed in brain        tissue       notably in neurons in medial septum        cranial motor nuclei and ventral spinal cord     all        of which are likely cholinergic However no data are        currently available on the possible coexpression of PLD        andor PLD and cholinergic markers eg choline        acetyltransferase in vivo Transfection of PLD into SN        cells resulted in increased PLD activity and ACh production        suggesting that PLD like PLD could potentially be used        to supply choline for ACh synthesis Thus while the        catalytic activities of both PLD and PLD appear to be        equivalent in generating choline for ACh synthesis in        transfected cells it is possible that the modes of        regulation of their activity might specify which one is        expressed in a particular population of cholinergic neurons        in vivo It will be important to determine the mechanisms        that control the expression of the two PLD isoforms and        their possible relationships with the mechanisms that        regulate the cholinergic phenotype        Stimulation of PLD activity by PMA and the resulting        increase of ACh synthesis from PLDgenerated choline        indicates that this pathway is regulated by PMAresponsive        PKC isozymes In vivo this form of regulation of ACh        synthesis would be controlled by neurotransmitters released        by neurons that innervate particular cholinergic cells        There are multiple neurotransmitters whose receptors are        coupled to PKCdependent activation of PLD     and thus        this mode of regulating the availability of choline for ACh        synthesis is likely to be widespread Significantly among        the five subtypes of muscarinic ACh receptors MAChRs Ml        and M receptors have been shown to efficiently activate        PLD and PKC in various cell types                whereas activation of PLD by M and M receptors is less        robust     These observations suggest that in a        cholinergic synapse ACh released into the synaptic cleft        might stimulate PLD activity leading to a release of        choline that could be used for ACh synthesis Since these        MAChRs may be present on the pre and postsynaptic neurons            this choline may be derived from PC residing in        the membranes of either However while the        presynapticallyderived choline released into the cytoplasm        can be converted directly to ACh the choline released by        the postsynaptic cell must be initially taken up by the        cholinergic nerve terminals Our previous results in        cholinergic human neuroblastoma LAN cells indicated that        the choline moiety from PC breakdown was released directly        into the cytoplasm    and a kinetic study using         Hcholine in BHK cells also showed that choline was        initially released inside the cells by PMAactivated PLD        and then rapidly appeared in the medium     Consistent        with the latter study we also observed a rise in the        medium choline levels in SN cells transfected with either        PLD or PLD and treated with PMA        Although it is clear that the PLDgenerated choline is        efficiently utilized by cholinergic cells LAN and SN        as a precursor of ACh the quantitative significance of        this pathway and mechanisms that regulate it remain to be        fully determined Studies on a variety of preparations        indicate that most of the choline used for ACh synthesis is        derived from the extracellular space reviewed in            and therefore the PLD pathway has to be considered as an        accessory process Interestingly PLD activity is        upregulated in the hippocampus of rats whose mothers        consumed a cholinesupplemented diet during pregnancy            Given that prenatal choline supplementation improves        memory and attention     two cognitive functions that        require the hippocampal cholinergic system it is possible        that the upregulated PLD pathway underlies at least in        part the cognitive enhancement observed in the prenatally        cholinesupplemented animals        Abnormalities in the PLDmediated release of choline        would be expected to result in an impairment of cholinergic        neurotransmission andor in a generalized malfunction of        cholinergic cells Alzheimers disease AD is        characterized by such a malfunction together with        degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and it        is thought that memory loss in this disease is partly        caused by this cholinergic lesion     In vitro studies        point to two novel mechanisms that might cause        dysregulation of PLD activity in AD The first is based on        observations that PLD is inhibited by synuclein            a protein of unknown function that accumulates in the        amyloid deposits in AD brain Normally synuclein is        present in the synaptic nerve terminals including those of        cholinergic neurons      but in AD its processing is        altered causing it to be abnormally deposited in plaques        composed primarily of aggregates of amyloid peptide            However how this abnormal turnover of synuclein        contributes to the pathophysiology of AD remains to be        determined Recent in vitro observations that synuclein        is phosphorylated by G proteincoupled receptor kinases        and that this phosphorylation relieves its inhibitory        action on PLD     suggest a novel mechanism by which        neurotransmitter receptors including muscarinic receptors        might modulate PLD activity Since multiple receptor        classes are affected by the pathophysiological processes of        AD     abnormal phosphorylation of synuclein may        contribute to both altered synuclein turnover and        abnormal regulation of PLD activity The second set of        observations indicate that reactive oxygen species ROS        activate PLD in a PKCdependent manner     There is        much evidence that ROS generation is upregulated in AD        brain     Thus it is possible that PLD may be        activated in this disease resulting perhaps in        dysregulation of PC metabolism Indeed evidence of an        accelerated PC turnover has been repeatedly observed in        postmortem samples of AD brain        as well        as in an in vitro model of this disease characterized by        the generation of ROS                        Conclusions        Most of the previous studies on the physiological        functions PLDs have concentrated on the role of its        product PA     Our data show that PLD has a dual        function in cholinergic cells as the second product of its        activity choline is used as a metabolic precursor of ACh        and suggest that this pathway may be regulated by the type        of PLD isoform expressed in a particular class of        cholinergic neurons In our basal forebrainderived SN        cells this isoform is PLD However our observations that        PLD overexpression increases ACh production form        endogenous sources suggest that PLD may serve the same        function as PLD in other cholinergic cells Moreover the        data showing that this pathway is stimulated by PMA        suggest that it is subject to regulation by PKCactivating        neurotransmitters The physiological and possible        pathophysiological significance in neurological diseases        of this pathway remains to be determined It will also be        important to determine how cholinergic cells regulate the        metabolism of PA  a compound with multiple signaling and        structural functions  when the PLD pathway is stimulated        to meet the demand for choline                    Materials and Methods                  Materials          Dulbeccos
