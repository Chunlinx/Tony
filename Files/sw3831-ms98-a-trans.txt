              okay uh yeah Middle East and   yeah uh well you know its really ironic because its just about a year ago today we were involved you know actively in that war that was going on at this time and uh   yeah i guess last week was the uh anniversary of everything but uh   uhhuh yeah yeah uhhuh   thats thats one of those  messed up areas i mean its just   uhhuh   i i i think that the whole operation you know the idea of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a i dont know i mean that were going to have peace you can have maybe some little more stability that what they have right now but   um uhhuh   its just thats pure hatred between the Israelis and the uh Arabs i mean its just i just dont think they can coexist i mean because theyre not ever going to you know its just too many problems that   yeah well it it it certainly is not a an easy situation to deal with but uh i uh i i remember last year when the war was going on that i actually was uh if one can be in any way relieved when a war is going on but at least Israel listened to the uh admonitions of the United States about not retaliating uh when those missiles were dropped on them   right   and amazingly we we had those weapons that would counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage uh the whole thing was very amazing to me i dont think any any of it is right i mean we should be doing any of that stuff oh its such an misuse of what we are as people but under the circumstances i could not help thinking that probably uh you know five or ten years ago i dont i dont even think that same kind of uh respect uh sufficiently for the United States would have been there that Israel wouldnt have just gone ahead you know uh like that uh Arafat and the and the the P L O and everything would just you know be so rambunctious as to just to retaliate and even even cause worse damage i oh it was a very terrible thing but uh its uh   uhhuh yeah im im amazed uh Israel didnt even uh   uhhuh they did   retaliate that that thats one of the most surprising things   yeah yeah well i guess you know so long as our uh missile systems were holding out to counteract what was being thrown in and things seemed to be working i guess its   im uh but   its really worth trying for peace or at least coexistence like you said uh and they have actually gone to peace talks uh since the time of that war to try to hit some kind of a a common ground for coexistence uh   yeah in fact Baker was uh a speech yesterday trying to get them back theyre supposed to be going back to tables pretty soon the next week or two i guess but   yeah uhhuh   uh theyll you know theyll work out some type of an agreement and something will pop up in about five years and   oh sure   the fact that we never got uh Hussein out hopefully that will fall apart on its own in the next year or so but   uhhuh   i mean if he ever gets any type of military power back i mean for that area thats just going to be same situation again and   uhhuh   i dont know Bush   um   i just think should have gone in and just take take him out that would have that was a major problem   yeah well it amazes me that the guy is still there yeah yeah is not around   just him being just hes powerless but still the fact that hes still in power its over there thats a symbol of   very strange uhhuh   he stood up to the evil force of the western world and i mean thats just completely different mode of thinking and   you know yeah   to them what they view view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view but   yeah um   so i its i just i dont know the only thing that keeps us there is the oil and i guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying twice as much more now for gas but   oh well thats hopefully not the essential issue to mankind but uh   i mean well it is for the money makers out there i guess but   yeah uhhuh   i dont know its its kind of hard for me to really   yeah   imagine i mean ive never even been over in that part of the world i had a friend of mine that got back and   oh really yeah   hes sort of there and hes just said that he just really he couldnt stand the the uh Saudis at all because he said they just didnt have any respect for them at all just   mentality like oh really   yeah they didnt he just really had a hard time you know   oh   i look at it as a he looked at it as a job he wasnt like   uhhuh   because he didnt like the people and no one did he said they just didnt they didnt want them over there the people they didnt like them and   um   you know they had all these rules you couldnt bring any type of religious artifacts in or   oh thats right thats right   any type of alcohol anything like that hes just   yeah oh that thats in Arabia   and they they have like this they look down at the soldiers the American soldiers and he said its just   um   you have a hard time you know fighting for their cause   yeah   and to me to its i dont know its just its just totally backward everything you know black is white and   yeah   white is black to them i mean that doesnt make sense but   yeah well it makes you wonder how how
