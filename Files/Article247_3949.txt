                                 Twilight of the TaxCutters                        No one has told the Wall Street Journal editorial writers to besure but pushing for tax cuts has become the political equivalent of floggingthat proverbial dead horse Congressional Republicans watched their proposed billion tax cut disappear from sight without much of a fight Steve Forbesis the only presidential candidate still banging the flattax drum and even hehas reinvented himself as a social conservative Earlier this summer AlanGreenspan notoriouslyat least for those on the rightsaid hed rather see abudget surplus go toward paying down the debt than toward a major tax cut Andmost polls show that the American public ranks lower taxes low on the totempole of priorities for the government            Its true that if you frame poll questions about taxes differently you getdifferent responses Greenspan did say he would prefer a tax cut to moregovernment spending and its safe to assume that the Republican Party platformin  will call for a significant tax cut But that call sounds increasinglyhollow at least from an intellectual perspective and the reason is not justthat bringing the budget into balance via in no small part the  taxincrease has proved to have pleasant side effects for the economy Even moreimportant is the fact that much of the Reaganite case for tax cutting dependedon the harsh reality of life in an inflationary economy            Supplysiders have now become among the most ardent advocates of the ideathat inflation is dead and that therefore the economy can safely grow muchfaster than it has in the past But they dont appear to have considered whatthe death of inflation might mean for their taxcutting fervor            In Wealth and Poverty  for instance George Gilder made the impact ofinflation central to his emphasis on taxcutting Effectively calling for anend to the capitalgains tax he wrote With a rate of inflation over percent a  percent tax on capital gains quickly rises above  percent inits average impact on assets held more than a few years Contrasting thesituation of the late s with that of the early s when top marginalrates on income and capital gains ranged as high as  percent he noted thatthe real tax rate is far higher not lower than it was during the days ofKennedys Camelot  The real tax was not  percent but  percent of anominal amount of earnings that was mostly inflation combined with a declinein the value of principal equal to the rate of inflation            What Gilder was pointing to here was in fact important Because tax bracketsand capital gains are not indexed the combination of rapid inflation and hightaxes ends up eating away most real gains It works something like compoundinterest in reverse In the s just staying ahead of the game took a lot ofeffort            The really important blow against this state of affairs was not the Reagantax cuts but rather Paul Volckers interestrate hikes which endeddoubledigit inflation And in any case the reduction of the capitalgains taxon longterm investments to  percent had already happened in  by thetime Wealth and Poverty was published Regardless though there wassomething to the idea that in a time of high inflation high marginal tax ratesacted as a disincentive to both investment and labor            But we dont live in a time of high inflation anymore Actually we dontseem to live in a time of inflation at all And with a rate of inflation of percent or so a capitalgains tax of  percent has an average impact onassets of about well  percent And if you look at the trading volume onUS stock exchanges its pretty clear that the  percent rate onshortterm gains isnt keeping too many people from investing As for bracketcreep Im not sure anyone even remembers what that is Which doesnt mean thatwe need to go back to  But it does mean that from an economic perspectiveat least ardent taxcutters need to come up with a new idea Perhaps theycould call it the PostInflation Paradigm
