                                 Warrior Queens                           Elizabeth is a luridparaphrase of the old Groucho Marx line about Doris Day I knew the VirginQueen before she was a virgin As the movie tells it she was a sylvanredheaded princess Cate Blanchett given to gamboling with her fella JosephFiennes between periods of internment in the Tower of London on charges ofconspiring to

The director Shekhar Kapur made the same pointin his grim  Indian epic The Bandit Queen  against a backdrop ofscrubby plains along the Ganges Is this feminist take historically accurateProbably although the evidence suggests that Elizabeth had developed a headfor stratagems earlier in life her position had been precarious since thebeheading of her mother and came to the throne with few girlish illusionsabout How Things Work in a barbarous state            That said the movies approach makes for juicy melodramaThe tone of Elizabeth comes nearer to the nihilistic relish of Jacobeanssuch as John Ford and John Webster than to the more sorrowful horror of theElizabethan dramatists Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare Its even closer toa Jacobean drama of our own age The Godfather  which it emulatesby cutting backandforth between queen and courtiers in prayer and the roundupand slaughter of Catholics on their privies in bed with their mistresses andso on Their severed

casuallydismissive its like no other musical ever made Its determinedly swirlingdiscursive elliptical Now the story is told by an omniscient narrator now aTV reporter now a participant Now its flashing back now forward Everyother line of dialogue is a cue for one of its dazzling numbers largely coversof songs by Brian Eno Bryan Ferry and T Rex The narrative is a challenge tokeep up with but

of the Incredible Shrinking Man            It waspartly my passion for Haynes films that led me to accept a job offer from hisindefatigable producer Christine Vachon last year to collaborate on anutsandbolts book about producing Shooting To Kill  So my review ofVelvet Goldmine like my review ofVachons other recent release Happiness should be read as the work ofa partisan But not a blind partisan            In Velvet Goldmine  Haynes sets out to demonstratethe power of popular music to change peoples livesto tell them its OK tofashion themselves into anything they please The core of the movie turns outnot to be the Bowie figure but the journalist Arthur Stuart who was a witnessto the events hes now reconstructing Bale is such an expressive performerthat Stuarts remembrance of things past attains a Proustian intensity To himSlade was a sexual messiah Ive never seen a more vivid distillation of rocksallure than the scene in which he reverently opens the new Brian Sladealbumits centerfold image is a lithe naked greentinged MaxwellDemonslips the vinyl out of its paper jacket and after gingerly setting theLP on the turntable props a chair under the doorknob to keep theuncomprehending world at bay            But if Haynes wants VelvetGoldmine to be an anthem to the principles Bowie once embodiedthe embraceof artifice and the smashing of conventional sexual roleshe also wants toportray the rocker as a hollow opportunist who abandoned glam and bisexualityfor the life of a corporate superstar throwing in his lot with the forces ofrepression Thats a lot to cover An actor of stature might have bridged thesetwo impulses but the beautiful brazenly slimhipped RhysMeyers doesnt makehis lines sound as if hes thinking them up on the spot and Sladesselfdestructive passion for Curt Wild Ewan McGregor the films fuzzy sweetIggy Pop figure seems less an emotional imperative than a thematic one            A case canbe made that Velvet Goldmine isnt fully filled in and that Haynes whohas never shaken off his background as a semiotics major has made a moviethats all signifiers I sometimes found myself wishing he would let thepicture catch its breath that the performers would stop coming at me instroboscopic flashes But then Id be swept up in the sinuous motion of hisfilmmaking in the elation of watching point of view passed like a baton fromhand to hand in the liberating force of his language and soundtrack VelvetGoldmine might seem like a collection of baubles but those baubles arestrung            Is Brad Pitt the worst actor on

considerable weight so that whether or not Death takes himbefore he can stop to smell the roses and make amends to his neglected childrenbecomes a matter of some suspense The rest of the cast works
