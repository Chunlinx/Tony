                                                            Dowism                        In  Bruce Gottlieb like Clive Crook before himthinks he has found a flaw in our argument that stocks are undervalued He hasnot In a                   Slate                 last year Crook claimed that we werecontending that the value of a company is the present value of its stream offuture earnings and that such a contention was false Gottliebs piece in aneasytofollow way demonstrates Crooks argument that if you value a firm bydiscounting its earnings and all earnings are not paid out in dividends thenyou are doublecounting            But the problem with what Crook and Gottlieb aresaying is that we never based our theory on earnings but instead as wewrote in our Wall Street Journal piece on March   on the moneya stock will put in your pockets through the profits generated by the companythat issued it Neither in this years piece nor in our March  Journal piece did we claim that all those profitsorearningswould go into your pockets What we said explicitly was that theproper figure to use to measure the cash generated by a company was somewherebetween the lower bound of the dividend that a firm pays and the upper bound ofits official aftertax earnings Indeed in our first piece we explicitlyhighlighted the fact that earnings are a problematic measure of cash flowbecause of the potential that a firm might grow simply through retentions            But Crook and Gottlieb are intelligentwellintentioned journalists What led them astray They both cite an argumentagainst our first piece raised by Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School Heclaimed that it is a mistake to assume that dividends per share will postreal growth as we did in our calculations because dividends in theoryshould only just keep up with inflation            Crook and Gottlieb appear to have been convincedthat real earnings growth only reflects retentions and that real dividendgrowth must be zero While Siegels point fits the simplest introductoryeconomic models it is contradicted by the facts Historical data on dividendsreveal significant real growth of dividends per share For example in thelatest edition of Siegels excellent book Stocks for the Long Run  Table on Page  shows that the growth of real dividends per share has been percent on average since  and positive since the  th centuryIn our calculations we assume  percent real growth in dividends            What Siegel Crook and Gottlieb say canthappendividends growing faster than inflationhas been going on for almost years Where has all this growth come from We treat that question atlength in our book relating the observation to theories at the frontier of thebranch of economics known as Industrial Organization but here is a hint Thesimplest textbook model of the perfectly competitive firm doesnt do a greatjob of describing the companies that have driven the market higher andhigher            Discounting dividends is uncontroversial and thefact that they grow is clear It is interesting that Gottlieb says that on thestrength of dividends alone the Dow should be about  using our theoryThat is a good start Even sticking with dividends alone the number is pushedconsiderably higher than that if one accounts for repurchases and the taxadvantage associated with them So much for the crazy stock market bubble Dow is clearly a lowerbound estimate Today many enormous firms dont paydividends at all These firms have value because ultimately they will delivercash to their shareholders            Crook and Gottlieb think that all valuationtechniques are out the window for firms that dont pay dividends but they aremisinformed There is a very large peerreviewed academic literature on thistopic The basic idea is simple You can base a value measure on earningsinstead of dividends if you can identify those things that you aredoublecounting and make sure that you only count them once For exampleearnings themselves are a reasonable measure of the dividend that you use toconstruct the value of the firm if all earnings are paid out each year Such anexample is no pipe dream Real Estate Investment Trusts for example pay out percent of their earnings and many of them post earnings growth well aboveinflation year after year In  alone REITs on average are expected toincrease their earnings by  percent with inflation at about  percent Whenfirms retain lots of earnings it gets more complicated with the growth ofearnings increasing as more and more cash is retained in the firm For thosewho cant wait until the fall release date of our book Dow  andwant to start thinking through these issues check out the Spring  issue ofthe journal Contemporary Accounting Research  which provides a number ofvaluable review articles of the some of the relevant academic work            It is impossible toaddress every conceivable objection in a short article in the Wall StreetJournal or                   Slate                which is one reason we are writing ourbook We look forward to picking up this debate in the fall when we lay all ourfacts and arguments on the table Until that time we have a little homeworkassignment for Gottlieb and anyone else at                   Slate                who would liketo try Microsofts earnings have grown at an average rate of about  percentannually over the past  years Microsoft pays no dividends Were allMicrosofts earnings consumed in running in place as Gottliebs modelsuggests Should Microsoft be worth nothing since it doesnt pay an actualdividend today Was the price increase over that period justified What would afair price for Microsoft be if the risk premium were zero We look forward totheir answers                           James K Glassman and Kevin Hassett Washington                                             Bruce Gottliebreplies                               Glassman and Hassett write in to say I havemisrepresented their argument They do not they say value a stock by lookingat future earnings They even agree that this would be a big mistake Theyclaim to look instead at future cash flows to stockholders The two authorsmight want to reread their original WSJ article which says Assumethat aftertax earnings are a reasonable estimate of the cash flow from astock In other words there is no difference between my description of theirargument and their own                                       Meanwhile they have misrepresented myargument My article does not say or imply that real earnings growth onlyreflects retentions and that dividend growth must be zero or that allvaluation techniques are out the window for firms that dont pay dividends Itsimply asserts that in calculating a firms potential value you cant assumethat earnings are simultaneously retained and paid outand that theGlassmanHassett argument depends on precisely these conflicting assumptionsThe argument is fallacious whether all the earnings are paid out all areretained or anything in between                                       Glassman and Hassett now claim that they willsort out the components of retained earnings to avoid doublecounting in theirforthcoming book I look forward to it But I boldly predict it wont workunless they have an entirely new thesis since doublecounting of corporateearnings is the core of their current one The thesis is simply wrong andcannot be refined into sense Whats more doublecounting of all corporateearnings is how they get the figure in their title Dow  sothat will have to go if they even start down Refinement Road                                       Its obvious thatour discussion must rest until this ambitious book is published For right nowit is worth noting that this letter is the first place where Glassman andHassett have explicitly admitted that equating earnings and dividends is amathematical sin They refer to it as doublecounting which indeed itis                                       Speaking With theEnemy                        Ive never read a more paranoid piece of writingthen James J Cramers  At the risk of being lumped into Cramers legion ofenemies I thought it worth highlighting some of the absurdities in thepiece            Cramer writes that TokyoMexs online following is much bigger than mine And my record of giving good financial guidancepublicly and privately is better than his So why the fuss over me while otherportfolio managers write every day about their stock picks and get no heatTokyoMexs activities deserve notice but its ridiculous to say that hisfollowing via his own small Web site and Silicon Investor chat rooms isbigger than Cramers whose thoughts have been distributed through not onlyTheStreetcom but also ABCNEWScom Good Morning America  GQ Yahoo Squawk Box  SmartMoney  Time  and PoliticallyIncorrect  among other media properties with vast audiences TokyoMex maybe unsavory but Cramer just sets him up as a straw man to burn him Justbecause Cramer is more ethical than an infamous pumpanddumpster doesnt meanthat his unusual position as both professional money manager and professionalfinancial journalistand yes it is unusualisnt deserving of scrutiny andcriticism The dual role is Cramers gimmick and more power to him for havingthe energy to exploit the possibilities inherent in straddling two worlds Ifind his columns entertaining more often than not But his situation isntcommon so the argument of everyone does it why pick on me isntrelevant            Then Cramer says I dont write for the money andI dont write for the notoriety so giving them up wouldnt hurt If itstrue then give up your  salary and your stock options inTheStreetcom stop writing about your personal life in your musings andremove the iconic projection of yourself from your Web site You dont have tostop providing the insights that only you can give to the ignorant investingmasses in order to forgo the money and fame that come along with your positionAnd frankly you shouldnt have to But do us all the favor of not acting likeyoure just being noble            Cramer continues There is no difference betweena portfolio manager who recommends stocks in an interview to a reporter  anda portfolio manager who recommends stocks in a column of his own Say whatExtending that logic theres no difference between a government that promotesits policies to an independent press and a government that runs its ownnewspapers The second of the two scenarios Cramer describes conflates theinterested role of the portfolio manager with the presumably disinterested roleof the journalist Dont tell me there arent ethical challenges in that beyondthose posed by the first scenario            Finally Cramer writes The journalists who wouldstop me are complicit with that ignorance and are willing tools of those thatwould like the reader to have to rely on those who charge high commissions orhigh fees to unknowing worried consumers of finance This is a low blow Thegeneral tone of Cramers piece is dismissive of financial journalists or atleast those who would criticize him as knownothings or worse conspirerswith the dark forces of the finance industry But Ive read Alan Abelson theonly enemy Cramer refers to by name offandon since I first got interestedin investing and whatever else he is he isnt a tool of the industry Norare the vast majority of financial journalists Sure there are some hacks butmost are intelligent folks who have the interests of their readers at the topof their agenda Cramer notes that if investors dont find his writing worthyhe will disappear from the writing firmament Well isnt that what wouldhappen to the established business press that Cramer so disdains if hisaccusations were even partly true            I really do likeTheStreetcom and                   Slate                and I have my own conflicts I work forMorningstar whose site at wwwmorningstarnet is a competitor toTheStreetcom a supplier to MoneyCentral etc But Cramers screed didntreflect well on your publication or his                   Slate                has beenunwittingly caught in the crossfire that has been going on for a few yearsbetween Alan Abelson and James Cramer It would have been better if youreditors had dispatched the enviably good James Surowiecki to cover the feud orif you had invited the two to duke it out in a Dialogue Luckily I donthave to cancel my subscription to your zine in a fit of pique             Cebra Graves New York City                           Good and NecessaryEvil

American involvement in World War II was agood thingyet I doubt anyone would want it to happen again There are otherless dramatic examples surely David Kaczynskis decision to alert the FBI tohis brothers suspicious activities was the right choice Nonetheless few ofus would want to face that decision ourselveseven if we are confident that wewould have chosen similarly Not all moral choices are painless One can want aparticular practice to be rare just because it is painful even if it ismorally required and not just permissible So there is no contradiction inwanting abortions to be safe

in World War II was a good thing and hopefullynot rare I would hope that the United States would defend itself every time afascist power bombs Pearl Harbor Likewise I would hope that David Kaczynskisgood thing in informing the FBI of evidence bearing on his brothers guilt wasalso not a rare thing I would hope that every time Kaczynski or anybody elsefor that matter discovers that a brother of his is an environmentalistextremist bent on murdering people that he will inform the FBI of thisevidence If abortion like defending oneself against fascists andenvironmentalist murderers is a good thing than it should not be rare Goodbehavior should never be rare It should be routine                                                         Time IsMoney                        I have great respect and admiration for MarshallLoeb thats not a throwaway line I really do but his explanation that hewas getting paid by Time  not the advertisers is kind of funny seeCulturebox  Imagine how                   Slate                and others would slice me upif you found out I was running a magazine about journalismone that some calla watchdogand was getting paid writing assignments from one of theorganizations I was supposed to be watching and of course not disclosing iton the pages of the magazine whenever the magazine writes about thatorganization Youd probably even get a great quote from Marshall saying howtroubled he is by it Might they cancel future assignments if a piece in themagazine really stings them Might they add on assignments if a piececelebrates them Mightnt it all just look bad even if everyone behaveshonestly            For you to let thatexplanation go uncommented on was surprising Seems to me that getting paid byTime  as opposed to advertisers whom the Columbia
