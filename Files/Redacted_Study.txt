WT  Col  L   WT  Col  L  If the US Postal Service and FPAs were to pay each otherterminal dues applying full First Class mail rates to all LC and AOmail exchanged the US Postal Service would both pay and receivesubstantially larger sums It should be noted however that theCommission has not analyzed the impact of price elasticity on thevolumes of inbound and outbound mail Table  line  shows thatunder a domestic postagebased system the US Postal Servicewould have paid  million more in FY  than it collectedan increase of  million See line column  Table  furthershows that the total payments to industrialized countries wouldincrease from  million to  million a  percent increase Incolumn  compare line  to line  IC payments to theUS Postal Service would increase from  million to  millionIn

and combined would account for percent of the increase in the ICterminal dues net balance would account for  million and wouldaccount for  million This is due partly to the relatively highdomestic rates for these two countries compared to US domesticrates and partly to the disparity in the mail volumes exchangedbetween the US and these two countries and are among the threelargest recipients of US outbound mail the third being  USoutbound mail to and exceeds the inbound mail from each of thosecountries by about a toone ratio Thus the imbalance in thevolume of mail exchanged magnifies the effect of the relativelyhigher rates in these countries actually sent more mail to theUS than it receivedBasing terminal dues on domestic postage would have the oppositeeffect on the exchange of mail with developing countries Table shows that the US Postal Services payments to DCs would increasefrom  million to  million In column  compare line  to line while DC payments to the US Postal Service would increasefrom  million to  million In column  compare line  to line Thus the expenses associated with the exchange ofinternational mail to and from DCs would decrease by about million under a domestic postagebased terminal dues system Seecolumn  line Overall considering both the negative effect on expensesassociated with the exchange of mail to the ICs and the positiveeffect on expenses associated with the exchange of mail to DCs theimplication of this analysis is that a switch from the terminaldues system in effect in FY  to a domestic postagebased systemwould have a negative effect on the Postal Service of about million Column  line  This amount represents  percent ofthe revenues raised from international postage rates applicable toLC and AO mail dispatched to foreign postal administrationsexcluding Canada This result is valid to the extent that theassumptions concerning the weight profile of the mail and theapplicability of FirstClass rates to such mail are validIn addition it should be noted that the terminal dues changed onJanuary   The terminal dues that the US Postal Servicepaid to ICs and collected from ICs during FY  essentially equalthe terminal dues in effect on January   However theterminal dues between ICs will increase gradually over a threeyearperiod implying different results for subsequent periods Anotherchange beginning on January   is a new  percent surchargeon payments to DCs by ICs The monies generated by the surchargeflow into a common pool to be parceled out to DCs by the UPU forquality of service improvements The Commission chose the actual FY results as a convenient benchmark for measuring the effect ofa domestic postagebased terminal dues system For this reason FY actual results were not restated to reflect the effect of thesurcharge However the effect is relatively easy to calculateThe  percent surcharge would have added  million to the FY terminal dues cost  x  million in Table  line column  and column  This would also increase line  columns and  by  million Thus the US Postal Services FY  netterminal dues shown at line  column  would increase by  millionfrom  to   Since the surcharge would not apply in the domesticpostage scenario none of the figures in lines  to  wouldchange Table  line  column  shows the difference between theUS Postal Services actual net terminal dues in FY  million and if the terminal dues in FY  had been based ondomestic postage  million The difference is million Since the percent surcharge on DC payments would have decreased the FY net terminal dues to   this also would reduce the netbalance under a domestic postagebased system from  million minus  to  million  minus   Effect on Cost Coverage and Institutional Cost ContributionTable  below displays the revenue

should be notedthat Table  includes the revenues and attributable costs for thevolume of mail exchanged between the US Postal Service and Canadaeven though this study did not consider a change in

contribution of million Lines  through  show the effect of changing the methodof payment for the exchange of LCAO mail between the US and allother FPAs Changing the terminal dues system affects the USPostal Services inbound revenues and its outbound attributablecosts Thus comparing line  column  to line  column  showsthat inbound revenues increased from  million to  millionwhile comparing line  column  to line  column  shows thatattributable costs increased from  million to  million Thenet effect on the US Postal Services international mail financesis to reduce the contribution to institutional costs from million to  million a reduction of  million This amountreflects the net increase in the terminal dues net balance that theUS Postal Service would experience under a domestic postagebasedsystem as expected See table  Column  Line  It should benoted that had the  percent surcharge on DC terminal dues beenin effect in FY  the contribution under the current terminaldues

without consideringthe  percent surcharge would be reduced from  percent topercent and the cost coverage for inbound mail would increase from percent to percent Combining outbound and inbound mail andincluding incremental costs would result in an overall costcoverage of  percent compared to the FY  cost coverage of percentIf the US Postal Service wanted to recover the  million inlost contribution it could increase the rates on outbound LCAOmail excluding outbound rates to Canada by  percentAlternatively if it wanted to maintain the FY  overall costcoverage of  percent the US Postal Service could increasethose same rates by at least  percent There are of courseother contribution or cost coverage goals that could beselectedReliability of the Analysis There are four critical inputs tothis analysis  the distribution of outbound mail by weightinterval  the distribution of inbound mail by weight interval US Postal Service domestic postage rates and  FPAdomestic postage ratesThe Distribution of Outbound Mail by Weight Interval Like therates of theUS Postal Service the domestic postage rates of FPAs vary byweight interval Thus the analysis requires a distribution ofoutbound mail by weight interval As part of its annual submissionof data and workpapers to the Commission to support theCommissions Report to Congress on International Mail the PostalService provided the FY  billing determinant data for outboundmail This data include volumes by the weight intervals associatedwith the US Postal Services rates for outbound internationalmail Because the data are not maintained by individual countryexcept for Canada and Mexico it was not possible to develop aweight interval distribution for outbound mail unique to eachdestination FPA The Commission therefore assumed that the weightinterval distribution for all outbound mail sent to all FPAsexcluding Canada was a reasonable proxy for the weight intervaldistribution for mail sent to each FPA This distribution isapplied to the actual number of pieces sent to each country in FY Thus distortion could enter the analysis of US outboundmail if there are differences between the proxy distribution andthe actual distribution The Commission believes it unlikely thatthis would have a meaningful impact on the calculation of terminaldues based on FPA domestic ratesThe Distribution of Inbound Mailby Weight Interval The analysisalso requires a distribution of piece volumes by weight intervalfor inbound mail The Commission by a letter to the PostmasterGeneral requested this distribution from the Postal Service ThePostal Service responded that the information does not existHowever the Postal Service did provide as much detail as iscollected a volume distribution by transportation mode and shapefor sixty individual countriesIn the absence of data showing the weight distribution ofinbound mail the Commission employed as a proxy distributiondata developed by European postal administrations in the course ofpreparing a new terminal dues system The European system calledREIMS II relates terminal dues to domestic postageThis distribution represents the aggregate distribution for theREIMS II countries The REIMS II countries are all industrialcountries so the distribution is likely a reasonable approximationfor mail received by the US Postal Service from industrialcountriesDeveloping a distribution for inbound mail from DCs is moreproblematic The Commission was not able to obtain any data ondeveloping countries Generally LC mail is lighter than AO mailFurther studies by the Universal Postal Union indicate that theaverage weight for each shape envelope flat packet of mail sentfrom DCs to ICs is  to  percent less than the average weight ofmail from ICs to ICs Hence it appears likely that the proportionof LC to AO mail is less for inbound mail than for outbound In theabsence of specific data however the Commission assumed that theREIMS II data would be a reasonable proxy for DCs also Thisassumption seems likely to result in an overstatement of thedomestic postage that would be collected on inbound mail Themagnitude of the overstatement cannot be estimated withconfidenceAs noted the REIMS II data was separated by shape lettersflats and small packets Because the US Postal Servicesavailable inbound LCAO volume data is reported separately forsurface and air the Commission applied two separate REIMS IIdistributions For Air LCAO mail the distribution for all shapeswas used because inbound Air LCAO contains all shapes For SurfaceLCAO mail the distribution for flats and small packets combinedwas used for two reasons First the volume of inbound surfaceletters is negligible Second the average weight per piece was ounces in FY  This implies that the surface mailstream iscomposed of flats and small packets These distribution keys appearto reasonably reflect the distribution of inbound of mail subjectto the caveats aboveThe REIMS II data did not identify the volume of cards Becausethere are inbound cards the Commission assumed that therelationship between US outbound cards and the total volume ofoutbound Air LCAO mail applies to inbound mail Air LCAO Thereasonableness of the assumption is unknownThe Selection of US PostalService Domestic Rates Based onfield observations and some discussions with US Postal Servicefield personnel the Commission determined that no inbound mailwould be likely to meet the eligibility requirements for domesticbulk business rates Thus any inbound mail piece would pay theFirstClass rate or the Priority Mail rate for items weighing morethan  ounces Although inbound books and records might beeligible for the Media Mail rates the amount of this mail isminimal For these reasons the Commission has applied the USPostal Services domestic rates for FirstClass and Priority Mailto the inbound mail distribution described above Of course if theUS Postal Service made available domestic bulk business rates toFPAs FPAs might prepare inbound mail so that it would meet theeligibility requirements The Commissions analysis does not takeinto account this possibility However because the discounts forbulk mail are cost based any lost revenues should be offset bycorresponding reduced costsThe Selection of FPA Domestic Rates To obtain FPA domesticrates the Commission used the available FPA web sites TheCommission identified  sites with rates for industrial countriesand eight sites with rates for developing countries Because USPostal Service FirstClassPriority Rates were applied to inboundmail the Commission tried to identify the corresponding rates forthe FPAs Identifying these rates was problematic because manycountries do not have FirstClass rates for heavy mail USoutbound LCAO mail weighs up to  pounds To fill the gap inmissing FPA rates the Commission calculated an extra ounce ratebetween the two highest weight intervals for which there wererates The difference between the rates divided by the number ofgrams in the weight interval The proportion of volume covered bythis extrapolation procedure ranges from  percent to sevenpercent Although this approach seems reasonable there is apotential for substantial overstatement or understatement becausethe amount of estimated domestic postagebased terminal duescalculated under this procedure represents  percent of total ICpayments to FPAs and  percent of total DC payments The potentialdistortion is unquantifiable at this timeThe Commission also assumed that the average revenue per piecefor the  industrial countries whose rates were available appliedto the remaining  ICs whose rates were not available Similarlythe Commission assumed that the average revenue per piece for the developing countries with available rates applied to the remaining DCs without available rates The latter assumption is probablyweak but there is currently no way to improve upon itPotential Improvements to the Study In this study theCommission has sought to provide its best estimates within the timeprovided The analysis so far suggests the following possibilitiesfor further studyIndustrialized countries First it would be to desirable todevelop a separate estimate of the international mail revenuesassociated with outbound IC mail This would allow an estimate ofthe effect on international postage rates of shifting to domesticpostagebased terminal dues in the exchange of mail betweenindustrialized countries The use of domestic postagebasedterminal dues appears most feasible among industrializedcountriesSecond it would be informative to divide the IC mail exchangeinto LC and AO components LC mail is the most profitable mail andthe mail to which FirstClass domestic postage rates are mostlikely to be applicable in the future It seems likely that USand foreign mailers would prepare AO mail so that it would qualifyfor lower domestic rates applicable to printed matter andor lowerpriority delivery Hence a separate estimate of the financialeffects of shifting from terminal dues to domestic postage ratesfor LC mail is likely to identify the most significant persistentand predicable effects of a shift to domestic postagebased terminaldues To divide IC mail into LC and AO components we need furtherdata from the Postal Service or to make additional assumptionsThird our estimate of the revenue from inbound IC mail could beimproved by a specific study of the weight distribution of inboundmail received from IC FPAs by class of mail Our use of REIMS IIdata as a proxy for this distribution appears plausible but nomoreFourth we need to obtain the domestic postage rates for NewZealand and Israel the only significant outbound IC mail flowsomitted from this analysisDeveloping countries The first improvement needed in regard toDC mail is a specific study providing the weight distribution ofinbound mail received from DC FPAs by class of mail This wouldallow a plausible estimate of the revenue the Postal Service wouldreceive by applying domestic postage rates to such mail Our use ofREIMS II data as a proxy for this distribution was necessary butnot realisticSecond further work would likely allow us to develop for ahigher percentage of outbound DC mail  estimates of thedomestic postage costs that would be incurred if the Postal Servicepaid domestic postage instead of terminal dues and  theoutbound mail revenues associated with such mail flows In thiseffort we would anticipate focusing on the most significant postaldestinations among the DCs rather than trying to analyze each andevery destinating DCThe Commission is attaching a disk with the electronicspreadsheets and a hard copy explanation of the procedures usedThe US Postal Service considers the terminal dues amountscontained in Table  commercially sensitive The US PostalService also considers the data in the electronic
