        Steve this is       like i mentioned Brian and i guess were going to want to be talking about child care uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care   well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care our kids are now fourteen and eighteen but uh  and so you know you go back   uhhuh     those many years and uh we didnt do it very much we i guess we were in a situation where we didnt need to be looking at uh two family income at the time   uhhuh uhhuh   and our kids were older but ive had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing   right   uh so it my involvement hasnt been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using how about yourself   uhhuh well uh were kind of lucky i im uh im working my wife isnt working and she is taking care of the kids also and and so we havent had to look for child care either which has been very nice but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh coworkers and associates that are looking for child care and some of the things that theyre very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know uh guidance counselor to student or you know uh adult to child relationship how many you know you dont want to have thirty or forty  kids and only one adult   right right   then uh something happens and the adult wouldnt be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well and uh   well   they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time so you know depends also upon the the level of the child we uh we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the   uhhuh   the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that theyre willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and its very important i feel uh that the kids interact with other children also its a its a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids so i dont know i i guess were kind of in the same boat we havent had to look very carefully for child care   yeah i  i kind of think that uh you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have   uhhuh   in one sense two forms of uh child care theres where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children   uhhuh uhhuh   and then otherwise there will be  the majority are cooperative day cares uh people form a coop and uh parents will work in the coop and put a fair number of hours       frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time theres some fairly good training programs   uhhuh   and and some of them formal two year programs   right right   uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing   i think its uh important like you mentioned thats a good idea on the uh parent coop because uh im very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i dont want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere i want to trust the people   yeah   and uh you know you hear in the newspaper you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know dont treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this situation  for awhile so   yeah  you know weve even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and  i guess   uhhuh   you know it are its uh typically uh whether its been child care in a home   uhhuh   or in a larger situation where actually its more of an institution and youve actually got children that most people would consider problem children and its not and its more of a group home rather than actually day care  type of facility uh so   yeah thats true thats true   well Steven its been   so
