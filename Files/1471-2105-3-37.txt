                    Background        Genomic cloning has revealed that most of the enzyme        families essential for maintaining cell growth have been        conserved throughout evolution     However mammalian        enzymes with different functional activity may have evolved        by combining elements from several bacterial ancestral        genes Even small proteins may contain several individual        domains that link them to different superfamilies            While many endonucleases share a common active site that is        highly conserved across many subfamilies identifying        residues that control substrate specificity requires        sophisticated analysis that combines both sequence        conservation and structural data              In this paper we distinguish using a wordbased        molego approach structural elements that control        substrate specificity We postulate here that elements        conserved in all the members of related protein families        dictate common structures and also common functions        ie individual steps in a complex reaction Areas that        affect substrate specificity will be less conserved in the        superfamily than they are in subfamilies of enzymes that        catalyze specific activities We have chosen to illustrate        this approach using the multifunctional family of DNA        repair proteins the apurinicapyrimidinic endonucleases        APEs which have a clearly defined bacterial ancestor         E coli exonuclease III ExoIII and        are distantly related to several enzymes with varying        substrate specificity        APEs are essential for mammalian cell growth and        bacterial survival in the presence of ionizing radiation        and DNA mutagens     They initiate repair of an abasic        DNA site by cleaving the phosphodiester backbone  of the        phosphodeoxyribose This generates the necessary         hydroxyl group for DNA polymerases pol   or  in        eukaryotes to insert the correct nucleotide in later steps        in the base excision repair pathway BERpathway             Recent crystal structures of huAPE complexed with DNA        containing an abasic site       combined with        sequence analysis and sitedirected mutagenesis have        defined the residues that participate in metal ion based        cleavage of the phosphate backbone of the DNA                        Mutations that greatly diminish the enzymatic activity        of huAPE do not affect and may even increase binding to        damaged DNA while nonspecific DNA binding remains low             Further mutations that have little effect on APE        activity in vitro prevent complementation of DNA repair        deficient         E coli  As seen with other DNA        repair enzymes     specificity determining residues        as yet unidentified for APEs must be distinct from those        involved in phosphorolysis        To better assess which residues determine specificity        we assume that functions unique to APEs will be determined        by motifs that are not conserved in a similar fashion in        families with a different activity spectrum of functions        Besides cleaving the phosphate backbone to achieve        specificity APEs must coordinate a series of functions        including interaction with target DNA in a series of        small possibly repetitive steps scanning locating        damage sites establishing the transition state complex        completing the cleavage readjusting the charge status        within the active site and regulating release of product        after interaction with the next enzyme in the BER pathway                 A finer breakdown of these functions        can be achieved at the molecular level once all the        residues in the reaction mechanism are known APEs also        have RNase H exonuclease and phosphodiester        activities that are particularly high in the bacterial        members of the family             Our webbased MASIA program    was used to rapidly        decompose the sequences of APEs and related protein        families into motifs areas of significant conservation in        members of identical function which could then be        correlated structurally using data from crystal structures        Having determined that  motifs were common to all APEs        we compared the structure of the subset of these that        occurred in both DNase  and synaptojanin a member of the        IPP family These shared motifs had a similar D structure        in representatives of these functionally diverse families        and we therefore called these motifs molegos molecular        legos We then demonstrated that the shared molegos served        a similar role in substrate binding by comparing the DNA        binding profile of huAPE with that for the less specific        enzyme DNase  The molegos present in both enzymes        interact with target DNA in a similar fashion while        residues in molegos distinctive for APE control        specificity by binding primarily to the bases around the        apurinic site Matching of molegos guided by the degree of        conservation of individual residues across the three        families allowed a better alignment of the individual        secondary structure elements among the proteins than DALI        achieved This word based sequence motif to structure        molego to function method has clear implications for        genomic analysis and template based homology modeling as        well as immediate application in recognizing specificity        determinants in proteins that share active sites common to        many enzymes                        Results                  Total sequence decomposition of human Ape with          MASIA          MASIA identified  motifs as conserved in all members          of the APE family Figure and Table  As table  last          column illustrates these motifs include all the          residues known to be essential for DNA cleavage Most of          the highly conserved greater than  residues have          been shown by previous mutagenesis studies to affect          activity The  motifs are also structurally conserved          as demonstrated by the low RMSD values between segments          in the crystal structures of bacterial ExoIII and of          huAPE These two proteins are only  identical based          on a DALI structure based alignment and most of the          similar segments are contained in the molegos As the          third column of the table demonstrates the backbone          deviation of the segments is overall   and for  of          the motifs   We have chosen the name molegos          for the structural units associated with motifs which          are presented pictorially in Figures and  Most of the          DNA and metal ion binding molegos form individual          strands at the core of the protein that orient the          absolutely conserved residues toward the substrate but          several have a helical or hydrogen bonded coil          structure          The  motifs which account for about half of the          protein are bridged by areas that vary in the different          members of the APE family These connecting regions may          account for the differing activities of the bacterial and          mammalian proteins The longest molego  was broken          down into two areas with the contiguous region labeled          a The first  residues of the a area molego are quite          similar in the bacterial and mammalian APE However the          end is differently conserved in eukaryotes The          endonuclease activity of DNase  is reduced many fold by          integrating this loop from           E coli exonuclease III but the          mutant cleaves at abasic sites in DNA with low efficiency              Thus additional residues in the APEs control          specificity while still allowing a reasonable rate of          phosphorolytic cleavage                          Finding APE molegos in the DNase           superfamily          In an effort to functionally annotate the molegos of          APE we next sought to find them in other proteins that          shared some structural similarity to APE The APEs          DNase and inositol polyphosphate phosphatases IPP          have been grouped according to the SCOP database             as the DNase like superfamily Although DNase  has          only  overall sequence identity and the IPP domain of          synaptojanin  to APE we could show that most of          the areas of identity were in molegos common to all three          proteins Motifs in other protein families were          identified by genomic crossnetworking with PSIBLAST see          methods for details Our analysis identified  molegos          that are common to the DNase  IPP and APE families          which roughly correspond to areas of sequence similarity          identified previously      The structural          similarities of molegos    and  ie the          segmental RMSDs between APE and representatives of the          distantly related DNase  and IPP families are comparable          to those found between members of the APE family Figure          and Table                            Common molegos form a similar active site in two          distant relatives          The  conserved molegos form the barrel core of          huAPE The completely conserved residues of huAPE          concentrate for the most part at one end of this          framework to form the metal ion binding active site          Figure  This core is also common to DNase  and          synaptojaninan IPP family member which share the          functions of metal ion based cleavage of a phosphate          backbone The shared molegos define an active site          architecture conserved in all three proteins including          the orientation of the substrate toward the metal binding          site                          Molegos define functional areas common to DNase           and APE          A contact plot of huAPE with the DNA in the DE          crystal structure Figure  shows that motifs           and  all have residues close to the substrate an          oligonucleotide containing an abasic site APDNA The          Nterminal motifs  and  bind primarily  to the          apurinic site and to the  end of the undamaged strand          The other motifs bind more to the area  of the damage          site Motifs  and  span both strands of the DNA          Although motif  contains several highly conserved          residues that according to mutagenesis results Table           contribute to APE activity only His is very close to          the abasic site in the DNA Molegos  and  contain no          residues in contact with the DNA or metal ion Comparing          the binding of APE in a substrate complex Figure           left suggests that APEs binding to the  end of the          DNA after cleavage Fig  especially that mediated by          molego  is stronger while the distance from the          protein to the DNA  of the cleavage site increases          The contact plots of APE and DNase with their          respective substrates Figure  documents that the          similar molegos in the proteins serve similar functions          The Nterminal  residues of both proteins including          molegos  and  bind  of the cleavage site and to the           end of the opposite DNA strand Molegos   and           bind to one base  and the next base  of the cleavage          site in both proteins Overall the pattern of protein          contacts to the cleavage site the area  of the          cleavage site and the  end of the opposite strand are          common to both proteins suggesting that the functions of          forming the substrate complex and the actual          phosphorolysis are similar in both proteins          While the length of the DNA in both cases is similar          DNase  clearly has less binding to bases opposite and           of the cleavage site The extensive contacts that APE          makes to these positions are mediated by molegos it does          not share with DNase  Molegos  a and  all have          residues within hydrogen bonding distance of the three          basepairs  of the APsite This redundancy of binding          to the  side is unique to APE as is its strong binding          to the DNA opposite the abasic site          The importance of such bonds for activity was shown in          other work where huAPEs binding to the DNA backbone is          only inhibited by ethylation of the phosphates two and          three positions  to an abasic site     Mutation of          RA at the end of Molego  that binds to this region          and to the bases opposite the APsite had enhanced          activity     while mutations at W Molego  and          F Molego     reduce activity and in the          latter case substrate selectivity          In work from this group that will be described          separately we used this analysis to generate mutants of          APE with altered activity An alanine substitution          mutant NA of a conserved residue at the end of          molego a that forms a hydrogen bond with the second          phosphate group downstream of the abasic site had          enhanced APE activity but increased Km and Kd values          similar to an alanine mutant of R which binds to the          same site reported previously     A combination of          the two mutants NA and RA substantially reduced          the ability of APE to bind to DNA containing an abasic          site Izumi et al in preparation Thus molegos can          effectively guide the redesign of enzymes to alter          specificity                          Molegos to improve structural alignment          Using molegos may also help in aligning proteins for          template based modeling by determining the end points of          secondary structure elements in alignments with many gaps          and insertions According to MASIA analysis the residues          KR and DI at the Ntermini of motifs  and  are          absolutely conserved in the three families APEs DNases          and IPPs However matching these conserved residues          between synaptojanin and DNase or APE requires a gapping          that would not be consistent with CLUSTALW or a          structural DALI     alignment of these proteins          Table  If the local alignment with synaptojanin is          gapped to align these residues in the three proteins          Table  gapped the RMSD for the two sections          separated by the gap is much lower than that if one tries          to align the whole ungapped segment As Fig          illustrates the local environments of both conserved          residue pairs DI and QE are structurally equivalent in          all three proteins indicating that a motif based          alignment with a two residue gap is correct The first          two strand molegos in synaptojanin are  residues          longer than in APE or DNase  By regarding these          elements as simple lego style blocks and recognizing the          connectivity molego based alignment correctly defined          the changing length of the secondary structure          elements                            Discussion                  Is the specificity of APE determined by binding           to an abasic site          Crystal structure data coupled with molego analysis          outlined the areas of APE that distinguish its mode of          DNA binding from the less specific DNase  Contact maps          Figure  illustrate how the conserved motifs direct DNA          binding in the distributive ie rapidly releasing          substrateproduct relatively nonspecific DNase as          opposed to the processive highly specific huAPE Both          enzymes cleave only one DNA strand in a duplex and          bacterial Xth cleaves ssDNA containing an abasic site              The additional contacts huAPE compared to DNase           Figure  makes  to the damage site and to the          opposite strand lower its turnover rate and its potential          to cleave normal DNA The residues contacting the region           to the abasic site come from three different uniquely          conserved areas of APEs molegos a  as well as           a molego that is similar to that in DNase These          observations coupled with DNA ethylation data              indicates that  binding is a key element in specific          recognition by APEs          This is confirmed by site directed mutagenesis          studies Of the four protein areas that bind to the DNA           of the abasic site mutating F molego  or W          middle of molego  decreases APE activity     The          F mutation is particularly interesting as the mutants          at this position had reduced substrate specificity and          enhanced exonuclease activity However an RA          mutant had           enhanced APE activity              as do mutations at N Izumi et al in preparation          Combining these mutations however greatly decreases          substrate binding Izumi et al in preparation The           approach to the DNA    and the wide area covered by          the protein on both sides of the abasic site    are          both consistent with the need to hold the product until          the correct polymerase moves in  to  to complete the          repair     This implies that the mammalian enzyme          has evolved to be processive to facilitate more          efficient functioning of the overall BER pathway and may          not be optimized for simple catalysis Processivity is an          important facit of the activity of enzymes that function          in complex pathways     Reduced processivity may          explain for example the repair deficits in Xeroderma          pigmentosum XPA cells     Our molego approach          provides a basis for exploring the role of segments of          the protein in its functions rather than relying only on          data from missense mutations                          Using molegos to detect structural and functional          homologues          We have demonstrated here the derivation and uses of          molegos for analyzing the specificity of enzymes based          on those derived from the APE family The methodology can          be used to complement searches with programs such as          PSIBLAST and PROSITE    to detect distantly related          functional or structural homologues in sequences revealed          by genome sequencing PSIBLAST searches often reveal          areas of local similarity in proteins that have no          significant overall sequence identity Molego analysis          could be useful to analyze the significance of such          findings The combined sequence and structure definition          makes molegos more flexible for defining shared protein          elements than methods such as PROSITE that require a          strict onedimensional definition An improved motif          definition method based on physical property similarity              which has been incorporated into our MASIA tool          also promises to enhance the usefulness of the method          This may eventually lead to a method to find functional          relationships between proteins with even lower overall          sequence similarity          Another potential area for applying the molego          approach is in homology modeling Molegos may prove          useful in to check alignments for template based modeling          of homologues with low identity Table and Figure  if          the anchoring residues are conserved in sequence or          property across the members of both subfamilies Our          molego approach is closest in principle to that of the          ROSETTA program    whereby the latter seeks only to          connect structure not function to a sequence element          We are currently testing the usefulness of the molego          approach in modeling in the CASP competition                            Conclusions        The MASIA program can parse sequences into discrete        blocks of significant conservation The motifs identified        in the APE family could be structurally annotated using        crystal data to derive molegos words in the protein        sequence that correlate with structural elements These        molegos could in turn be functionally annotated by        comparing the DNA binding profile of APE with that of the        less specific nuclease DNase  This analysis indicated        that residues binding  to the site of phosphorolytic        cleavage control the substrate specificity of APE These        results indicate that molegos can provide a useful basis        for identifying specificity determining regions in enzymes        with similar active sites but different activity spectra              Site directed mutagenesis based on these        results can define the function of the unique elements of        the APEs and aid in the design of enzymes with altered        specificity

at least  positions in a row are less          than  conserved To allow for mistakes in the          alignment of all the sequences essential residues are          those  conserved by MASIA criteria over all          sequences in the alignment                          Genomic crossnetworking with PSIBLAST          A PSIBLAST search using huAPE as the founder          sequence with an evalue of  per iteration did not          converge after  iterations but few new sequences were          added in the last  cycles Searches with an evalue of          iteration had similar results but members of          several families were not included until later cycles          Members of the DNase  LINE repeats inositol          polyphosphate phosphatase Nocturnin CCR cytolethal          distending toxin neutral sphingomyelin          phosphodiesterase and amino acid methyltransferase          families were found with expectation values of  or          less to be significantly similar to APE To determine          the presence of motifs in these relatives a CLUSTALW          alignment of at least  representatives of a protein          family was prepared and analyzed with MASIA for          significant areas of conservation In some cases          alignments taken from literature references eg for          IPPs     were used to confirm MASIA results The          motifs common to these families were compared with the          APE motifs of Table  Criteria for inclusion presence          of motif included conservation of residues           conserved side chains shown in blue in the
