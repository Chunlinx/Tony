during the thcentury Reconquest The fortress even withstood an earthquake in  as well as attempts by the Austrian Archduke Charles to blast his way in during the War of the Spanish Succession Guadalest itself is just as spectacular as the view from it Wandering round the compact castle youll understand why for lack of space the belfry had to be built outside and why the picturesque old cemetery is so smallFrom Guadalest the road leads to the small town of Callosa de Ensarri centre of the honey industry where you can taste before you buy often six or eight different flavours From

openair cafs on the trafficfree Calle Mayor Then head uphill to the Castillo de la Concepcin at the highest point of the city The castle dates back to Roman and perhaps even Carthaginian times Its surrounded by the Parque de las Torres a beautifully landscaped vantage point The pepperpot lighthouse in the park of Roman or Moorish origin wrecked many a marauding ship when it was blacked out by Cartagenas defendersOne glance over the almost landlocked harbour explains why Andrea Doria the thcentury Genoese admiral remarked that the Mediterranean had only three safe ports June July and

and two more still in good repairthe Atalaya and Galeras castlesprotect the seafront arsenal of vital importance to Spains militaryImmediately west of the Castillo de la Concepcin are the ruins of the

the wellhead with weathered ropemarks that traditionally inspired Saint Isidore the youngest of a sixthcentury Visigoth dukes four saintly children to argue the merits of perseveranceQuite a long trek to the northwest is the small Museo Arqueolgico noted for its exceptional collection of Roman mining tools used to extract the considerable mineral wealth of La Unin a neighbouring inland town Mines there continue to yield lead which is exported from Cartagena as it has been for centuriesAlthough the Costa Clida extending southwest beyond Cartagena has opened up to property development you can

miles more bring you to thriving Mojcar a village planted on the eastern extremity of the rugged Sierra Cabrera Purists complain that the cubist effect of steep hillsides dotted with square flatroofed houses has been spoiled by modern development but the beaches all around are still pleasantAbout  years ago Mojcar was an important Phoenician port but earthquakes and major geological upheavals have left it high and dry For centuries the women of Mojcar were kept behind the veil and the place is still known as the Village of the Covered Ones Interestingly theres an elegant white statue of a veiled woman outside the church Its renown as the Village of Witches comes from Mojcars long and continuing flirtation with faith healing spells and magic brews This isolated town is the last bastion of the mystical sign of the dalo a figure holding a rainbow over his head that was believed to be a talisman against the evil eye The word comes from an old Iberian term meaning Lord of All Nowadays you are more likely to see the Indalo in the form of a lucky charm on sale in souvenir shops rather than painted as it once was on house doors The narrow coastal road continues another  km  miles weaving through a moody landscape of barren mountains to Carboneras The long sandy beaches here are another favourite spot for camping excursionsFrom Carboneras the road travels  km  miles inland through sweeping treeless moorland to Njar This developing Andalusian hilltop village is a busy centre for potters and the narrow streets of the old town centre invite exploration Look for local ceramics with their characteristic design of tiger stripes and splashes the colours deliberately allowed to runSouth of Nijar spectacular cliffs and isolated beaches mark the hardtoreach natural park of the Cabo de Gata The Moorish Legacy InlandFour historic townsElche Crevillente Orihuela and Murcialine the N from Alicante The most distant of them Murcia is only about  km  miles away and all four can be visited in a couple of days While these towns have been influenced by various cultures the Moorish legacy is predominant in eachElcheThousands upon thousands of date palms overwhelm the eye in Elche a city as old as the Iberians The trees originally planted by the Carthaginians in  bc or thereabouts thrive under irrigation They still stand as the Moors described them with feet in water heads in the fire of heaven Elches palms are watered by Abderraman IIIs tenthcentury irrigation system and surround the town of some  inhabitants on three sidesThe Hort del Cura Priests Grove is celebrated even in Elche for its cactus pomegranate and orange trees and above all for the palmera imperial This male tree of exceptional age and size has seven branches growing from one main trunk The palmera imperial and many other trees in the grove have been dedicated to royalty and celebrities like Carmen Polo de Franco the widow of the GeneralsimoOverlooking the groves lily pond is an exact replica of the famous bust of the Dama de Elche The Lady of Elche The original dating from  bc and now housed in Madrids Archaeological Museum remains something of a puzzle almost a hundred years after it came to light If you cover that exotic headdress youll see why attributions are difficult to make The face could be male or female Spanish Greek or EasternTo visit the place where the bust was discovered go to the nearby hamlet of La Alcudia Be sure to see the exhibits of Iberian and Roman finds displayed in the excellent local museum On the way youll see palms that look rather like giant asparagus tips Encapuchadores bind these male trees in spring to produce the pale bleached fronds that are used in Palm Sunday celebrations These branches once suitably blessed are said to conduct lightning and youll see them attached to houses all over Spain The female palms make a less esoteric annual contribution of  tons of dates which ripen in December and are prized for their juicy sweetnessBack in Elche there are more palm trees to see and more luxuriant tropical foliage to admire You can dine and dance in the frondslatted shade of the Parque Municipal which also features citrus trees and a noisy frog pond Or visit the Hort de Baix and the Hort del Chocolater the latter open at irregular intervalsthese groves help make Elche one of the most verdant cities in EuropeNot

dome of the Iglesia de Santa Mara The church was built in the th century and rebuilt after being damaged during the Civil War Every August a spectacular form of sacred theatre El Misterio de Elche The Mystery of Elche is performed here by an amateur cast of priests civic dignitaries and other local people The play has been presented in Elche for more than five centuries The music Gregorian and traditional is sung in old lemosn However the story it tells of the Assumption of the Virgin is quite easily understood Across the main road from the church you cant miss the solid Alczar de la Seora known locally as the Palacio de los Altamira with its square towers This Moorish palace formed part of the city wall In times past Spanish monarchs such as James the Conqueror and Ferdinand and Isabella stayed hereThe Vinalop River spanned by a bridge here supplies the water that is still carried to the horts in canals dug by the MoorsA short distance from the palace toward the city centre you come upon the Ayuntamiento Town Hall with its fine Renaissance faade and Gothic door Stand back for a good look at the thcentury Torre del Concejo a former watchtower The quaint carved figures of Calendura and Calendureta ring the hours and quarter hours as they have done since CrevillenteNineteenthcentury travellers sped through neighbouring Crevillente in fear of the notorious bandit James the Bearded Today Crevillentes industrial appearance similarly induces haste But those unattractive factories produce  percent of Spains handsome woven rugs and carpets and many invite visitorsCrevillente was the birthplace of the Arab surgeon AlXafra and during his thcentury heyday the town was a good place in which to fall ill The progressive Moors treatise on wounds inflammations and tumours may sound hairraising today but his treatment of broken bones by padded splints traction and bitumen casts was actually centuries ahead of its timeThe Museo Municipal Mariano Benlliure
