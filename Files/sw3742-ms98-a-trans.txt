        so what kind of hobbies you have     well the primary thing that i do uh is go around and uh collect uh collectibles that are purchase collectibles and uh and some antiques uh go to a lot of garage sales and estate sales   uhhuh hm   and collect signatures   signatures like uh like important people i guess   uh yeah uh important people um oh some are just uh sports fans   uhhuh   uh i had i land like aviation so ive got a number of them from uh uh like the Wright brothers uh uh Chuck Yeager um Charles Lindburgh things like that   hm thats pretty neat yeah  most of my hobbies are uh i guess i uh i like cars i work on i like to work on my car and uh yes since i have an old car   yeah oh do you what do you have   i have a i have a Honda its an eighty three Honda this cars not too bad i dont have to work on it as much but ive before this i had a Toyota Corona i dont know if you ever heard of those cars but uh   yeah sure   i had the car its an eighty one Toyota Corona i mustve worked on it like every third day i had it  i had a i had a problem with the uh with the radiator     umhum   uh the car basically would overheat i mean i i lived used to live in Washington DC and didnt have any problems when i lived up there but soon as i came down here the heat was must mustve been too intense for the car so the car kept overheating and turned out it was some kind of a problem with the radiator   yeah   so i had the radiator replaced and they did everything they could possibly do they said there was some kind of problem they just couldnt figure out what it was and the Toyota dealer couldnt figure it out the radiator place couldnt figure it out so basically i had to keep adding water to the radiator every uh every couple days   oh jeez   you know and what you had to do is you had to start it up let it get hot let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine then add more water to it then shut it and then you could run another three days   well that sounds like fun   oh yeah let me tell you i mean its it was bad when it was in the winter time you had to do this too you know   hm yeah oh yeah   so uh   no as a matter of fact ive been uh seriously considering uh restoring a car   uhhuh uhhuh   um i was looking at a Nash Metropolitan i dont know if you know what those are   no huhuh   uh theyre little two tone uh cars that came out in   oh is it like a mini car   yeah   my my parents next door neighbor have one of those   fifty really   they uh it um i think his wife won it in some kind of contest and he just uh it looks almost like a fake car because its so small its you know and its its in perfect shape   huh yeah yeah   and uh he just kind of pulls it out every so often cleans it up puts it back in the garage   does he wanna sell it   yeah really but uh its its really a neat looking car though and uh   oh yeah now im ive been trying to find one thats uh uh i was i was looking at getting one of those and trying to restore it   yeah umhum umhum um thats kind of kind of cool   yeah   and the other hobby i have is uh i guess i play uh like the racket sports you know racquetball and tennis and i love to play that   yeah oh both of them   yeah umhum   because most of the folks that i found and i i used to play a lot of tennis then when i started playing racquetball uh by the time i finally got a swing down for racquetball i i found out i couldnt play tennis anymore   uhhuh umhum uhhuh well what i did was i played tennis for a long time then hadnt played for a long time then i started pay playing racquetball again   uhhuh   and uh when i got really good at racquetball then i waited a while and i went back to tennis and so now when im back to either one of the sports you know since i since the gap was so far apart between the two i think that i get back to tennis soon as i pick up a tennis racket im im back into the swing   yeah oh good   and soon as i pick up a racquetball racket im back it takes me a little while to to get as good you know uh i usually need you know at least a good hour warmup before im im back into the swing   yeah yeah   but uh once im back in it you know its pretty good   well its tough to those ceiling shots on a tennis court   oh  yeah thats definite yeah you dont it i have to really think about the uh the ceiling shots and the side wall shots you know   yeah   uh and thats probably it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it does in my on my body   i tell you i really like uh racquetball   its a great sport see its aerobic and uh and if you play with someone uh you got to play with someone whos as good as you are you know not better or not and not worse   yeah yeah yeah   because if you play i used to play with uh my roommate and uh from college and we uh we were both about the same as far as you know how good we both were you know and wed have volleys that would last five or six minutes you know   yeah   and uh it does  i mean we werent like the best players in the world but we you know we we couldnt get it past each other you know   umhum   and uh i used to work out to play racquetball three or four times a week and i tell you by the end of the summer i was in perfect shape you know   yeah   so its its a great sport great aerobic sport   i like it better than uh tennis just because i dont have to go so far to get the ball   well the only reason i like it better than tennis is i used to play tennis with my dad and he plays uh old man tennis you know       he could hit puts underspin on the ball all the time and he can hit every ball okay but he doesnt hit it hard he just hits it really lightly you know makes you run all over the place   yeah uhhuh  so who   and it just kind of drives me up the wall
