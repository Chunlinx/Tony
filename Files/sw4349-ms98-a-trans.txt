                the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four Nissan truck       i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it and the the reason i did that was because i dont have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and its hard to to get get at them and plus the time  i just dont have time anymore um as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once but the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes  i wanted i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs to should be changed regularly very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubrication lubrication system needs to keep be lubricated and so i i stay on top of that  but i  i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it   just to pack the bearings   just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they changed i had them another thing i i let them do sometimes is that i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics thats free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see   right   and they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus   right and they repacked the wheel bearings   and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but ive ive had considerable experience i you might say im a mechanic a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school its been a while back but i i still have a pretty good feel for it but one thing i didnt know is that when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i had i had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little Nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten so i drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little trucks and cars like that they they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good   you know theyve gotten to the point that where they dont weigh very much and the the surface material on the pads is so good   exactly exactly so i you know but i i just did it anyway i like to stay i like to stay up on it you know like to stay kind of stay up on it then if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a a light golden brown you know its not dirty i i i keep it that way because thats that is the key to the longevity so   right well   so so how   it it sounds like youve had um some good experiences with that uh   uhhuh   and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that   uh oh   um i       i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and uh   uhhuh   and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a  in it that ive uh beefed up a little bit   umhum okay   and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesnt have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels um the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were   umhum   um not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum   youre talking about the vibration dampener   well theres three theres three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley   thats the vibration dampener yeah   and uh the water pump pulley   okay   so when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things   hm   and uh probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out   uh oh   so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way   hm uh oh   but not far enough to notice   hm   so i was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half         so there was a half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh so i   umhum
