                                 Selena                           Note Life and Artis an occasional column that compares fiction in various media with thereallife facts it is ostensibly based on                                       Selena is the lifestory of the MexicanAmerican singer who was murdered in  at age Abraham Quintanilla Selenas father and manager was the executive producer ofthe film and had complete script approval Before filming began Quintanillasaid Nobody knows more about my daughter and our life than I do  If theyget out of line as far as the story goes Ill put them back on course Eitherthey never got out of line or Quintanilla put them back on course becauseSelena does not stray far from the facts at least as they are recountedin the secondary sources            WhenAbraham discovered that his daughter could sing he turned his children into aband called Selena y Los Dinos They debuted in  when Selena was  andstarting in  performed frequently at the family restaurant in LakeJackson Texas Selenas father pushed her to sing in Spanish which she didntknow how to speak The group did gigs across South Texas performing mostlyTejano music described by Billboard as Mexican polkas and cumbiasmixed with elements of rock pop country and even rap Selena eventuallybroke into the Mexican market on an unprecedented scale for a Tejano artistwith spotty Spanish giving concerts before crowds of  peopleInterested in fashion since childhood she opened a boutique called Selena Etcin January  The actual designer of the Selena line Martin Gmez gets abrief mention in the film In March  she won a Grammy for bestMexicanAmerican album In July  the biggest hit of her career AmorProhibido reached No  on the Billboard Latin chart Though the filmdoesnt go into all the details it is correct in indicating that Selena waspoised for mainstream success when she was killed            The film also reflects Selenas downtoearth style atleast as described in media accounts and in such books as the unauthorizedbiography Selena Como la Flor  by Joe Nick Patoski a senioreditor at Texas Monthly  Selena the movie ticks off the pointsmade in numerous profiles Though the singer drove a red Porsche convertibleshe dined at Pizza Hut shopped in malls mowed her own lawn and lived in amiddleclass neighborhood in Corpus Christi at the time of her death next doorto her parents and brother a detail left out of Selena  The filmfaithfully records her status as a role model Onscreen Selena studies on thetour bus and asks children seeking autographs how theyre doing in school Inlife she got her highschool degree via correspondence from Chicagos AmericanSchool the Osmonds alma mater and was one of the only Tejano stars not toendorse a beer brand            One factmissing from the film is that both she and her family were Jehovahs WitnessesThough Selena was not an official member of the sect she was a believer andwent to Bible study with other believers The Houston Chronicle reportedthat when Abraham showed up at the hospital after Selenas shooting he saidshe wouldnt want a blood transfusion because of her faith by that pointthough shed already been given blood to no avail            Onscreen Abraham comes across as a demandingbut goodhearted stage father He forces his children to form a band and yellsat Selena for wearing a bustier during a performance He angrily forbids hisdaughter to marry Chris Perez a guitarist in the band In both film and lifethe couple elope and the Quintanilla family eventually accepts the union Inreal life Quintanillas stagefather parenting did occasion some criticismSelena  Como la Flor recalls battles between Abraham and Selenasjuniorhigh teachers over the girls increasing absences            As forYolanda Saldivarthe founder of Selenas fan club an employee at herboutique and her killerQuintanilla wanted to leave her out of the movieentirely until the producers convinced him not to The film implies thatSelena and Yolanda were friendly but not actually friends In truth they werequite close and Yolanda often traveled with Selena Currently serving a lifesentence for the crime Yolanda told  that Selena called her MomSelena addresses neither Yolandas obsession with Selena her apartmentwas a shrine to the singer nor the tabloid rumor denied by all and not backedby any evidence that they were lovers            As the script indicates the family thought that Yolandawas embezzling money and confronted her The film does not reenact themurder choosing instead to cover the crime in an  oclock news style butthe details are accurate An announcer states that Selena had gone to the motelto pick up papers from Yolanda when she was shot as family members latertestified Next we see Yolanda holed up in her truck with a gun to her headsaying Im so ashamed and Look what Ive done to my best friend She didsay those things during a  hour standoff with police though she alsoaccused Abraham of having raped hera charge never substantiated            The finalmoments of the film resemble a musicvideo tributewe see an empty stadium anda candlelight vigil Selenas death did inspire an outpouring of grief andattract the attention of the mainstream media inspired by the success of theirSelenamemorial issue People launched a Spanish version of themagazine As the movie implies with a scene in which a crowd forms aroundSelena in a Los Angeles store and a white employee asks Whos Selena manywhites learned about the singer only because of the way she died Madonna wasreportedly the sole Anglo star to send her condolences
