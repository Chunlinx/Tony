                                 He Jests at Scars                         Dear Jack            The thing I find most disheartening about Rosens book is probably bestsummed up by an oftused Shakespeare line He jests at scars that never felt awound That is Rosens writing and thinking betrays almost no familiaritywith what is actually required to produce good journalism He criticizesreporters mostly political reporters who maintain that an adversarialrelationship with government is healthy believing instead that some fabledcooperation with civic groups would be better            But what about when the adversarial relationship comes from governmentitself Heres one example from my backyard Shortly after taking office theGiuliani administration in New York began stonewalling the most routine mediarequests for information In one instance a department denied a request by theNew York Daily News  made under the local Freedom of Information lawfor a list of all investigations commenced by an agency in the previous yearJust a listas had been provided by every previous administration in recentmemory            Whatre the reporter and city editor supposed to do Go to the publisherand hope that the relationship will be healed through some kind of feelgoodcivic project between the paper and the mayor Given the politically corruptrelationship that exists between the News  publisher and the mayorthatd be the worst possible journalistic outcome To its credit the DailyNews sued and only under court order did the administration provide theinformation as it was legally required to provide            Thats an ugly and uncivil process but its also under the circumstancesthe best way to serve the public interest Rosens worldview is so far removedfrom actual journalistic practice that it cant even imagine such a scenariomuch less grasp its importance            Ill conclude by trying to give an answer to the books title question Onething that journalists should be for is independence In my view that doesntrequire objectivity or neutrality or being boring or being goodcitizensthough it doesnt preclude any of those things either It meanssimply that the task of gathering and presenting news must be kept as separateas humanly possible from pretty much everything government interest groupsand the publishers own business plans Rosens book demonstrates so littleunderstanding of that core journalistic value that it paints itself out of thepicture            BestJim
