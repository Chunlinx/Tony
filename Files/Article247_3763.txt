                                 The Catholic Leagues Skewed Priorities            Dear Mick            Mets again win            I think its being a little hard on Miramax to say it folded onDogma it kept its commitments to the film and to Disney by buying it filmnot Disney back and arranging to distribute it independentlyTransubstantiation makes you queasy because its the consumption of someonesbody and blood or on more philosophical grounds            In general boycotts against works of the imagination as the primary focusof a political organization are suspect whether its the Catholic Leagueagainst Dogma or the Brooklyn Museum NOW against Bret Easton EllisAmerican Psycho  or gay activists against Silence of the Lambs which is not to say that I dont think these things should be as vigorouslydebated as anyone cares to debate them and in some cases more vigorously thanthat However even leaving aside what are in all three of those examples tome very valid questions of interpretation I thinkI havent seenDogma  given that the resources of political activism on the behalf ofspecial interests are necessarily limited I would prefer to put my dollar andmy anxiety down on the side of protecting actual real live human beingssuffering actual real live oppression or the threat thereof I wish that theCatholic League or for that matter anybody seemed to give a fuck about thefact that W has presided over a state thats executing people at such anungodly as it were rate some of whose attorneys did things like fall asleepduring their trials In fact I even feel like a wimp for having to try tocurry sympathy for deathrow prisoners by pointing out the proceduralirregularities in their cases I oppose executing them even when they aremonsters in human form because while I can easily understand why someonewould want to kill the murderer of their near and dear I cant at allunderstand why someone would want to give the state the power to killthemeven if its not being abused in that exact case its going to be andprobably sooner rather than later as the muchpublicized racial statistics ofthe death penaltys application demonstrate Surely this is a more importantthreat to Church doctrine than Kevin Smith I believe that Bush has a shallowkind of a defense in being technically dependent on the recommendations of theparole board for granting clemency but he could at least pipe up as long ashes being so goddamned compassionate a conservative            LoveMim
