            okay so do you do a lot of cooking in your family   um i do some every now and then i i work and my wifes home during the day so she usually ends up doing most of it   umhum oh yeah   when i was single we used to always cook around the house   yeah do do you like to cook   huh yeah i really like it um theres a few dishes like i i grew up with the um you know having Polish and Ukrainian food   yeah yeah oh really   and my wife she likes Italian and stuff so we we definitely have different tastes so   oh yeah yeah but thats neat though because you get to have different stuff  yeah im not im a pretty bad cook  im pretty bad my husband is really good he put himself through college working in restaurants   uhhuh   oh wow   and uh hes a much better cook than i am so when i was home i still cooked a lot and i was into a lot of vegetarian stuff and now that i went back to work about a year and a half ago so one of the things that he took over was the cooking and the kids are thrilled theyre really happy that i dont cook anymore   theyre like uh preferring it now right   yeah they say oh dad let dad cook mom  let him do it but um so so do you all do you have kids you obviously have one okay you have two   yeah two umhum yeah one is uh nine months and the other is two and a half   two and half oh   yeah thats the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh   i was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesnt it or are you not at that stage yet     yeah it does   yeah   we try our hardest to to get them to eat what we eat you know   right   and my sister uh shes the master of the fast order grill you know she can make uh  she makes six different meals but we like to have one thing you know one likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs   oh yeah oh my gosh oh my gosh i couldnt yeah   and then she makes noodles with uh with soy uh soy sauce or whatever so all things but um yeah our favorite let me think i was thinking of the one recipe that uh   boy i couldnt do that i   that we made i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy and that was um   whats that   uh scallops uh scallop um   oh really   it has a French name it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese cream sauce with it   oh yeah whats what is that Saint Jack or something scallops saint something or yeah  yeah yeah   and you pour it over rice yeah uh yeah i cant even remember what the recipes name is anymore but uh it it basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then uh standard cream sauce base and then uh   really with scallops   the scallops and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really good   no no im from New England so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here   uhhuh     and uh that sounds delicious to me that sounds great i think were just thinking of having a uh dinner party we went to this dinner party the other night that   yeah yeah but uh   was kind of like a game they had uh a murder mystery and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner   umhum umhum   and it was really fun and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves but were trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game so   right right yeah   so i was thinking theres this beef bourguignonne recipe that ive tried before thats pretty good and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until youre ready   umhum   so thats uh   yeah thats another thing i have a problem with my wife   yeah   she uh she likes to um she doesnt like the beef dishes she likes the chicken and fish   uh yeah   and like i said we always ate beef and uh pork   oh yeah   you know a lot so   i know my husband did too  his parents are Austrian and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table   oh yeah red meat plenty of good red meat   yeah yeah yeah   my dad could eat a a meal with out any vegetables at all   oh my gosh   and uh Susans you know they had you know meatless meals you know  my dad wouldnt know what to do   yeah yeah oh gosh so do you   course she grew up Catholic so you know they they sort of come with the theres a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have   oh they did the that you do right right thats just part of it   uhhuh   yeah we didnt my family didnt but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly he never there was dishes that he really enjoyed   umhum umhum   eating there there were several things that he liked but it never was really something that he would have chosen its just that i cooked so he had to put up with it   right   so but there was one thing that he couldnt stand and that was soybeans i tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it so i never i had i was limited i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans but     yeah its hard to get a protein content up then   yeah yeah thats true   huh yeah i like i like them every now and then for a change yes its nice   yeah some of the stuff is good but it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking  because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure theyre complete   umhum umhum   and we had little kids at the time you know when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking i couldnt i dont like to cook and im not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much of a too much  too much cooking     umhum   so well i guess ill let you get back to feeding your little one there   yeah no uh hes all done  yeah yeah i set him down   hes set oh okay okay do you like to bake at all or do you do you get into thats thats   yeah we used to do that um my mom used to go crazy every Sunday until my dad like blew up you know  after after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy she stopped doing it   yeah     but um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls you know every week   really no kidding   and um the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days and that would be it   yeah then be gone i know thats the thing about baking i used to i i dont mind baking at all and i i can do a pretty good pie we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother and my mother taught me how to make it   umhum umhum   and um so i can make a pretty mean pie but um i dont do it anymore because its just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread i mean forget its supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat  it tastes so good   hum umhum uhhuh we always we had that bread that was uh um you ever seen the the starter bread i cant remember what its called they call it the um Amish bread here but uh its made with you just leave leave it out   oh uh yeah yeah i   you know and you let it spoil sort of yeah you know   yeah uhhuh ive heard of that ive heard of it but ive never done it   yeah   that sounds pretty good   yeah it tasted pretty good really   yeah oh yeah   but um its the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and then you add all these other ingredients to it but   yeah and then you save you make the bread but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something   yeah right yeah you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else and thats how they continue the thing   yeah yeah yeah i know it sounds it always sounded i dont know how safe that was sounded pretty bad   yeah i know it sounded strange to me too i figure well youre baking it so you know yeah yeah   yeah thats true thats thats got to got to kill anything i guess but   umhum okay well ill talk to you later where are you calling from by the way Texas   all right well yeah thanks Plano yeah Plano in Texas are you in
