                                 The Mirror Stage            The suspicion aboutpsychoanalysts that is currently fashionable creates an interesting dilemma fortheir biographers The biographer of a great analyst is always tempted to provesomething to secondguess the dubious reader Since psychoanalysis as atreatment is itself about the possibility and indeed the value ofbiographical truthpsychoanalysis as the biography that is supposed to improvethe biographywe are likely to want something specific from this callow newgenre We want to know whether these people should have been trusted and whyand if we should go on trusting their socalled followers In other wordsbiographies of psychoanalysts make us wonder what it is that makes a persontrustworthy to us and what if anything this has to do with the significancewe give to their lives            By theconventional standards of psychoanalytic orthodoxy Jacques Lacan was a heretic His notoriety was based on his shortening of the psychoanalyticsessionsometimes to five minutes His fame was based on his radical revisionsof Freud and his insistence on the ways in which language and sexuality disrupta life Toward the end of his life historian of psychoanalysis ElisabethRoudinesco tells us Lacan usually saw his tailor his pedicurist and hisbarber while conducting his analyses So what            There is a tension in any biography between what thesubject wanted to bewho he or she was always wanting to becomeand what thebiographer wants the subject to be In this sober incisive and riveting booka welldocumented history rather than a novelistic evocation of the manhimself Roudinesco cannot conceal her dismay that Lacan was not betterbehaved more temperate in his appetites less baroque in his provocations Shewants him to be more poignant and less boastful            It was ofcourse about excessesof desire of meaning of emptinessthat Lacan wroteso eloquently For Lacan a person was by definition in excess of himself Hebelieved there was something fundamentally unintelligible about the vagaries ofa life But Roudinesco neither takes pleasure in nor makes intriguing sense ofthe fact that Lacans theories denounced the omnipotence of the ego ingeneral though he himself asserted the supremacy of his own Lacans writingsare clearly among other things the confessions of a selfjustifyingmegalomaniacunusual in itself because such people dont tend to explainthemselves But by the same token these are also the most inexhaustiblyinteresting and stylish psychoanalytic writings since Freuds The Lacancharacterized in this book as flamboyantly voracious for the Freudiantriumvirate of women money and power is as Roudinesco suggests a Balzacianhero a triumph of appetite over class This is a story of a man with anamazing talent for finding what and whom he needed to make himself what hewanted to be the greatest analyst since Freud            As always from the evidence available thereis no obvious reason why this particular family should have produced thatparticular psychoanalyst Lacans father owned a very successful vinegardistillery the family were respectable bourgeois Roman Catholics Lacansadored youngest brother became a priest and his sister spent most of hermarried life in Indochinaso clearly some distance was needed from what wasotherwise a typical French family of a certain type Very early as one mighthave expected Lacan wanted to be top of the class though in fact he wasnt anespecially talented boy He had a precocious intellectual curiosity He tendedto read as Roudinesco remarks rather than play Cowboys and Indians with theother boys            Ofcourse Lacans life here is being read retrospectively partly through theprism of his writings whereas he was living it prospectively we have toremember given that Lacans work was the theorizing of life stories that hehimself never knew what was going to happen next If one of the dominantmotifs of Lacans early life is his contempt for his father as it is in thisaccount then it can seem virtually inevitable that his early work was aboutthe terrible cultural consequences of the weakening of the father imagothere were no strong fathers anymore and that much of his later work shouldbe obsessed by what he called thenameofthefather and the symbolicsignificance of the phallus But psychoanalysisand Lacan was particularlyshrewd about thishas always been essentially a critique of straightforwardlycasual accounts of how people become who they are Indeed what distinguishespsychoanalysis is that it can show us the ways in which a life is notmerely the effect of its causes biology parents etc            As Lacan progresses through psychiatry World War II as adoctor in France surrealism psychoanalysis structuralismLacans life wasapparently a magnet for everything intellectually interesting happening inFrance He was for example Picassos personal doctorhe seems to have had aknack for finding useful fathers His friendships with the likes of writer andcritic Georges Bataille philosopher Maurice MerleauPonty anthropologistClaude LviStrauss and linguist Roman Jakobson were formative in ways that heeither fails to note or misleadingly acknowledges Here Roudinesco is ratherlimitingly censorious wanting Lacan to pay his debts rather than being amazedby what he could make of what he found in the work of these remarkable peopleLacan was apparently always dismayed by how little his mentors were influencedby him In this book it is Lacans craving for recognitionhis almost demonichunger to be unforgettablethat drives him and that every so often isgently pathologized by Roudinesco            Roudinesco alludes to manymistresses though always discreetly in the abstract Lacans private lifehowever was really a tale of two families A first marriage in his s toMalou the sister of a close friend with whom he has three children and thena second marriage to Sylvie Batailles exwife with whom he has his adoreddaughter and acolyte Judith The children of the first marriage are toldnothing of the second marriage until they are young adults So Lacan leads abizarre double life One of the most chilling scenes in the book is when LacanSylvie and Judith stop at a traffic light in Paris and see two of Lacansother children They approach the car and Lacan drives off Confronted withsome of the most callous follies of this extraordinary life the so whatquestion becomes more and more pressing            An act always misunderstandsitself Lacan wrote Indeed all Lacans writing is an elaborate meditation onthe ways in whichand the structures by whichwe can never be transparent toourselves Lacans life was a struggle against the institutionalization ofknowledge and he flourished by creating havoc both publicly in a famousbreak with the International Psychoanalytic Institute and privately amongsome of his colleagues He wanted psychoanalysis to be a science ofselfdeception a proof against the old pieties It would be strange to wishthat he were more lovable or honest or familiar His life is exemplary in themodern sense not as a picture of virtue or even as a struggle to live outsome kind of personal truth but rather as a question How complicated can weallow people to be before we stop trusting them
