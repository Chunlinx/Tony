                    Background        One mechanism by which tumors evade immune destruction        is through cytokine production or induction            Prostaglandin E PGE constitutively produced by many        NSCLC has been identified as one factor that has direct        immunosuppressive properties and is known to induce IL in        mononuclear cells          IL is a dominant        immunosuppressive cytokine found in the NSCLC environment        known to directly affect T cellmediated immunity                      Both PGE and IL have been shown to        suppress antigen presentation to suppress cytotoxic T cell        CTL responses and to inhibit cytokine production by T        cells and antigen presenting cells perhaps most        importantly IL that plays a central role in initiation        and potentiation of cellular immune responses                             We asked whether PGE        levels andor IL levels were elevated in plasma of NSCLC        patients whether monocytes from NSCLC patients produce        more IL than normals and whether there was correlation        within our findings As an additional         in vitro correlate we evaluated        differences in IL production by normal adherent        peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in conditioned        media from cell lines that produce variable amounts of        PGE                    Results                  PGE produced by tumor cell lines correlated with          IL production by normal donor adherent PBMC          To confirm observations from the literature          supernatants from  different NSCLC cell lines producing          variable amounts of PGE ranging from  pgml            cells to  pgml   cells were compared          directly for their ability to induce IL in adherent          mononuclear cells Each cell line induced IL in          adherent mononuclear cells that was greater than control          This relative increase in IL correlated with PGE          produced by each cell line p  Figure                           PGE levels in plasma of individuals with          NSCLC          Two separate assays yielded similar elevations in          plasma levels of PGE above normals Each assay used          different sets of normals for comparison Significant          differences were seen when comparing measurements from           NSCLC samples to  normals  vs p            and  NSCLC patient samples to  normals           vs   p   Figure           Absolute measures of PGE differed between assays that          prevented the pooling of results relative values may          reflect differences in sample handling or assay          conditions or differences in ELISA kits themselves          Plasma IL levels measured in  patient samples were          not significantly elevated above controls    vs             p   not shown PGE levels did not          correlate with stage or histology p   all          comparisons                          Cytokine profiles of adherent mononuclear cells          from NSCLC patients          Adherent cells predominantly mononuclear phagocytes          from  individuals were evaluated for IL production          Data show adherent mononuclear cells from NSCLC patients          produced baseline levels of IL significantly greater          than those of normal volunteers    vs    p            Figure  IL production did not correlate          with stage or histology not shown                          Correlation of PGE levels and IL production          from adherent mononuclear cells          Paired comparisons of plasma PGE levels and          mononuclear cell IL was possible in  patient samples          Paired comparisons in patient sample did not reach          statistical significance p   although in a          subset of  patients excluding  samples with the          highest PGE levels a positive correlation of PGE          levels and IL production was apparent p            Figure  There was no simple explanation for these          outliers nor rationale for excluding these samples          There was a significant correlation between PGE levels          and IL production in normal samples p   but          combining normals and patient data did not strengthen the          statistical observations                            Discussion        COX is an inducible enzyme upregulated in inflammatory        states      Notably many NSCLC and what have been        characterized as premalignant lung lesions have been        shown to constitutively express the COX enzyme and        produce prostaglandin E PGE the primary product of        the COX pathway         Importantly PGE        production by tumor cells has been linked to tumorinduced        immunosuppression in NSCLC        PGE has been        shown to directly suppress T cell mediated immunity the        primary effector against tumor cells at a variety of        levels          Further PGE has been shown to        induce the IL in mononuclear cells      IL is a        prominent immunosuppressive cytokine that may have a        dominant role in preventing innate antitumor responses in        the NSCLC environment                              Among myriad suppressive effects on T cells        and antigen presenting cells IL is known to inhibit IL        production         IL plays a key role in        the initiation and potentiation of cellular immune        responses and alteration of the IL producing function in        circulating mononuclear phagocytes may be a critical factor        in suppressed T cell immunity to NSCLC             We evaluated both PGE and IL in plasma of NSCLC        patients finding only PGE to be significantly elevated        above controls Elevations were independent of stage of        disease or tumor histology Data also show mononuclear        phagocytes from NSCLC patients produce significantly more        IL over  hr in primary culture than controls        consistent with reports of altered cytokine profiles of        adherent mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients            Although         in vitro experiments suggest there        could be a direct link between elevated plasma PGE levels        and increased IL production by adherent mononuclear cells        in NSCLC the measurements of patient samples do not        support a simple causal relationship The correlation seen        in a subset of  patient samples may reflect only the        presence of underlying malignancy however it is tempting        to speculate on the physiologic relationship between the        two        PGE can be induced by a number of inflammatory        conditions however no single factor other than cancer is        likely to account for the significant differences seen in        this series Absolute values of PGE that may vary with        different assays are likely less important than the        observed differences between NSCLC and normals The lack of        association with disease stage or histology and the        nonspecific production of PGE by multiple cell types may        limit the usefulness of PGE as a specific independent        marker for NSCLC        Apart from standardized measurement of PGE as a marker        for disease a biologically relevant aspect of elevated        PGE would be in the association with altered immune        profile of mononuclear phagocytes specifically IL        induction Importantly serum IL levels were established        as an independent marker for disease and response to        therapy by De Vita et al     The source of the IL in        that series was thought to be from mononuclear cells Based        on the observations and conclusions of these investigators        and the measurable increases in IL production by        mononuclear phagocytes derived from NSCLC patients compared        to controls plasma levels of IL from these patients        might be expected to also be elevated In the current        series however there was no difference between patient        and control plasma IL levels The reasons for this        discrepancy are unclear and may be related to differences        in handlingprocessing samples or differences in the        sensitivity of the ELISAs used in the studies Further        there was no significant correlation between IL        production by mononuclear cells and disease stage as might        be inferred from the previously mentioned studies There        was no correlation with histologic type of lung cancer                    Conclusions        Plasma PGE levels may be a nonspecific marker for        NSCLC and warrants further investigation In contrast        plasma IL levels did not appear to be sensitive markers        in our studies IL production by circulating mononuclear        cells however appears to be associated with disease The        reasons for IL production by mononuclear cells in NSCLC        are speculative and may be varied Plasma PGE may        contribute but cannot be simply and directly linked                    Methods                  Cell lines          Six established NSCLC cell lines
