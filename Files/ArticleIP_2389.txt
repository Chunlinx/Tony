                                 Why Kids Have Kids            Does welfare spawnoutofwedlock babies The architects of the recently passed welfare reformbelieve it does They hope that curbing payments for additional children andenforcing parental work requirements will reverse the year trend that hasbrought large numbers of unmarried mothers onto the welfare rolls            In  percent of black infants and  percent of white infants were born tosingle mothers By  the rates had risen to  percent for black infantsand  percent for whites Every year about  million more children are borninto fatherless families at an enormously increased risk of growing up inpoverty            Efforts by social scientists to explain the rise inoutofwedlock births have been unconvincing Conservative Charles Murray forexample blames overly generous federal welfare benefits But as David Ellwoodand Lawrence Summers have shown cash welfare benefits rose sharply in thes and fell in the s and s when outofwedlock births rosemost            Liberalshave tended to favor the explanation offered by William Julius Wilson who ina  study attributed the increase in outofwedlock births to a decline inthe marriageability of black men due to a shortage of jobs But Robert D Mareand Christopher Winship have estimated that at most  percent of the declinein marriage rates of blacks between  and  can be explained bydecreasing employment            Abetter theory might be called ReproductiveTechnology Shock In the late s and very early s well before Roevs Wade in January  the availability of both abortion andcontraception increased dramatically Many states including New York andCalifornia liberalized their abortion laws In July  the Massachusettslaw prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people wasdeclared unconstitutional Many observers expected liberalized abortion andcontraception to lead to fewer outofwedlock births But the oppositehappened because of the decline in the custom of shotgun weddings            Before the stigma of unwed motherhood was so great that most women would onlyengage in sexual activity if it came with a promise of marriage in the event ofpregnancy Men were willing to make and keep that promise for they knew thateven if they left one woman they would be unlikely to find another who wouldnot make the same demand In the s women who were willing to get anabortion or who used contraception reliably no longer found it necessary tocondition sexual relations on a promise of marriage in the event of pregnancyBut women who found abortion unacceptable or who were unreliable in theircontraceptive use found themselves pressured to participate in premaritalsexual relations as well These women feared correctly that if they refusedsexual relations they would risk losing their partners            By making the birth of the child the physical choiceof the mother the sexual revolution has made marriage and child support asocial choice of the father And while only a few unmarried mothers oncekept their babies only a few put them up for adoption today because thestigma of unwed motherhood has declined Once shunned by their peers andwhisked out of town pregnant teenagers now receive both encouragement andsupport to keep their babies stay in school and participate in other socialactivities            Althoughdoubt will always remain about what causes a change in social custom thetechnologyshock theory does fit the facts The new reproductive technology wasadopted quickly and on a massive scale Marital and fertility patterns changedwith similar drama at about the same time            The use of birthcontrol pills at firstintercourse by all unmarried women jumped from  percent to  percent in justa few years and probably much more among sexually active unmarried women Thenumber of abortions among unmarried women grew from roughly  a year inthe late s compared with some  outofwedlock births to more than million a year compared with  outofwedlock births in the earlys During the same period births per unmarried woman roughly doubled forwhites while the fraction of white unmarried women rose about  percent Forblack unmarried women the birth rate actually fell by between  percent and percent but this was offset by an increase of about  percent in the numberof unmarried black women Meanwhile fertility rates for married women of bothraces declined rapidly making the outofwedlock birth ratio even larger            Theshotgunmarriage rate itself declined only gradually but that is notsurprising Social conventions change slowly It took time for men to recognizethat they did not have to promise marriage in the event of a pregnancy inexchange for sexual relations It may also have taken time for women toperceive the increased willingness of men to leave them if they demandedmarriage            One final puzzle however requires explanation The blackshotgunmarriage ratio began to fall earlier than the white ratio and shows nosignificant change in trend around  Here federal welfare benefits mayplay a role Because blacks on average have lower incomes than whites theyare more affected by changes in welfare benefits As a result the rise inwelfare benefits in the s may have resulted in a decline in the blackshotgunmarriage rate and thus in an increase in outofwedlock births            What should be done Even ifpossible attempts to turn back the technological clock by restricting abortionand contraception would now be counterproductive Besides denying reproductivefreedom to women such efforts would increase the number of children born andreared in impoverished singleparent families Most children born out ofwedlock are reported by their mothers to have been wanted but not at thattime Some are reported as not having been wanted at all Easier access tobirthcontrol information and devices and to abortion could reduce the numberof unwanted children and improve the timing of those whose mothers would havepreferred to wait
