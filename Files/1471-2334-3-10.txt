                    Background        Amprenavir APV is a potent protease inhibitor PI        that is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs        for the treatment of antiretroviralnave and experienced        adults and children with HIV infection         APV        offers the convenience of twicedaily BID administration        with no food or fluid restrictions      Preclinical        and clinical data suggest that APV has a lower potential to        cause lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities than other        currently available PIs       APV has a distinct        resistance profile that permits it to be considered as a        treatment option for either PInave or PIexperienced        patients     In a week trial in treatmentnave        patients NZTA n   APV  mg administered BID        APV with one abacavir  mg tablet and one        lamivudine  mgzidovudine  mg combination tablet        Combivir  was as effective as nelfinavir  mg three        times daily plus Combivir BID with regard to the        proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA  copiesmL        at week   vs  astreated analysis            However many patients in this trial withdrew prematurely        because of adverse events that may have been in part        related to the high pill burden  large  mg        softgelatin capsules daily associated with APV dosing and        excipients contained in the APV formulation available at        the time of the trial        To reduce APV pill burden and possibly improve        tolerability of APV treatment pharmacokinetic research        efforts have been directed at combining APV with the PI        ritonavir RTV which inhibits CYPAmediated hepatic        metabolism of APV thereby enhancing plasma APV exposure              The administration of RTV at the clinically        subtherapeutic dosage of  mg BID was found to boost APV        plasma exposure to such a degree as to permit halving the        APV daily pill burden from  to  capsulesday in        addition to maintaining the minimum plasma APV        concentration C         min  over  hours well above the         inhibitory concentrations IC           of patientderived HIV isolates            A pharmacokinetic study in  HIVinfected patients        PROF showed that APV at the lower dosage of  mg BID        combined with RTV  mg BID APVRTV resulted in a        geometric mean steadystate APV C         min  gmL over fold higher than        the C         min resulting from APV  gmL            This C         min was more than fold higher than        the IC          of APV against HIV of        antiretroviralnave patients mean    gmL        and over fold higher than the IC          of APV against HIV of        multiPIresistant patients mean    gmL IC                 s adjusted for the  protein        binding observed with APV Following APVRTV the APV        maximum serum concentration C         max  has been reported to be slightly        lower by  than that observed with APV            which may account for the RTVboosted APV regimen being        less likely to cause certain adverse events eg        oralperioral paresthesia and headache            Since the above pharmacokinetic studies and others        involving pharmacokinetic modeling predictions were        conducted over only a short period generally   days        and in a small number of patients there remained a need to        evaluate lowdose APVRTV combinations in large populations        of HIVinfected patients over a therapeutically relevant        period The purpose of ESS was to compare the        efficacy safety and tolerability of APV  mg BID plus        RTV  mg BID APVRTV to APV  mg BID APV        over  weeks in antiretroviralnave or experienced        HIVinfected patients who were receiving other background        antiretroviral drugs Late in the study patients who had        not yet completed  weeks of treatment were given the        option to continue treatment in a subsequent week        extension phase to assess the durability of virologic        response                    Methods                  Patients          Male and nonpregnant

stratified according to prior          antiretroviral therapy exposure ie nave or          experienced then randomized  to treatment for           weeks with either APV  mg BID plus RTV  mg BID or          to APV  mg BID in combination with   nonPI          antiretroviral drugs APV was supplied as  mg          softgelatin capsules of Agenerase GlaxoSmithKline          Research Triangle Park North Carolina thus eight          capsules were given for each  mg dose of APV and four          capsules for each  mg dose RTV was supplied as  mg          softgelatin capsules of Norvir Abbott Laboratories          North Chicago Illinois Late in the study patients who          had not yet completed  weeks of treatment were given          the option to continue treatment in a subsequent week

before any studyrelated          procedures were commenced The initial week portion of          the study was conducted between June   and October            at  treatment centers in the United          States                          Efficacy and Safety Assessment          The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of          patients with plasma HIV RNA levels  copiesmL          at week  Plasma HIV RNA was assessed by the Roche          Amplicor MONITOR Ultrasensitive assay version  lower          limit of quantitation LLOQ  copiesmL and          quantitation range of  to  copiesmL Roche          Diagnostics Branchburg New Jersey Patients were          classified as having reached a virologic endpoint if at          week  plasma HIV RNA levels were   copiesmL or          if the plasma HIV RNA had not decreased by at least          log            from baseline at week  with          confirmation at week           Secondary efficacy measures included assessment of the          proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA           copiesmL using the above mentioned assay changes in          CD cell counts measured by flow cytometry compared          with baseline values and progression of HIV disease from          baseline status to the occurrence of the first new event          involving a change in CDC class for each patient          Patients who remained at their entry CDC class were          considered to be clinical nonprogressors          Change from baseline in plasma HIV RNA levels was          assessed at weeks    and  in all patients as          well as at weeks   and  in patients who          participated in the treatment extension phase CD cell          counts were assessed at baseline and at weeks  and           Patients had plasma collected for

Statistical Analysis          The study was powered to evaluate whether the          virologic efficacy proportion of patients with plasma          HIV HIV  copiesmL at week  in the APV          RTV arm was at least as good noninferior as in the          APV arm Noninferiority of the APVRTV regimen to          the APV regimen was established if the  lower          confidence limit LCL for the difference in proportion          of patients achieving HIV RNA  copiesmL at week           with APV RTV minus APV was  The          noninferiority margin of  was chosen based on          previous regulatory studies and was prespecified in the          protocol Target enrollment was  in the APVRTV arm          and  in the APV arm The primary analysis was made          in the intenttotreat ITT

    between treatment arms regarding proportion of patients          achieving HIV RNA  copiesmL and           copiesmL were made using the CochranMantelHaenszel          test controlling for prior

      plasma HIV RNA were tabulated by treatment arm and          visit then analyzed using analysis of variance ANOVA          The safety population consisted of all patients who          consumed at least  dose of study drug Safety parameters          included incidence of treatmentlimiting toxicities          clinical and laboratory adverse events and change from          baseline in selected laboratory variables at weeks             and  Fishers exact test was used to compare          adverse event rate and ANOVA was used to compare change          from baseline for laboratory variables

At week  the median change          from baseline in CD cell count in the APVRTV and          APV arms was  and  cellsmm  respectively          and the final median CD cell count was  and

fatigue were the most common adverse events in both          treatment arms The incidence of drugrelated          oralperioral paresthesia was lower in the APVRTV          treatment arm than the APV arm  vs  No          differences between the APVRTV and APV treatment          arms were observed regarding the frequency of          drugrelated grade  adverse events  vs           frequency of discontinuing treatment due to adverse          events  vs  incidence of hyperglycemia  vs           patient nonspecific lipodystrophy  vs  buffalo          hump  vs  or hypercholesterolemia  vs  More          cases of hypertriglyceridemia were reported as adverse          events in the APVRTV arm   vs  However          review of laboratory changes revealed that the incidence          of grade  hypertriglyceridemia was the same  in          each treatment arm                            Discussion        The virological results of this study indicate that over        a week treatment period the APVRTV regimen was        statistically similar to or better than the APV regimen        according to the  copiesmL endpoint criterion        However a significantly greater proportion of patients in        the APVRTV treatment arm achieved HIV RNA         copiesmL Greater reductions in plasma HIV RNA levels        were also observed in patients receiving APVRTV BID        than those using APV BID The greater magnitude of        virologic suppression in the study population as a whole        with the APVRTV regimen was expected in view of the        results of earlier clinical pharmacokinetic studies showing        a fold higher C         min level with APVRTV BID compared        with the APV BID regimen     Higher C         min values achieved with RTVboosting        may be critical in treating antiretroviralexperienced        patients particularly those with HIV isolates having        increased IC          values        The proportion of antiretroviralnave patients who        achieved HIV RNA  copiesmL in the APVRTV arm        was twice that for the APV arm  vs          P   No differences in        virologic efficacy between treatment arms were evident in        the antiretroviralexperienced subgroup  vs          P   It is possible that        proportionally more treatmentnave patients may have        responded to APVRTV due to poorer or more difficult        adherence to the APV regimen but no adherence checks        were included in this study to verify this Although the         copiesmL endpoint criterion also showed a higher        proportion of antiretroviralnave patients responding to        APVRTV than to APV  vs  the differences        were not statistically significant possibly due to the        small size of this subgroup In another study of APVRTV        in antiretroviralnave patients Arasteh et al           reported a higher proportion of patients achieving plasma        HIV RNA  copiesmL  than in the present study        perhaps due to the use of only lamivudine and abacavir as        background antiretroviral medication and to differences in        their study population relative to ours        The proportion of antiretroviralexperienced patients in        the APVRTV treatment arm who achieved HIV RNA         copiesmL at  weeks  ITTobserved analysis         ITT M  F analysis was comparable to that reported in        antiretroviralexperienced patients at  weeks in the        studies by Schooley et al    ESS PEARL         ITTobserved analysis but much higher than that        reported by Katlama et al     ITT M  F        analysis Differences in virologic suppression between        the present study and the Katlama study may stem from the        use of other background agents and the far greater        antiretroviral experience and welldocumented PI mutations        in Katlamas patients        The week extension phase showed that most patients        who had HIV RNA  copiesmL at week  maintained        this level of virologic suppression through week  Thus        some indication of durability of viral suppression might be        gathered from these data although the number of patients        evaluated in this study phase was small The durability of        virologic response to APVRTV was also suggested in an        earlier study by Katlama et al            The increase in CD cells observed at  weeks in the        APVRTV BID arm was not different from that in the        APV arm It was lower in magnitude than the CD cell        count increases reported for APVRTV arm at  weeks in        antiretroviralexperienced patients in ESS            and similar to that reported in heavily pretreated        patients by Katlama et al    in a patient population        with comparable baseline disease characteristics median        HIV RNA of  log          mL and CD count of  cellsmm                The safety profile of the APVRTV regimen was similar        to that of the APV regimen with respect to the main        adverse events which were gastrointestinal GI in nature        in both treatment arms GI adverse events reported in the        APVRTV arm were possibly due to the addition of RTV to        the regimen or because the reduction in pill burden and        hence in excipients was not great enough to improve GI        tolerance The higher incidence of oralperioral        paresthesia in the APV treatment arm was most likely        due to the higher APV C         max that occurs following APV dosing        compared with APVRTV BID dosing     Although the        incidence of headache has been shown to increase with        higher APV C         max values     the incidence of        this adverse event did not differ between treatment arms in        this study The higher incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in        the APVRTV arm was probably due to RTV because this PI        has been reported to cause elevations in serum        triglycerides     Other studies of RTVboosted APV        regimens have also reported that triglyceride elevation is        usually grade  or  in magnitude and as in the present        study seldom necessitates treatment discontinuation or the        addition of antihyperlipidemic drugs to the patients        treatment plan             This study evaluated a patient population that was        ethnically diverse with just over half of the patients        being either African American or Hispanic The inclusion of        a large proportion of African American and Hispanic        patients was deemed important because these are the        populations in whom the HIV epidemic is increasing the most            Earlier clinical trials have tended to        underrepresent these populations            One limitation of our study was that no pharmacokinetic        analyses were performed to validate whether the RTV dosage        regimen coadministered with APV was effectively        boosting plasma APV exposure or C         min levels However ESS which        also evaluated the APVRTV regimen over a week        period did conduct a pharmacokinetic evaluation showing        steadystate serum APV C         min values of  gmL ie over        fold higher than that usually achieved after the APV        regimen Thus plasma APV levels well above the IC          s of most HIV isolates were most        likely achieved in ESS Higher RTV doses of  mg BID        and  mg BID coadministered with APV have resulted in        no greater virologic suppression than  mg BID            and raising the dose of APV from  mg BID to  mg BID        does not improve efficacy either although it may increase        the incidence of adverse events            In conclusion APVRTV BID was similar to or better        than APV BID based on virologic results using the        copiesmL HIV RNA endpoint Of note a significantly        greater proportion of patients in the APVRTV treatment        arm achieved HIV RNA  copiesmL at week  which        was a secondary endpoint Other beneficial features of the        APVRTV regimen such as improved dosing convenience and        reduced pill burden need to be factored into decision        making when APVRTV is being considered by clinicians as        a therapeutic option for the treatment of either        antiretroviralnave or experienced patients with HIV        infection
