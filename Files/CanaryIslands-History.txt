A Brief HistoryThe Canary Islands are a land of legends The ancient Greeks thought of them as the Garden of Hesperides Romans called this archipelago the Fortunate Islands and Homer tells us that blessed ones were sent to the Elysian Fields to enjoy eternal happiness in a land where winter was unknown Could this have been the CanariesThe author Plutarch wrote of fertile lands somewhere off the coast of Africa where the breezes of springtime never stop His source was the Roman leader Sertorius who had heard of the lands from an explorerMany writers link the lost continent of Atlantis with the Canaries According to Plato this rich happy land lying somewhere to the west of Gibraltar in the Atlantic Ocean was destroyed by earthquakes and tidal waves nearly  years ago After the cataclysm only the mountaintops of Atlantis remained above the sea and constituted seven islands The Canaries perhapsFrom Plato to Jules Verne the possibilities have stirred peoples imagination ranging from the theories of learned academics to the ramblings of wild eccentrics By now the truth is surely lost in the myths and mists of time What is undeniable however is the magical presence that these seven volcanic sisters possess When you sight Mount Teide on a distant horizon you will understand the profusion of legendsThe First InhabitantsLong before the first European sailors beached in the Canaries all seven islands were inhabited The original Canarians came to be called Guanches meaning in the native tongue man Strictly speaking this name applies only to the original inhabitants of TenerifeThe Guanches are thought to have arrived in the islands around the st or nd century bc probably from North Africa Ethnographers link them with the CroMagnon and ProtoMediterranean race They were tall lightskinned often blueeyed and blondhaired You can see their remains in the meticulous collection of the Museo Canario in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria Here too you can study their preoccupation with death Like the ancient Egyptians they carefully embalmed their dead presumably for a ceremonial passage to the next world Cryptic rock carvings have been found that may explain these rituals but so far no one has found the Canarian version of the Rosetta Stone with which to decipher themAnother baffling mystery is how the Guanches arrived on the islands No evidence of Guanche boats has ever been discovered so were they marooned here by pirates or perhaps exiled by their own people One theory is that they may have floated across from North Africa on reed craft The expeditions of Thor Heyerdahl do lend some credence to this idea and the concept is explored in great detail at the Pyramids of Gmar on TenerifeIn keeping with their Berber origins the Guanches were cave dwellers though by no means did all Guanches live in the rocks and many of the original caves that remain today for example the Cuevas de Valern on Gran Canaria were probably used only for storage Cave dwelling in such a climate is a logical idea being cooler in summer and warmer in winter than more conventional accommodations Even today there are many cave dwellings in the islandsA Guanche legacy that you will see at the market place and in traditional eating houses is gofio a finelyground toasted flour that is still a traditional Canarian staple The Guanche language also lives on in such place names as Tafira and Tamadaba on Gran Canaria Timanfaya on Lanzarote Teide on Tenerife and Tenerife itselfConquistadorsThe first foreign visitors to the Canaries are thought to have been Arab sailors who landed on Gran Canaria some  years ago and were met warmly In later centuries the islanders gracious hospitality was to cost them dearlyEuropeans did not arrive until the th century when the Genoese sailor Lanzarotto Marcello colonized the island known then in native tongue as Tytheroygatra and subsequently as Lanzarote Slave traders treasure seekers and missionaries all followed in Lanzarottos wake but it was not until  that the European conquest of the Canaries began in earnest At its helm was the Norman baron Jean de Bthencourt under service to Henry III king of Castile After the baron had taken Lanzarote and Fuerteventura with comparative ease his ships were scattered by storms off Gran Canaria He next turned to El Hierro where the awestruck islanders welcomed the new visitors arriving in their great floating vessels as gods Bthencourt returned the hospitality by inviting the natives aboard his ships He then took them captive and sold them into slaveryAround this time the Portuguese who had also been colonizing the Atlantic turned their attention to the Canaries Naval skirmishes ensued between the two powers but at the end of the war of succession between Portugal and Castile the wideranging Treaty of Alcaovas ended Lisbons claims to the Fortunate IslandsBy order of Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile the second phase of the conquest was set in motion By  Gran Canaria had been subdued and in  Gomera was taken La Palma held out until  and after another two years of furious fighting the biggest prize of all Tenerife was in Spanish hands The process of pacification and conversion to the Christian faith had taken almost a century of bloody guerilla warfare with thousands of casualties sustained mainly on the brave but illequipped Guanche sideThe World Is RoundJust as the conquest of the Canaries was reaching its climax Christopher Columbus Cristobal Coln in Spanish was planning his historic expedition in search of a sea route to the East Indies Each of the Canaries boasts some connection with Columbus who came to the islands because they were then the worlds most westerly charted points and therefore the last stopping point before venturing into the unknownThe great navigator definitely stopped off at Gomera and Las Palmas on his voyage of  and he even recorded a volcanic eruption while passing Tenerife Not surprisingly his crew took this as an ill omen but as history tells us once past El Hierro they did not drop off the edge of the world after all Columbuss routes and Canarian connections may be traced at the atmospheric Casa de Coln in Las Palmas see page The role of the islands as a bridge between the Old World and the New World has continued through the centuries Canarians have settled in Latin America in large numbers usually in search of a better way of life and news from Venezuela and Cuba is treated almost as a local item in the Canary Islands newspapers Canarian bananas provided the stock for those of the Carribbean and in spoken accent and musical rhythms the Canaries lie halfway between Spain and South AmericaWine and WarfareThe Canaries first major agricultural enterprise was sugar Sugar cane sprouted easily on the islands and during the first half of the th century a burgeoning industry developed Boom turned to bust however with cheaper sugar production from Brazil and the Antilles and the industry diedStill trade links had at least been established with both the Old and the New World and wine became the new farming venture to bolster the economy Grapes grown in the volcanic soil produced a distinctive fullbodied malmsey wine malvasa that became the fashionable drink of aristocratic Europe Shakespeare and Voltaire among others were lavish in their praise and todays island visitors can still sample the excellent wine in bodegas restaurants or even from the supermercado When touring the islands you may still see old disused wine presses lagares on hillsidesBy the end of the th century the Canaries were a sufficiently important trading point to attract all types of pirates In  Horatio Nelson attacked Santa Cruz de Tenerife in search of a Spanish treasure ship The defenders responded vigorously accounting for the lives of  British sailors and the removal of the lower part of Nelsons saluting arm The Santa Cruzeros clearly had no hard feelings towards Admiral Nelson however Once it was known that the attack had been repelled a gift of wine was sent out to Nelson England was after all an important wine market and a street was named Calle de Horacio Nelson in his honorFree TradeBy the early th century Canarians had become fully Spanish in both outlook and loyalties and many volunteers joined the Peninsular War Spaniards call it the War of Independence which ended in  with the restoration of Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throneEconomic problems arose in the early th century and the wine industry started to fail Luckily another singlecrop opportunity presented itself in the form of cochineal a parasitic insect attracted to the opuntia variety of cactus The tiny bodies of the female bugs contain a darkred liquid perfect for dyeing and for  years or so millions of bugs were crushed for the sake of the Canarian economic goodThe Bug Bubble burst with the rise of chemical dyes in the s With the failure of yet another monoculture the Spanish government felt constrained to help the Canarian economy In the midth century free port status was granted by royal decree to one port in each of the islands two in Tenerife The lowering of duties and trade barriers at a time of considerable shipping expansion had the desired effect and Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas soon became two of the worlds busiest portsThe most recent major crop to come from the Canaries is bananas The variety is the dwarf banana small and very tasty and today demand actually outstrips production in some areas The first exports were made in the s and the banana has continued to be a mainstay of the islands economy Despite some recent problems and concern for the future it is hoped that bananas will continue to be an important Canarian crop alongside their other staples tomatoes and potatoesIn  Cabildos Island Councils were created and given the responsibility for the social political and economic administration of each island and coordination with the Town Halls This led in  to the islands being divided into two provinces Santa Cruz de Tenerife with the islands of Tenerife La Palma La Gomera and El Hierro and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with the islands of Lanzarote and FuerteventuraThe Spanish Civil WarThe plot that sparked off the Spanish Civil War was hatched in the Canary Islands In  a group of senior officers discontented with the policies of the Spanish Republican Government met in secret in the woods of La Esperanza on Tenerife They had come to meet a fellow officer Francisco Franco whom the government had banished to the Canaries for subversive plotting From the Canaries Franco took off for North Africa the launching pad for the insurgent rightwing attackThree years later his armies had triumphed in a ruthless struggle that cost hundreds of thousands of Spanish lives The Canaries were not spared the horrors of the war mass Republican executions took place in the aptly named Barranco del Infierno the Gorge of Hell on Tenerife but on the whole the islands prospered during Francos period of dictatorship which provided for added protection to their freeport statusTourismThe massive growth of tourism in the islands since the s has in some cases literally refaced the landscape with brandnew resorts such as Playa de las Amricas on Tenerife and Playa del Ingls on Gran Canaria springing up like Gold Rush boom towns However such developments are mostly the exception and whole swathes of even the more developed islands are virtually untouched while La Palma La Gomera and El Hierro are only now starting to provide even the most basic tourist facilities The infrastructure and transport systems both within and between the islands have as a consequence improved drasticallyIn  the passing of the Rgimen Econmico y Fiscal Economic and Tax Regime allowed for different methods of tax collection and economic management than that of the rest of Spain Three years later after the death of Franco a constitutional monarchy was restored with King Juan Carlos I at its head However the subsequent decolonization of Spains Western Sahara possession resulted in a movement of many thousands of people back to the Canary Islands creating social and logistical problems The year  saw the declaration of a new Spanish Constitution further strengthening the new democracy and preparing the ground for a State of Autonomous Regions As a result on  August  the Canary Islands were given autonomous status with nearly all governmental functions transferred from Madrid and the status of capital being shared between Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria The former is the head office of the Canarian Parliament where the President of the Canary Islands is elected and half the departments and ministries are based and the latter is the seat of the presidency of the government and the home of the superior courts and the remaining departments and ministries The Canary Islands Parliament has  members distributed equally between the two provinces with Tenerife La Palma La Gomera and El Hierro having    and  respectively and Gran Canaria Lanzarote and Fuerteventura having   and  respectively Each island still has its own Cabildo Island Council and all officials are elected by a free vote every four years The full incorporation of Spain into the European Economic Community in  brought the end of the dutyfree ports status but saw certain special allowances for the Canary Islands with respect to agriculture fishing and taxes
