        oh it it its i im im not sure if if theres anything i really consider an invasion of privacy that happens happens regularly except maybe like telemarketers and things       yeah i have the problem with the telemarketers over here we get we get all types we get the handicapped people calling up here   you want to buy some light bulbs   thats right   yeah   and uh if you dont want the light bulbs theres vitamins and if you dont want the vitamins theres the household cleaner   pens   no  ive had ive we i just today was looking into an organization called Catholic War Veterans because they were bugging   boy they they theyre tugging on a few strings at once arent they   yeah they were uh bugging me for a donation earlier and i i you know i get these calls on one line just constantly every single organization   yeah   and you know you its ive learned to hang up on them but sometimes its not so easy   yeah i i got some call last night im trying to remember oh this this was like this this is kind of an invasion of privacy where uh i went to a wedding expo because im getting married and uh there are like you know uh these places where they say you know sign sign up for a free whatever you know for for a drawing   yeah   and you do it and uh you know all of a sudden this guy is calling you and saying hi we want to call you know talk about video taping your wedding when shall we set a time up and i couldnt get the guy to get off the phone       its like how many at what what part of no didnt you understand you know   well its the same thing with these oil well people what do you mean you dont want to get rich The other thing that i i think is amusing are with these long distance companies now we have MCI here   yeah same here   and uh they have their friends and family program and i love it you can call up on one of the lines the   family right yeah  they they fixed it so you had to give some information out but   well theres another one the account balance line all you got to know is the persons zip code   right   and you can find out how theyre paying their M C I bills and and on anyone you know all you got to do is cross reference a phone number with a zip code which isnt too difficult and you can learn all sorts of things and Sprint does the same thing and and     yeah they i i think in general you know technology as nice as it is is causing a lot its just too easy now to its like you know Bay banks used to be you know you could do anything over the phone   yeah   you had to know your pin number but i could just i could just say to it empty my whole account out if i wanted transfer things and you know there theres a lot of of risk involved there because you know it its like you know the best example is probably credit reports now   huh   where where you know God knows what goes on those things i mean thankfully thankfully now you can get your reports for free at least from TRW but it it it its like its its this anonymous thing where anyone can dump any information they want about you in there with no real  opportunity to rebut unless you want to go and get the report and then you know and then you you you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been you know dumping information about you in there and ive heard of cases where it was just done vindictively   yeah we had uh we got a report back in the mail as a matter of fact and found all sorts of problems with it mainly account numbers that have changed and they left both accounts showing as open   yeah   and uh some other one that claimed i didnt pay them and i did and then you have to try and get that company to take you off and they dont really want to bother and   yeah yeah when i when i applied for my Gold MasterCard they said well you have to close this other MasterCard out too and i said you mean the one i closed two years ago       and i had to get a letter from this other company saying that i had closed it   oh yeah its a pain in the neck because they you know theyll theyll believe these companies in a second over the individual   yeah   and getting proof for these people i mean its not my job youre the one that screwed up and you know if you want to damage my credit rating thats fine but i will take whatever actions are appropriate to protect it   um   like lawsuit   oh it it its very slippery though because you know its  one of the things you do when you when you sign those little credit applications is theres all sorts of disclaimerage at the bottom about how you know youre permitting them to check do credit checks of you and to make your information available to other people and by the time you get through reading it youve basically permitted them to you know broadcast on the evening news your credit rating   yeah  i know i know its just that consumer we need to have stronger consumer protection laws and we just dont seem to be able to get the government to do it   right right well you know theres much more subtle kinds of invasions of privacy like every time you call an eight hundred number youre giving them your phone number   oh yeah yeah i know ive been reading the Comp DCom Telecom all about it   yeah were we both probably signed up for this in the same place   yeah i i contribute every once in a while in there and yeah i see the messages about the uh A N I   A N I yeah but to some extent im not as worried about that because yeah youre youre getting a value for that youre getting to call these people for free   yeah i uh you know the other boondoggle is this caller I D thing you know i dont mind caller I D one bit   umhum   um if i dont want to use it or if someone calls me that i dont know who it is i can just not answer the phone   yeah
