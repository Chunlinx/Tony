                                 The Cultural Contradictions of Celebration                        Dear Witold            I hear what youre saying about being skeptical while also takingCelebration seriously Ive tried to do the same in writing about the placefor while I think Celebration is a flawed experiment with insidiousimplications I also think that Disney was adventurous to try it and that thearchitects and planners Disney employed to make it a reality are in thrall to aworthy ideal I might accuse them of being pernicious tools of Satan well OKDisney but I wouldnt be so disrespectful as to dismiss them lightly ordiscredit all of their motives Now the same for books I give just aboutanyone high marks for writing one and I hate to see any author misreadcavalierly as so regularly happens            Living in a town so as to write about it can be a soultwisting commitmentfor a writer requiring a simultaneous existence as neighbor and spy friendand infidel For taking on that task all three of these writers deserve kudosAll the more reason why I hate to see Ross dismissed when to my mind his bookis not only more fun to read it is also more ambitious and Kurt Andersennotwithstanding better reported            Ross book is not parallel to Celebration USA It is a complementto it It takes the same year same town same questions and many of the sameevents and hunts for their meaning in a very different direction Frantz andCollins with their solid if seemingly cutandpaste history and assiduousdiary of whose kid beat up whose etc stay within the perimeter ofCelebration within what Ross calls the White Vinyl Fence Ross to theapparent consternation of some reviewers but to my relief strays beyond itYou say Frantz and Collins have done the relevant homework but theirinterviews with Michael Eisner Robert AM Stern and others among the seminalthinkers funders and power brokers who brought Celebration to pass didntseem to draw those thinkers very deep into the matters that make Celebration anexperiment worth writing about Ross seems to have engaged them a bit more inthat regard            The advantage of Ross exploration is that he doesnt buy the conceit thatCelebration is a world apart He makes it a part of the world an actor in alarger ecology This can be through the natural incursions of alligators intothe towns artificial lake and encephalitisbearing mosquitoes onto its iconicporches Or more significant it can involve the human machinery behind thebuilding of the town Ross notes how the ransom that Disney paid to OsceolaCounty for the favor of being exempt from providing lowincome housingassistance within Celebration was eaten up by themepark employees who couldnot afford to live in Celebration on a Disney wage He notes that in localreal estate terms Celebration was not the antisprawl incentive that the NewUrbanists imagined but rather a beachhead for an expansion of suburban tractdevelopment And more than Frantz and Collins Ross explores the significancethat makes Celebration not just another Columbia or Reston or Hershey orPullman its corporate sponsorship of a community in an age when corporationsand governments are shuffling and redealing the cards of civic responsibilityin what Ross calls a consumer societys rendition of the concerns of thefounding fathers            This is where Disney is more than just an irresistible candle to the mothsof snarky social critique Disney was uniquely positioned to foster thepreeminent attempt at a neotraditional townno one else had the pocketbookinterest and reputation But Disney was also uniquely burdenedbecause itsparks were magnets for the Orlando sprawl that Celebration is meant to correctand because the Disney company is a historically antidemocratic institutionwhose imposition of civic virtue in Celebration relies to some extent onauthoritarian principles principles at odds with the American charter itstraditional house faades are calculated to evoke This is extraordinary Thepeople at Disney find it extraordinary the people in love with Disney whoflocked to buy houses in Celebration find it extraordinary and thankfullyDouglas Frantz and Catherine Collins and Andrew Ross find it extraordinarytoo enough so to warrant spending a year of their lives there Do you trulyfind Celebration unexceptional except in its halo of Disneyengenderedexpectations
