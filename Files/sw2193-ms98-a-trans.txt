            all right well what do you think about womens roles in the last generation what uh what changes have you seen   well i have noticed a lot uh more womens roles at work which i like in management which thats good i i guess to have a womans viewpoints and uh in a way things are handled at work especially in personnel type jobs which i think is probably better on the hand of women for uh any kind of maternity benefits and stuff like that women probably understand that better than the men do so i think thats good   well yeah yeah i would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than men     yeah   we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings   i think   i think that thats a good benefit i think having women uh in in higher up positions stuff like that   well ive noticed that it seems uh some women are i guess what i call the feministus       you know or you know very strong uh you know womens libbers and others that dont want to be and its its confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you dont know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know   uhhuh yeah right and how to treat them right right and who wants to be treated which way   yeah i think they should all wear signs you know or something       but uh i i i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background   yeah   the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not   right i thought that was really interesting in the war i figure   i cant figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go   right   if you can stay out of it although i guess although i did notice that all the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go     they couldnt do anything about it   now its kind of like when the men do you course you you used to saying used to be the old men declare the war and the young men fight it and now and now its its im happy to see that the women have the same problem that the men has had because they got the old fat women yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they dont have to go   right right   thats exactly right they can just watch it   i always wanted to put Gloria Steinem on a set of camels and send her over to the Gulf and let her fight but   i think its uh i think if they want to do it you know if thats what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it   well they couldnt be worse than some of the men   thats right and i dont   i think it all depends on mental set more than sex   right thats exactly right now theyre trained and everything so  let them do it if they want to thats thats the way it is in a lot of jobs you know like the firemen you know for a long time they thought stuff like that you know trying to be firemen policemen and stuff like that now they get to be all that   well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it   right   but i do object to you know someone hiring a woman just because they have to meet their quota   thats exactly and i feel the same exact same way i dont think thats right   thats thats really just kind of discrimination no matter how any way you put it   right youre uh you know its the best person qualified i think and and thats the way it ought to be but its as we know its not   yeah i i stutter to think that i may be flying in a seven forty seven with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know the right sex rather than qualifications   right exactly same with a doctor in a hospital   yeah thats true i hate to i hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female     thats right   you know   she got that scholarship   or a Black woman named Rodriguez   right they need to give the scholarship to a woman thats true thats true with any case i hate that but but that is true but   well i think we are that society tends to overcompensate   right   much with whatever its with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now   its yeah ethnic any ethnic problem or race   or with uh anything ethnic problems uh i think society society tends to overcompensate and we go we swing we swing out to the far left and far right trying to get everybody in   umhum dont want to hurt anybodys feelings and get everybody covered   oh thats true oh yeah God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say you know   umhum   hey sweetie or something   umhum and now everythings his you know uh his and her and everything you have to you always have to say it like that you can never say you know his you know and that never has offended me when you know when someones talking and they say you know his job or something like that or   right a wait person   thats never i mean i understand that theyre talking about the job  not the person in the job thats thats always thats always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it   what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female   but yeah she is she  i i dont know i i cant say that that i i well i cant say that i did or didnt vote for her because i didnt get to vote this time but i dont know that im i guess im ready just hard to see a woman in such a i guess powerful position   i think im more scared of her not because shes a female but because more for her political political beliefs and what she says shes going to do i think id be scared of anybody male or female in that position   right right right   although you see more and more uh more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics   i know thats true and   and you know occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the business sector   right inexperience also thats something that bothers me is uh even though she is you know the treasurer forever it bothers me that i dont know that she doesnt have that much background i guess in well its hard to say i dont know something about it just just kind of bothers me   i think her backgro und totally bothers me   yeah she i mean she seems on the outside uh good and everything but but i dont know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because were not used to having im not used to having women in in roles like that you know as role models   that could be yeah   youre just always used to men i mean thats just something that men always did   yeah the governor was you know the governor he did this   right   an d now we got the governor shes going to do that   thats exactly right and   wonder what theyll call if she was married and wonder if theyll refer to him as the first husband   probably yeah and in Dallas you know we had the uh Annette Strauss and shes a uh first woman mayor so   oh yeah Houston got a female mayor   do they   yeah   i didnt know that   she oh yeah shes a shes a staunch supporter of all the uh gay rights matter fact she lives down in the gay district   oh does she really   oh yeah   oh Lord   so i think you know i im not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or because or because she supported the gays i really dont know because a large you know theres a large population down there of gays     big combination of both shes got covered all the bases didnt she   yeah yeah she seems to be interesting i i and you see more and more uh you know uh Mickey Lelands wife is   yeah   taking over his seat and course you know we got the like you said they elected a female mayor in Dallas one in Houston we got a female governor and theres two or three more governors in in the in the state that are females   right thats really good i guess   and theres quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them you know i would i i i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards   right yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that so thats going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion they just   yeah but i think were bred that way you know i think i think its part of the   yeah exactly and thats   of the of the male mystique   thats thats sad to say that that that thats true though   and uh   so   course the reason yeah i think its going to be harder for for females in the next ten years or so to make strides in say you know the Southwest and Midwest and you down here   umhum   in the southern states than it will be up in the more liberal east and west coast   right right   this is you know   i am surprised though that we do have so many that are in politics down here   we dont have quite as many as they do east and west coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the   yeah   the good ole boys with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your down between your legs driving down the road   yeah yeah yeah   and of course thats changing too but you know i think and that came about because of the women you know Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD   thats right that was a good that was a good leadership   the greatest force in America is mothers   that women thats what they say thats true   if you could mobilize the mothers you got them     thats true well i hope   yeah   you know that they whatever these leaders of ours do that everythings for the good that just like like you said its with man or a woman it should however theyre going to be able to uh take care of us i dont know   just depends on whos going to exploit us when   yeah i do know though in our company we dont have a lot of upper upper management women i mean we rarely have any women that are upper management   is that because theyre just not uh you just dont have any women that are there or no one has   i dont know     ascended to that level yet   i dont know thats really thats really well its its so uh i guess were were kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of men always did the you know the engineering and all this and the technology and men are so im im sure thats has a lot to do with it   ive noticed that in a lot of companies that you know everybody says well theres no women in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there   right right   just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesnt automatically mean you it shouldnt mean that you get promoted to that part     thats right thats exactly right so but a lot of more women are starting their own businesses ive noticed than   yeah   and thats thats pretty interesting   we have several here in Austin that have uh i guess started up uh one of them matter fact runs a furniture uh place she builds library furniture   oh does she thats pretty interesting   and she and shes take shes taking over and its uh its its a million dollar a year company and shes having a ball doing it   yeah theres a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarella or a cheese company cant remember the name of it and shes a multimillionaire from it and i i just think God if only it could be me   yeah yeah ive got several uh matter fact i have some friends that own machine shops and they have several
