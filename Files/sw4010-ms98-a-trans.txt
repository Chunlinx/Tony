        what do you think about drug testing   i think its pretty good i think they should do it especially in uh in companies where uh you deal with uh either with other people or with uh stuff that uh i want to say uh deals directly with peoples lives like hospitals and stuff   yeah yeah but   um everywhere uh you know when uh when i was in college when uh everywhere i i applied a job for uh pretty much did a drug test because most of them were like defense contractors and stuff   uhhuh   except uh the the last job the job i actually took they didnt care   oh is that right was it a large or a small company   so its a big company its uh MCI telecommunications and i think uh they may require it for like the field engineers the people that actually go out you know and drive their trucks around and stuff like that uh or run the heavy machinery but they dont require it for you know the engineering positions     uhhuh uhhuh is that right   yeah i was kind of surprised but defense contractors only want you doing it because uh they dont want you to sell drugs or buy drugs for you know for secrets or something you know   well sure i theres that part of it i think and and i think most defense contractors also have other divisions of the company   right   that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in uh defense or   umhum umhum hum right   consumer products or whatever youd youd have an equal chance of being tested   umhum   i dont i dont know i just think its a sick thing that weve come to that i dont like the way the worlds going   yeah i mean yeah i mean i have i have no problem i mean people complain so much you know about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this stuff and you know i i dont know i guess its bad you know to to go inside somebody you know hand them a urine sample bottle you know but uh   well does it ive heard a lot of discussions about this and i guess the scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive   right right   and and thats what what really upsets a lot of people who are you know very straight and probably wouldnt ever think of using drugs but the idea that they could lose their jobs   right   or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive   uhhuh well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean theyre theyre better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair   uh no urine   they can uh well cant they also test your hair   yes they can and i think thats probably be more acceptable i believe its more accurate   right right   but thats not what theyre doing at my company   oh really   no its urine samples i havent been tapped yet  to do this     okay well you know   but they certainly started out i believe with the managers and folks like that   uhhuh uhhuh well they uh i mean all the places i went to you know they gave us you know small tests and stuff like that i guess if uh you could always get a second opinion i mean if your company tests positive i mean i i i would just think there was a way thered be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again and uh test negative   yeah well   and any way have time for that        wouldnt it   yeah i i suppose i suppose its its just you know the whole idea of all the hassles youd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind   yeah umhum   you know everybody has databases these days       and they know a lot more about me than ill ever remember im sure   yeah and a matter of fact i think there are too many of these dull databases going around   yeah well im im certainly certainly sure that uh any drug test results would become a part of that   yeah thats true i guess they put it in your personnel file   probably so   yeah because i im im you know im surprised they dont do it you know in uh in my organization   yeah   but uh   well i certainly believe in it for uh  people like airline pilots   right   or uh what seems to be more of a problem train drivers   uhhuh yeah train  and also uh uh uh boat captains i mean not necessarily big boat captains but small the uh small personal boats   uhhuh   they had trouble with uh not just substance abuse but uh alcohol abuse and stuff   oh sure   and they had these boat crashes and you know all these people were getting arrested and and they finally said no more alcohol out there you know in uh like where i used to live in Virginia   oh   they had a lot of problems with uh with boat wrecks and involving you know alcohol related incidents and uh drug related incidents   yeah   so they finally just said uh if we catch you were going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to   huh   so straightened a few people out   well i guess it would i guess so well i dont know i i i really havent sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh im totally straight would never consider using drugs   um   umhum well you know im the same way   but uh it it sort of goes back to its a presumption of guilt and you have to prove that youre innocent   umhum umhum umhum   on the other hand uh
