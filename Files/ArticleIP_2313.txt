                                 The Football Caucus            Three of the  Republicanfreshmen elected to Congress in  arrived in Washington with the status ofcelebrities One was Sonny Bono lately replaced by his widow Mrs Bono Theother two were both former professional football players both from Oklahomaand both aggressively religious The white one is Steve Largent who representsTulsa The black one is JC Watts who grew up poor in the hamlet of Eufaulaand represents southwestern Oklahoma            From themoment they arrived the two have had an aura about them Both won desirablecommittee assignments They are frequent guests on talk shows and favoredspeakers at GOP fundraisers Largent has been touted in conservativepublications such as the Weekly Standard as having what it takes to be aRepublican vice president Watts who is also frequently mentioned as veeptimber gave a big speech at the partys  convention in San Diego and wasselected by Newt Gingrich to deliver the Republican response to Bill Clintons State of the Union address His signature line used in both speechescharacter is simply doing whats right when nobody is looking Evennonconservatives praise Watts in somewhat patronizing tones The cynicalsecular world of Washington might snicker a bit at his homemade handmedownwisdom Steve and Cokie Roberts write in their syndicated column But in theEufaulas of America they know hes right            Youre not supposed to say that Watts and Largent are dumbjocks This taboo is a form of political correctness that even Republicansendorse But in truth the stereotype is not too far off the mark Both areembarked on undistinguished if not utterly futile careers in Congress Whiletheyre both very nice men in an unworldly sort of way theyre in way overtheir heads Treated as stars theyre really just mascots            Largentwas the more successful football player and is a more extreme conservative Apass receiver for  years on the Seattle Seahawks he was inducted into thePro Football Hall of Fame in  His concerns are principally the taxes thatafflict upperincome earners like himself hes worth several million dollarsand issues that flow from his evangelical Christianity such as opposition togay rights My faith is the foundation of my life he says I wont denythat because the way I relate to people is a reflection of my faith On hisWeb site is a profile touting his antitax zeal It is reprinted from theSpotlight  the newspaper of the antiSemitic Liberty Lobby A spokesmanfor Largent said he thought the Liberty Lobby was merely a conservativeprofamily organization and didnt know it was antiSemitic Largents twosignature proposals are abolishing the tax code on Jan  an idioticgimmick Largent is either stupid enough to believe in sincerely or cynicalenough to push despite its idiocy I have my hunch and something called theParental Rights and Responsibilities Act            What makes Largent ineffectual is not hisextremism but rather his disinclination to compromise or operate as part of ateam As part of the small ongoing insurrection of conservative true believersagainst Speaker Gingrich he has essentially given up his chance to get billsintroduced or to have an influence on the Republican agenda Largent appears tohave decided early on that Gingrich was spineless When the speaker decided tosurrender to President Clinton during the government shutdown Largent voted tokeep it closed He subsequently opposed the  budget agreement and called onGingrich to step aside during his ethics trouble During one heated GOP caucushe made a scene by telling the speaker that he wouldnt succeed in intimidatinghim because burly NFL linebackers had tried and failed            Largentdoes have a kind of blinkered integrity Along with another colleague fromOklahoma Tom Coburn he blew the whistle on House Transportation andInfrastructure Committee Chairman Bud Shusters offer of  million in roadpork in exchange for votes for the highway bill But Largents own passes haveall been intercepted He had to withdraw his parents rights bill when evenreligious leaders opposed it as too extreme His endthetaxcode initiativehad merely given fodder to the Clinton administration in its efforts to paintRepublicans as irresponsible On a daily basis Largent spends his time tryingto attach antiabortion antigay rights and antiNEA amendments to anythingwith an HR number On Meet the Press  he recently advanced the novelargument that without Roe vs Wade we would have  million more workershelping to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent He sees Washington as acity filled with temptations and pines openly for his family in Tulsa            JC Julius Caesar Watts was not Largents equal as afootball player A quarterback at the University of Oklahoma he led his teamto two Orange Bowl championships but never made it from the Canadian FootballLeague to the NFL He has been marginally more effective as a congressmanbecause he has cooperated with the leadership Watts has succeeded in helpinghis district and statesaving an Air Force base from closure and winning million for a new crosstown bridge in Oklahoma City in exchange for his votefor the transportation bill His pet community renewal bill an enterprisezonetype proposal was defeatedbut at least it got to the floor            Butdespite his goalong getalong affability Watts is unlikely to accomplishmuch in the House The problem is that Watts would never be given a leadingrole in his party if he werent black Republican affirmative action is thebasis for his career and Republican political correctness is the basis for hisreputation Though Watts is a minister when he speaks without a script he cando little more than utter what Steve and Cokie gently describe as homemadehandmedown wisdom Heres a sample from our phone conversation We canagree without being disagreeable Im not trying to be like anybody ordifferent from anybody Im here to be who I am Im comfortable with that Iam not an anticonservative kind of personwhoever else is who they are andwhoever else isnt is something different I didnt come to Washington to belike somebody or be different from somebody At end of the day Ill let thetalking heads and experts do their thing A worldclass waffle Watts can goon like this forever On affirmative action he has urged caution When Iasked if he would have voted for Proposition  in California he said Iunderstand the people who have voted for it and I understand the people whovoted against it Asked which he would have been he answered Goodquestion            If Watts sticks to his pledge to step downafter six years next term will be his last But like other term limittraitors he is now hedging I think Ill do what the state of Oklahomawants he told me on the phone last week Ill just weigh it But then Wattsadded that he had seen too many people fail to leave the stage while theaudience was still applauding Whenever I leave whether six or eight or years Im comfortable to allow history to speak he said            Oklahomas jocks may be nodenser than many of its other Republican politicians This is the state afterall that gets credit for sending Don Nickles and Ernest Istook to WashingtonIndeed Largent and Watts could match lack of wits with plenty of House membersfrom both parties and all  states But its uncontroversial that manyCongress members are dim Only about former football players are you notallowed to say so
