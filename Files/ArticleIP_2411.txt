                                 AmazonCon            Amazoncom calls itselfEarths Biggest Bookstore and the media online and off have accepted thatclaim uncritically The toast of cyberspace is the Economist saccurate characterization of this Internet bookordering service which wasfounded in  Time rated Amazon one of the  best Web sites of The Washington Post called Amazon a megawarehouse The NewYorker pointedly compared Amazons claimed inventory of  million bookswith the mere  titles available at a Barnes  Noble superstore            In factAmazons megawarehouse in downtown Seattle contains just  or so titlesAny other book must be obtained from a wholesale distributor or the publisherThis is exactly what any traditional bookstore does when it doesnt have a bookin stock The difference is that traditional bookstores start out with a lotmore than  titles in stock Earths Biggest Bookstore More like EarthsSmallest            How does Amazon get the books it doesnt have in itswarehouse According to Jennifer Cast vice president for marketing it usesseveral big distributorsincluding the Ingram Book Co one of thelargestand sometimes it calls the books publisher directly She says thatin certain cases it has even called the authors And how do less advancedbooksellers do it At Politics and Prose a small local bookstore in northwestWashington DC one employee told us We try Ingram first  and then callthe publishers At a northern Virginia outlet of Borders Books the superstorechain an employee said Its no secret we try Ingram  If all that failsI guess we go to the publishers            So whyshop at Amazon Cast gives four reasons One we have a lower price Two wehave a better selection Three were probably much faster And weredefinitely more convenient We conducted an experiment to test these claimsOn Dec  we ordered the same two books from Amazon Politics and Prose andBorders All three were told to giftwrap and ship each book as soon aspossible One book was Scott Turows newest novel The Laws of OurFathers  the kind of best seller that even Amazon actually has in stockThe other was an obscure psychology text even Borders wouldnt carry chosenfrom the catalog of the State University of New York Press called The Egoand the Dynamic Ground A Transpersonal Theory of Human Development secondedition by Michael Washburn            How did the three booksellers compare byAmazons own standards                                             Selection               Weve covered that If you define inventory as any book a store canspecialorder for you as Amazon does then the selection is identical atalmost every halfwaydecent bookstore in America At Amazon you can browsethrough all the titles and authorsand through some descriptive materialbycomputer At a conventional bookstore you can pick up and leaf through actualbooks but fewer of them                                             Convenience               For ordering Politics and Prose was by far the easiest Heidi answered thephone on the first ring She was chatty but professional The store had manymany many copies of the Turow on hand and she promised to send one outright away tomorrow morning at the very very latest When asked about thepsych text Heidi apologized sorry sorry for not carrying it and offeredto order it Estimated time of arrival four weeks She took a name addresscreditcard number The entire phone call took  minutes and  seconds            Borderswas slightly less helpful When asked to send the Turow Drew groaned at ourlowbrow taste but quickly said hed send it the next day The secondselections obscurity didnt cheer him up Ugh cant do you the Washburnbook When pressed he said it could be ordered but would probably take twoweeks Borders system is that when the book arrives you are sent a postcardasking you to come to the store and pick it up Cant they just send the bookWe prefer people do it this way Drew said but then he gave in and agreed tosend it Total phone time  minutes and  seconds            After calling the stores we connected to Amazon usingNetscape Navigator  and a baud modem Amazon has a special pagededicated to the Turow book complete with a picture of the cover and someunenlightening amateur commentaries from other Amazon users The psychologytext not surprisingly was listed with no description and no commentariesAmazon said it would take one to two weeks to order            After clicking your purchasesinto a shopping cart you are directed to a secure Netscape server thatwill encrypt your creditcard information After this is done you are toldFinalizing Your Order Is Easy Nothing could be further from the truth Lowerdown in the verbiage Amazon concedes Though we have tried hard to make thisform easy to use we know that it can be quite confusing the first timeAmazon users have to page through screen after screen of details about shippingcharges refund rules and disclaimers about availability and pricing Then youare told to allow between three and seven days for delivery after your bookleaves Amazons warehouse Upgrading to Next Day Air does NOT their emphasismean youll get your order the next day            Totalonline time from when we accessed Amazons home page to when we completed thebook order  minutes and  seconds It would be shorter once you got thehang of it                           Speed Turows book arrived in threedays from both Borders and Politics and Prose in plenty of time beforeChristmas Politics and Prose wrapped the book perfectly Borders wrapped itattractively but left the receipt inside The Turow didnt arrive from Amazonuntil Dec more than a week after the conventional stores Furthermore thewrapping looked as if it had been done by a fourth grader However it camebundled with the obscure psych book which still hadnt arrived from theconventional stores as of New Years Day Eleven days for that one is prettygood As for the Turow we had checked a box asking that each book be sentseparately as soon as possibleso either Amazon ignored these instructionsor it really needed the full  days to get the Turow to us            By the way lets not forgetthat in a conventional bookstore you can alsoif you chooseacquire books inzero days by going to the store in the preInternet sense of actually goingthere                                             Price                Amazon and Borders both offered the Turow for  percentoff the list price Politics and Prose offered  percent off All three wantedfull price for the psych book Amazon charges  plus  cents per book forstandard shipping Borders charged  to ship the Turow and Politics andProse  Amazon charges  a book for giftwrapping which is free at theother two stores but Amazon accidentally charged only  for wrapping bothbooks Finally stores with local outlets must charge sales tax on shippeditems Amazon does not unless you live in Washington state In all the Turowcost  from Borders and  from Politics and Prose If Amazon had sentit separately as we had instructed it would have cost  Giftwrapped andsent separately the psych text would cost more at Amazon than at the othertwo unwrapped and bundled about the same            There is a third category of books besides those thateveryone has in stock and those that no one has in stock These are books thatAmazon doesnt have in stock but a normal bookstore does Barnes Nobles strong inventory sniffed at by The New Yorker  is agood example            This category is Amazonsgreatest weakness It includes hardly obscure current books that arent bestsellers like The New Our Bodies Ourselves  produced by the BostonWomens Heath Book Collective Borders had three copies on the premisesAmazon needs two to three days to obtain this one plus between three and sevendays to send it to you Likewise for a classic like the Penguin paperback ofCharles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities  which any Borders or Barnes Noble will have on hand            Then theres a semiobscurebook such as Robert Marr Wrights Dodge City The Cowboy Capital and theGreat Southwest  This hardcover book about cowboys is on Borders shelvesAt Amazon it is listed as a special order which means it might be availableto be shipped in four to six weeks but our computer informs us PLEASE NOTEthat it might not be available at all Publishers do not always notify the bookcommunity about changes in the availability of their titles Notavailable So much for the pretense that Amazons list of  million booksmakes it Earths Biggest Bookstore in even a metaphorical sense
