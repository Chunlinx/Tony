        going to talk about clothing and how we dress for work     yes i must admit im pretty boring        i just wear some uh you know old dress pants and a button down shirt just about every single day     uhhuh    well im sure that you select different colors everyday and your shoes probably you you have you rotate your shoes around   oh the shoes are just about the only thing that doesnt get rotated   okay like brown with um if you wear black with brown pants   yeah well i just wear blue gray and black blue gray and   oh okay you just   what else is there theres another color dark gray thats it      theyre gray okay so you dont have to worry about the shoes then      i do once in a while i wear brown but   uhhuh   what can you do right   well i mean i think men look very nice i i think that theyre much better off than women are as far as their clothes go because i think um i think um uh and its true that uh you know men are attracted by what they see and of course the women always um either shes pleasing her boyfriend or shes pleasing her mate or she is looking for a a husband and she of course in the work field if shes single she dresses you know i dont dress for um i dress for myself i always like to look nice i want to look uh professional and so i i make an a big effort to do that   okay you that that that that agrees with what most women tell me is that they dress to please themselves and you know who cares what these other people think and you know they have their own idea of what looks good   uhhuh well and theres some that really are on target and then theres some that are kind of way out in left field       i dont appreciate the real short dresses and uh and then to sit sprawl legged i think thats very offensive and um       i dont know how they feel about it but it surely doesnt uh i think i think even the men uh men are offended by that too if its not you know if youre out in public and youre you dont watch how you sit i think thats very um inappropriate for uh a lady to act like that   where what sort of a do you work in an office or      yes i do yes i do i work in an office   and is it pretty well integrated as far as are you know positions of power or you know where i work just about every woman is a secretary   uhhuh   except for two        and uh   yeah its pretty   there are no male secretaries so   there its pretty much like that where i work i was very offended by one of the young ladies who is a secretary and plus shes a mother by what she wore and it looked like she just had and shes shes very lean you know its a very lean girl but she really offended me by her dress i mean it was like she forgot to dress it was like she was wearing uh um   golly how do i want to phrase that it looked   like sweat suits or something   yes a wet suit you know i thought that is not the appropriate attire for an office environment   you think it was distracting   i yeah because everybody was turning their heads sure enough  everybody you know everybody you know you just take a double look and theyll say is that really what shes wearing yeah thats really what shes wearing       okay well okay so so she wasnt just floppy and like put on some loose floppy stuff you know cotton  uh weave thing not knit something      oh oh no no no she yeah    something that youd wear doing doing the garden maybe uh no it was   yeah      i thought what is this now   definitely designed to catch the eye   yes it was it was definitely designed if you could see almost every fold of her body       so i thought that was very offensive and i i made a loud remark about it in fact i complained to my supervisor about it and he agreed and she has never worn it since   hey   but i think you have to take some action like that maybe she didnt realize you know how she came across some people are oblivious as to what kind of reactions they can cause   yeah well right or perhaps
