                    Synopsis                  Introduction          A spectrum of autoantibodies is now known to be          specifically associated with RA There continues to be          uncertainty as to what stage of the disease each of these          autoantibodies develop and whether they are associated          with unique clinical features                          Aims          To help address these questions a spectrum of          autoantibodies known to be associated with RA in a cohort          of patients with early synovitis was evaluated                          Methods          An inception cohort of  patients having peripheral          joint synovitis of less than  months duration was          evaluated clinicially then followed prospectively for           year Patients were classified as having RA on the basis          of fulfilling the  criteria Serum samples collected          at the time of the initial evaluation were tested for          antiSa and antiRA using immunoblotting and to          profilaggrin AFA antiCCP and calpastatin          antiRA using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay          techniques AKA were detected using immunoflurescence on          human epidermal tissue RF was tested by nephelometry          HLADRB alleles were determined using sequence specific          primers Initial and  year radiographs were evaluated          for the presence of erosions                          Results          Of the  patients with synovitis of recent onset in          the cohort   met RA criteria   of whom          met the criteria on their initial visit Diagnoses in the          remaining patients included   with reactive          arthritis   with psoriatic arthritis or another          form of spondylarthropathy   with another          welldefined rheumatic diagnosis and   with          undifferentiated arthritis The RA patients were          significantly older than the nonRA patients             versus              P   had higher mean          swollen joint count    versus              P   and higher          Creactive protein CRP level    versus                       P   Table summarizes the          prevalence of the various RA associated antibodies in          patients diagnosed as having RFpositive RF RA          RFnegative RF RA and nonRA Regarding the          characteristics of these tests RF had the highest          sensitivity at  and all the other antibodies          individually were less than  sensitive AFA antiSa          antiCCP were greater than  specific for RA while RF          and AKA were  specific and antiRA and          antiRA was not specific for this diagnosis The data          further indicate that adding any one of AFA AKA          antiSa or antiCCP to RF increases the specificity for          RA from  to  In the absence of RF the presence of          one or more of these antibodies carried a sensitivity of          only  for RF RA with antiSa being the most specific          at  Overall there was a high degree of correlation          between AFA AKA antiSa or antiCCP this being highest          between antiSa and antiCCP odds ratio            P   Despite this high          level of correlation of the  patients who were          positive for at least one of these four autoantibodies           were positive for only one suggesting considerable          variability in individual reactivity patterns          RA has been shown in multiple populations to be          associated with HLADRB alleles encoding for the shared          epitope SE In this study as illustrated in Table           the presence of each of these autoantibodies was          significantly associated with having two shared epitope          alleles even when only the RA patients were          considered          Patients with antiSa antibodies were predominantly          male  versus            P  had significantly          higher swollen joint counts    versus              P  and higher CRP levels             mgdl versus    mgdl           P  at the initial visit          Despite subsequently begin treated with significantly          higher doses of prednisone    mgday versus             mgday           P  and more disease          modifying antirheumatic drug therapy    versus             disease modifying antirheumatic drugs           P  the antiSapositive          RA patients had a higher frequency of erosions than the          rest of the RA patients  versus            P  Neither RF nor SE were          associated with the disease severity measures and          analyses evaluating all the other autoantibodies failed          to reveal a similar trend                          Discussion          Despite a welldocumented lack of specificity RF          continues to be a central part of the definition of RA          primarily because of its favourable sensitivity profile          In our cohort RF had a sensitivity of  a specificity          of  and an overall accuracy of  for the diagnosis          of RA AFA antiSa antiCCP were all highly specific          for this diagnosis and when any of them were present in          conjunction with RF the specificity for RA approached           Potentially of more importance to the clinician is          the diagnostic value of these antibodies when RF is not          detectable Our data indicate that only  of RF RA          patients had any of AKA AFA antiSa or antiCCP and          that antiSa was the most specific for this diagnosis          This modest level of sensitivity suggests that testing          for this spectrum of autoantibodies carries little          advantage over RF alone in diagnosing early RA          AFA AKA and antiperinuclear factor APF have all          been proposed to identify a common antigen present in the          skin protein profilaggrin It has continued to be          puzzling why a skin antigen would be targeted relatively          specifically in a disorder that is primarily articular A          potential explanation for this may relate to the          demonstration that citrulline appears to be an essential          constituent of the antigenic determinants recognized by          AKA APF and AFA The citrulline rich profilaggrin          molecule makes an ideal substrate for detecting this          reactivity Moreover the SA antigen which unlike          profilaggrin is detectable in rheumatoid synovium has          recently been shown to also be citrullinated It is thus          possible that AKA AFA APE and antiSa all recognize          one or more citrullinated antigens Despite this          possibility the modest degree of concordance between          them in individual patient sera suggests that it is          unlikely that a single antigen is involved in generating          these responses          This study provides evidence suggesting that antiSa          antibodies appear to be a marker for a subset of early RA          patients whose disease may be more severe and erosive          Moreover it was determined that antiSa AFA and          antiCCP were all highly associated with SE particularly          two copies We examined a spectrum of potential RA          severity indicators including the number of swollen          joints CRP level and presence of early radiographic          erosions Our data indicate that antiSa was more highly          associated with these measures of RA severity than any          other parameter including the most accepted prognostic          indicators RF and SE          In conclusion it is demonstrated that antibodies          directed against putatively citrullinated antigens          including SA filaggrin keratin and CCP are the most          specific for RA and are detectable early in the disease          course It will be of interest to find out whether the          cumulative prevalence of specific autoantibody subsets          tends to increase over time as this would suggest that          the mechanisms underlying the development of these          reactivities continue to evolve over the course of the          arthropathy                            Introduction        Autoantibodies can be detected in a spectrum of        rheumatic diseases where they may be highly associated with        distinct clinical syndromes These are often helpful for        diagnosis and to some extent prognosis In RA RF is        detected in  of patients with established disease        and is an integral part of the definition of this disorder        AKA APF AFA and antiSa have all been shown to be        associated with RA and appear to be more specific than RF        for this disease           AntiRA            and antiRA   have also been shown to        be prevalent in RA patient populations but not specific        for this disease        There is an evolving understanding of the antigens to        which these RA associated antibodies are directed although        their ultimate pathogenic role if any continues to be        unclear AKA APF and AFA identify epitopes carried by        keratin profilaggrin and filaggrin respectively             These proteins follow a common posttranslational        pathway which involves a peptidylarginine to citrulline        deimination This modification appears to be central to        specific antigenicity giving rise to epitopes recognized        by sera from RA patients    AntiSa antibodies are        directed towards an unknown antigen that is abundant in        placental tissue and rheumatoid synovium          Interestingly the Sa antigen also appears to be        citrullinated   AntiRA antibodies recognize the A        protein an antigen found in the heterogeneous        ribonucleoprotein of the splicosome   AntiRA        antibodies are directed towards domains  and  of        calpastatin the natural inhibitor of calpains which are        members of the cysteine proteinases that have been        implicated in articular damage          This spectrum of autoantibodies has been evaluated        primarily in cohorts of patients with wellestablished RA        A number of important questions are unresolved regarding        the stage of the disease at which each of these antibodies        arise and whether indeed some may antedate the clinical        expression of this disorder The fact that RF AKA or APF        could sometimes antedate the appearance of clinical RA by        several years has been reported     AntiSa AFA        and antiRA have been reported to be present in early RA        patients although the cohorts studied have generally been        small and the clinical characterization of the patients        not detailed       Anticyclic citrullinated        peptide antiCCP has recently been evaluated in a cohort        of patients with early synovitis and was found to be more        specific than RF for early RA while having comparable        sensitivity          Recently the clinical features and human leukocyte        antigen HLA associations of a wellcharacterized cohort        of patients with synovitis of recent onset were presented          In the current study we sought to determine the        prevalence and diagnostic value of the RA associated        autoantibodies in this heterogeneous cohort of patients        with early synovitis Sera obtained within  months of        symptom onset were tested for these antibodies and their        presence was related to disease features and subsequent        clinical course over a  year period Our data indicate        that AFA antiSa and antiCCP are all highly specific for        early RA but demonstrate only a modest degree of        concordance in the sera of individual patients AntiSa        identifies a subset of male RA patients with severe        disease                    Methods                  Patients          Two hundred and thirtyeight patients were recruited          to an early synovitis study at the National Institutes of          Health protocol AR The study patients had          persistent synovitis  weeks of at least one          peripheral joint which had been present for less than           year Patients with traumatic septic and crystal          induced arthritis were specifically excluded          Patients underwent a complete clinical evaluation The          number of swollen joints was determined by evaluating for          the presence of effusion andor synovial thickening in           peripheral joints hips were excluded Patients were          then followed clinically over a  year period Routine          laboratory data were obtained on each visit including an          evaluation of acute phase reactants Anteroposterior and          lateral radiographs of the hands and feet were either          available for evaluation or obtained at the time of          assessment A second set of radiographs was obtained at          the  year visit All radiographs were evaluated for the          presence of erosions Although a proportion of the          radiographs were felt to have possible or          questionable erosions only patients with definite          erosions on either set of radiographs were included in          the definition of erosions At the completion of the year          of observation patients who were diagnosed as having RA          had all met the  American College of Rheumatology          ACR criteria   on at least one visit If a patient          had met ACR criteria but with follow up was          unequivocally diagnosed as having another          wellcharacterized rheumatic disease this individual was          not included in the definition of RA                          Detection of autoantibodies          IgM RF was measured by nephelometry and a level           IUml was considered positive AntiSa antibodies          were detected by immunoblot as previously described            A partially purified preparation of placental Sa          antigen was provided by one of the authors HAM and the          western blot assay performed blindly by another GS          RA was detected using immunoblot as described          previously   Filaggrin was obtained from human          epidermis and purified using reversed phase          highperformance liquid chromatography After covalently          coupling to well plates AFA were detected by          enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA as previously          described    The cutoff level for positivity OD           was determined on the basis of results of sera from           middleaged  years blood donors Antibodies to          CCP were evaluated after generating a cyclic peptide from          linear citrulline containing peptides by substituting          serine residues by cysteine AntiCCP were detected using          ELISA as previously described with the linear peptides            Control peptides had an unmodified arginine rather          than citrulline The cutoff level for positivity OD           was determined on the basis of generating           specificity for RA in previous assays using local normal          controls AKA were detected using immunoflurescence          Sections of human breast epidermis were used and the          slides were read independently by two observers AR and          CZ Any slides in which the observers did not agree were          reread and a consensus agreed In all cases the          detected autoantibodies were of the IgG class The          results were not corrected for total IgG levels                          HLA typing          HLADR typing was done by the molecular polymerase          chain reactionsequence specific primers methods using          specific oligonucleotide sequences as primers as

    variance of the KruskalWallis test for continuous          variables and using the Chisquared test for          proportions The significance level for associations          between individual autoantibodies and HLADRB alleles          was adjusted for multiple comparisons using the          Bonferroni method Statistical analysis was performed          using Epi Info statistical software

Previous studies have generally suggested a high          degree of correlation in RA patient sera between AFA          AKA antiCCP and antiSa We tested the correlation          between these antibodies in the patient sera The          correlation was highest between antiCCP and antiSa          odds ratio OR            P  and lowest between          antiSa and AKA OR            P  In total  patients          had at least one of the four antibodies  of whom had          RA Of these  patients  were in fact positive for          only one antibody AKA   AFA   antiSa            antiCCP  Only seven patients were positive for all          four antibodies          Seropositivity for antiCCP and AFA was determined on          the basis of an ELISA cutoff level as described in the          Methods section The relationship between the titers of          these two antibodies and between each of them and RF          was examined There was a significant correlation in the          titers of antiCCP and AFA in individual sera            r            P  Titers of both          antiCCP and AFA were not correlated with RF titers When          only antiCCPpositive patients were examined the

similar tread was seen          with AFA although this did not reach statistical          significance Of note also the mean RF titer for          RFpositive patients who did not meet RA criteria did

autoantibodies were          particularly associated with SE alleles in our cohort          These data are presented in Table  Overall the SE          alleles were highly associated with the diagnosis of RA          OR            P  RF AFA antiSa          and antiCCP were all associated with SE alleles          particularly two copies Interestingly  patients with            were positive for at

associated with the disease          severity measures and analyses evaluating all the other          autoantibodies failed to reveal a similar trend data not          shown Of interest only six RA patients demonstrated          the presence of nodules and this feature was more          associated with RF and SE than with antiSa Analysis of          the nonRA patients did not reveal any clinically          meaningful associations with any of the          autoantibodies                            Discussion        A cohort of patients with synovitis of recent onset was        evaluated and we sought to determine the prevalence and        potential clinical utility of a spectrum of autoantibodies        that has been shown to be associated with RA To date most        of the studies evaluating these antibodies have been in        patients with established wellcharacterized disease and        their prevalence and diagnostic value in patients with        early inflammatory arthritis has not been defined Our        study evaluated patients within a few months of the onset        of synovitis and then followed them for a  year period to        determine the best clinical diagnosis In particular we        sought to determine how sensitive and specific each of the        antibodies alone and in combination were for early RA We        utilized the accepted definition of RA using the  ACR        criteria   Of note a large epidemiologic study of        patients with early inflammatory arthritis found that the        proportion of patients who met the ACR criteria increased        if the criteria were applied cumulatively over a  year        period   Although the duration of follow up in this        study was shorter we found that almost all of the patients        who had met the RA criteria at the completion of the study        period had done so on their initial visit        Despite a welldocumented lack of specificity RF        continues to be a central part of the definition of RA        primarily because of its favorable sensitivity profile In        our cohort RF had a sensitivity of  a specificity of         and an overall accuracy of  for the diagnosis of        RA AFA antiSa and antiCCP were all highly specific for        this diagnosis and when any of them were present in        conjunction with RF the specificity for RA approached         Potentially of more importance to the clinician is        the diagnostic value of these antibodies when RF is not        detectable Our data indicate that only  of RF RA        patients had any of AKA AFA antiSa or antiCCP and that        antiSa was the most specific for this diagnosis This        modest level of sensitivity suggests that testing for this        spectrum of autoantibodies carries little advantages over        RF alone in diagnosing early RA        This study provides evidence suggesting that antiSa        antibodies appear to be a marker for a subset of early RA        patients whose disease may be more severe and erosive        These data are consistent with observations in a French RA        cohort where antiSa and SE were associated with severe        radiographic erosions   Indeed it was determined that        antiSa AFA and antiCCP were all highly associated with        SE particularly two copies We examined a spectrum of        potential RA severity indicators including the number of        swollen joints CRP level and presence of early        radiographic erosions Our data indicate that antiSa was        more highly associated with these measures of RA severity        than any other parameter including the most accepted        prognostic indicators RF and SE In particular there was        a significantly higher prevalence of radiographic erosions        in the antiSapositive RA patients compared with the rest        of the RA population despite the fact that the        antiSapositive patients had received significantly higher        doses of prednisone and more disease modifying        antirheumatic drug therapy Interestingly the        antiSapositive subset in this cohort was strikingly        predominated by males  of Sapositive versus  of        Sanegative RA patients         P  It has recently been        shown that in comparison with female RA patients male RA        patients tended to develop erosions earlier in the disease        course   The finding that antiSa antibodies are        associated both with male gender and with severe early RA        further emphasizes the importance of gender differences in        the clinical expression of this heterogeneous disease        AFA AKA and APF have been proposed to all identify a        common antigen present in the skin protein profilaggrin              It has continued to be puzzling why a skin        antigen would be targeted relatively specifically in a        disorder that is primarily articular A potential        explanation for this may relate to the demonstration that        citrulline appears to be an essential constituent of the        antigenic determinants recognized by AKA APF and AFA           The citrulline rich profilaggrin molecule makes        an ideal substrate for detecting this reactivity Moreover        the Sa antigen which unlike profilaggrin is detectable        in rheumatoid synovium has recently also been shown to be        citrullinated   It is thus possible that AKA AFA        APF and antiSa all recognize one or more citrullinated        antigens As with previous studies the current study        documents a good overall correlation between these        antibodies Nevertheless the data clearly indicate that        reactivity to CCP does not capture that complete spectrum        of AFA AKA and antiSa reactivity Indeed it has been        shown that  of patients who were positive for one or        more of these antibodies were positive for only one and        that only  of these patients were positive for all of        them Similarly previous studies evaluating AKA APF and        AFA have shown varying degrees of discordance in the        seropositivity of individual patient sera             Moreover there was a spectrum of reactivity patterns seen        when RA sera were tested against various citrulline        containing peptides   Together these data are most        consistent with the hypothesis that individual RA patients        respond to unique antigenic determinants that may        preferentially be citrullinated but that are likely        distinct from those of targeted by other RA patients        It was surprising to discover that antiRA antibodies        were all but absent in this cohort of patients        particularly in view of the previously reported prevalence        of  in other RA cohorts     This antibody        was reported to have a prevalence of only  in a Finnish        cohort of early RA patients   It should be pointed out        that the testing for antiRA including that performed        in the current study was all performed in the same        laboratory GS The reasons for this discrepancy are        unclear and may represent inherent differences in the        populations studied Alternatively it is possible that the        development of antiRA reactivity increases as the        diseases progresses Longitudinal follow up of early RA        cohorts such as the present one will help to further        clarify this issue        In the current study it was demonstrated that        antibodies directed against putatively citrullinated        antigens including Sa filaggrin keratin and CCP are the        most specific for RA and are detectable early in the        disease course It will be of interest to find out whether        the cumulative prevalence of specific autoantibody subsets        tends to increase over time as this would suggest that the        mechanisms underlying the development of these reactivities        continue to evolve over the course of the arthropathy
