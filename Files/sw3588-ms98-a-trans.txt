myself and i see the good ones with my wife  i go see all the shoot them up bang bangs     yes   all the uh strong R rated and my wife and i go see the the My Girls and the good ones   well im ready if you are   what kind movies you like   um oh you pressed one already im sorry okay um   yes im sorry course   i like most everything im quite fond of horror movies and science fiction uhhuh   oh are you okay so am i   um what about you   well i sort of well like i like them all but im a you know im an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan a Sylvester Stallone fan and i like detective type uh mystery dramatic types we saw did you have you all have you seen Cape Fear   no but its on my list of things to see i havent as a matter of fact i havent seen whole lot in the last month or so but did you like it   have you okay yes thats tremendous thatll  thatll be equivalent to uh Silence of the Lambs or something like that   oh did you i assume you saw that one yes i really enjoyed it id read the book and i thought they stayed very faithful   yes that was great they did yes yes it was a great movie   did you see the original Cape Fear before you went to see the new version   no i didnt no i missed that one   i thought i might rent that um   that might be a neat idea   uh well ill tell you something that we just saw recently that is old old but id never seen was Fantasia   yeah bet that was good   it was not what i expected it to be   oh no its a tremendous movie   it was but i mean i can understand that little kids wouldnt find it um particularly appealing  itd be way over their heads i think   right yeah ive seen it two or three times its such a a great movie   and the music is wonderful   yes they uh everyone my wifes a teacher and all of her teacher friends are saying we need to go see Beauty and the Beast they say thats quite a nice movie   i wouldnt mind seeing that well actually we kind of like going to see things like Bambi and such too so Beauty and the Beast would be okay with me   right you bet we seen them all you see im such a movie buff i go out im selfemployed so a lot of times ill just uh i just have a two person office myself and my secretary and ill just uh go out for lunch at noon sometimes go to a movie and come back at two that kind of a thing   so how often a week do you go   oh i probably average at least one and a half to two times a week   yeah see youre pretty youre pretty movie buffy id do that if i could   oh i enjoy it yeah i enjoy it a lot of times uh my wife will have to stayed after school till seven and ill just uh leave the office at five and go to a movie and come home at seven and ill be here when she gets here   have you seen the new Star Trek   no im a will see that though   that one and Hook looks like uh it would be good   Hook does look like itll be good   and lets see what else is out new this year that   uh my wife and i saw My Girl and that was a good little uh that was a good little movie   its supposed to be cute i heard it got pretty good reviews   yeah it was cute   um i was  we were a little disappointed with Home Alone which we just saw we kind of catch them sometimes when they come around on videos   sure you bet   and uh i dont know maybe we just werent in the mood but   yeah that was a little that was a little slapstick you know yes but uh My Girl will sort of itll bring a little tear to your eyes or something it was cute movie   kind of well thats all right a lot of them do   oh i understand we uh yeah we see quite a few our daughter and uh son are moviegoers and future soninlaw theyre all moviegoers so weve we just all go to movies   its good entertainment especially if you go you know before the uh when the bargain matinees are   oh i think so too absolutely thats what my wife and i do on Fridays you know we uh meet at five thirty and uh go to the movie and then go out and go to dinner somewhere then come home   uhhuh well particularly if you see something that isnt very good you hate having wasted your seven dollars each or whatever its up to   you bet well its expensive to go to a movie ill tell you   well it is particularly when you buy popcorn and everything   oh i know because we take uh so my wife and i take my son and her intended to the movie youre talking uh between tickets and popcorn and everything probably forty bucks   im sure im sure   because we go we go visit them Lubbock Texas thats where theyre at going to school and theres nothing to do in Lubbock Texas but go to the movie  and you better do it before nine oclock you know     oh thats the last show huh   right  but anyway we uh yeah we really enjoy it but trying think of another good movie ive seen lately uh oh i dont know i missed
