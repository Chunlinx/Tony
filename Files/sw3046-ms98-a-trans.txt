                good morning my name is Jean   hi im Tina   oh where you from Tina   i live in Garland Texas   oh Garland Texas im in Pennsylvania   oh my lands  youre the farthest person ive ever talked to yeah     really do you work for Texas Instruments   my husband does yeah probably most people you talk to do huh   uhhuh huh most of them do now i dont have anybody that works for TI but uh     huh   my son works for a computer company the National Institute of some something i dont know what   i see well thats neat   so i guess were supposed to talk about foods today   yeah i guess you have to push one though okay yeah   yes uhhuh you ready okay   uh foods like you would plan for a a dinner party or something like that yeah   yeah i guess so it may be interesting because probably here in Texas we may eat a little differently than you do up there   well i dont know my brother lives down East of us down there and i dont think they ate all that much different   oh really   uh i think as long as you plan your basic foods course for a dinner party  you fancy things up a little bit more   yeah thats true   uh   well uh the thing that i found interesting my husband and i lived up in Washington state for awhile   um umhum   and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food and that kind of thing and down here sea food is pretty expensive because you have to ship it a long way to get it   oh uhhuh right yeah and its not as good as if its fresh it   right and and uh and but here we eat a lot of like Mexican foods and um up there there was no no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me   uhhuh is that right yeah   yeah it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could but it just didnt taste right     well they probably were trying to do the best they could yeah   yeah and uh down here we eat a lot more fried foods i think like chicken fried steak is a real big thing and up there uh it was hardly ever heard of and     uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   we drink ice tea with every meal and   umhum   up there hardly anyone drank ice tea   yeah well they do in the summertime i think that tea big in the summertime mostly of course you have warmer weather most of the time   really yeah right yeah it never gets real cold so   so uh yeah so i   yeah but when when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular   is that right   yeah i know that um i do a lot of planning with our church and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a Mexican dish or and Italian food is real big too   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh more like covered dishes for those type of dinners   uhhuh yeah yeah how about you what is real popular up there   well i dont know just about anything   oh really   yeah we we really uh use most anything i uh i think are like parties and that though are well like we had a dinner party here here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party  but basically we tried you know included all the basic uh foods that you are supposed to have in a meal here   oh uhhuh   your uh bread family and your or least what it used to be the regular menu followed and ham and bake potatoes and uh   uhhuh uhhum   uh something from each each area that youre supposed to choose from   umhum   and uh we we we ourselves are into the wok cooking you know they been advertising that and weve really been enjoying those uh meals   umhum well thats good   they have a lot of vegetable to them and uh they really are very good   umhum right oh yes i i love that kind of cooking my uh unfortunately i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things   is he a meat and potato person  well all our family is is gone they are out on their own and uh   right they uhhuh that probably makes it easier but   it its much different and uh   yeah we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese and uh  and of course   uhhuh uhhuh well my husband didnt like that so we as kids we had five children and we ate that when he he wasnt going to be home for supper thats what we had   uh right yeah well thats pretty much what we do if dads not coming home we have macaroni and cheese or something   uhhuh uhhuh   but they like uh spaghetti you know thats one meal i can fix and the whole family eats but there are several things that well as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because   uh yeah yeah yeah oh those always go good   yeah the children love them and uh they are real easy to cook and that way whatever meat we have if they dont like it well and my girls dont like beef i dont know   yeah yeah oh really well maybe thats good the way way the things are going   i guess well yeah it could be because they dont i think its the texture of it but it takes more chewing  and   uhhuh right children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers and that and it is easier to chew   uhhuh right right so theyre not too much into beef and my husband and i eat more beef than we should but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them   uhhuh right we dont really have uh you know entertain too much   uhhuh   i dont know if you do or not but we we dont a whole lot were more once in a while but mostly family activities   yeah well most of the entertaining we do is church associated we have a real tiny little house we dont have room really to have people here but we do get together for what fellowships at our church and   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that and   yeah well thats good   yeah it is and its fun to uh i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish   umhum yeah we do a lot of that type thing at church and our homemakers meet at the church also and uh thats what we do mostly most of the time for that   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah   so you dont really include any certain food groups you just bring what you like   right thats right   sometimes you have all desserts sometimes you have all vegetables   yeah yeah thats truth thats the only problem with just letting you bring whatever you uh like best   yeah but it doesnt happen very often usually you get a pretty wide variety and you can you can have a pretty good meals from one of those   uhhuh yeah yeah i remember one time we had a progressive dinner its the only time that ever yeah they are   oh those are fun uhhuh   but the its the only time that i can remember that i cant remember what food it was i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with   uh   several people were supposed to bring you know each like uh a an appetizer and a main dish and a dessert and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers and   uh uhhuh uh uhhuh oh   but when we came to the main main dish plate there was only like two or three   oh is there enough to go around   well not really you know we all took real tiny little portions and uh were kind of angry with whoever it was we werent sure who didnt show up with the food   uhhuh uhhuh they were suppose to keep uh yeah thats kind of irresponsible but that what upset you because they are grown adults usually and they know they know better even if they cant do it they can always need to get somebody else that could   yes right right either either go ahead and fix your dish or call someone that can i know it   right right   well that sounds neat i cant uh believe youre so far away but you sound so close     they said that we could share we share a recipe but im up at my daughters i dont even have any of my recipes with me uh you know   it sounds like youre here in Dallas oh i dont know if i have anything handy we were just about we were getting ready to go swimming and were waiting on my sister   oh oh great   Cara hold on just a second as a matter of fact my little one is hollering   theyre ready to go well i we probably have we talked long enough im i   yeah i i think it probably has been so ive enjoyed talking to you   okay so ill let you oh same here you have a good day   thank you thanks for calling byebye   uhhuh byebye
