                    Background        Nerve growth factor NGF a prototypical neurotrophic        factor and a member of the neurotrophin family promotes a        wide range of responses in its target cells These range        from neuronal differentiation maintenance of survival and        regulation of metabolic activities for review see              Many of these actions include and require        transcriptional regulation      However the greater        part of the changes in gene expression that underlie the        NGF response remain to be elucidated The PC line of rat        pheochromocytoma cells    has proved to be a        particularly favorable system for detecting NGFresponsive        changes in gene expression         These cells        resemble sympathicopheochromoblasts and upon exposure to        NGF cease proliferation and acquire in a transcription        dependent mechanism many of the properties of postmitotic        sympathetic neurons including neurite outgrowth and        electrical excitability The robust nature of the response        of PC cells to NGF coupled with their capacity to be        examined both before and at various times after exposure to        the factor has greatly facilitated study of the NGF        mechanism of action including gene regulation            To obtain a comprehensive and quantitative overview of        NGFpromoted gene regulation we    have used SAGE        Serial Analysis of Gene Expression In this technique             cellular transcripts are converted to SAGE        tags which are sequenced quantified and in many cases        matched with known genes By comparing SAGE profiles for        cells in different states as for example before and after        exposure to NGF it is thus possible to obtain a        comprehensive view of gene expression and regulation        Moreover if a sufficient number of SAGE tags are analyzed        changes in expression levels of individual transcripts can        be associated with a high level of statistical significance                   Initial analysis of approximately  SAGE tags from        PC cells cultured without or with NGF for  days revealed        nearly  transcripts of a total of at least  that        are regulated by  fold or greater in response to NGF            Of these approximately  were assignable to named        genes of known functions that regulate cellular behaviors        ranging from actin and microtubule cytoskeleton        assemblydisassembly gene transcription RNA processing        neurotransmission and energetics A variety of criteria        supported the reliability of the quantitative findings        revealed by our SAGE analysis            In the present study we have extended our SAGE        profiling of nave and longterm NGFtreated PC cells to        over  tags representing over  unique        transcripts Analysis of these reveals the presence of        transcripts encoding  different ribosomal proteins RPs        Surprisingly we find that longterm NGF exposure leads to        statistically significant changes in relative abundance of        at least half of these transcripts by factors of up to        nearly fold In addition a time course for one of the RP        transcripts encoding RP L reveals that its relative        abundance begins to change within  hr and is maximally        regulated by  hr of NGF exposure                    Results                  SAGE libraries          SAGE libraries were generated and analyzed as          previously described    from matched sets of PC          cells before and after  days of exposure to NGF The          present analysis is based on  mer tags from          NGFuntreated PC cells and  tags from NGFtreated          cells after exclusion of duplicate ditags mitochondrial          transcripts and repetitive elements Consideration of          tags observed twice or more between the two libraries          indicated the presence of approximately  unique          transcripts Of these approximately  were regulated          by more than fold in response to NGF and approximately           by fold or more                          Detection and quantification of transcripts          encoding ribosomal proteins          Transcripts represented by SAGE tags were identified          by direct matches of tags with the appropriate sequences          of known rat genes present in GenBank or through          matches of tags with appropriate sequences of rat ESTs          present in NCBI Unigene that were in turn found to          overlap with known rat genes Positive identification          required that the transcript or EST have a poly          adenylation signal and poly A tail and that the tag          followed the most  CATG of the transcript In this way           tags were unambiguously assignable to known rat          transcripts encoding proteins described as ribosomal          components Available sequences encoding rat ribosomal          proteins L and S do not contain a CATG sequence and          hence SAGE tags for these could not be identified In          addition rat sequence data for transcripts encoding RPs          L L L and S are not presently available in          GenBank or Unigene          Table lists the tags in our libraries corresponding          to transcripts for ribosomal proteins along with their          relative abundances Considering that the eukaryotic          ribosome contains approximately  proteins our analysis          includes transcripts encoding a major proportion of the          known ribosomal proteins                          Relative expression of transcripts for ribosomal          proteins          Among the information provided by analysis of SAGE          data is the relative abundances of transcripts The data          given in Table and Figure show the relative abundances          of transcripts for PC cell ribosomal proteins with          respect to one another as well as with respect to the          total cell complement of transcripts As noted above our          analysis has detected at least  unique transcripts          in PC cells The  ribosomal protein transcripts          identified here thus account for no more than  of          this total By contrast for NGFuntreated and treated          PC cells tags corresponding to the  identified RP          transcripts represent  and  respectively of          total tags analyzed As anticipated this clearly places          transcripts for ribosomal proteins as a whole in the high          abundance category          The most abundantly expressed ribosomal transcripts in          NGFuntreated PC cells included those encoding          ribosomal proteins S S and L These each accounted          for approximately  of total cell transcripts          The high relative abundance of these ribosomal          transcripts in NGFuntreated cells can be appreciated by          the observation that of the  tags encountered more than           times in our analysis  S and S encoded          ribosomal proteins moreover RP transcripts represented           of the  tags encountered from  times and  of          the  tags encountered from  times          The data in Table and Figure show that NGF treatment          resulted in an overall decrease in relative abundance of          transcripts encoding RPs from  to  of total          This may reflect in part our observation that NGF          treatment increases the numbers of transcripts          representing lowabundance genes     Nevertheless          transcripts for ribosomal proteins remained among the          most highly expressed in the NGFtreated cells For          instance tags for RPs LA L LA S and S had          relative abundances of  or more Of the  most          abundantly expressed tags in NGFtreated cells           represent ribosomal transcripts                          NGF selectively regulates the expression of          transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins          In addition to yielding an overall decrease in the          abundance of RP transcripts relative to total cellular          transcripts longterm NGF treatment also promoted          selective changes in relative expression of transcripts          encoding individual RPs Table  Figs            MonteCarlo simulation analysis of the SAGE data          indicated that nearly half a total of  of the  RP          transcripts underwent changes that were significant at          the           P   level see Table  Of          these  transcripts  were downregulated in response          to NGF          Figure shows the distribution of foldchanges in          transcript levels in response to NGF  of the  RP          transcripts were either invariant or showed changes of          fold or less  individual transcripts decreased by           fold L L L L L S S S S and          S and one was elevated by more than fold L          In a past study     the differences in          NGFpromoted gene expression revealed by SAGE analysis of          our libraries were found to be highly reliable based on           the absence of regulation shown by a number of          anticipated housekeeping genes including actin           the observation that the vast majority of transcripts          were not responsive to NGF  the detection of          anticipated changes in expression of a number transcripts          previously reported to be NGF responsive and  the          agreement in relative expression of  genes as revealed          by SAGE and northern blot analyses To further confirm          the reliability of our SAGE findings we used real time          quantitative PCR to compare levels of  different RP          transcripts in PC cells treated with or without NGF for           days As shown in Figure  both techniques revealed          similar changes in expression                          Rapid regulation of an RP transcript by NGF          We next determined the time course with which NGF          regulates an RP transcript For this purpose we studied          RP L which undergoes a fold elevation in response to          longterm NGF treatment Because the changes in          expression are relatively small we used real time PCR          for this end As shown in Figure A the relative          abundance of transcripts encoding RP L were          significantly upregulated by  hr of NGF treatment            fold n   whereas there was no significant change          in transcripts encoding RP S which does not undergo          longterm NGF regulation A time course Figure B          revealed that elevation of L transcripts reaches maximal          levels within  hrs of NGF exposure                            Discussion                  NGF regulates expression of RP transcripts          In the present work we used SAGE profiling to          identify and quantify the relative numbers of transcripts          for  ribosomal proteins in rat PC cells before and          after longterm exposure to NGF This has permitted us to          detect selective changes in transcripts encoding specific          RPs          A number of criteria support the reliability of our          findings The first regards the assignment of SAGE tags          to specific RP transcripts We required that all matching          ESTs or transcripts have clearly definable poly A tails          and poly adenylation signals Due to the extensive data          base for rat RP transcripts it was possible to make all          matches with rat sequences In addition we used  mer          CATG  base SAGE tags for our analysis we have          reported    that this leads to a significantly more          reliable matching of SAGE tags to genes than with the          oftenused mer tags A second indicator of reliability          stems from prior analysis of our SAGE libraries and data          obtained from them     For instance we have shown          that our SAGE libraries show little or no NGFpromoted          changes in tag numbers for transcripts encoding a number          of housekeeping proteins Moreover a number of          transcripts previously found by alternative technologies          to respond to NGF treatment showed similar changes in          our SAGE profiling study Finally Northern blot analysis          verified SAGEpredicted responses of over  transcripts          to NGF treatment A third criterion for reliability was          that Monte Carlo simulation indicated that many of the          NGFpromoted responses of RP transcripts were at a          probability of           P   Because of the          relatively high abundance of many RP transcripts even          comparably small changes in expression could be detected          at this level of significance A last criterion was that          we used real time RTPCR to verify effects of NGF on five          RP transcripts          A previous study by Lee et al     based on          comparison of a total of approximately  random ESTs          from nave and NGFtreated PC cells reported an          NGFpromoted increase in expression of RPL transcripts          and a decrease in RPL transcripts This contrasts with          the current data which revealed no significant change in          expression of either of these transcripts The reason for          this discrepancy is unclear but could in part originate          from the relatively small number of transcripts that were          surveyed in the former study To our knowledge there are          currently no other reports regarding effects of NGF on          levels of ribosomal transcripts                          Relative levels of RP transcripts          Our observations indicate that there is a wide range          in the numbers transcripts per cell that encode          individual RPs For instance both before and after NGF          treatment there was over a fold difference in the          relative numbers of transcripts for RPs L L S as          compared to those encoding RP S Because of the general          scarcity of antisera prepared against mammalian RPs we          do not know whether this is reflected at the protein          level However for a number of other NGFregulated          transcripts in PC cells there is a good correlation          between relative levels of message and protein                Thus it may be that although levels of individual          RPs are assumed to be similar to one another some may be          present in limiting numbers Alternatively there may be          a considerable disparity between relative abundances of          RP transcripts and their corresponding proteins          A recent SAGE study of targets for Nmyc in a human          neuroblastoma cell line     reported relative          abundances for  RP transcripts The existence of such          data permit us to compare the relative levels of RP          transcripts in two cell types neuroblastoma and          pheochromocytoma of related origin ie          neuralcrestderived that both have the potential for          neuronal differentiation The  RP transcripts detected          here represented  of the total transcripts in          NGFuntreated PC cells and  after NGF treatment By          contrast the  RPs reported in the neuroblastoma study          accounted for  of total transcripts for cells without          Nmyc overexpression and  for such cells          transfected with Nmyc Thus for nonNmyc transfected          neuroblastoma cells and PC cells  NGF the          contribution of total RP transcripts lies in a similar          range and this parameter is greatly elevated in          neuroblastoma cells by Nmyc overexpression With          respect to transcripts for individual RPs there are          many similarities as well as several striking differences          between the two cell types When NGFuntreated PC cells          are compared with nontransfected neuroblastoma cells of          the  RP transcripts detected in common for both          systems about half a total of  have relative          abundances within a factor of  Twenty transcripts are          more than fold higher in relative abundance in PC          cells In two of these cases S and S no tags were          detected in the nontransformed neuroblastoma cells in          several other cases S S L the relative          abundance in PC cells was over fold that in the          neuroblastoma cells For most of these expression of          Nmyc elevated the neuroblastoma levels to relative          abundances within fold of those in PC cells However          for L and S the relative abundance in          Nmycexpressing neuroblastoma cells was still  that          in PC cells Finally  RP transcripts L L L          L S S and P were of  times lower abundance in          PC cells than in neuroblastoma cells and this          difference was appreciably enhanced when the NB cells          were transfected with Nmyc          We have also compared our RP results with those for          SAGE carried out with pooled human adult brain tissue          supplied by Gregory J Riggins          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovsagesagereccgirec          Comparison with data for NGFtreated cells reveals          similarity in relative abundance within a factor of  for           of the  RP transcripts in common between the          libraries and  of  to within a factor of  However          several large differences do occur For example the          relative abundances of transcripts encoding RPs L L          S S and S are fold higher in NGFtreated          PC cells than in the pooled brain library and          transcripts for RP L are fold lower These          observations reinforce the notion that expression of          individual RP transcripts can be significantly variable          from cell type to cell type as well as sensitive to          extrinsic signals                          Potential significance of RP transcript          regulation          Although the ribosome has been considered as a          molecular machine     it is of interest that the          transcripts encoding individual proteins of this          organelle are subject to regulation by NGF Two related          questions emerge regarding these findings how do these          changes compare with previous reports for regulation of          RP transcripts and what might be the functional          consequences of these changes          A number of studies have employed a variety of          techniques to detect changes in gene expression          associated with the oncogenic state and have reported          selective elevation of specific RP transcripts in tumors          Examples include RPs La L and S in prostate tumors          and cell lines     RPs L LA L S S S          S S S P and P in colorectal cancers and cell          lines          L in astrocytomas              La in squamous cell carcinoma     L in breast          tumors that overexpress erbB     RPs SA S and          S in lymphoid malignancies     L S P and P          in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines     and P P P          L L L L SA S and S in liver tumors              In addition as noted above a recent SAGE study          identified targets of Nmyc in a human neuroblastoma cell          line     Of  upregulated genes detected           encoded RPs with elevations ranging from  to fold          Several of these genes were also upregulated by cmyc          Taken together these findings indicate that the          transition to the transformed state is associated with          elevation of various RP transcripts A potential          interpretation of such observations is that this          upregulation reflects the enhanced rate of cell division          in tumor cells and the requirement for greater levels of          protein synthesis In agreement with this possibility          transcripts encoding RPs L and S are reported to be          upregulated in regenerating liver     However for          the study involving responses of neuroblastoma cells to          NMyc despite the massive upregulation of RP          transcripts there was no overall increase in the rate          of protein synthesis              Before considering potential functional consequences          of the changes in RP expression described here as well as          elsewhere it must be conceded that changes in transcript          abundance may not necessarily lead to changes in protein          expression The present lack of available          antibodiesantiserum to most mammalian RPs hampers such a          determination However even if cases occur in which          altered RP transcript expression does not lead to changes          in expression of the corresponding protein our and          others findings regarding selective regulation of RP          transcripts would then raise the interesting issue as to          why and the mechanism by which transcript and protein          expression are uncoupled          If at least some of the NGFpromoted alterations in RP          transcript abundance lead to changes in expression of the          corresponding proteins what might be the functional          consequences In the present system NGF converts          proliferating PC cells to a nonproliferating          neuronally differentiated state Our findings reveal that          the relative overall abundance of transcripts for RP          proteins fell by  in response to NGF In addition          nearly half of the individual RP transcripts detected          showed significant changes in expression and          approximately  of these were decreases This overall          decrease in NGFpromoted RP transcript expression and the          preponderance of decreases in expression of specific RP          transcripts compared to increases would favor the          interpretation that the changes observed here reflect at          least in part the transition to the nondividing          phenotype On the other hand we observed that many of          the RP transcripts did not show significant responses to          NGF and that a number showed increases in expression          This suggests that the situation is likely to be more          complex with individual RPs perhaps playing specific          roles not simply associated with the state of cell          proliferative capacity In agreement with this we found          no significant change in expression of RP S transcripts          even though these have been reported to be present at low          levels in growth phase cells and elevated in quiescent          cells              In addition to leaving the cell cycle NGFtreated          PC cells undergo neuronal differentiation This raises          the possibility that some of the observed changes as for          many other NGF regulated genes is related to acquisition          of the neuronal phenotype An analysis of gene regulation          in human NTERA cells induced to leave the cell cycle and          neuronally differentiate in response to retinoic acid          revealed decreases in RP transcripts including L L          L L L L S S S S S S S SA          and P     Of these In the present study only RP          transcripts L and S S S showed significant down          regulation in response to NGF whereas the others found in          the NTERA study either did not show changes that were          significant at the           P   level or underwent a          significant increase RP SA Curcic et al             reported that differentiation of BCH myocytes is          accompanied by a drop in L gene transcription in          contrast we found no significant change in transcripts          encoding this RP In another study RPs La and S were          down regulated during murine erythryolukemia cell          differentiation     we also observed decreases in          these transcripts Mutation of RP S is associated with          Blackfans anemia and therefore appears to play a          selective role in differentiationproliferation of          erythropoetic cells     Here NGF resulted in a          nearly fold drop in S transcripts Thus although          changes in expression of specific RP genes may be          associated with differentiation the pattern of such          changes may reflect the particular cell type and          differentiation stimulus that is involved          Another condition associated with changes in RP          expression is apoptotic death RP LL transcripts          which were not significantly affected by NGF are          selectively upregulated in PC cells prior to  aza          cytosineinduced death and overexpression of this gene          in COS cells induces apoptosis     Overexpression          of L LA S have been also reported to induce          apoptosis      In the present study NGF promoted          little if any change in expression of these RP          transcripts Thus although NGF is an effective          antiapoptotic factor these actions do not appear to be          mediated by downregulation of potentially deathinducing          RPs          At present in contrast to studies on bacterial and          archael ribosomes relatively little is known about the          functions of individual mammalian ribosomal proteins               However assuming that changes in message          abundance lead to alterations in protein levels it is          reasonable to anticipate that the NGFpromoted effects          observed here may affect the protein synthetic capacity          of the cell in some manner Such changes are unlikely to          be global NGF does affect the cellular rate of protein          synthesis but this seems to be due at least in part to          posttranslational modification of the translational          machinery     The alternative is that the changes          reported here may result in selective effects on          translation of specific messages          A final and important possibility to consider is that          a number of RPs appear to possess extraribosomal          functions    and consequently that the changes          reported here may lead to responses that do not directly          relate to ribosomal function For example RP L which          was significantly downregulated by NGF has been          reported to negatively regulate doublestranded RNA          dsRNAactivated protein kinase PKR     As an          additional example RP S which is also downregulated          by NGF has been implicated in erythropoiesis and has          also been described as a monocyte chemotactic factor              As one last example rat RP L which we found to be          upregulated by NGF starting within a few hours and          maximally by  hrs has been shown to be the ortholog of          the yeast gene           grc which appears to be involved          in multiple cellular functions including growth control          cytoskeleton control and energy metabolism              Identification of NGFregulated RPs should now facilitate          exploration of their potential roles in the responses of          cells to neurotrophins                            Conclusions         SAGE analysis provides a reliable quantitative        picture of ribosomal protein expression in PC cells        before and after long term exposure to NGF         Transcripts for ribosomal proteins are among the most        abundant transcripts in the cells however there is a wide        range between numbers of transcripts for individual RP        transcripts         NGF promotes an overall decrease in relative RP        transcript expression for the  RP transcripts detected        from approximately  of total transcripts to  This        drop represents a decrease in relative expression of        individual RP transcripts as well as an increase in message        complexity in NGFtreated cells         Long term NGF treatment of PC cells promotes        statistically significant changes in expression of over        half of the transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins        Decreases in expression outnumbered increases by a ratio of        approximately  The largest observed changes in        expression are in the range of  fold         For at least one RP transcript RPL the response to        NGF is rapid an elevation is detected within  hr of NGF        exposure and reaches maximum regulation by  hrs         Examination of the literature reveals many other        reports in which expression of individual or groups of RP        transcripts are regulated in response to growth factors        differentiation agents or malignant transformation        Comparison with the present data indicate that changes in        ribosomal protein transcripts is regulated in a cell and        state dependent fashion with a large diversity in the        particular RP transcripts that are subject to regulation        Thus although the ribosome may be regarded as a machine        there is a good deal of potential for plasticity with        respect to the expression of its various components This        raises the possibilities that growth factors and other cell        regulators may affect ribosomal function and thereby the        capacity of cells to transcribe specific transcripts         In the absence of information about the specific        functions of most individual RPs in mammalian cells one        can only speculate at present on the physiologic        significance of the reported changes However it seems        highly plausible that the observed responses may play roles        in NGFpromoted neuronal differentiation This may be        mediated in part by selective effects on translation of        certain messages In addition past findings support the        possibility that at least some of the regulated RPs have        extraribosomal actions that may affect neuronal        differentiation and function                    Materials and Methods                  SAGE and matching SAGE tags with RP          transcripts          SAGE
