                    Background        The rigid cell wall that forms a protective layer around        most bacterial cells is chiefly composed of peptidoglycan        a biopolymer unique to bacteria    The backbone of        peptidoglycan consists of a chain of alternating         N acetylglucosamine NAG and         N acetylmuramate NAM units linked        by a  glycosidic bond between the two hexoses The NAM        units of the glycan chain are linked to short peptides        which are synthesized via a ribosomeindependent mechanism        and contain both canonical Lamino acids and unusual        Damino acids Crosslinks between these peptides hold        together the glycan chains and give the cell wall its        characteristic rigidity While this generic structure is        conserved throughout the Bacteria there are number of        variations in particular lineages of bacteria in terms of        adducts to the glycan and composition of the peptide chain           A large suite of conserved enzymes such as        glycosyltransferases which form the hexose polymers        racemases which generate Daminoacid units and        peptidyltransferases and transpeptidases which form        interpeptide linkages are involved in the biosynthesis of        peptidoglycan     The bacterial cell wall is        dynamic and undergoes reorganization during vegetative        growth development and cell division       In        these processes the wall is disassembled through the action        of a diverse set of enzymes that hydrolyze various linkages        in peptidoglycan These enzymes include glycosidases such        as lysozymes that attack the polysaccharide backbone and        peptidases that degrade the crosslinking peptides          Some of these enzymes are also encoded by bacteriophages        and are used to degrade the host cell wall                   Biochemical and structural analysis of the        peptidehydrolyzing enzymes of bacteria have revealed a        large diversity of peptidases with different catalytic        mechanisms Some well studied examples of these peptidases        include Zndependent peptidases of the Hedgehog        carboxyterminal domain fold and the DDpeptidases with a        PAS domainlike fold        The         Bacillus subtilis autolysins LytE and        LytF the         Listeria monocytogenes proteins p        and p and the         Streptococcus PcsB proteins define        another family of somewhat less well explored        peptidoglycanhydrolyzing proteins that are present in all        bacterial lineages       This family        includes the         Escherichia coli membraneassociated        lipoprotein NpC and possesses a catalytic domain        containing a conserved aminoterminal cysteine and a        carboxyterminal histidine Members of this family here        termed the NpCP family from the genus         Bacillus have been shown to be D        Lendopeptidases that hydrolyze the        Dglutamylmesodiaminopimelate linkage in the cellwall        peptides   In         B subtilis  disruption of LytE        CwF and LytF CwE causes the normally rodshaped cells        to assume a long filamentlike morphology as a result of        defective cellwall separation during cell division            In         L monocytogenes p is an essential        gene and has a similar role in cell separation          Multiple paralogous proteins with NpCP catalytic        domains are present in most bacteria suggesting that the        NpCP family is a peptidase family with a widespread        role in the dynamics of the bacterial cell wall        We sought to understand the evolutionary history of the        proteins involved in cellwall dynamics because such an        analysis could throw light on the emergence and        diversification of this uniquely bacterial structure Such        an investigation could also uncover hitherto        underappreciated components of cellwall dynamic systems        and could help in clarifying the biochemical mechanisms of        certain poorly characterized but critical proteins        Furthermore there is considerable interest in these        proteins as they could be potential targets for        antibacterial agents and some cellwallhydrolyzing        enzymes from bacteriophages themselves function as        antibacterial agents As a part of a comprehensive analysis        of proteins involved in bacterial cellwall dynamics we        studied the diversity of the NpCP family Here we        present evidence that these proteins define a large        superfamily which encompasses several conserved lineages        of proteins which were previously not known to be related        to the NpCP proteins These include the cellwall        hydrolases typified by the Pal protein from streptococcal        phages    and the amidase domain of the bacterial        and kinetoplastid GSPS          We also show that members of the NpC superfamily exist        outside the bacterial superkingdom in eukaryotes large        DNA viruses positivestrand RNA viruses and certain        archaea In eukaryotes one of the members of this family        has been studied experimentally and possesses LRAT        activity rather than peptidase activity   These        eukaryotic versions along with certain bacterial forms        show a circular permutation of the domain which results in        a swapping of the positions of the catalytic cysteine and        histidine residues in the sequence These observations        point to greater diversity in terms of biochemistry        biological functions and structural organization than has        previously been recognized in this superfamily                    Results and discussion                  Sequence analysis and detection of novel divergent          members          To determine the entire extant of the NpCP family          we initiated PSIBLAST   searches of the          nonredundant database expect Evalue for inclusion in          threshold   iterated to convergence with a number          of starting points such as the catalytic domains of           B subtilis LytF CwE and LytE          CwF           L monocytogenes P and P and           E coli NpC A search with the          NpC of           E coli gi  residues           recovered several P homologs in its first          iteration YaeF of           E coli second iteration E               the           Arabidopsis homolog of LRAT          Atg gi  second iteration E               and LytN of           Staphylococcus aureus gi           fourth iteration     Reciprocal searches          initiated with regions from the newly detected proteins          YaeF LRAT and LytN detected their closely related          homologs in the initial iterations but in subsequent          iterations they recovered several classic NpCP          homolog members with significant Evalues E            suggesting that these proteins defined a novel          superfamily of proteins          The large set of homologous proteins from diverse          bacteria which was recovered in these searches typically          contain a characteristic aminoterminal conserved region          with a cysteine followed by a carboxyterminal conserved          region with a characteristic histidine Figure  see          also Additional data files In between these conserved          regions there is another characteristic stretch with a          highly conserved glycine that is often followed by an          aspartate Figure  Hereinafter we term these          obviously related bacterial proteins as the classical          NpCP group Thiol peptidases of the papainlike          transglutaminaselike adenoviral proteaselike and          caspasehemoglobinaselike folds have a conserved          cysteine Chistidine H pair      Figure           However the context of the CH pair in the NpCP          peptidase domains along with the central motif with the          conserved glycine G defines a unique constellation of          residues Figure  which is not encountered in any of          the above peptidase families Accordingly this pattern          served as a good marker to identify divergent homologs of          the classical NpCP family The above searches          unexpectedly recovered LRAT and its homologs from various          eukaryotes           Caenorhabditis          elegans developmental regulator Egl candidate          tumor suppressor Hrev proteins from poxviruses and          animal positivestrand RNA viruses with statistically          significant Evalues Transitive searches initiated with          the divergent members detected in these searches          additionally recovered the amidase domains of bacterial          and kinetoplastid GSPS and the bacterial          peptidoglycandegrading enzymes such as           Lactococcus AcmB           Staphylococcus LytA   and LytN            and their homologs          The presence of three tandem repeats of the NpCP          module in the protein YwtD from           B subtilis allowed us to define          the amino and carboxyterminal boundaries of this domain          quite precisely The domain begins approximately           residues before the aminoterminal conserved cysteine          and ends  residues from the carboxyterminal          conserved histidine A search for conserved motifs using          the Gibbs sampling procedure resulted in the detection of          three conserved motifs with a probability of chance          occurrence   in the search space comprising          these proteins These motifs correspond to the          abovementioned conserved signatures which are          characteristic of the NlpCPlike proteins and were          readily identifiable in all true positives recovered in          the transitive sequence profile searches Interestingly          the eukaryotic versions typified by the LRAT their viral          homologs and the bacterial forms typified by           E coli YaeF while containing all          the hallmark signatures of the NlpCP catalytic domain          showed a reversal in the positions of the motifs with the          conserved cysteine and the conserved histidine in their          primary structures Figures   Thus in these          proteins the central motif of the classic NlpCP          proteins with the conserved glycine was the most          aminoterminal conserved motif followed by the motif          containing the conserved histidine and then the one with          the cysteine This arrangement suggested that there was a          circular permutation with respect to the classical          NlpCP module in these proteins All the NlpCP          homologs recovered in the above searches were collated          and clustered at various thresholds of BLASTbitscore to          highscoring pairs HSPlength ratios using the          BLASTCLUST program Multiple sequence alignments were          prepared for the individual clusters using TCoffee            and their secondary structure was predicted with the PHD          program   A comparison revealed that the core          secondary structures of both the classical NlpCP          modules as well as those with permuted motifs showed           or greater concordance These observations taken          together suggest that classical NlpCPlike          peptidases the LRATlike permuted forms and the          divergent GSPS amidase domainlike proteins comprise a          vast superfamily of enzymes with different biochemical          activities                          Structural and biochemical features of the NlpCP          superfamily          Secondarystructure prediction based on multiple          sequence alignments revealed that the NlpCP          superfamily domains adopt an    fold with segregated           and  elements Figure  The first recognizable          secondary structure element in this domain is an helix          that is present in practically all members of this          superfamily with the exception of a few members of the          AcmB family from           Staphylococcus aureus Figures            where it appears to have entirely degenerated The          most prominent helix which is conserved in all          proteins of this superfamily is the second helix which          is associated with the first conserved motif The          conserved cysteine occurs at the extreme amino terminus          of this helix and is typically preceded by a polar          residue The central motif with the conserved glycine and          the motif bearing the conserved histidine correspond to          the two well conserved strands Three more strands are          predicted to occur carboxyterminal to these two strands          Of these the strand that immediately follows the strand          with the conserved histidine contains a conserved polar          residue either histidine or an acidic or amide residue          By analogy with all other thiol proteases in the          NlpCP superfamily peptidases the cysteine would act as          the nucleophile that attacks the peptide bond while the          histidine acts in sequential steps as the base and then          acid catalyst for the proton transfers   In other          thiol proteases the histidine is oriented to a hydrogen          bond with the cysteine by a third polar residue            The presence of a third conserved polar position in the          strand that follows the histidinecontaining strand          suggests that it serves as the orienting residue for the          catalytic histidine in the NlpCP While there is no          directly detectable sequence similarity between the          NlpCP proteins and other superfamilies of peptidases          the arrangement of catalytic residues with respect to          the conserved secondary elements in this superfamily is          the same as that in several other peptidase superfamilies          Figure  The configuration comprising a catalytic          cysteine at the amino terminus of a helix packed against          a core threestranded sheet with the second and third          strands bearing the catalytic histidine and its orienting          polar partner is seen in the transglutaminases and a          related class of aminogroup acetyltransferases          papainlike proteases adenoviral proteases and ubiquitin          carboxyterminal hydrolases    Figure  This          suggests that despite the absence of significant sequence          similarity the NlpCP domain is likely to contain a          structural core corresponding to the classical          papainlike protease fold Figure           In the case of papainlike proteases  calpains          transglutaminases and NH            acetyltransferases  the          threestranded sheet of the core is incorporated into          barrel with five to eight constituent strands Figure           Contrary to this in the case of the ubiquitin          carboxyterminal hydrolases and the adenoviral proteases          there is a tendency for the sheet to be incorporated into          a scaffold with other helical elements forming a mixed             structure The observation that the threestranded          unit of the NlpCP domain is followed by two other          strands suggests that the NlpCP proteins are likely          to form a fivestranded barrel similar to that seen in          papainlike proteases Figures   However in the          NlpCP domain the distance between the helix bearing          the catalytic cysteine and the core barrel is similar to          that seen in the transglutaminases and NH            aminotransferases suggesting that          it lacks the large insert that is seen in several          papainlike proteases Figure  This difference may          also explain the failure of sequencestructure threading          algorithms such as the combined fold prediction and          DPSSM   to recover any significant hits to the          papainlike proteases Thus the NlpCP domain is          structurally close to the minimal ancestral unit of the          thiolprotease fold          The prediction of a classical thiolprotease fold for          the NlpCP proteins also explains the circular          permutation of the conserved motifs that is observed in          several members of this superfamily such as LRAT and YaeF          Figure  Precedent for such a permutation is offered          by the adenoviral proteases in which the sheet with          the catalytic histidine precedes the helix with the          catalytic cysteine    In this fold the carboxyl          terminus of the structure barrel or sheet with the          histidine typically occurs in close proximity to the          aminoterminal region of the domain Figure  This          could allow a permutation to survive without distorting          the overall spatial arrangement of the catalytic          residues A comparison of the conserved residues and          predicted secondary structure of the regular NlpCP          domain with the permuted versions suggests that the          fivestranded barrel is maintained intact with the          remaining segment including the helix with the cysteine          being linked to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of          the barrel Figures            The only biochemically characterized eukaryotic          representative of this superfamily is LRAT which          transfers an acyl group from the           sn position of          phosphatidylcholine lecithin to retinal to form          retinyl esters     The general base of the          enzyme cysteine accepts the acyl group from lecithin          and this is followed by retinol being directed to attack          the acylenzyme by the catalytic histidine followed by          the release of the retinyl ester    The          similarity of this reaction mechanism to that catalyzed          by the catalytictriad cysteine and serine proteases has          been previously proposed    The phylogenetic          relationship we demonstrate between the LRAT family of          enzymes and thiol peptidases shows that this catalytic          triad was derived only once in evolution and reused for          different mechanistically similar reactions such as acyl          transfer transacylation or peptidebond hydrolysis The          presence of an analogous situation in the          transglutaminases    and the related NH            acyltransferases   suggests          that diverse acetylacyltransferase activities have been          repeatedly derived in course of the evolution of the          papainlike fold The presence of duplicated versions of          the NlpCP domain in some proteins Figures            suggests that the permutation could have potentially          occurred through a duplicate intermediate in which the          either the amino or carboxyl terminus of each of the          copies degenerated leaving behind a stable permuted          unit          In the thiolprotease fold variablesized inserts are          often seen in the region between the strand containing          the histidine and the strand bearing the orienting polar          residue This feature is even observed in the NlpCP          superfamily including the insertion of an entire zinc          ribbon domain   in the case of the plant homologs of          LRAT The orienting polar residue is either an acidic or          a polar amide residue in most members of the          thiolpeptidase fold    In the majority of the          members of the NlpCP superfamily this residue is          histidine which in the appropriate environment can act          equivalently to an acidic orienting residue In the          NlpCP domains of the AcmBlike divergent group and the          circularly permuted YaeFlike and poxviral groups this          residue is an acidic residue as in most other thiol          peptidases Figure  However in the AcmBlike group it          is shifted by two positions with respect to the rest of          the superfamily Figure  suggesting a specific          elongation of the strand bearing this residue in this          lineage                          Functional architectural and phylogenetic          diversity of the NlpCP superfamily                      The Plike family            The Plike family typified by P and its obvious            relatives includes the most commonly occurring versions            of the superfamily which are seen in most bacterial            lineages Figures   All members of this family            have either a signal peptide or a transmembrane region            indicating an extracellular location Figure  All            characterized members of this family are peptidases            and they either hydrolyze the            Dglutamylmesodiaminopimelate linkage or             N acetylmuramate Lalanine            linkage    There are  clearly identifiable            orthologous lineages within this family which have            varying phyletic distributions in bacteria Figure             Some of these like the YwtDlike orthologous group            are prevalent only in Grampositive bacteria while the            NlpClike orthologous group is present in both            Grampositive bacteria and proteobacteria The Pal            lineage of the NIpClike orthologous group is            restricted to the bacteriophages and their prophage            remnants in Grampositive bacteria They hydrolyze the             N acetylmuramate Lalanine            linkage and are potent bacteriolytic enzymes               They appear to represent a case where a host            enzyme has been exapted reused by a virus for            penetrating the bacterial cell wall            The presence of the Plike family in most            bacterial lineages suggests that a representative of            this lineage was probably present before the divergence            of the bacteria from a common ancestor However it            appears to have differentiated to several distinct            orthologous groups only later in bacterial evolution            Several orthologous groups show a patchy phyletic            pattern for example the orthologous group SCP is            present in the actinomycetes and the Grampositive            bacterium             Clostridium acetobutylicum  It            shows a lineagespecific expansion in the former taxon            with  and  closely related paralogous forms in the            genomes of             Streptomyces and             Mycobacterium tuberculosis             respectively Such phyletic patterns together with the            presence of members of this family in genomes of phages            and prophages suggests that lateral transfer was            involved in the dissemination of some of these            orthologous groups Gene loss is an alternative            possibility that could in part explain the sporadic            distribution of some of these orthologous groups If            the trees showed a consistent clustering of proteins            only from bacteria with large genomes in which gene            loss is less pervasive then gene loss is likely to be            a major factor However this pattern in not observed            Figures   suggesting an important role for            lateral transfer            In addition to the variable phyletic patterns the            proteins of the Plike family also show extensive            lineagespecific diversification in terms of their            domain architectures Figure  In many proteins the            catalytic peptidase domain is fused to domains such as            SH LysM and cholinebinding domains               Figure  These domains probably aid them in            interactions with peptides carbohydrates and lipids            that are associated with the bacterial cell wall The            NlpCP domain is also fused to other catalytic            domains such as the polysaccharidehydrolyzing lysozyme            domain and the JAB domain that has recently been            described to have metallopeptidase activity               These are likely to function as twoheaded enzymes that            simultaneously attack different linkages in the murein            These architectures point to the potential diversity in            the biological functions of the autolysins in bacterial            cellwall metabolism They could be functional at            different spatial locations and at different temporal            points in the life cycle thereby contributing to the            diversity in the morphology of the bacterial cell and            colonies                                The AcmBLytNlike family            The AcmBLytNlike family is the most divergent            family of the NlpCP superfamily Figure  The            monophyly of this family is strongly supported in the            phylogenetic analysis RELL bootstrap  and by            synapomorphies such as the position of the orienting            polar residue see above Two major subfamilies within            this family typified respectively by AcmB and             S aureus LytN are predominantly            restricted to the Grampositive bacteria and function            as cellwall hydrolases The AcmB subfamily shows a            lineagespecific expansion in the genome of             S aureus  with around seven            paralogs Both the subfamilies exhibit considerable            diversity of domain architectures with most of the            architectures mirroring those seen in the Plike            family Thus these proteins contain fusions of the            NlpCP peptidase domain with the SH            cholinebinding LysM lysozyme and NAM amidase domains            Figure  and this implicates them in different            processes in cellwall dynamics A third subfamily of            the AcmBLytNlike family is typified by the            aminoterminal amidase domain of the GSPS from            proteobacteria and trypanosomes     GSPS            is a bifunctional enzyme its synthase domain carries            out the ATPdependent fusion of two glutathione            moieties to the polyamine spermidine to form the            antioxidant metabolite GSP while its amidase domain            hydrolyzes the amide linkage to release glutathione and            spermidine     The proteomes of             Methanosarcina and the            Grampositive bacterium             C acetobutylicum have a member            each of this GSPSlike subfamily Both these proteins            are secreted proteins with the version from             Methanosarcina  MM            additionally containing von Willebrandt factor A            immunoglobulin and fibrinogenlike repeat domains            Figure             The phyletic distribution suggests that the            AcmBLytNlike family emerged early in the            Grampositive lineage through rapid sequence            divergence With the exception of the GSPSs all the            proteins within each subfamily of this family are            secreted or membraneassociated Even the closest            relatives of the GSPSs namely MM and CAC are            secreted proteins that are likely to function as            extracellular peptidases This suggests that even the            GSPS subfamily probably arose within the Grampositive            bacteria followed by a lateral transfer to the archaeon                        Methanosarcina and the            proteobacteria In the latter lineage it was exapted            to function as an intracellular enzyme probably due to            the similarity in structure of GSP and the ancestral            extracellular substrate namely the peptidoglycan            peptides MM is a rare instance of an NlpCP            superfamily member occurring in the archaeal lineage            Its domain architecture suggests that it might function            as a protease in the maturation of the complex            extracellular matrix of this multicellular            archaeon                                The YaeFPoxvirus GRlike and the LRATlike            families            Both the LRATlike and the YaeFPoxvirus GR            families are unified by the circular permutation that            occurs at essentially the same point in both these            families The YaeFPoxvirus GR shows a peculiar            phyletic distribution of being present only in            bacteria the archaeon             Archaeoglobus C elegans and the            poxviruses Figure  The synapomorphy that unifies            this family is the presence of an acidic orienting            residue in the catalytic triad Figure  Given the            widespread distribution of this family in bacteria            with multiple distinct lineages it is likely that this            family arose early in the bacteria through a circular            permutation from an ancestral classical NlpCP            domain Subsequently it appears to have been            transferred from a bacterial source to             Archaeoglobus  the nematode            lineage and the common ancestor of all poxviruses The            high degree of conservation and maintenance of this            protein across both entomopoxviruses and vertebrate            poxviruses suggests that it performs an important            function in these viruses Figures   Along with            the LRAT proteins these proteins contain a second            conserved cysteine red letters in Figure             carboxyterminal to the catalytic cysteine This second            cysteine has been shown to be critical for a functional            LRAT enzyme suggesting that the poxviral proteins may            have a related activity see below   Formation of            acyl conjugates during the maturation of the            lipoprotein component of the viral capsid could be one            such potential function Alternatively these proteins            could function as proteases in the maturation of the            viral particle            The LRAT family is thus far found only in eukaryotes            and animal viruses with the sole exception of a single            member from the proteomes of             Vibrio cholerae and             Anabaena  The LRAT and its            obvious orthologs are found in addition to the            vertebrates in other animals and plants In            vertebrates the enzyme has an important role in the            storage and mobilization of retinol vitamin A as            esters in peripheral tissues and for generating an            intermediate in the synthesis of the rhodopsin            chromophore in the visual tissues   The ortholog            of the vertebrate LRAT Egl in             C elegans has been implicated in            the development of the vulva   The Egl function            is required in the cell neighboring the one in which it            is expressed suggesting that it may have a role in            generating a regulatory signal   This could raise            the interesting possibility of Egl synthesizing an            ester similar to the retinyl esters that might function            as a secreted differentiation signal during vulval            development The presence of orthologs in plants            suggests that even plants may process retinol or            related compounds similar to those in animals            The vertebrates possess two other distinct            subfamilies that appear to have been derived from the            LRAT family Figure  One of these is typified by the            candidate tumor suppressor protein Hrev which            inhibits growth of tumors induced by the oncoprotein            HRas   Hrev has been shown to exist in two            cellular isoforms one of which is associated with the            cell membrane    This suggests that Hrev            could potentially act as an acyltransferase that might            modify membrane components A homolog of Hrev is            detectable in the pathogenic bacterium             V cholerae  and phylogenetic            analysis suggests that it has been acquired through            lateral transfer from a vertebrate source Further            experimental analysis of this bacterial protein could            be of considerable interest as it could potentially            have a role in interactions with its vertebrate host            The second vertebratespecific subfamily is typified by            the uncharacterized human protein NSE which could            potentially function in a similar capacity to Hrev            However in these proteins the catalytic cysteine is            replaced by a serine Figure  Such substitutions            have previously been observed in other papainlike            peptidases with the serine participating in a            functional active site    Multiple paralogs of            both Hrev and NSE are seen in vertebrates            suggesting some functional diversification of these            subgroups            The viral homologs of Hrev were observed in            picornaviruses such as human parechoviruses Aichi            virus and avian encephalomyelitis virus   We also            detected related proteins in human caliciviruses such            as the Norwalk virus and related viruses Figures              These proteins could potentially function as a            second protease in the processing of viral            polyproteins or they could function as a viral enzyme            that could modify some membrane component like their            cellular homologs All the members of the LRAT family            including the forms from RNA viruses clearly form a            distinct family which excludes the YaeFpoxvirus GR            family which shows a similar circular permutation The            widespread distribution of the LRAT family in            eukaryotes suggests that they possessed the enzymes            from an early stage in their evolution The NlpCP            superfamily is largely absent from most archaeal            proteomes However it is very widespread in bacteria            and includes forms with circular permutations similar            to the eukaryotic LRATlike proteins Hence the LRAT            family was probably acquired by the eukaryotes by the            lateral transfer of a bacterial precursor similar to            the YaeFYiiX family This could have either occurred            during the primary proteobacterial endosymbiosis            which gave rise to the mitochondrion or as a result of            a subsequent transfer from some other bacterial source            The currently available sequences do not allow us to            distinguish between these possibilities The drastic            change in biochemical function might have resulted in            an accelerated evolution of these eukaryotic proteins            resulting in considerable divergence from the bacterial            YaeFYiiXlike forms                                      Conclusions        We present a detailed evolutionary and structural        analysis of the NlpCP superfamily of peptidases We show        that this superfamily in addition to the well        characterized Prelated peptidoglycan peptidases        includes divergent cellwall hydrolases typified by        AcmBLytN eukaryotic proteins such as LRAT Egl and        their relatives amidase domains of GSPSs and several        other uncharacterized bacterial proteins We identified        three residues involved in catalysis namely a cysteine a        histidine and a polar residue that are conserved        throughout this superfamily A comparison of the predicted        secondary structure for this superfamily with known        peptidase folds revealed that these three residues show        exactly the same arrangement as the catalytic triad of        papainlike thiol peptidases The NlpCP domain is        predicted to adopt a papainlike fold in which the        catalytic cysteine is at the amino terminus of a helix        which is packed against a fivestranded barrel with the        histidine and the polar residue The NlpCP superfamily        has diversified into four major families with two of them         namely the LRAT and YaeFPoxvirus GR families  showing        a circular permutation of the catalytic domain        This analysis could considerably aid further        experimental investigations of the NlpCP superfamily        Certain members of this superfamily such as Pal have        recently been proposed as potent antibacterial agents          Identification of novel members of this superfamily in        diverse bacterial proteomes could point to additional        candidates with similar bacteriolytic activity        Furthermore this analysis could help in identifying        enzymes with important roles in bacterial colony and cell        morphology Recognition of Egl Hrev and NSE as        homologs of LRAT suggests a potential role for these        proteins as novel components of lipid metabolism in        eukaryotes Further studies on the homologs of these        proteins in diverse animal viruses and the pathogenic        bacterium         V cholerae could help in uncovering        hitherto unknown mechanisms by which these pathogens could        interact with their hosts                    Materials and methods        The nonredundant nr database of protein sequences        National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI was        searched using the BLASTP program   Profile searches        were conducted using the PSIBLAST program
