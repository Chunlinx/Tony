                                 Repairing China            Both the New York Times andLosAngeles Times lead with the first highlevel encounter between the USand Chinaa lunch meeting in Singapore between Chinas foreign minister andMadeleine Albrightsince NATOs bombing of the Chinese Embassy in BelgradeDiplomacy also leads at the Washington Post  which stuffs the Albright meeting butgoes with the impromptu talks between new Israeli PM Ehud Barak and the newpresident of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika and between Barak Yasser Arafatand President Clinton at the funeral of Moroccos King Hassan a story theother majors run inside USA Today leads with a story also fronted by theLAT  the arrest of a man in last weeks Yosemite National Park murder ofa naturalist a man the FBI is saying is also a suspect in the February murderthere of three other women            The two Times agree that Albrights luncheon with her Chinesecounterpart is a hopeful lift in what has been a difficult patch with Chinaespecially given that it resulted in the two announcing that President Clintonwill meet with President Jiang Zemin in New Zealand in the fall a nice changefrom just after the embassy bombing when notes the NYT  Jiang wouldnttake a Clinton phone call A key ingredient in the upswing is that Albrightemphasized that the US doesnt endorse Taiwans recent attempts to departfrom the one China policy The only real difference between the two accountsis that the LAT stresses remaining strains in the relationship a bitmore noting this in the big type of its headline and also mentions thespurning of Albrights requests for renewed visits to China by US navalvessels and for resuming talks regarding the nonproliferation of weapons ofmass destruction            The LAT fronts the followon to a story

through something you dont reallyunderstand it is how Rep Richard Gephardt explains the change to theTimes  Hmmm  so maybe what this country also needs is for morepoliticians to have family members who cant get drug rehabilitation treatmentor day care or who end up on the wrong end of a handgun            A Wall Street Journal frontpage feature notes a waycorporate America is bucking the general trend against affirmative action Thebusiness group that certifies minority ownership of corporations is likely todrop its definition from  percent ownership by minority group members to percent The story notes two overriding factors behind the trend Corporations are slashing their suppliers down to a handful of giants whichwould under the present rules automatically exclude virtually allminoritycontrolled companies and  the clout of minority consumers has grownand therefore companies want to be able to undertake  without losing thechance to establish a minorityfriendly track record But isnt this sort oflike becoming more attractive to investors by weakening the definition ofprofitability            ExReagan defense official Lawrence Korb points out in an NYT opedthat the vote the other day to deny money to the F doesnt despite manyheadlines actually kill the plane Thats because he explains the money thatwas turned down was only for producing the first block of aircraft next year billion in R and D for the plane was left untouched and Korb notes thatthis sort of pot has been used in the past to resuscitate killed or virtuallykilled aircraft such as the B and B bombers and the Osprey tilt rotoraircraft If politicians want to really kill a weapon they need Korb pointsout to do what Bush Defense Secretary Dick Cheney did to bury therunawayexpensive Atake

demonstration of  Iranians in LA When oneof the protests organizers called he was transferred three times and thenapparently none of the three faxes he sent got through The sole Iranianreporter at the paper an intern knew in advance of the demonstration butassumed the city desk would already know about it Just getting the snafu storyout there will make both the paper and its readers more aware of what needs tobe done to avoid this sort of mistake in the future            Back to USAT s account of the arrest of the suspect in the Yosemitecases His crucial misstep appears to have been a profound failure to blend inHe was arrested Saturday fully clothed at a nudist colony nearSacramento
