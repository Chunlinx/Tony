                                  Lethal Weapons            Tuesday a week after the Colorado highschoolmassacre President Clinton proposed new gun control legislation and askedAmericans to rethink the issue Weve got to keep working until people startthinking about this stuff the same way they think about Xrays and metaldetectors at airports he declared at a White House ceremony We have toredefine the national community so that we have a shared obligation to savechildrens lives To the gun control advocates in attendance Clinton pleadedYou change the culture well change the laws            Clintons speech was a textbook illustration of howto use a national trauma to reframe an issue Congress has opposed gun controlfor years By changing the cultureie the way voters think aboutfirearmsClinton hopes to swing public opinion in favor of gun restrictionsIn the past he observed rural Americans have thought of guns in terms ofhunting and the right to bear arms In the future Clinton wants Americans tothink of guns in new terms bombs and kids His strategy is threefold                                           Coopt the cultureargument Opponents of gun control have framed the debate as a choicebetween blaming weapons and blaming people who abuse them Guns dont killpeople people kill people goes the famous slogan Since conservatives tendto oppose pornography and divorce as well as gun control they get a twofer byattributing tragedies such as the one in Colorado to a degenerating cultureMonday Republicans put out the word that House Speaker Dennis Hastert andSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott were going to kick off a national dialogueon youth and culture to address nongunrelated causes of the massacre            Clinton tried to neutralize the importance ofculture by acknowledging it In her opening remarks Hillary Clinton invokedprayer and religion and repeatedly charged that the culture of violence intelevision movies music video games and the Internet is having a profoundeffect on our children and causes more aggression and antisocial behaviorWe must resolve to do what we can to change that culture she proposed BothClintons claimed that several of their pet causes and projects wereameliorating antisocial conduct Vchips childrens television Internetfilters and mental health awareness By suggesting that the cultural causes ofviolence were being sufficiently addressed they sought to shift attention andpressure to the remaining factor guns                                           Focus on kids Adultswho cant stand the idea of the government telling them what to do are usuallywilling and often eager to have the government impose identical restrictions onteenagers So the Clintons aimed their legislation and rhetoric at kids andyoung adults Guns and children are two words that should never be puttogether in the same sentence argued Hillary Clinton who managed to squeezeoff countless criticisms of guns in between her eight invocations of ourchildren President Clinton repeatedly drew applause as he announced proposalsto raise the legal age of handgun possession from  to  years and preventjuveniles who commit violent crimes from ever buying a gun                            Equate guns with bombsAmericans love rights and recreation but hate crime and mayhem The mostimportant element of Clintons strategy therefore is to get the public tostop associating guns with hunting and selfprotection and to start associatingthem with explosives and terrorism instead We have a huge hunting and sportshooting culture in America Clinton observed But I want to make a plea toeverybody who is waiting for the next deer season in my home state to thinkabout this in terms of what our reasonable obligations to the larger communityof America are  Next time you get on an airplane think about how youdfeel if the headline in the morning paper right before you got on the airplanewas Airport Metal Detectors and XRay Machines Abolished as Infringement onAmericans Constitutional Right To Travel  And right next to it there isanother headline Terrorist Groups Expanding Operations in the United States            To fortify this unorthodox analogy the Clintonsbound guns and bombs together in their legislation and in their analysis on theColorado tragedy While Hillary Clinton preached against juvenile access tobombmaking materiel and decried the arsenal of guns rifles and bombs thatthe two young men in Littleton were able to bring into their school PresidentClinton earned another ovation by proposing to require Brady background checkson anyone who wants to buy explosives            If opponents of guncontrol dont recognize soon how the emerging prominence of kids and explosivesis transforming the nations image of deadly weapons Clinton may succeed inreshaping the debate and turning the political tide against guns Advocates ofgun rights say Clinton is exploiting this tragedy in Littleton to further hisgun control agenda Of course he is Theyre missing the point Politiciansdont ban guns Politicians with persuasive arguments ban guns
