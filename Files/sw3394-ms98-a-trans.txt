        okay do you   well the magazines that i subscribe to are i im i dont know if youre familiar is Better Homes and Gardens   yeah im familiar a little bit   okay and um Sesame Street  okay   Sesame Street yeah weve had that one before and uh i dont presently subscribe to any i think weve subscribed ive subscribed to Sports Illustrated and   uhhuh   um i think weve taken Sesame Street actually before and um   yeah thats the big hit in this in this house the Sesame Street because they have um you know the calendars and that kind of thing but i take the recipes and the home gardening and the furnishings from Better Homes and Gardens   yeah uhhuh   so   you uh do you do you read it all the way through everytime how often does it come out   uhhuh once a month   yeah   and i yeah i read it all the way through more than once and my husband i find him reading it too   oh yeah huh   so and its a free subscription my mother gave it to us so   oh well thats the the best kind oh oh weve uh ive had Sports Illustrated weve had National Geographic when it was free my my mother got that for us it was free so we and uh but um  i guess i found um i really i like reading them but i never i never seem to have because Sports see the Sports Illustrateds weekly   uhhuh   and it and i just didnt seem to have time to sit down and read it   oh we were always reading magazines because we we dont really subscribe to them we usually buy them off the rack and were always buying Life and People and um   yeah   oh a few others i cant really think about but were were always reading magazines in this house and oh and Time Time and um   yeah umhum   so were were were always reading magazines in this house   yeah   and um we saved all the Time Magazines from the um from when um we went to war so we have all of those uhhuh well we saved yeah we saved them we thought maybe maybe theyd you know   uhhuh huh you have a whole collection from the Gulf War well thats a good idea   be useful later on in life when the boys grow up because we have two small   yeah yeah yeah do you get Life every month   um no the we dont purchase subscribe to those we just get them like maybe   no yeah when it looks interesting yeah   yeah uhhuh maybe once every three months or something like that but   i havent gotten a copy of that in well actually i dont know i my parents used to take it and uh when it was weekly   umhum uhhuh   and that that was i used to read it all the time then and i really havent looked at it much since it went monthly except in the grocery line picking it up and looking looking at the pictures in it looked looked interesting   uhhuh   yeah and my husband is the kind of person that prefers prefers the um  what do you call those the uh The Sun and um The Star yeah those suck  yeah he likes he loves those hell read hell read those all the time   oh yeah those the the tabloid things oh does he really and and and and you and you fess up to it huh   no i just i dont i dont read them   but you admit your husband does  huh   yeah he does all the time and   isnt that funny huh   and hell sneak one home every once in a while in the grocery cart but thats just those i dont know those are just things i dont really i dont know i dont really find interesting i dont believe and hell show me an article or two i i i dont believe it anyway so its not   really yeah i glance at them in line um but the stories are so ridiculous you know i mean uh     thats what he does he hell stand in line and just laugh   right seven year old gives birth to twins and um uh       uh ninety nine year old uh elopes with ten year i mean you know i just huh   yeah  yeah well he he loves all of those yeah so those are his kind of great role model for the kids i guess   umhum i read um the newspaper like every day and i guess um as i was thinking about it before the what i guess i like about the magazines is the article theyll cover the same material sort of   uhhuh   but more more um more in depth and more thought out and more the whole picture instead of just you know one little   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah we usually just get get the newspaper on weekends because we really dont have time during the week but we usually get Fridays Saturdays and Sundays and thats really about it but uh we read like the Dallas Life Magazine you know in there and   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   those kind of pretty interesting so i mean just talking to you i i i realize how much we read i didnt really realize that thats just amazing   say it sounds like you read quite a bit really yeah yeah   we do now that i think about it we do read a lot so   i dont ive gotten to where i dont get one unless im on a trip a magazine   oh really oh   yeah just just about i mean ill pick up when im going somewhere ill pick up a People and and uh usually a Sports Illustrated and uh occasionally ill go to the library and and uh   uhhuh yeah   and uh you know they have all the current ones every every week and ill sit down and and read them read them there   yeah yeah yeah thats a good idea yeah ive only done it once but i   yeah well i uh ive got teenage kids so i you know theyre usually there doing stuff and im and not ready to leave at the appointed hour so i end up i end up sitting you know while theyre   yeah oh
