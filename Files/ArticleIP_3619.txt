                                 I Have Seen the Millennium and It Works            Since plans for BritainsMillennium Dome began to take shape last year condemnation has poured in fromall sides Leftwing critics are appalled at the waste of  billion thatcould have gone toward housing and the National Health Service Conservativesobject to the Blair governments attempt to present England as a modernmulticultural nation instead of a traditionbound Christian one With the helpof constant attacks from all sides the domes approval rating fell to percent in one recent polllower than Monicas Kens or even Lindas Theonly people in London who dont heap scorn on it are those who complain theyretoo tired of the topic to talk about it            On thechance that something so despised might deserve defending I put on a hard hatand rubber boots and went to look at the construction site in Greenwich justoutside London this week Because the worlds clocks are fixed to GreenwichMean Time this is the spot where the millennium can be argued to officiallydebut As I half suspected the dome is better than advertised As a buildingit is stunning As the site of the main international event of the Year it may or may not succeed But the dome has at least a chance to follow in thepath of its illustrious English ancestors the Crystal Palace exhibition of and the Festival of Britain of  Those events too were derided inadvance as wasteful and stupid But they are remembered now as monumentalexpressions of British identity and historical moment            As a feat of architecture engineering and urban renewalthe dome is already close to being a success John Majors Tory governmentfirst conceived of the project and Labor was officially opposed before it tookpower so until  no one knew what would happen Once Tony Blair decided tomake the dome a kind of signature for New Labor there were just three yearsto plan and build one of the largest structures on earthon a contaminatedgasworks site Before construction could begin the ground below literally hadto be washed to remove cyanide and arsenic Engineers then went about raising aroom of nearly a million square feet This is a structure so huge thataccording to Anthony Day the retired architect who gave me a tour weathersystems would form inside if not for the hightech fiberglass and Teflon doubleskin Day suggests that winter visitors will want to bring overcoats and brandyflasks because the building is simply too big to heat though I suspect theBrits like it that way            Even ifthe exhibition fails to draw the hopedfor  million visitors it will beresponsible for turning hundreds of acres of industrial wasteland into a lovelyspot on the Thames linked to the rest of the metropolis by the UndergroundThis follows the urban planning ideas of Britains most famous architectRichard Rogers who is responsible for the dome Rogers believes that Londonlike many of the worlds great cities is being undone by traffic and unplannedsprawl He argues in a recent book Cities for a Small Planet  that theway to rescue London is to reduce car traffic develop new neighborhoods formixed use and convert the citys greatest natural asset the Thames riverbankinto public space If successful the dome will make the case for pursuingRogers grander visionturning the Thames Embankment now a highway along theriver into a grand park            Like Rogers bestknown building the PompidouCenter in Paris the dome is drawn in brilliant color which jumps out againstthe London drab like a brightly frosted cake The Italianborn architectsother hallmark of which the Lloyds of London headquarters is the leadingexample is for a building to show how it works exposing its elevatorsventilation pipes and structural girders You can see at a glance from theoutside how the dome stands up Its huge tent is sustained by brilliant yellowtent poles nearly  feet high and stitched together with steel cables Fromthe overlooking hill of the Greenwich Royal Observatory the structure lookslike a whimsical sea monster that crawled out of the Thames The chief fault ofRogers other buildings is that they dont age wellmany of the better knownones have an early s new wave look But the dome has the advantage ofbeing temporary The millennium exhibition will last a year and though thestructure may be converted to another use its only supposed to last years            The tentis beautiful emptyDavid Hockney the painter was recently quoted proposingthat it be left that way And members of the planning committee may privatelyshare that wish Almost every decision about how to fill the space has arousedcontroversy The most ridiculed proposal is Body a gargantuan naked humanpeople can walk through observing the operation of the internal organs as in aRogers building Leaving Dome Person unsexed on the exterior seems overlyprudish But the alternative of Brobdingnagian genitalia and pythonsize pubichairs could be hard to stomach even after the Starr report            The greatest challenge may be the least futuristic part ofthe exhibitionthe National Identity section for which the committee hasyet to announce any kind of plan In deciding what to put here Britain will bedescribing itself to the world In previous great exhibitions this was a lesscomplicated issue At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in  Britainwas an imperial power with a unitary culture A great exhibition was a chanceto dazzle with what it could make and build beginning with the glass and ironCrystal Palace itself a marvel of early Victorian engineering The Festival of Britain organized by the grandfather of the Labor minister now incharge of the Millennium Dome still represented a culturally homogenousindustrial country It displayed thousands of Britishmade things heraldingthe emergence from wartime rationing into postwar consumerism But todayBritain is increasingly an immigrant nation with an emerging postindustrialeconomy It depends far more on the export of services and its culture than itdoes on its goods The Blair government has invested its prestige in the domebecause it sees it as an opportunity to convey this new social and economicreality            Peter Mandelson the Cabinetmember in charge of the millennium project was lampooned for traveling toDisney World in search of ideas But an excess of popular appeal is less likelythan an overinfusion of centrist political ideology Blair loves to say that hesees Britain as a dynamic forwardlooking and multicultural societyLaborites talk unblushingly about rebranding the country To New Labor thedome is a great marketing opportunity Which makes it in a way an authenticexpression of the spirit of the age
