        thats it     yes   what do you think are possible changes in the uh the way trials are conducted these days do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh we have no way of knowing whether theyre legitimately right or wrong so forth   yeah   what do you think about these things   well as i look at our trial systems i think theyve gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials and theyve taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage i think that a jury should listen to the court uh to to the hearings and to everything but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision i think the judge should hold the fifty or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other   you youre so youre saying you you think the judge should actually have the final say   i think he should and i think that there should be more than one judge there should be maybe two       at least that sit in and listen so that theres no way that you could have   hum   like a crooked judge do you know what i mean   yes i know what you mean   um and i think that there its important to have a jury but i think the way that they go through so much time to get a a fair one thats okay too as long as its not used to delay the trial so much they need to have a fair jury but they only would you know would cover fifty forty nine percent of the decision or fifty percent and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision   well   how do you feel about that   i hadnt uh thought of it from that point of view before i have been in a fairly important trial and uh what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand   right   what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision thats the part that bothered me about it um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether theyre guilty or not but i also think that the jury should be uh very very uh carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate accurate decisions   right   i hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and dont know much about any of this stuff and and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time thats no way to make a decision on some terrible problem   right right well what if they used you know i just had a thought come as you were talking what if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials   that would be certainly nice shit lets say we we would have fifty percent of them law students at any rate yeah yeah   yeah at least at least on the jury and that would give them experience in the courtroom and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major     umhum thats a very neat idea and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial   right thats right that would be a really good thing to do   that would be a a really good thing to do   i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial   so thats hum   and what happened was her husband was um involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stop light and ran into the motorcycle   um   but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle he was just taking it home from the place it was brand new and his brakes did not work   for goodness sakes   and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened   umhum   and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen   oh they saw the husband get   thats right they were following him home from the motorcycle shop   yeah   and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other every time shed get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement   theyd find something wrong with it   until finally they won and said that it was the drunk drivers fault and she would have to sue him   did they really uhhuh   which i would think it would be some his fault but i just felt like justice wasnt served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didnt   that is a shame youd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife   right   to to also uh make statements and they have nothing to gain one way or the other so if they say a certain way then why not believe them   right and i dont know all the details on that but i certainly think that weve come up with a good idea with the the student the students coming into the jury   yeah   and i dont think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didnt have the final say   umhum
