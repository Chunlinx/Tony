                                 When Motley Fool Speaks Some People Listen                        The Internet has become such a central part of both the US economy and theAmerican cultural landscape that its easy to imagine that a real convergencebetween the offline and online worlds has happened particularly when it comesto the media world But the truth seems to be that for a lot of the offlinepress and for much of Wall Street what happens on the Internet is stilleither something of a mystery or almost by definition too sketchy to takeseriously            Take the case of Celera Genomics a biotech company that offers informationfrom its genetic databases to drug makers Since the close of trading on Dec Celeras share price has risen from  to  or better than  percentThe companys trading volume has skyrocketed as well Just  sharestraded on the  th  while  million changed hands on the th  and the stock has had volume of a million shares or betterevery day since then Well technically on the  rd only shares traded but thats pretty close to a million The stock leapt  pointson the  th   points on the  th  and  points on thest fell back a little on the  nd  and then bounced further aheadon the next two days            Even by the standards of this wacky momentumdriven market thats animpressive and really surprising move and it did not go unnoticed by eitherthe New York Stock Exchange or eventually by the financial press On Dec for instance the NYSE asked Celera itself whether it knew of any reason forthe sudden spike in its stock and the company said sensibly enough that itdid not comment on its stock price Three days later the NYSE had to declarean order imbalance at the open because there were too many buy orders and notenough sell orders on the books And Bloomberg and Reuters both ran pieces onCeleras ascent            The odd thing though is that no one has actually reported what happenedBloomberg for instance blithely attributed the runup to increasedenthusiasm for genetic information companies and for incorporating genomicresearch into drug development As for why that enthusiasm suddenly hitinvestors with such force and why it was so focused on Celera all Bloombergcould offer was an article that appeared in the New York Times on Dec which included a oneline reference to Celera Bloomberg quoted an analystwith Banc Boston Robertson Stephens who confidently said The New YorkTimes article would be the trigger today Reuters meanwhile came to thestory yesterday including Celera in a broader piece about a boom in biotechstocks a boom that weirdly enough it suggested began about  days ago onthe  th             What everyone appears to have missed is that on the evening of Dec  theMotley Fool an onlineinvestment community with more than  million unique visitors a month and myformer employer announced that it would be adding Celera to its RuleBreakerPortfolio in the next five days The Fools announce all their buys in advanceof actually making the purchase in order not to frontrun the stock The verynext day Friday volume in Celera was  times higher than it had been onThursday and the stocks dramatic rise was under way Its probably true thatall the stocks rise cant be attributed to the Fools influence especiallysince Celera did announce an important acquisition on Dec  But its alsotrue that many more investors are now paying attention to Celera than werebefore the RuleBreaker buy and that now includes lots of people who havenever even visited the Fool site            Whether you think this is a good thing or a bad thing probably depends onwhat you think of the Internets impact on financial markets I think a goodargument can be made that in this case what youre looking at is not aspeculative bubble but rather an example of potentially valuableinformationnot the RuleBreaker Portfolios decision to buy but itsexplanation of why it was buyingbeing disseminated to a much wider audiencethan would once have had access to it But the really interesting thing is thealmost complete obliviousness of the offline media to what actually happenedand the forced nature of their explanations for Celeras rise You didnt evento have to work hard to find out about the addition of Celera to the portfoliosince the Fool put out a news release announcing it Call it willful blindnessthen Apparently the Net still has a ways to go before the offline press canreally take it seriously
