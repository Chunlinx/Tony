                                 Test Patterns            The New York Times leads with theFBIs announcement last night that its director Louis Freeh supports anoutside investigation into the FBIs failure to disclose the use of incendiarydevices at Waco a development nobody else fronts The Los AngelesTimes leads with what it claims is alarm among education advocatesas opposed to the rest of us about continuing SAT disparities between whitesand nonwhites in the latest board score data released Tuesday The Washington Post leads local the Virginia governorshighway and rail expansion plans and

         The headline over the LATs SATlead cites an ethnic gap and refers to the worry that schools are failingto prepare nonwhites But the story itself never mentions the SAT performanceof Asians an omission that is stunning given Southern Californiasdemographics and that lends false credibility to the stark picture the paperpaints False because as a graphic accompanying the story indicates Asianshave the highest math SATs and the secondhighest verbal The WP storymakes the same elision mentioning Asians only once in passing and nevermentioning their scores The WSJ also mentions Asians only once inpassing but does mention their scores            Also the stories fail to establish any sense of context that would justifyconcerns over the differences in scores they report For instance theLAT notes that nationally scores for whites rose one point from theyear before while blacks and Mexican Americans were each down four points inmath but there is no discussion of what a standard deviation would be onsamples of SAT scores Since test scores are known by college counselors andadmissions officials to often vary dozens and dozens of points from onetesttaking to the next by the same student surely a few points cant be thestuff of crisis Or if it is at least the papers need to argue the pointSimilarly the LAT says the national verbal score remained mired at But wasnt the idea behind the recentering of a few years ago preciselyto put the median score as close as possible to  The NYTs SAT piecehardly mentions the ethnic angle at all dwelling much more on differencesbetween boys and girls scores and in the online version at least sitsunder a refreshingly calm headline College Board Scores Vary Little FromPrevious Years            The NYTs Waco lead also mentions that a House committee thats starting itsown investigation is said to be interested in what role the Armys Delta Forcemay have played in the operation It would have been nice if the story had saidsomething
