                     OK         This is David Emrich and he also grew up in Philadelphia and hes lived in Charlotte for is it almost three years         Is that right                     Three years                     Um and Ill ask you the same questions as well         When you were growing up do you remember reading a book that uh you particularly liked and you remember or do you remember someone reading you a book that you particularly liked                     See         When I was growing up the books I remember the most of were like The Hardy Boys Mysteries and Frank Swift and those kind of really um you know just serial serializations of books and those were the books that I remember first         I dont remember any specific mysteries or anything like that I just remember reading         dozens of them really until I was probably seven or eight years old                     Is there any particular reasons why you chose those books to read over others                     I think that I was given them as a gift         The other because I would and they kept giving me gifts of books because they knew knew I liked to read         And they were it would it would generally be series and like for example I remember now I now I recall uh Id gotten a series uh theyd come in box sets at Christmas and theyd be paperbox paperbacks in a box with a eight or ten books in them         And I remember reading like uh I remember reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries this way and I remember reading books by JRR         Tolkien uh you know Lord of the Rings         and you know all those books the same way         So I guess that these were the I mean my parents knew I liked to read and I would always for Christmas or my birthdays or or um you know anytime         a gift was appropriate         These were the kind of gifts that I would get         I would get other gifts of course but not only also get something like this every year                              Were I mean obviously your parents thought reading was important because theyd give you books because they knew you liked to read         Did they like when you were younger maybe you couldnt read did they ever read anything to you that you remember                     Hum                  No I dont recall anything like that it doesnt mean it didnt happen         It just means I dont recall it                     Hum         Um         did as you got older did they types of book change         Did you still like mystery type books                     As I got older                  Lets see                     You know ten eleven or twelve                     By the time I got to be ten eleven or twelve I mean I remember I would read the books that were assigned in school and I really like those like you know the seventh grade readers usually that John Knowles A Separate Peace I remember reading that and it was very good and I remember reading um um Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding which was was the type of book that was assigned then         Um even then I used to like to read histories         I remember reading very specifically uh uh history of the German rocketry program during WWII that reading you know                                                               I was just         a thirteen or fourteen year old boy         Uh I remember actually I remember reading a book it was on the best seller list at the time it was uh it was probably written in the late seventies and it was called The Third World War and it was it was uh it was written as if it were factual but it was uh um sort of a fictionalized account of what of a of a potential third world war and I remember the funny thing I remember was I read this book like after it was probably  or  and the war took place according to this book in like  or          I wouldnt say I lived in dread but I always a little afraid of that year                                                               That this was the year that these these events would come true and that there would be a Third World War         In fact I remember it was seventh grade                  I remember because in this particular book the Soviet Union at that point had used um nuclear weapons against Birmingham England um and I had uh and thats what caused their coalition to unravel because none of the coalition partners wanted any part of that and that was what eventually caused them to lose the war         But I remember doing a creative writing piece for a seventh grade reading class um where I invented a series of newspaper articles surrounding that particular event         The fact that the Soviet Union had launched nuclear attacks various parts various uh you know cities around the world                     So you used what you had read to actually you you wrote about things youd actually read                     Yeah Id                     Created your own writing system                     Actually what I did was I imagined that this was that I was a news reporter writing for the New York Times or whatever                     Hum                     And I you know made up a big headline you know Such And Such a City Destroyed you know give a byline you know give a date and time and then just start writing what I what I thought were journalistic articles at that point about that event event which I had read about in a book which I had imagined                     Hum                     Umhum                     Um did do you remember any particular stories that were told to you when you were a child                     Well ah I dont remember my parents reading anything I do remember being in grade school and being in the library and the librarian reading James and the Giant Peach to us         And we would go to I forget how often wed go to library like you know maybe it was once a week maybe it was three times a week but everytime wed go wed all sit on the rug wed sit Indian style crosslegged and uh Im sure its very politically incorrect at this point but the librarian could never say that today         Um and then she would read us you know chapter at a time of James and the Giant Peach                     Did you look forward to reading or hearing her read James and the Giant Peach                     Yeah sure did I think think I enjoyed James and the Giant Peach                     Hum                     In fact I remember a few years ago they made a movie of it and I thought I ought to go see that but I guess it didnt do so well and it fizzled and I never saw it no                     Hum         Do ever go back and reread the things that you read when you were younger now                     Uh                     Maybe not now but you know within the last four or five years                     Right         I dont re remember rereading anything         Besides um things like you know first off what I mentioned before it would it could be adult reading like um A Separate Peace or Lord of the Flies I remember rereading those in college just because I wanted to reread them         Um but I dont I dont remember rereading anything that I read when I was a kid that that I that I reread as an adult                              OK                  Um         Do you like now um I asked Megan the same question but now do you are there any family stories that you either remember or you like think are bizarre or you know would like to hear again                                       Well I mean I dont think that uh my family generally doesnt sit around telling stories about what people did years ago or that kind of thing years ago there is one event I remember um no I mean theres a few things a few things I remember or have memories of but it isnt like anyone sits around telling stories about them         Certainly the memory I have is different than the stories that that uh         the family swaps around the table or anything like that                              So like you remember specific events                              I remember general things I remember one time we were at the shore my fam my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember um you know we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and you know and we we doubletied the awning down         During the hurricane wed go out and check to make sure that uh uh you know all the strings were still tied and the awning wasnt going to blow away but I dont remember you now I dont think wed sit around and telling that story I mean I occasionally mention that         Do you remember         Does anyone remember that story         That that kind of thing that                     You dont elaborate on it much                              No no but I remember it like um most of my memories of of childhood memories I guess were were of that beach house and you know my grandmother and my mother and my sisters would stay there during the week and then on the weekend the men would come down like the men meaning my grandfather and my father and that kind of thing                     Um hum                              But I dont remember we we dont generally sit around and swapping stories about it I mean we just         last week we were at the whole family again went to this time a North Carolina beach         My Mom rented a house there and we you know I think at that point just because you know being at the beach I remember things and I would say You remember when we used to do this or that and the other thing and         We talked about some other things then but it wasnt like we sat around telling hilarious tales and laughing over dinner and things like that                              OK         Thank you very much                     Well youre welcome very much
