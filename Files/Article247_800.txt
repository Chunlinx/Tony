WP goeswith the Senates apparently growing enthusiasm for censuring President Clintonrather than conducting a fullblown impeachment trial USAT followsup its SaltLake City Olympics probe lead from yesterday with the news that federalinvestigators are broadening their inquiry to include possible tax fraudcharges against the Utah citys Olympic organizers for allegedly usingtaxexempt funds to purchase lavish gifts and other favors for relatives ofInternational Olympic Committee members The NYTs top nonlocal story claimsthat a recent US effort to help Mexicos armed forces defeat drug smugglersis in a shambles souring relations between the two countries The helicopters the US donated to Mexican drug forces have been plagued withmechanical problems the paper says and angry Mexican generals have sharplycut back on the number of troops they will commit to the program And says theTimes  citing US intelligence drug flights into Mexico ceased in late shortly that is after the start of the vexed programwith smugglersputting their loads on container ships instead The story gives a little toomuch free play to the suggestions of various US officials that the root ofthe problem lies

sanctions with noindication that they will bring him down or to heel any time soon has led todisenchantment in Western Europe Russia and Turkey concerning their continuedadvisability On the other hand the US is emerging from Desert Fox ascommitted as ever to sanctions The paper quotes a senior State Dept officialsaying that ifas seems likelyIraq chooses to end its cooperation with UNweapons inspectors it has literally chosen for sanctions in perpetuity            The WP  on the strength of interviews with senators and staffersclaims there is a general consensus that a Senate trial will
