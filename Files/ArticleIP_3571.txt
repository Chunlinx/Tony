become embroiled in thepresidential scandal Not publicly of course but among my circle offriends                                       Although I am not awagering sort I foolishly made a bet with a friend before the presidentsfirst apology I insisted that he would not come forth with a public meaculpa  My friend insisted that he would After some heated discussion weagreed to place a  wager on the whole sordid mess thus adding five moredollars to the  million cost                                       Now that the presidenthas spoken I am in a terrible quandary I am a lawabiding honorable decentcitizen and I stand by my responsibilities and my debts But the question isWhat is my debt Was that speech a mea culpa  I say No My friendsays Yes I have thought of a Solomonic approach in which I would send to my friend and he would send  to me but I am also a principled personand it is my view that this was no mea culpa and I am backed by manycommentators such as Mike Kelly who said in the Washington Post  Thisspeech wasnt a mea culpa  It was an everybodyelseculpa                                        I do not want to seemcheap but if one parsed that speech perhaps one might settle on it beingonetwentieth of a mea culpa  I would then owe my friend  cents Isthere any way at all that you can help me do the right honorable andprincipled thing here                                       You bethe judge                                       Heads orTails                        DearHeads            Prudie is not a bettingparlor but she sympathizes with you having had her own doubts about thatspeech Since there is disputation about what exactly got said and your betwas with a friend Prudie suggests the two of you go out to lunchDutchanddevote some of the luncheon conversation to the sad and shabby affair            You areright that there was no obvious winner in your wagernot you your friend oreven alas the president And by the by Prudie could not help thinking thathad Mr Clinton waited  hours to give that speech it might have been quitedifferent            Prudiecompromisingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have a loving daughterbeautiful intelligent but not always selfassured She has been living witha musician for nine years She is  a schoolteacher and working on hermasters He is a popular trumpet player with his own band                                       Here ismy question Im worried about my lovely daughters future though thats herbusiness I keep my mouth shut But when it comes to occasions such as hisbirthday or Christmas am I supposed to just send a card or do I treat himlike my other sons and send a gift                                       G in Arizona                        Dear G            Goodness nine years islonger than Prudies marriage to her starter husband so the young peoplecertainly sound committed to each another The problem Prudie divines is notthat you dont care for the young man but that you wish the children weremarried Try to put your parental concern aside since  you dont get a voteand  marriage isnt for everyone            Since theyoung man with a horn is your daughters spouse equivalent by all means treathim as a son or a proper inlaw Who knows The family feeling may have apositive effect            Prudie hopefully                                             DearPrudence                                                      I need some ideas Im ayearold man and I just moved to a new city and a new job Im havingdifficulty meeting women One might wonder how thats possible given theplethora of meeting places most big cities offer my age group but my troublesare twofold First I dont drink dont like the taste or thefuzzyheadedness and second I cant stand loud music I dont mind otherpeople drinking thoughits not a moral thing And I tend to cough whenconfronted with cigarette smoke                                       Anyway Ive tried bookstores without any luck and the average patrons ageat the local dance studio is about twice mine Churches and the like are outtoo since my atheism probably wouldnt go over too well at such functions Doyou have any ideas for me Do I have to start drinking believing and packingAdvil for the music headaches                                       Clueless in theCapital                        DearClue            Do not start hittingthe bottle for starters If the need arises to order a drink try Prudiesfavorite cranberry juice and soda in a wine glass Also hang in there withyour boycott of deafnessinducing music The only people you would find thereanyway are those whose musical taste would clash with your own            You alsoneed not find religion or feign it to meet women Simply get out and aboutTry affinity groups classes volunteer groups of interest to you singlesnights at the supermarket etc And dont neglect to put out the word tofriends and coworkers that youre available A yearold man who is ateetotaler and appreciator of good music sounds very desirable for a youngwoman of taste And dont dismiss the fact that the numbers are in your favorWashington DC has more women than men for reasons unknown to Prudie Goodluck            Prudiesocially                                             DearPrudence                                                      I keepon wondering about the presidents current situation Why would anyone beinterested if the president had an affair I could not care less what he doesin his personal life I know he has plunged himself in deep waters forcommitting perjurythat does interest mebut why does everyone make such afuss about his affair with silly Monica Lewinsky anyway She is a grownupthey knew what they were doing it was certainly not harassment Please help meclear up my thoughts                                       Confused Mone FromMexico                        DearCon            Well as to why anyone wouldbe interested perhaps its an American thing For whatever reason we areunlike Europeansand apparently Mexicansalways interested in the sex livesof the famous Maybe this is none of our business but thats probably why weare interested            Prudie suspects the Lewinskysituation became wildly interesting for the following reasons She was near theage of the Clintons daughter she was a lowlevel employee she was notlooking for financial gain she was er Rubenesque and she was a source ofinterest to the president for a relatively long time And you are right Itcertainly was not harassment            Remembertoo that one of this presidents defining characteristics is his Hot Springsgene the one that impels him to chase skirts A fitting coat of arms forWilliam Jefferson Clinton might carry the legend veni vidi vice  Icame I saw I partied            Prudieregretfully
