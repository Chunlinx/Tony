        FROMDave Zimny                           DATE Mon Sept             The heart of Edelsteinsnegative assessment and rank seems to be a negative word indeed to summarizea movie that draws a great deal of praise in the course of the review seems tobe his assertion that American Beauty is                            Sayingthat our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachmentwhereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and asignpost to a Higher Power But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not askhow it got that wayor if theres anyone nearby with a gun who might want toadd to the body countstrikes me as either moronic or insane or both The kindof detachment the movie is peddling isnt artistic it isnt lifeitsnihilism at its most fatuous In the end American Beauty is New AgeNihilism                        I suggest that MrEdelstein take a closer look at the end of the movie He might notice that ONLYRicky Fitts a seriously damaged character is shown regarding the body withaesthetic detachment The daughter is frozen in fear when she enters the roomLesters wife who also apparently sees the body is consumed with horror andrevulsion at her own murderous intentions Other characters are only shownreacting to the sound of the gunshot Nor does the film suggest that Lestershares Rickys world view The montage of Lesters memories at the end of thefilm is hardly nihilistic He remembers the closest relationships in his pastlife with wonder and gratitude At the moment of his death he is lookinglovingly at a photograph of his former self and his young family not at aplastic bag whirling in the wind            In short I see no evidence that the filmmakerswanted to endorse Rickys nihilistic detachment As a matter of fact his eerieselfpossession is depicted as a tragic dislocation from life itself apitiable response to his fathers brutality Edelstein a critic of unusualsensitivity and sophistication simply fails to realize that the makers ofAmerican Beauty show an appreciation of moral and ethical complexity thatequals his own            I hope he willreconsider his harsh conclusion            Torespond click

                  DATE Fri Sept             There is a huge difference between a fastmovingexperimental science and a more theoretical field In molecular biology whichI know best the editorial process is nothing like that described foreconomics An article cannot take more than several months to transit fromfirst writing until publication or it will be completely out of date as thereare a half dozen groups working on closely related experiments who will havereported their results Moreover new information is new it does not have toknock over a theoretical predisposition to be news and thus publishable            In the clinical literature this kind ofexamination of hypothesis confirmation is fairly common and there iscertainly some wobble A series of clinical trials can reach differentconclusions and a metaanalysis that pools information from multiple trialscan lead to a conclusion different from a large definitive clinical trialBut thats a signal for further empiricism not a theoretical point that thereis no way to get better evidence or improve certainty that one is rightThere is certainly publication bias in that the probability of publication ishigher for positive results improved clinical outcome for example than noresults            But what has this got todo with Alan Sokal I cant make the leap from a largely rhetorical field ofanalysis to experimental fields that report new data The line of argumentseems to be that since hypotheses in academic economics have not been confirmedmeans that the same would be true for all fields whether theoretical orexperimental and therefore fields that rest on empirical evidence must becastles in the sky The analogies are not strong enough to allow leaps of faiththat long            Torespond

  DATE Thu Sept             An interesting phenomenon related to that discussedin Steven Landsburgs article concerns the truth of hypotheses published inscientific journals that are then reported in daily newspapers weekly newsmagazines and discussed on television news shows Although I dont have anysystematic data on this I suspect that the trend that Landsburg describeswould be amplified in the following way if you read in the newspaper about atheory that has been published in a prestigious scientific journal it is evenmore likely to be wrong than an article that is published in a prestigiousscientific journal that is not widely reported Reporters and editors decidewhat hypotheses are newsworthy and likely to evoke interest in their readersand for the same reasons discussed in Landsburgs article this selectioncriteria are not especially effective at selecting the true scientifichypothesis            An example of this can be seen in the scientificresearch program that I discuss in my book The Mismeasure of Desire TheScience Theory and Ethics of Sexual Orientation Oxford University Press Three studies concerning the origins of male homosexuality done in thelast decade garnered a great deal of attention in the media LeVaysneuroanatomical study Hamers genetic study and Bailey and Pillards twinstudies Together the three have been widely understood as establishing thatsexual orientation is genetically determined However LeVays study was doneon a small and perhaps atypical sample and it has not be replicated Hamersstudy has been disconfirmed by other labs and Baileys latest and moresystematic twin study undermines his early ones Although the original studiesreceived a great deal of attention and are widely accepted the seriousproblems with them have not been discussed in the media            Although it is easier todisconfirm a hypothesis than to establish one disconfirmations are much lesslikely to be deemed newsworthy Readers of media reports of
