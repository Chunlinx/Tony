                                 Reading Safires Mind                            Its been five years offrustration but I think Ive finally got Elvis by the short and curlies Itsa tangled Web that POTUS has been weaving around his crony Hubbell Now hisspin has spun out of control What everybody thinks and nobody can print isthat the president got his Asian associates to pony up lest a pinched pal feelthe urge to sing to Starr No evidence but no matter Ill read Bills mindand baptize the story hushgate Who knows what didnt happen If Im guessingright theres another Pulitzer in it for me If not bygones will soon gobyebye and Ill still make Bibis day Clinton has been squeezing thesettlements a bit too hard lately                        WilliamSafire might complain that this attempt at insight into his thinking isgrotesquely unjust After all I dont know that Safire recognizes theunfairness of the accusations he flings around with such abandon in his columnI cant prove that he is motivated by the quest for fame and power rather thanthe desire to get at the truth I dont even truly believe that he sticks upfor the Likud Party out of personal loyalty to the Israeli prime ministerrather than genuine conviction But I could pass off all that maliciousinnuendo as fact and still remain within the boundaries Safire sets forhimself in his twiceweekly Essay column in the New York Times             The least defensible of Safires columns are hisintermittent efforts at Reading Bills Mind In the latest of these whichappeared May  Safire projected a view inside the criminal consciousness ofthe president of the United States Just when I should feel terrific about myeconomic boom making possible my budget deal I can feel the damn prosecutorsclosing in the column began My main vulnerability Dave Kendall tells meis arranging for that half million in hush money to Web Hubbell Even forSafire the passage and the column were extraordinary Under cover of hisfavorite literary devicetemporarily being someone elseSafire was accusingthe president of active involvement in an effort to obstruct justiceanimpeachable indictable offense            Thischarge couldnt have appeared anywhere else in the Times  Absent somekind of evidence the reporters on the national staff who have been coveringthe Clinton scandals can only say that prosecutors and congressionalinvestigators are exploring the possibility that Clinton might have had somerole in arranging Hubbells postemployment benefits package Even Safiresfellow opinion columnists wouldnt dare leap to his conclusion They mightargue as AM Rosenthal did in an unusually good column a few days afterSafires that Clintons version of events doesnt add up and that there arestrong grounds for suspicion about the serendipitous help Hubbell got Butaccusing someone even the president of a crime without evidence crosses adivide that is usually observed even in oped landthe line separatingplausible opinion from pure speculation            Safire gets away with sliming Clinton byartfully exploiting his status as hybrid reportercolumnist Unlike RosenthalAnthony Lewis and other traditional oped page writers Safire doesactualand sometimes extensivereporting He has even been known touse how shall we say it strong incentives to encourage highly placedofficials to leak to him What he writes carries the implication that he knowsthanks to his inside tipsters that which will soon come to light But withincreasing frequency Safire has been abusing the privileges he grantshimself            Lets look closely at therest of that mindreading column Easy to say now that the coverup is alwaysworse than the crime the interior ClintonSafire monologue continues Butwhat were we going to do in  Let Web twist in the wind Abandon him tothat sumbitch Starr until he started talking about our use of hisfatherinlaw as a front about the Rose files in his basement about whatVince Foster had been working on            Webought three solid years and a reelection by getting our friends to takecare of Web            The welter of innuendo here is so thick that one can hardlypeer through it Safire is saying that in  Clinton had committed a varietyof crimes that would if they had been brought to light have prevented hisreelection Hubbell he suggests knew about all of them and so had to bekept quiet with bribes But what crimes might Hubbell have kept to himselfOnly Whitewater buffs will have any idea in this paragraph But those whofollow this stuff should recognize that like the theory Clinton arranged hushmoney for Hubbell Safires hints about what got hushed up are pure conjectureLater in the column Safire does some more thinking on behalf of the presidentMy stonewalling just has to work past the  elections Then I can finish outmy term and pardon everybody including me on the way to Als inauguration            The key to Safires deeper purpose is hispromiscuous use of terms like coverup stonewall hush money twist inthe wind hang tough and pardon This is the lingo of Watergate an eventthat remains at the center of Safires consciousness As a Nixon speechwriterfrom  until  Safire managed to avoid being dragged into the scandalthat ruined the careers of almost everyone he worked with But after he joinedthe Times in  Safire took it as his mission to exculpate Nixon andhis henchmen While the Watergate story was still breaking Safire focused ondirty tricks by JFK and LBJ to try to demonstrate that what Nixon had done wasno worse than what previous presidents had done In fact he has been tryingever since to prove that they all do it            TheCarter years were represented in Safires column by a series of associativewordplaysBillygate Waterquiddick peanutgate Koreagate andmostsignificantlyLancegate Safire won a Pulitzer in  for helping to forcethe resignation of Carter adviser Bert Lance in a scandal no one muchremembers In his excellent book Watergate in American Memory  MichaelSchudson well describes Safires efforts to WatergateizeCarteradministration scandals The interesting point that emerged subsequentlywas that the conservative Safire wasnt just using the Watergate comparison tobash Democrats He wasand weirdly enough still iswriting principally as aNixon apologist aiming to trivialize Watergate itself            Though he is a graceful writer and a skilled reporter andhas a sharp mind Safire is hitting with a corked bat No one should be angrierabout this than Stephen Labaton Jeff Gerth and Safires other colleagues atthe Times who have patiently pursued the Clinton scandals in a carefulway Safires journalistic cheating undermines their professional work Backduring the first term when Safire called the first lady a congenital liarhis hyperbole overshadowed the fibs Hillary Rodham Clinton was accused oftelling The weight of the Times is such that unfairness anywhere in thepaper casts a shadow over legitimate stories that appear elsewhere                           I know I know But theold dogs been at it going on  years Cant ask him to learn a newtrick
