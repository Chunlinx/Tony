        you have any pets   yes do you have do i have pets yes i have a cat and i have two dogs   yeah two dogs what kind   i have a Schnauzer and i have a Sheltie   Schnauzers is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer   it its a miniature umhum hm   uh im going into all this because i used to work i just got done working at a pet shop actually   oh okay well the Schnauzer im im watching for one of uh the managers where i work and hes been transferred to Germany for a while   yeah uh   and im taking care of his dog and uh and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says well my dog doesnt like cats and i said well we wont tell him its a cat we wont tell her its a cat           because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens they just are fascinated   yeah oh yeah   so she doesnt know that this is a cat yet  and they get along real good i said if Tom could see his dog lick this kitty hed flip  so that was interesting   thats good they say didnt expect that would happen yeah thats cool thats nice um lets see what was the other dog you had   its a Sheltie shes real sweet sweet little dog shes got a very nice temperament uh theyre not as aggressive as a Schnauzer you know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive   oh a Sheltie yeah they can be nippy   umhum   yeah Shelties are nice everybody seems to be really happy with them theyre good temperament   theyre a good temperament and they   they put up with a lot   and they just uh  i think they have a good head on their shoulders i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that ive encountered   Schnauzers in particular probably   well yeah but also some poodles uh theyre kind of um there are some smart ones out there but theres some also some uh not so smart ones  i   oh yeah yeah i get it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are   yeah that thats maybe thats theres uh some credence in that statement   yeah theyre theyre bred down so much its   umhum   they arent the best pets   i id i really dont know what the best pet is i guess its up to the individual and how they relate to their animal   yeah yeah i mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such   hm and Bulldogs  but i dont know about these uh these um uh these Pinschers these no what are they called Pit Bulls Pit Bulls that are so vicious     pit bull oh theyre nice theyre actually very friendly dogs   are they really i dont think ive ever seen one   uh theyre really nice i i have dealt with quite a few of them people uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me to like they uh  fit collars and stuff on them and theyre theyre just really nice really friendly um kind of like medium intelligence um   well how do they becomes well how did they get their reputation then     well because some people um want to train them as   oh they train them to be that way then oh okay   yeah you really cant get a pit bull from birth thats that way yeah it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond   oh okay oh dear so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection oh dear   right yeah they arent they arent by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them going its not good to   umhum   to deal with but they i i really like them i was i was impressed by them theyre theyre real sturdy little critters and they arent that big and uh just really friendly   umhum well thats unusual i was huh well i suppose you were surprised   i was i was overwhelmed yeah uh right now   after the reputation that you know they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know   they picked up a lot of bad press lately   yeah theyre banned from in some areas i understand umhum   well yeah but any any  any pets gonna can can be bad if you train it to be that way   you know that they must have just targeted that breed and said boy were gonna   well yeah its when in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets   oh okay   because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a kid a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild   oh okay uhhuh uhhuh   and you know they should expect something like that to happen and so basically now its like ferrets are outlawed in the town   uh oh did it attack the child then   yeah it it bit him   uhhuh   and that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was fairly it was a fairly wild ferret and they hadnt   well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that   yeah i they really shouldve shouldve expected it and taken the precautions they didnt its too bad it happened though   none um sure yeah yeah because then the the the animals in trouble and not the person   right
