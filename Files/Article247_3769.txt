                                 Reagan for Dummies                        Dear Alan            How I want to like Edmund Morris How much I havelooked forward to his book on Reagan Ive heard Morris speak twice at theAmerican Enterprise Institute where I work He is urbane and sophisticatedand the model of gentlemanliness and charm When I enrolled at Dartmouth as aforeign student from India I met professors who exuded learning and grace andwit I wanted to be like that Edmund Morris is one of them And let me becandid Ronald Reagan is not Yet frankness also compels me to acknowledgethat at the end of the day Reagan succeeded in his great enterprise andMorris failed Reagan was an ordinary man who became an extraordinary leaderMorris is an educated man who has written a profoundly foolish book            One reason Dutch is so disappointing is thatit gives no vivid sense of the situation in America when Reagan was firstelected When Reagan entered the Oval Office the landscape looked dismal bothat home and abroad Inflation was in double digits eroding pension plans andsavings accounts interest rates had reached  percent the highest since theCivil War the Soviet bear was on the prowl having gobbled up  countriesbetween  when South Vietnam fell and  when the Soviets invadedAfghanistan There was an energy crisis with long lines at the pump and talkof gas rationing And who can forget the hostages in Iran held captive bymullahs who denounced America as a great Satan            Reagan promised to bring inflation down and he did Hecut taxes to energize economic growth and after the recession of  theeconomy went into a juggernaut of growth that has still not abated Interestrates fell so that new businesses could get loans and families could buyhouses again Reagan decontrolled gas prices and the energy crisisdisappeared The technological revolution accelerated in part due to theexplosion of venture capital that became available in the s No more realestate fell to the Soviets under Reagans watch Indeed the Soviet empireitself came under unendurable strains and began to collapse The Soviets pulledout of Aghanistan In  the year Reagan left office the Berlin Wall cametumbling down            Not many presidents its safe to say can claim acomparable record of achievement The s have been peaceful and prosperousto be sure but Clinton inherited a growing economy and a global environmentrid of the Soviet menace and open to American multinationals Of courseClinton deserves some plaudits for preserving Reaganism this is his truelegacy but Reagan deserves the lions share of the credit for turning thecountry and the world around Moreover Reagan articulated a moral vision ofwhat it means to be an American that I for one sorely miss in the s            Morris dimly perceives that Reagan is implicated inthese huge events but he has no idea how or why they happened Hence theschizophrenia that is manifest throughout his book Like some of the petulantletterwriters who have been weighing in on our exchange Morris premise seemsto be that Reagan was as Clark Clifford once put it an amiable dunce SoMorris tries to apply the premise to the astonishing turnaround of the sAnd it doesnt fit How could a dunce enjoy the continuous successes thatReagan did Maybe Reagan got lucky once or twice but could luck account forReagans triumphs in the multiple ventures he pursued and the multiple policieshe enacted Did luck account for how Reagan got elected governor of Californiaand then reelected After Reagan became president is luck the true reasonthat the seemingly invincible inflation dragon was slain Reagan wanted a worldin which the market not the government runs the economy by the time he leftoffice such a world was in the making more luck            Morris knows this is ridiculous but he cannot figureit out he becomes confused He goes into a long depression He suffers fromwriters block Then he solves the riddle Reagan was a dunce with incredibleimagination and will Never once does Morris question his premise What ifReagan was not the dummy that his critics made him out to be What if Reaganwas intelligent and perceptive far more imaginative than all his critics puttogether infinitely more resourceful in implementing his agenda eerilyindifferent to much of the acrimony and pettiness around him resolute andfarsighted in keeping his eye on the long ball of history            Suddenly the events of the s make sense Reagan didthem Morris senses Reagans involvement but he does not understand it Hecompares Reagan to a glacier that carved a deep valley But he is too captiveto his original dummy hypothesis to question it and abandon it when it doesnot fit the facts This is why despite his strenuous efforts Morris finallyfails to make sense of Reagan and the effects of Reaganism            The people around Reagan like Michael Deaver whopicked Morris seem to have assumed that because Morris admired a ruggedoutdoorsman like Teddy Roosevelt the subject of Morris previous book Morriswould also like Reagan But TR was an intellectual and a polymath He invitedzoologists to the White House to discuss the fine points of botany TR waswellbred and selfconscious He wrote books and quoted poetry By contrastRR was a simple guy selfmade with ordinary interests and no intellectualpretensions Visit the Reagan ranch near Santa Barbara recently purchased bythe Young Americas Foundation and look over Reagans bookshelf No Plutarchno Shakespeare not even Whitman or Frost just Louis LAmour westerns andbooks about horses and copies of Arizona Highways Morris who fancies himself a cultural sophisticate is obviously appalled Hissuspicions about Reagan are confirmed Reagan strikes him as a brainless yahooAnd so Morris finds himself set on his disastrous course that takes up a decadeand a half of his life ruins his reputation and does a grave injustice toReagan and to history
