for New Gasoline SparkIgnition MarineEngines Exemptions for New Nonroad CompressionIgnition Engines ator above  Kilowatts and New Nonroad SparkIgnition Engines at orBelow  KilowattsPursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a major rule promulgated by EnvironmentalProtection Agency entitled Control of Air Pollution Final Rulefor New Gasoline SparkIgnition Marine Engines Exemptions for NewNonroad CompressionIgnition Engines at or above  Kilowatts andNew Nonroad SparkIgnition Engines at or Below  Kilowatts RINAE We received the rule on September   It waspublished in the Federal Register as a final rule on October   Fed Reg The rule regulates exhaust emissions from new sparkignitionSI gasoline marine engines including outboard engines personalwatercraft engines and jet boat engines beginning with the model year and the rule is fully phasedin by the  model yearThe regulation of these emissions became necessary under sectiona of the Clean Air Act as amended when EPA found thatthese nonroad engines were significant contributors to ozone orcarbon monoxide concentrations in more than one nonattainment areaA nonattainment area is aGAOOGCspecified area that has failed to attain the applicable NationalAmbient Air Quality Standard for a given pollutant In additionthe rule exempts new nonroad compressionignition engines at orabove  kilowatts and new nonroad sparkignition engines at orbelow  kilowattsEnclosed is our assessment of the Environmental ProtectionAgencys compliance with the procedural steps required by sectionsaBi through iv of title  with respect to the ruleOur review indicates that the Environmental Protection Agencycomplied with the applicable requirementsIf you have any questions about this report please

EXEMPTIONS FOR NEW NONROAD COMPRESSIONIGNITION ENGINES ATOR ABOVE  KILOWATTS AND NEW NONROAD SPARKIGNITION ENGINES AT ORBELOW  KILOWATTS RIN AEi Costbenefit analysisEPA has prepared an analysis of the costs and benefits of therule which is contained in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Theanalysis explains the methodologies and the reasons behind theiruse in arriving at the cost and benefits of the ruleIn achieving the rules goal of a  percent reduction inhydrocarbon emissions by the year  such a reduction will alsocontribute to the reduction of volatile organic compounds and ozonein ozone attainment areas The EPA finds that the benefits of a tons of hydrocarbons reduced per year by the rule more thanoffsets the increase in oxides of nitrogen of  tons per yearwhich will resultThe annualized costs associated with the rule in  willexceed  million which is  percent of the projectedexpenditure on these engines in that year The average increase incost for the engines would be  percent or  per engine Theanalysis contains tables which show the annual cost from  theeffective date of the rule until the year  by which the EPAexpects the entire existing fleet of these engines to have beenreplaced to be  million to  million respectivelyThe costeffectiveness of the rule has been calculated by EPA tobe approximately  per ton of hydrocarbons reducedii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and In the preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  FedReg  EPA concluded that the rule would have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities especially inview of EPAs implementation of the Act which considers any impacta significant impactGAOOGCHowever in the preamble to the final rule EPA has nowdetermined that the rule will not have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities This change is due to thedeletion from the rule of the regulation of stern drive and inboardengines which are mainly manufactured by small entities EPAbelieves that at most there are only two firms which manufactureoutboard or personal watercraft and jetboat engines that qualify assmall entitiesEPA notes in the preamble to the final rule that it has reducedthe burdens where possible on these small entities followingconsideration of the comments received EPA states that it hastaken into consideration the potential competitive impact on thesefirms and has eased the burden by permitting averaging emissionsacross product lines reduced production line testing reducedinuse testing simplified certification procedures and allowingmanufacturers to purchase emission credits from the market place asan alternative to employing control technologies to meet thestandardiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  Based on the cost benefit analysis performed by EPA the rulewill not impose an intergovernmental mandate because there are noenforceable duties on State local or tribal governments Howeverthe rule will impose a mandate on the private sector in excess of million in any one yearEPA has prepared both a qualitative and quantitative assessmentof the benefits and costs of the rule in the Regulatory ImpactAnalysisEPA has considered numerous regulatory alternatives to the finalprovisions of the rule which are discussed in the Summary andAnalysis of Comments but has determined that the requirementsexpressed in the final rule constitute the most costeffective andleast burdensome alternative that would meet the mandate of sectiona of the Clean Air Activ Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqInstead of the notice and comment procedures in theAdministrative Procedure Act the EPA promulgated this rule usingthe procedures which have similar notice and comment requirementscontained in section d of the Clean Air Act as amended USC  d The use of these procedures regarding rulespertaining to nonroad engines or vehicles is mandated by sectiondR of the Clean Air ActPage  GAOOGCEPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on November   Fed Reg  requesting comments on the proposed ruleOn February   EPA published a Supplemental Notice ofProposed Rulemaking  Fed Reg  to refine some of theproposals made in the prior notice and to respond to comments whichhad been received In the preamble to the final rule  Fed Reg EPA discusses the changes made in the proposed rule infinalizing the rule and advises that the significant commentsreceived and EPAs responses thereto are available to the public ina Summary and Analysis of Comments documentPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The rule contains information collection requirements which aresubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act EPA originally submittedeight information collection requests ICRs to the Office ofManagement and Budget OMB for approval under the Act inconnection with the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking OMB originallydenied all eight requests but subsequently approved two of therequests EPA has resubmitted all eight requests based on reducedreporting and recordkeeping requirements resulting from changedrequirements in the final rule EPA notes that it has taken stepsto reduce the administrative burden as much as possible and in thefinal rule estimates that the burden for the collection ofinformation under all eight ICRs would average  hours annuallyfor a typical manufacturerThe ICRs contain the information required by the Act includingthe reasons for the collection of the information the type ofinformation and an estimate of the burden imposed on respondentsEPA has solicited comments on the proposed information collectionrequirements to be sent to both EPA and OMB for considerationduring the approval processThe information collection requirements of the rule will not beeffective until OMB approval is obtainedStatutory authorization for the ruleThe EPA has cited sections           and a of the Clean Air Act as amended USC            and a In particular section  of the Act USC   requires the Administrator of EPA to regulateemissions from nonroad engines and vehicles and to issueregulations containing standards applicable to emissions from thesecategories of new nonroad engines and vehiclesExecutive Order No OMB reviewed the rule under Executive Order No  as asignificant regulatory action The Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs of OMB approved thePage  GAOOGCfinal rule as complying with the requirements of the Order basedon the information supplied by EPA including a planned regulatoryaction document describing the reason for the rule and anassessment of the costs and budgetary impact of the rulePage  GAOOGC
