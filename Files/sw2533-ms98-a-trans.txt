          okay um what baseball team are you familiar with   well im only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because i lived up in Boston for a while   really   and um the Mets   oh now come on no Texas Rangers   after that if you asked me that i wouldnt have been able to tell you if that was football or  baseball       really i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but um i understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers i know George Bush threw out the first pitch the other night and it bounced off the ground and that um that i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that in regard that he didnt design the patriot missile system and uh the which was kind of cruel i mean think the the shame that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground i mean golly       how humiliating for a man to do that any man i dont care if youre President   yeah but at the same time i dont know its pretty far to throw that far  i couldnt do it     i know but hes a man come on men know how to do that right   right hes supposed to be able to do that   i know so i felt kind of sorry for him i said oh no that must have been hard on him because hes just a person but um i know his son is a major owner of our team of the team here   oh really i didnt know that   yeah hes like i thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that hes part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because thats all you hear about is if you know about Neal Bush i think is his name see i even know his name because hes on the news a lot and i never hardly watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything   I have yeah and ive been watching uh my husbands French and so if ive been watching the French news when i watch it its incentive speaking of Bush were going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush they that had   uhhuh   a story where he went to visit some little uh elementary school students and stuff did you see that where he the guy asked him for proof of who he was and he showed his license   oh i saw that yeah i want to see your drivers i i i dont i youre not President Bush   i know and i want to see a credit card   i know and he pulled that out that is so funny i heard it on the radio i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but i didnt see it but   it was so funny to see it was a really cute little kid too   thats about my extent of um about baseball i dont know that much about it   well i can tell you that the Mets opened i think two days ago because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game and i couldnt tell you who pitched but they won the Mets won but yeah not my a lot and then somebody else lost   uhhuh uhhuh   did they     maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees but i dont even know if theyre still New York Yankees or the New Jersey yeah   uhhuh thats so stupid that you all have two teams thats really stupid   well but it then then they can have them play against each other   yeah i know   i think its still the New York Yankees you know for some reason i thought they were moving to New Jersey  this is how much i know about baseball   yeah the Texas Rangers they they lost i think   uhhuh   but i know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year we got free tickets because someone at our church one of the deacons at church um parks cars at the Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the uh the places and stuff   uhhuh   and hes their head chauffeur is this funny as theyre parking the cars the valet service   right   yeah he makes good money too doing that youd be shocked i was shocked but anyway someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year   uhhuh   and then the Iranian couldnt he didnt want them so he gave them to Alan and Alan and his Dad had plans that night so they gave them to us so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian   with baseball tickets   valet with baseball tickets and we ended up with them right and so we were walking up and i looked at my husband and i said you know what Kyle   yeah its pretty funny   this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip i bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor and you know we just they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and   wow   left and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because   because theyre fancy seats and stuff   yeah and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up and all this you know i just was there you know like i made it im here you know and uh it was just kind of funny because you know but we got to sit by first base if theyd hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know   i know im always scared of that whenever i go to a game i rarely go but we went last year because       my brother my brother is impossible when um he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff and if theres a game on hes watching it i mean thats all there is to it and hes like glued at the TV   uhhuh uhhuh really oh im glad my husbands not like that   oh im glad my husbands not like that either id kill him  my brothers like that and um       see he goes to a lot of games not a real lot but he tries to go then my father got us some tickets so my brothers wife and my husband and i went last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because you know being a non American   uhhuh uhhuh   you want to see what a baseball game is like and he describes it as you sit there in a crowd and it was nice weather and stuff it wasnt a real problem but you sit there in a crowd and youre waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs  um because we made him try a hot dog you know and things like that and um   thats funny   and um so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time yeah and so youre basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it     you miss the whole thing thats funny   and didnt understand it and it   where is he from in France   um he grew up out well he grew up in Le Ren which is the sort of um oh strip east to west eastern part of France     uhhuh yeah i have a i had a friend in college from Strasbourg   yeah hes not that far he was sort of in between Strasbourg and Paris   uhhuh Paris and my cousin lives in Paris and shes lived there for like oh off and on for twenty years   oh is she still there   uh huh Saint Claude is that sound familiar yeah   because yeah Saint Claude yeah we used to thats one of the um entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city   oh really   and it it it it sits right at the limit   uhhuh   i dont know exactly where she is but um   thats neat yeah she does and they have twelve children   we we met in Paris twelve children oh my God the poor woman   she has twelve children she looks gorgeous no shes gorgeous a nd she just liked having kids and shes thin and i mean all my friends with four or more children are thin i mean im not kidding you   were any of them twins you probably cant afford to eat if you have more than two of them   no you have i have a friend now that has seven and um and theyre all eight and under   uhhuh   or nine and under theyre all real young theyre just really feel like thats what Gods told them to do but theyre not condemning you if you we only have one child you know they dont say they dont put airs on about it or anything which is good because it would be easy im sure for them to do that you know you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it and so im real proud of them because theyre arent really they dont do that at all you go in their bathroom and theres ten tooth brushes in there and i always give her a hard time i go now come on whos toothbrush did you really use this morning   uhhuh but how do they afford to even have the kids uh were expecting our first baby almost any day   uhhuh they live lean for one thing and they tithe and they really believe the Bible says that tithe puts it puts a hole in your money bag we dont honor God with the first portion and so they i think that helps a lot i think thats the key   and   and he like his sales last year he just works a normal job he probably has an income of thirty five thousand but last year he made one sale that got him a bonus of twenty five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van   uhhuh   you know its God i mean it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done and he got to do it and so God just really blesses him in ways like that just trust God because i dont know kids are a blessing and and some people we think of blessings as   wow   nice furniture and things like that but kids are just as much of a blessing as all these material things but its a different kind and a lot times people think oh well im not blessed i have an old car but youve got five kids you know youre just as blessed probably more   uhhuh   because if you follow this theres a good book called What the Bible Has to Say About Child Training by Richard Fugate and hes you know a lot of wisdom in it and the kids in the Bible talk about anything but training and training is different   uhhuh   than anything else in in psychology doesnt address it a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff thats in psychology it just comes out of the Bible and they dont quote you the proverb out of it but the things that work in psychology other the years that theyve proven to work they just come out of the Bible and so this book it just really ties in all these things and how to train the child so theyre not going to be a curse to you when theyre thirteen   uhhuh   you know what i mean how to train them so theyre going to be a blessing and so you know they do that and they they just live lean pretty much they dont she doesnt shop at Foleys you know and stuff like that but a lot women in Dallas shop at Foleys so Foleys its like a Macys kind of store its pretty nice and everythings pretty expensive and you know you just cant do that and you dont go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did you know what i mean   i dont i dont know what Foleys is uhhuh yeah   you do these fun things you know in other kinds of ways and i know Manhattans real expensive but um its kind of a different situation because youre probably living in an apartment right   yeah well that makes a really big difference but but still its just as hard as having that but well he can your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids   yeah well have a church state softball leagues so theyre not all boys and   uhhuh   right now we dont have a girls league because im the one thats supposed to start one and i just havent gotten around to doing it i keep saying we need to have one they go okay then start one but everybody wants to do it but you know Gods sitting on my heart and i just hadnt gotten around to doing it anyway so they could really only have four members on the team i think they only have four boys i dont even think they have but two old enough to play yet   uhhuh   but um they you wouldnt believe it though her kids are the they are so good im not kidding you but she does work with them and its a commitment and that thats what theyre called to do   uhhuh   i have a most of my friends   i admire someone that can do that you know i really can   i know i do too i most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like you know thats really all that God wants for them and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them dont i had my tubes tied so you
