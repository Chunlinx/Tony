                    Background        The exact conformation of a tripeptide in a protein can        be determined from its side chain and hydrogen bond        interactions The backbone conformation is captured in the        Ramachandran angles       The rotamer degrees of        freedom fixes the entire side chain A fixed tripeptide        occurring in different proteins will have different side        chain interactions which in turn determine the range of          angles These ranges are typically fairly wide and hence        their utility in protein structure prediction is limited        The use of Ramachandran angles comes about from the well        known planarity of the peptide bond In this work we would        like to complement this bias We expect that C          locations are more directly        constrained by the side chain interactions The data was        therefore analyzed in terms of the C          and C          locations without the bias of the        planarity of the peptide bond For structure prediction we        need the side chain interaction statistics in terms of C          and C          locations The planarity of the        peptide bonds can be imposed as a further constraint        In theory there are  tripeptides and         tetrapeptides With the dataset of about  polypeptide        chain structures of high resolution  A an analysis of        tripeptide study is feasible and a tetrapeptide study will        be statistically insignificant In our representative        protein data set for each tripeptide R          R          R           Figure  we pick the corresponding        C         i  C         i i   positions and then compute        distances ij ij and ij for i not equal to        j These  distances along with the covalent bond length        ii capture the entire solid structure of the        tripeptide as embedded in the protein This information is        sufficient to fix a unique   value along with the        position of the C           The same  R          R          R           is picked up from different proteins        and from different locations within the same protein This        data is statistically analyzed without any further        physicochemical bias about the residues In this way data        about various possible conformations of a tripeptide is        gathered and analyzed as explained in the discussion        section        Attempts to understand and capture structural features        were first done as inter residue contact statistics            involving long range interactions Short range pairwise        residue statistics is contained in the Protein Atlas            In the literature           there have been        many attempts to predict new protein or peptide structures        using small amino acid subsequences or fragments of length         to In the seminal paper     Unger         et al  analyzed hexamers and        identified about  structural building blocks in which        each amino acid has a position dependent probability of        occurrence Others    classified the  amino acids        into  classes Glycine Proline hydrophobic and        hydrophilic and identified structural clusters Baker         et al     used fragments with        definite amino acid sequences and their structural        variations in different known proteins as potential        templates for predicting new protein structures In all the        cases they have only used the backbone structure ie C          coordinates only In contrast we        have used the C          and C          coordinates which then captures a        significant side chain configuration Recently de novo        protein design           is gaining        importance and our data can also be used for this        purpose                    Results        Tripeptides have been classified into three categories        rigid nonrigid and intermediate based on the relative        structural rigidity of various distances between C          and C          atoms in a tripeptide In our sample        of crystallized proteins of the possible  tripeptides        only  occurred The  tripeptides which do not occur        in our sample however do occur in the SWISSPROT           sequence data The tripeptides which occurred more than         times in our sample were taken into consideration in our        analysis We found that   tripeptides can be        classified as rigid   as nonrigid and  as        intermediate We classify rigid tripeptides as those where        at least one  distance has a fluctuation less than        A and nonrigid tripeptides as those with all the         distance fluctuations greater than A After accounting        for rigid and nonrigid all the intermediates have at        least one  distance fluctuation between  to A        The entire dataset of  tripeptides along with all the         relative average distances standard deviations and        frequencies is available at the URL        httpwwwaukbcorgresearchareasbioprojectsproteintrihtml        A profile of this large data set can be obtained by        studying side chain relative abundance Table  and        structural homology Table  To find correlation between        the three classes of tripeptides and known secondary        structure subsequences  helices of sequence length           helices of sequence length    beta strands        of length   and  beta strands of length   from DSMP           were analyzed and the results are tabulated in Table         The distribution of the three classes of tripeptides in        these secondary structure elements mirrors their        distribution in the entire dataset occurrence being        predominantly intermediate followed by rigid and nonrigid        It can be inferred that the rigid tripeptides have no        definite correlation with secondary structure elements        Table shows the frequency of various amino acid        residues occurring in the three categories intermediate        rigid and nonrigid In any category we have mentioned the        relative percentage of occurrence within the same        tripeptide category The amino acids Methionine Proline        Tryptophan and Glutamine occur predominantly in the rigid        tripeptides and not as much in the other two categories        suggesting that Methionine Proline Tryptophan and        Glutamine can cause structural rigidity in a tripeptide        Similarly it can be inferred that Serine and Threonine can        cause structural nonrigidity in a tripeptide The amino        acid Cysteine tends to be either in the rigid or in the        nonrigid category but rarely in the intermediate        category The sum of all the percentage numbers within a        category falls a little short of  since the residues        occur at any of the three possible positions in a        tripeptide Multiple occurrences of a residue within a        tripeptide are counted only once        Table does not reflect the absolute frequency of        occurrence in our dataset For example Methionine and        Tryptophan actually occur rarely Therefore we looked at        those tripeptides that occur with more than the average        frequency which is greater than  in our sample This high        frequency sample dataset again shows that Serine and        Threonine are predominant amongst nonrigids while        Proline Alanine Isoleucine and Leucine occur often        amongst the rigids        The structural homology of most tripeptides is shown in        Table  The fluctuating nature of tripeptides is quite        often captured by                      distances So we chose to classify        various structural similarities by looking at the                      distances alone This was done by        taking the                      mean distances in bins of A        range being  to A and counting the number of        tripeptides falling into each bin Table shows that almost        all the intermediate tripeptides have an                      distance of   A We take        the range to be  as the allowed fluctuation in any        single tripeptide is A The tabulated results show that        all intermediates are broadly similar in structure Among        the rigid tripeptides where the maximum allowed fluctuation        in any individual tripeptide is A only we find that        there are essentially two structural categories namely          A and   A Finally the nonrigid        tripeptides whose fluctuations are certainly larger than        A can be thought of having essentially one        structure        The frequency with which each of the tripeptides occurs        in our sample set of  million tripeptides from         polypeptide chains is shown in Figure         In the graph Figure  Series  indicates the        frequency profile of all the tripeptides Series  is for        intermediate Series  is for rigid and Series  is for        nonrigid About  of the tripeptides occur with a        frequency of less than  All the categories except the        nonrigid do show that tripeptides that occur very        frequently are fewer They obey Poisson like statistics        Most tripeptides occur with a frequency of  Nonrigids        are rare and almost each nonrigid tripeptide occurs with a        different frequency We find in our sample size of         million tripeptides  fall into the rigid category         in nonrigids and the remaining in intermediate                    Discussion        Every tripeptide which occurs in a particular protein        and in a particular position may yield one possible        conformation Examining the entire crystallized data will        give the other possible conformations of the tripeptide        structures in proteins When this is statistically        analyzed it will give a clue to the magnitude of        conformational fluctuations It should be borne in mind        that in every event there are particular chemical bonds or        steric hindrance which makes the conformation        possible        The data set that we studied typically has about A        R factor uncertainty in the position of any coordinates        of the atom Consequently most of the nearest neighbour        distance data show a standard deviation ranging from  to        A Next nearest neighbour R           R           data will typically have a standard        deviation of A to A Let us say we start with a        rigid structure in three dimensions given by mutual        distances between C           C           C           C          points We have to find the C          and C          coordinates Eight additional        distances with corresponding standard deviations        fluctuations are given in Table for each of the        tripeptides Many of the distances are actually redundant        Therefore the best distances are picked to achieve our        goal It can be noted that the nearest neighbour distances        have smaller fluctuations and to fix a point we need the        distance of a said point from three other known points        This translates to saying that we should know at least one        next to nearest neighbour distance We can choose from        amongst all the  distances the one which has the        lowest fluctuation and thus fix C          and then C          or vice versa This yields the        optimum procedure for fixing the three coordinates        accurately In Table we have boldfaced the significant        range around the medians within the category This helps us        in demarcating those with fewer fluctuations than the        median        In Table there are occasions where R           R          or R           R          distances show a large standard        deviation greater than A These abnormalities are        artificial fluctuations in our crystallized data sample        For example in certain PDB data the authors have given        more than one possible coordinate information due to        experimental uncertainties in data interpretation In our        analysis the first choice with its uncertainties has been        taken This is reflected in Table  These occasions are        rare and therefore we have taken them as random errors        causing fluctuations        We discuss some possibilities for the rigidity of        certain tripeptides At the outset we cannot make any        strict criterion for rigidity However statistically more        often than not the following observations hold Rigidity        due to Proline is well understood because of the side chain        interacting covalently with the backbone Consequently C          is held rigidly upto         trans and         cis ambiguity This amounts to the        fact that essentially  is frozen to               The tripeptide therefore tends to be rigid On closer        examination we find Proline in position  in the        tripeptide makes the tripeptide rigid This is in        agreement with the expectations from the covalent bond        structure        Methionine and Tryptophan are fairly bulky perhaps the        good space filling is the cause for rigidity Rigid        tripeptides with Glutamine invariably also have another        polar side chain residue consequently they form a weak        ionic bond within the tripeptide Usually residues with        long side chains have more rotameric fluctuations            Occasionally we find they may bind with another residue        within the tripeptide and end up being rigid Lastly        nonrigids tend to have Serine and Threonine residues        which is consistent with their high polarity Cysteine        which is well known for its tendency to form disulfide        bridge can fall into either rigid or nonrigid category        but rarely in the intermediate category        A single tripeptide does not have a unique structure        indeed it varies as the position of the tripeptide changes        within a protein and across proteins This fluctuation is        captured by the standard deviations in Table  The        classification of rigid nonrigid and intermediate is most        often determined by  distance alone Therefore we        can assess that two different tripeptides have similar        structure when their  distance along with their        standard deviations overlap This criterion implies that        structurally homologous tripeptides have similar backbones        We have also looked at various other cross corelations        such as  vs  distances  vs         distances etc The structural homology conclusion as        presented in the results remains unaltered                    Conclusions        Tripeptide analysis is shown to be feasible and        statistically significant results have been obtained Some        regular features of side chain interactions suggest that        there are essentially three classes of tripeptides rigid        nonrigid and intermediate These have no correlation with        the secondary structures in proteins and hence are        complementary to such studies This data may be used to        predict plausible structures for oligopeptides and for        denovo protein design Attempts are being made by us to        develop useful pseudo energy functions to realize the above        aims                    Methods        A representative data set of  protein structures was        obtained from Protein Data Bank PDB    with a sequence        identity ranging from  and  A resolution This PDB        list was generated from CulledPDB RLDunbrack Jr        httpwwwfccceduresearchlabsdunbrackpisces which        uses an algorithm similar to the removeuntildone        algorithm of Hobohm and Sander     A statistical        analysis of  million tripeptides from this set was        done If the distribution of tripeptides across proteins        were random we would expect each of these tripeptides to        occur on an average about  times For each of these         million tripeptides  distances                           were calculated The mean and        standard deviation was then computed for each of these        distances The frequency of occurrence of each of the         distances was also calculated The objective is to find if        there is a conservation of distances in these tripeptides        irrespective of where they occur in a protein sequence or        which protein they came from        As a countercheck for the statistical reliability of our        analysis another representative dataset of  million        tripeptides in  proteins with sequence identity ranging        from  and  A resolution was taken and similar        computational analysis was done The quantitative results        as reflected in Table remained the same in both the sets        Statistical significance became better in the         sequence identity set The standard deviation obtained in        the  set is therefore much more reliable        In order to determine the structural homologs in the        tripeptides  mean distances were taken in bins of        A in a range of A to A The number of        tripeptides from each of the three categories rigid        nonrigid and intermediate which fall into these A bins        was counted The results are tabulated in Table  Helix        and beta strand subsequences from DSMP    were        extracted and the frequency of the three classes of        tripeptides was computed The results are tabulated
