FloridaWhenever I attend a quarterly sales meeting there are inevitably severalpeople who dont know me who start talking about how they love Florida Ipolitely tell them I live in California but I get very irritated As much as Ilove Mad magazines Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions I can neverbring myself to snap at these retards In the end the frustration is minewhen its they who should be apologizing Can you offer me some wit to helpdiffuse these situations                                       Still Black StillShavingLos Angeles                        DearStill            Your letter comes at acosmic time for Prudie who recently made the mistake you write about Havingbeen on the wrong end of the situation let Prudie point out that such mistakescome from unfamiliarity perhaps thoughtlessness but not bigotry            The rejoinder Prudiesuggests is granted an old standby but it defuses the situation andeverybody gets the message It is what a prominent black academic said whenPrudie greeted him by another gentlemans name We all look alike            It wassaid with wry humor and Prudie felt about as tall as a toadstool and willnever again be careless in her address which is after all what youreafter isnt it            Prudie penitently                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am good friends with agirl and both of us share a similar interest namely politics However we areon completely opposite ends of the political spectrum Shes a liberal Democratand Im a conservative Republican When we discuss our common interest it turnsinto a fiery political debate We disagree on every issue from gun control totax policy to our views on Clinton Ive even considered changing my politicalviews for her                                       Recently Ive considered becoming intimate with her but I dont know howwe would fare as a couple considering the area of political tension Is itpossible to close this political gender gap How do Mary Matalin and JamesCarville do it                                       SincerelyTooConservative for Her                        DearToo            Prudie can relate though shedoesnt see how you can turn a switch and change your views Your voterregistration maybe but not your views For you to become a bornagainDemocrat would probably take a deprogrammer            As for maintaining a romanticrelationship with someone with wildly divergent politics it is like walkingwith oatmeal in your shoe Its not easy but its possible The decidingfactor is how the rest of the relationship functions You might simply agree todisagree on this one subject            As forthose shrinking violets Matalin and Carville Prudie has a hunch they haveknockdown dragout fights about their different affiliations Bear in mind thatsome couples thrive on volatility and friction Now you must figure out if youare in that category            Prudie politically                                             DearPrudie                                                      One ofmy pet peeves when dining with family or friends is the constant thanking thatgoes on When the waiter brings cocktails for a table of eight there is aridiculous rhapsody of thank you and youre welcome Then there areappetizers salads main courses beverage refills desserts and coffee Athousand thanks for doing ones job I choose to thank once at the end of themeal and to provide a generous tip I have been a waiter and preferred theartistry of being both attentive and discreet The trick is to clear the saladplate and place the dinner plate without being noticed                                       Sign meNoshing on theNorth Shore                        DearNosh            Prudiehad no idea about the depth of feeling on the subject of when and how muchthanking of waitpersons is appropriate Your letter is just one example Thefact that you yourself have experienced both positions relative to the diningchair lends authority to your opinion Prudie imagining herself waiting ontables concurs that an appreciative gratuity is indeed preferable torepeated thank yous and now considers the problem solved            Prudie conclusively                                             Prudie                                                      Youracy minx Tat caught in a wringer Ex
