        okay what do you think about uh this health insurance business     well i watched something on TV a couple of months ago by uh General ex uh Surgeon General Koop   umhum   and he talked about Canadas system and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that but the expensive stuff heart uh operations and things they have a managed scarcity and they said that in Canada there were as many heart uh trauma centers as there is in San Francisco       so in one city of in America theres as many uh hospitals that are equipped to do hospital uh heart operations as in the entire area of Canada and thats kind of spooky   well i uh i understand what youre saying and theres probably some truth to that i think that uh generally i dont welcome added government responsibilities however when a anybody cant police their own profession it eventually leads to that and i think the costs and the uh the way the medical profession has every year i uh being in my own business uh in the last six years every year theres been at least minimum twenty five percent increase in health insurance costs and i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter uh   uhhuh   i think theyre asking for it i i think the medical profession is just just pushing until theres no option but the government take it over and uh   do you think that its just the medical guys what about you know you know how expensive new equipment and technology is thats where i think most of the cost is coming   well i i think a lot of it is uh i i dont disagree totally with that but uh my wife this last summer uh when we were on vacation tore up her knee and uh uh it it was ligaments ligaments uh in her knee as it turned out uh she came back that uh we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened and uh she got home   uhhuh   and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come i mean he knows knee problems okay i mean if anyone does this guy knows it   umhum   well she goes in and he says well i think this is what it is but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these MRI things thousand dollars for this uh oh Magnetic uh Resonance uh Imaging type thing and my wife said well uh do i need that and he he says well uh you know it itll help me diagnose this i mean uh you know i i suggest you go have this thing insurance wont pick this up unless youre in the hospital   oh great   now a thousand uh uh dollars for thirty five minutes i mean doctors routinely send people in for anything now for years they didnt have this and they solved these problems and you know i said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go but i i think a thousand dollars these guys i dont know what it is but theres no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day   in   and even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at uh roughly a thousand dollars every half hour uh thats ridiculous i i dont care what anyone says those you know the costs are not its a picture it shouldnt cost more than thirty five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness but they arent reasonable fifty a hundred dollars they dont have to pay them back in three months time you you know   you know yeah ill have to agree with you there but theres another problem and thats the how litigious our society is if the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that hes gonna to be hauled into court   well i think that should be thats thats a another problem but thats part of our legalese problem and that the government eventually will address too just you know because its out of control i i agree with you you know uh i was on a jury or i i didnt make the jury but there was a deal where a doctor was gonna be sued for malpractice on the death of an infant     uhhuh   like it was three days after it was born and he was the one that delivered it and they got four attorneys one guy out of Houston he introduced himsnelf as snake soandso he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars and i says yeah i got problems with that i mean you know five million bucks isnt going to bring this kid back you know i mean as sorrowful as it is       uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know it he should be pulled from his license but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it you know it it it it doesnt make logical sense to me but uh   no it doesnt   uh thats
