        how has your weather been recently   well the last two weeks we have had records  yes uh weve been weve had between ninety and ninety five degree weather with about eighty six to eighty eight percent humidity   record what oh wow thats something weve had a really wonderful Spring its been rainy   yeah   its been comfortable it been cool and weve only had a couple of really severe weather storms uh which is unusual for northeast Texas generally we have some   umhum   you know theres theres always at least one or two good hail storms before the season ends   yeah i know what you mean by good hail storms   yeah last Thursday though it was just raining buckets and it was probably in the low eighties   hm   it was really a nice late Spring day very comfortable just really was nice had plenty of rain and within three days time all of that moisture is gone the sun has come out and it is H O T  i mean big time hot the air conditioners in the buildings are saying oh no not again   umhum hm oh yes i know unfortunately my air conditioner broke down uh two days ago so uh things have been like a sauna  uh     umhum umhum i can imagine well uh typically though what does your weather run when does your Spring actually start   well its pretty Spring usually starts uh in May   umhum   and we usually have seventy degree weather to seventy to eighty degree weather in May and in June and then uh toward the end of June it starts getting hot and uh hot   umhum umhum   meaning you know ninety and above i consider ninety and above hot  uh and we usually have about the same humidity but unfortunately uh we had a very early Summer im im hoping that well   umhum umhum yeah   again maybe get some cool weather but uh i dont know uh it it doesnt look very encouraging because theyre calling for the rest of the week to be equally as hot so   oh wow   right oh boy i know that its been about eight years ago i guess now right here in Dallas   so   i guess it was late May temperatures got up into the nineties and by early June it was rocking a hundred and it stayed that way till September   hm   we had ninety one consecutive hundred degree days   oh my gracious wow   and i didnt know whether we would survive at all oh but   oh i guess not thats you dont have as much humidity though do you uh   well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at one time wasnt a real humid area but weve built a lot of lakes and a lot of reservoirs and that increases the relative humidity i mean it if its there to evaporate its going to go up into the air and the hotter it gets the more evaporates   umhum right um probably put in more trees and things too uh might uh uh it seems like the area there more treed seemed to um uh hold the humidity in uh even more   well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at one time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and       for farming and for construction and things a lot of the forests have been cut down and then of course you know they bulldozed a bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir  moisture   yes i know oh   but for the most part we have very mild Winters here we may get one snow storm i may actually see white on the ground one day but if it even ices over a half an inch worth of ice or just a little bit of snow man businesses close down traffic comes to a snarl i mean nothing happens if it gets enough snow you can see it on the ground   well dont feel bad it does here too and we get snow all the time  uh they dont get that awfully much but they get enough unfortunately that uh uh if if they arent used to it its not like having   um oh yeah uhhuh right   snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or quite quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the schools close when theres half an inch of snow  and uh   right yeah oh yeah thats true they sure do   everything else closes down so uh   umhum well you know the one of the things i have noticed is that the weather changes over time as well i was raised in Amarillo   umhum   and i can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in Amarillo it started in October and stopped in March or May April  and it you know there stayed snow on the ground all Winter long to to sun depth   right   but actually that has changed considerably uh the the Winters are no less cold but theyre dryer   right right yes its been the same way here uh we havent had nearly as severe uh a Winter in the last five years even   umhum   than we had uh ive been in Maryland for twenty years so uh um id id say when i first came here you know it it was quite   umhum   common to have several snows and uh you know they they build in uh ten snow days for our kids back here in the school and uh the last three years they havent taken but one day   umhum umhum right oh wow thats something well i dont think there was a single day out this year for our kids they i dont they dont put ten in there i think they put three   so uh it has umhum   but good grief here three days for snow days actually one year before last they took a snow day because it was flooding  uh Spring flood and they just couldnt get to school so they just canceled school   okay right   so theres just too many were in a a very uh theyre low hills you dont notice them because of the trees and because of the so many buildings built around but theres a lot of hills around here which means theres a lot of gullies which means theres a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding   right right right right   and uh  that can create almost as big a hazard and i drive a little Nissan when it floods it drowns   ooh yes right you wouldnt wanna you wouldnt want to go through too many puddles do you have much uh many many problems problems with um lightning uh with electric storms there   well yes uh anytime theres a storm theres going to be plenty of it yeah one of the   oh really okay because of that thats one thing that we have here see im originally from California so the contrast between   uhhuh   the lightning storms i experienced there and the lightning storms back here where it hits in the back yard you know uh uh have been uh quite an experience but um   yeah right   uh we seem to have a lot this time of year we seem to have a lot of uh where its still i mean last night it went down to sixty degrees but its ninety its its eighty two right now here so uh yeah   ooh goodness it really did climb fast didnt it   yes so it the the contrast in the Spring is so uh you know different i guess that it uh breeds some uh   well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that you you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really dont want that   umhum yeah no i dont either i know what you mean because electric bills go up and  in fact uh i was at my daughters on Sunday and they had their first brown out uh it just electricity just went off for about twenty minutes and then came back on   oh um   but it went off in the whole neighborhood so uh uh its this isnt uh   oh my goodness   this is still May its not a real good time of year to start you know because uh uh it kind of looks for the but the the Summers have been longer and um hotter   umhu m thats right   i think that a lot of it has to do with   i agree
