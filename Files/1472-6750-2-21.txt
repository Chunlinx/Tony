                    Background        Ribozymes whose activities are modulated by effector        molecules have previously been engineered For example        Herschlag and coworkers have previously shown that a        nucleobase could complement an abasic site within the        hammerhead ribozyme restoring cleavage activity            Similarly Porta and Lizardi engineered a hammerhead        ribozyme that assumed an inactive secondary structure upon        the addition of an oligonucleotide that disrupted the        engineered secondary structure the ribozyme was activated            More recently it has previously been shown that        many selected nucleic acid binding species aptamers        undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding              In addition when aptamers are conjoined to ribozymes        the ligandinduced conformational changes in the aptamers        frequently modulate the structures and hence the activities        of the ribozymes      For example binding of        theophylline to the antitheophylline aptamer           modulates the conformation of residue     and the        overall stability of the aptamer      Appending the        antitheophylline aptamer to the hammerhead ribozyme        allowed cleavage activity to be modulated by fold by        theophylline     Similarly appending the        antitheophylline aptamer to a small ribozyme ligase L        generated an aptazyme that was activated fold by        saturating theophylline concentrations            The methods for engineering and selecting Group I        aptazymes appear to be generalizable to several different        types of ribozymes Adjoining aptamers to the Group I        selfsplicing intron would potentially allow the control of        splicing not only         in vitro  but         in vivo  To this end we have        attempted to generate and assay Group I aptazymes                    Results and Discussion                  Design of Group I aptazymes          In order to convert the Group I selfsplicing intron          to a regulatable aptazyme it was necessary to first          identify sequences or structures in the ribozyme whose          conformation might modulate splicing activity The          structural and kinetic properties of the Group I          selfsplicing intron from the           thymidylate synthase            td  gene in bacteriophage T have          been extensively studied In particular a series of          nested deletions of the P stemloop have been shown to          partially or completely compromise ribozyme activity              More importantly either magnesium or the tyrosyl          tRNA synthetase from Neurospora mitochondria CYT can          suppress many of these defects      Previous          studies with other introns have also revealed that          deletion of the P stemloop can modulate ribozyme          activity      We hypothesized that sites where          deletions modulated ribozyme activity might also prove to          be sites where aptamer conformational changes would          modulate ribozyme activity Based on these studies we          designed a series of Group I aptazymes in which the          antitheophylline aptamer was substituted for either a          portion of P or P Figure  The antitheophylline          aptamer was attached at the same point as had previously          proven successful in the design of theophyllinedependent          cleavases and ligases                               Activation in vitro          The selfsplicing activities of the Group I aptazymes          were examined           in vitro using a standard splicing          assay Table  Magnesium had previously been shown to          suppress structural defects in the           td intron and ligandinduced          suppressions of splicing defects were examined by          carrying out splicing reactions at either low  mM          stringent or high  mM permissive magnesium          concentrations     Several of the constructs were          either relatively inactive eg ThP ThP and          ThP or did not consistently show differential splicing          activity eg ThP and ThP However four of the          constructs ThP ThP ThP and ThP showed good          activity  of wildtype and increased          selfsplicing in the presence of theophylline For          example ThP showed the greatest activation fold at           mM MgCl             while ThP showed low activation          fold at both magnesium concentrations          For all of the aptazymes except ThP the          ligandinduced splicing activity was greater in a          standard assay at the more stringent  mM magnesium          concentration Table  The construct ThP was inactive          at lower magnesium concentrations but underwent          ligandinduced splicing at the more permissive          concentration  mM Interestingly those aptazyme          constructs that showed liganddependent activity closely          resembled the original deletion variants that showed          magnesiumdependent recovery of splicing activity For          example the junction between the aptamer and the Group I          ribozyme in the aptazyme ThP resembled the deletion          variant           td P the aptazyme was          activated by theophylline while the splicing defect of          the deletion variant at  mM magnesium was suppressed by           mM magnesium or by stabilization of a tetraloop          sequence that capped the P helix     Defects that          poise a ribozyme between active and inactive conformers          have previously been used to engineer effectordependence                       The kinetics of splicing of two of the most activated          variants ThP and ThP were examined in the presence          and absence of theophylline Figure  As in the single          point assays the theophyllinedependence of the          engineered introns was readily apparent Figure a The          time courses reveal that the extents of splicing of the          aptazymes were significantly affected by the addition of          theophylline Figures bc The aptazyme modified at P          ThP showed less theophyllinedependent enhancement of          the extent of reaction than the aptazyme modified at P          ThP consistent with the single point assays          described above ThP was activated fold at           minutes Figure b while ThP showed a fold rate          enhancement at  minutes Figure c These levels of          liganddependent activation were similar to those          observed with the original hammerhead aptazyme          constructs    and it may prove possible to use           in vitro selection to further          optimize activation      However when the time          course data were fit with a single exponential equation          the rates of the initial reactions turned out to be very          similar in both the presence and absence of theophylline          Table           Based on these results the primary mechanism of          activation is likely the same as has been observed for          other aptazymes ligandinduced conformational changes          that stabilize functional ribozyme sequences and          structures However the Group I selfsplicing intron is          a much more complicated ribozyme than either the          hammerhead or the L ligase for example the tertiary          structure of the Group I intron is established by a          complicated folding pathway                 Therefore it was possible that theophyllinebinding          influenced the overall folding pathway of the engineered          Group I aptazyme In order to assess this possibility we          examined the theophyllinedependence of ThP splicing          reactions           in vitro following prolonged          incubation  minutes to allow for refolding No          significant change in the extent of liganddependent          activation was observed following preincubation data          not shown These results argue that both GTP and          theophylline may need to be present to influence the          folding pathway of the engineered Group I aptazymes          These results are also consistent with previous physical             and kinetic      data that shows that the          folding of the Group I intron is dependent in part upon          GTP                          Gene regulation in vivo          Each of the successful aptazyme constructs was          subsequently cloned into an interrupted           thymidylate synthase gene in place          of the parental           td selfsplicing intron The          vectors were introduced into an           E coli strain CThyAKan R          that lacked a functional           thymidylate synthase gene and that          was a thymidine auxotroph When bacteria grown in rich          media were subsequently plated on minimal media lacking          thymidine no colony growth was observed with the          exception of ThP However when theophylline  mM          was included in the minimal media bacteria containing          the intron ThP formed colonies and bacteria containing          the intron ThP showed increased growth Figure  All          introns that originally showed no or low splicing           in vitro including ThP could          not rescue bacteria either in the presence or absence of          theophylline Finally no growth was observed in a          negative control that contained a nonfunctional Group I          intron B and no theophyllinedependent changes in          growth were observed in a negative control in which          mutations were introduced into the aptazyme to abolish          theophylline binding ThPD Interestingly no growth          was observed for bacteria harboring the intron ThP          despite the fact that this aptazyme showed the greatest          activation by theophylline           in vitro  The plating results were          consistent and reproducible over a variety of          experiments          To better characterize the influence of the effector          on intronsplicing we also carried out a series of          growth experiments in liquid culture Figure a An          overnight bacterial culture that contained the           td gene divided by the aptazyme          ThP was inoculated into fresh minimal media effector          was added and growth was continuously monitored As          expected based on growth assays on solid media little          growth was observed in the absence of theophylline          However when theophylline  mM was added to liquid          medium bacteria grew almost as well as a control in          which the parental intron was inserted into the           td gene Most importantly          bacterial growth was not activated by the          structurallyrelated effector caffeine ie          methyltheophylline the antitheophylline aptamer is          known to discriminate between caffeine and theophylline          by a factor of fold     No effectordependent          growth differences were observed with cultures containing                    td genes divided by the          nonfunctional Group I intron B Similar results were          obtained with cultures that contained the           td gene divided by the aptazyme          ThP Figure b However in this instance there was          some background growth of uninduced bacteria consistent          with the higher level of background splicing activity           in vitro  If theophylline is          regulating intron splicing           in vivo  then the extent of          bacterial growth should be dependent upon the          concentration of theophylline introduced into the media          Figure c However theophylline was toxic to bacteria          and caused a decrease in the growth of bacteria          containing the parental           td intron at concentrations greater          than  mM Consistent with this observation low          concentrations of theophylline progressively increased          bacterial growth by activating the           td intron while concentrations of          theophylline above  mM progressively decreased bacterial          growth although levels of growth were still well above          background          These results were all consistent with the hypothesis          that theophylline regulates intron splicing           in vivo  To further probe whether          this was in fact the case mRNA was isolated from           E coli treated with theophylline          or not and RTPCR was used to confirm the presence of          spliced introns Figure  For each of the introns known          to be responsive to theophylline           in vivo ThP and ThP an          increase in spliced mRNA was observed while most other          introns that were not responsive to theophylline           in vivo did not show an increase in          the levels of spliced mRNA An exception to this was          ThP which originally showed theophyllinedependent          splicing           in vitro and also showed          theophyllinedependent splicing           in vivo  However ThP did not          mediate theophyllinedependent growth The bacterial          mRNAs were extracted cloned and sequenced and half of          them appeared to use a cryptic splice site          Several discrepancies were noted between intron          activation           in vitro and effectordependent          growth This is not surprising other studies have          revealed that there is often little correlation between          ribozyme activity           in vitro and           in vivo     However since it          is known that relatively small changes in gene expression          can greatly affect the metabolism of an organism another          possible explanation for the apparent discrepancies is          that relatively small modulations in intron splicing are          amplified via cellular metabolism to yield growth          phenotypes This would seem especially true in the          current set of experiments since the modulation of          Thymidylate Synthase expression is known to greatly          affect thymidine levels and cell growth     For          example           E coli that are starved for          thymine quickly die a phenomenon known as thymineless          death     In this respect Group I aptazymes that          may have yielded lower amounts of functional Thymidylate          Synthase eg ThP which was less active than ThP          or ThP which misspliced did not allow bacterial          growth In contrast aptazymes that may have yielded even          modestly greater amounts of functional Thymidylate          Synthase eg ThP which was both highly active and          modestly activated           in vitro  allowed bacterial          growth                          Effector specificity          In order to examine effectorspecificity           in vivo  a new series of Group I          aptazymes was constructed in which the antitheophylline          aptamer was mutated to bind methylxanthine MeXP              These variants proved to be responsive to          methylxanthine both           in vitro and           in vivo Figure a However the          variants were no longer responsive to theophylline nor          were they responsive to a variety of other analogues          including caffeine methylxanthine methylxanthine          dimethyl urilic acid hypoxanthine xanthine and          theobromine Figure b In contrast the original          aptamer was known to also bind methylxanthine and the          original Group I aptazyme ThP also proved to be          responsive to methylxanthine           in vivo Figure c Thus the          responsivity of the aptazymes           in vivo appears to mirror their          effector specificity           in vitro                           Applications          The ability to engineer Group I introns to be          responsive to effector molecules has numerous potential          applications For example it may prove possible to          develop new gene therapies in which patients rely upon          drugs that can differentially activate gene expression          rather than having to rely upon a set level of endogenous          expression of an introduced gene Similarly it may prove          possible to use effectordependent splicing to more          finely monitor gene expression           in vivo  A drug could be localized          to particular organs cells or organelles and splicing          of the aptazyme could be monitored via a reporter gene          such as luciferase It is also possible to imagine that          engineered introns introduced into reporter genes may          find application in highthroughput cellbased screening          assays that monitor drug uptake or efficacy These          strategies should prove useful not only for selfsplicing          introns activated by drugs but for introns activated by          proteins or peptides In this regard it is notable that          some natural Group I introns have proven to be highly          dependent upon protein cofactors    and that Group I          introns have been engineered whose tertiary structure and          activity is dependent upon a peptide     Such          applications could also be melded with other innovations          dependent upon the Group I selfsplicing intron such as          the introduction of a transsplicing intron that can          potentially repair or modulate the expression of a given          mRNA                                 Conclusions        Group I aptazymes that were dependent upon theophylline        both         in vitro and         in vivo were engineered by conjoining        the         thymidylate synthase          td  intron with an antitheophylline        aptamer Although the         in vitro activation of splicing was        modest up to an fold change in initial rate this        change was more than enough to mediate the survival of a        thymidinedependent         E coli strain The ligand        specificity of the antitheophylline aptamer carried over        to the theophyllinedependent aptazyme and no activation        was seen with caffeine which differed by a single methyl        group from theophylline The effector specificity could be        rationally changed by changing the specificity of the        conjoined aptamer when a mutation was introduced into the        antitheophylline aptamer that led to discrimination        against theophylline and in favor of methylxanthine that        also differed from theophylline by a single methyl group        the aptamer became solely responsive to methylxanthine         in vivo  Group I aptazymes may have        a number of important biotechnology applications including        use as         in vivo  realtime reporters and as        regulatable gene therapeutics                    Methods                  E colistrains and growth media                    E coli strain CThyAKanR was          used for the plate assays and           in vivo growth curves INVaF          Invitrogen Carlsbad CA was used for cloning and          plasmid

Norit Atreated casamino          acids MM and MM supplemented with thymine  mgl          MMT Plates contained Bacto agar  Ampicillin           mgl and kanamycin  mgl were added to all growth
