                                  Why Money Wont Buy Fat            If you have a job likemine in which a reasonably broad swath of American society presents itself toyou without any clothes on this question no doubt has popped into your headWhy are the poor so fat That obesity is a characteristic problem of affluentcountries surprises no one But why is it also characteristic that obesityincreases so dramatically as you go down the social scale            This of course is notthe case in developing nations In countries such as India where my parentsemigrated from being overweight is directly related to wealth and status andis regarded as attractive Thus my fathers rural family of farmers is thinand wiry while the elders in my mothers urban clan of higher caste andwealthier stock are as plump as can be When my sister and I two scrawnyspecimens of the American uppermiddle class visit we always evoke a gooddeal of concern from relatives            The first report I found to document the effect class hason obesity was a  study of midtown Manhattan residents The researchersfound obesity was six times more common among women in the bottom third of thesocial scale than among those in the top third Subsequent studies orginatingfrom California to New Zealand confirm these findings In a  study inMinnesotas Twin Cities women earning under  a year weighed onaverage  pounds more than women earning over  a year In advancednations low income is a more powerful predictor of obesity than any singlefactor except age though this relationship is weaker in men than in women Inmen height is associated more strongly with status On average in developedand undeveloped countries alike richer men are taller            Youd think weight would be like height More moneymeans more food So more food should mean more fat just as it means moreheight right And in fact in children this is exactly the caseat youngages certainly under age  in the United States lowerincome kids are lesslikely to be obese than higherincome kids By the time they are adultshowever the relationship has inverted            Whats going on As myepidemiologist friends point out to me when two things correlate there arealways three possible explanations One leads to the other The other leads tothe one Or some third thing is driving both            T he downward mobility hypothesis Onepossibility is that obesity leads to lower income Certainly the obeseparticularly obese women face severe disadvantages in both the job andmarriage markets And the evidence that this produces downward mobility isdistressingly strong Almost half the women in the  Manhattan studybelonged to a different social class than their parents and those who hadmoved down were significantly fatter than those who had moved up Morerecently a landmark national study led by Steven Gortmaker a Harvardresearcher tracked over  people from age  to  It found the heaviest percent of women were half as likely to get married and twice as likely tobecome impoverished as others Obesity affected a womans economic prospectsmore than even chronic illness In men however shortness led to downwardmobility One foot less of height doubled a mans likelihood of poverty But asGortmaker points out downward mobility explains only a small part of theobserved relationship of income to obesity That makes sense After all thegap also exists in countries such as Britain where social class is more rigidthan it is here                           T               he genetic explanation Could genetics be anoutside factor driving both obesity and poverty The socalled Danish adoptionstudy lent some credence to the idea finding that the obesity and socialstatus of adoptees depended on the social status not only of their adoptiveparents but also of their biological parents The study inferred that parentscan give their offspring genetic traits that tip the scales toward both heavierweight and lower status Even so inheritance accounted for at most a smallpart of the stark effect of income on obesity            T he gluttony and sloth hypothesis So downwardmobility and genes matter somewhat but ultimately were left with the obviousexplanation that in affluent societies the lower the income the more peopleeat unhealthily sit around or both Unfortunately measuring this directly isnotoriously difficult Most peopleespecially the obesefib about diet andexercise and when observed tend to change their behavior The differencesyoure looking for are also quite smalla single calorie of extra daily intakestarting in childhood can translate into  extra pounds by the time youre Nonetheless theres a good deal of indirect evidencefor example TV watchingis linked to eating more and exercising less and rises substantially as incomelowers Given the weakness of other explanations few experts doubt thatlifestyle is the most important one            The question is why Itsas if avoiding obesity were enormously expensive But its notexercise isfree and eating less junk food and meat and more produce saves money Ratherfor the  percent to  percent with a genetic predisposition to obesity itsjust horrendously difficult Being motivated is vital and motivation is whatseems to differ by class            The  Twin Cities study for example found markeddifferences in weight concern Although women earning under  were noless successful when they dieted than women earning over  they wereonethird less likely to diet in the first place They had a greater tolerancefor weight gain saying it would take a  pound gain before they took actionas opposed to the  pound gain that would trigger action in higherincomewomen They even weighed themselves less often three times a month vs seventimes a month            This culturaldifferences explanation certainlyaccounts for why anorexia nervosa is mainly a disease of higherincome girlsand young women Since obese men are less stigmatized it may also explain whywealthier men are not that much less obese than poorer men            Still if thinness really becomes the ideal inevery affluent culturethe way plumpness is in poor societiesits curiousIs this simply the nature of statusthe rich will always find a way todistinguish themselves from the poor Or does richness breed an instinct forlongevity Whatever the case Ill know India has finally risen from ThirdWorld status when I go back to visit my relatives and the first few words theysay are not Eat eat skinny boy
