Business WireStates Poor to Lose  Million in Legal AidWednesday November  DETROITBUSINESS WIRENov  Michigan will lose million in federal funding and  in state funding to providelegal aid to the poor in  according to Deierdre L Weirexecutive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association Incthe states largest provider of legal services to the poorCurrent federal funds of nearly  million from the LegalServices Corporation LSC will drop to  million for next yearaccording to Weir She said that the reductions reflect a declinein the number of persons in the state who are living in povertyaccording to the US Census Bureaus  censusLSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation andaccording to the census the states poverty population fell froman estimated  million in  to an estimated  inThe states legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet anothercut in  of some  of state funding A portion of filingfees paid by litigants in the states circuit courts and a portionof interest on lawyers trust accounts IOLTA are earmarked forMichigan legal aid programs These funds are expected to drop fromcurrently  million in  to  million when the MichiganState Bar Foundation makes distributions next year Most of thedecrease is attributed to the past years low interest ratesThe irony of these funding cuts is that while there may befewer poor people in Michigan today the demand for service willnot change because the poverty population remains so large and thelegal aid funding so little that local providers will never able toserve all who need our service said Weir Its as if the poorwill be victimized twiceonce for being poor and again as victimsof these funding cutsThe US Census Bureau in spite of its best efforts cannotlocate every poor person living in a census tract therefore thepoor are also undercounted added WeirThe brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County whereaccording to the census some  poor people live the largestconcentration of poverty in the state LAD will lose more than for legal aid in Wayne County nearly half of the statestotal loss said WeirWhile difficult to measure the loss of funds will mean thatseveral thousand of Michigans poor in need of legal service willnot receive it or they will receive significantly limited serviceCutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters aslandlordtenant bankruptcy consumer child custody predatorylending mortgage foreclosure utility shutoffs social securitywills and probateLocal providers will have to work harder and smarter and usemore technology instead of staff to provide as much service as wecan with fewer dollars said Weir We will be providing moreselfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legalsystem on their own in routine matters more assistance on thetelephone and less direct representation by attorneys in specifichigh impact mattersCurrently Michigan has  legal aid agencies covering thestates  counties Eight receive LSC funding in addition toreceiving charitable gifts and grants from various localsupporters Most of the eight providers rely on LSC funding for atleast  percent of their annual operating budgets Some of theseproviders have already laid off attorneys and support staff inanticipation of next years reduced funding according to WeirWeir added that the legal aid agencies will also recruit moreattorneys from private practice to handle legal aid cases for freeand accelerate efforts to find alternative fundingLSC is a private nonprofit organization established by Congressin  to provide legal services to the poor Last year Congressappropriated  million to LSC to distribute to local programsacross the country and LSC has requested the same amount forLSCs funding request from Congress is essentially unchangedsays Weir because the poverty population has decreased in somestates such as Michigan but has risen in others and the number ofpersons in the US living in poverty has changed little over thepast decadeAccording to the US Census Bureau  million persons in theUS were living below poverty level in  compared to million in However the census bureaus adjusted estimates for  show anincrease in poverty nationally The poverty rate and the number ofpoor both rose in  to  percent and  million upfrom percent and  million states Poverty in the UnitedStates  a recent bureau reportWeir says that traditionally LSC sticks to the year censusdata and will not change its funding based on the  datahowever it is possible that LSC will make an adjustment in thefutureLAD was established in  as the Legal Aid Society of Detroitand today is the largest legal aid provider in Michigan and one ofthe largest of its kind in the US With a staff of  attorneysand
