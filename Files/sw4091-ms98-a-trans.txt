        i guess that starts it um     all right go   so um i guess right now whats most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program uh where i work and its gonna give me about a three hundred percent return this time around on my uh investment   good   which is definitely helping since im gonna buy a house   is what do they what do they give you stock in the company you work for   yeah what they do is what they do is its its a purchase program where you get the stock its its its on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last May was five sixty four a share   right   stocks trading about fourteen now   wow   so and you so ill get to buy it at five sixty four four and turn around the same day the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do   yeah yeah that sounds good   yeah   what company is that   thats with Interleaf   excuse me   Interleaf   Interleaf never heard of it   uh desktop publishing   oh okay   so but um you know   yeah what are we supposed to talk about salaries  benefits besides salary is that   yeah benefits other than salary   yeah but i i get a i get a pretty good i work for the City of New York   umhum   and i get a pretty good um health plan and   yeah but that thats definitely a good thing to have  especially these days   yeah the health plans pretty good and and we get um they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what youre talking about where theyll theyll take out money tax free from your income and invest it   right   and its a group investment so you i think you also save fees   what is what is that like a uh like a  uh  TIACREF type thing   its like a K plan except they dont they dont contribute   okay yeah  so its for retirement   right   yeah so you you have to wait until like  fifty five or   yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but youll pay youll pay taxes on it and youre better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that   right yeah we we weve got a K here but um i chose to go into the stock program because you cant lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasnt saving up for the house i would be putting money into a K but you know id much rather get the eighteen eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house   yeah uh   but yeah you know medical medical is good you know we get a good program here whats basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month   wow thats thats really good   its like your yeah it is its a very good company as far as benefits go theyve got Ks theyve got uh the health coverage theyve got you know the stock program theyve got uh K selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the dental you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what youre doing   right   um and you know you the K means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax the only problem with K is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think im gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you dont use the thousand dollars it goes away   if you own oh okay i see   so at the end of the year if you havent used it all up its you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and miscellaneous miscellaneous medical and deductibles   right   so i just have them pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because its on pre tax   hello   yeah im here   yeah it uh it was a width away thats why its its every time i talk it sounds weird but uh yeah theres theres other benefits too noneconomic i mean theres theres uh   yeah yeah   theres benefits just in working for a big organization i think in in that you have a lot of uh different people doing a lot of different things and   yeah i i think it it depends how flat the organization is if you know  hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if its um   okay   i dont like working in an organization where youre really deep in the tree because then you start to feel like youve got no real you know power to change anything   right well thats working for the city is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my unit and and just that   right   um but what i mean is i i say for instance im an attorney uh a collection attorney for the City of New York and and in the environmental control board and   umhum umhum umhum   im ive learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought id be involved with and if i was in private practice id never be able to learn all that stuff   yeah but theres two sides to that because also you know ive seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for Digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and thats all he did
