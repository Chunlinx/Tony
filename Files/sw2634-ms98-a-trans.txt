          well um im uh pretty pro gun control over all i um have had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and uh i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find um use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the NRA slogan arguments and um uh so ive been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it um i guess on a one a scale of one of ten im probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i dont like the idea of people being able to kill me with very very little effort um and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me   well me being from Texas   umhum   i hope youre ready for this   um ill ill give it a try ive got my Texan stereotypes in place   well im not your stereotypical Texan i was raised around guns hunting   uhhuh   so i dont have a fear of fire arms in any respect i respect i respect them and what their capabilities are   umhum umhum   and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry   umhum its pretty powerful isnt it   and here in Houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country and here here here you go here you this will be border line NRA which i am not a member of   okay okay   i mean you i know youve heard this this slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns   umhum that applies to anything as well as guns a gun   well youve youve got well any of the big cities youve got the different rival gangs and theyre having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such   umhum   they get out their little Mac tens they get out there little Uzis and theyre going to fight with them and it doesnt matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm if they want it theyll get it i dont care if if theyve got to go down in New Mexico to get it theyll get it and theyll get across the border now my position although i have absolutely no use for fully automatic weapon anyway   umhum   since i am a lawabiding citizen and i have never had a felony if i wanted to buy one i dont think there should be that big of a restriction on it if they want to run a background check on me fine if they want to put a seven day waiting period fine again   umhum   if they want to have want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that ive got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county thats fine too   umhum umhum what i dont gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon its  it wouldnt you dont want to have someone making a personal choice in that way i would hope i mean because that means someone the personal sheriff doesnt like doesnt get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff   well the only well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has is this guy a convicted felon uh is he a habitual trouble maker are we picking him up every Saturday night for a drunk and disorderly and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems   yeah   you know just proving that youre a basically a good citizen   but if youre not a very if youre not a basically good citizen you just told me that youre going to get one of those guns anyway   if if they want the firepower they can get it   so why have   it doesnt it doesnt matter how restrictive youre border control points are theyll get it across the border one way or the other   so why have any restrictions at all   uh okay now go back to that one to ten scale where one being total gun control ten being none i said about an eight   uhhuh yeah umhum umhum well we could be   i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun i would like to see them go through either id like to see a law enforcement agency not NRA but whether it be the your state police or your county police for you to be able to purchase a handgun you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics   well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so   well the hands in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as a weapon as a as a pistol   yeah  well im a bicycler and that scares me too to tell you the truth  because ive been run off the road and all sorts of things well im still im still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway whats the point of putting a restriction basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway theyre not going to take those courses is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns   well theres   if its not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices is that uh main advantage   uh not necessarily a price thing what is happening at least in this state and i expect to see it in other states very soon legislations been introduced as that if a citizen of the state being myself   umhum   has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed unconcealed   umhum   okay you youre  youre from California right LA area   umhum uh no Bay area San Francisco Bay area   okay okay youve been to the city all these people coming around   umhum   someone attempts to mug me i would just i would as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me were equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade   umhum   now if this legislation comes through he pulls im out with my family weve gone shopping were fixing to get in the car this guy comes out pulls a blade on me im going to pull a gun on him now   umhum   when youre looking and when youre looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick   what if youre looking down the barrel of a hand cannon   then its still equally matched   i   having spent having spent time in combat i feel i feel it before theyll get the gun on me   yeah well im im sure im sure given given all your training im sure that   if im  well draw at the same time   you know youd  if i walk into a bad neighborhood im sure id want to walk through with you because im sure you have good you know u h far far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything um im quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasnt yet used a gun in a felony uh havent hasnt yet committed a felony if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario youre going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature youre going to start getting a lot of gunfire its its hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to its logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns youre not going to have an increase in gunfire   i actually its not its more of a police action in itself the fact that everybodys packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well im going to mug this guy right here but hey he carrying just as much firepower as i can and if theres if you got to go through a certification course to get to where to where you can carry it in public   umhum   then this individual also knows this guys pretty good with it now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not thats another trip but   umhum umhum umhum   in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat   umhum   even even more so when it comes to my my wife and son anybody tries anybody tries to hurt them i wont even blink   yeah dont it no i i understand that what if uh what if you think someones trying to hurt them and you make a mistake   this this is where the question of gun control comes in what i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot   yeah well uh that was the topic umhum   say a person uh starts uh uh get all of a sudden my combat antenna goes up and say ive got the vibes this guys fixing to do something i go ahead and pull my piece   umhum   and i make sure this persons sees it so hes got no doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then   umhum   if he doesnt back up that point he deserves what he gets because i have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family im going to dust you as it stands now ive got to do that with a blade and the only reason i feel confident comfortable comfortable doing that is because of the training ive had   umhum umhum well as as someone who would would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because uh youre not going to get  bullets flying around and killing people instantly and uh   well if im the one doing the shooting i dont miss thats the kind of training ive had i mean its
