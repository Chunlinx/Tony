          so what did you have done to your car last   well just fact just recently were waiting to get it fixed right now its uh my wife one day when it was kind of a windy day she opened the door and it kind of blew it all the way back kind of bent it back up against the front bumper there and so were trying it it uh broke the uh the hinge that holds the door on onto the car   oh   and so it has to be rewelded and everything so uh were waiting to get that repaired you know repaired and they have to weld it and touch up some of the paint and everything   uhhuh   and uh as for maintenance and stuff that i do i i i kind of dont dont do any my on on my own i other than waxing the car and kleeping it clean but usually i go to like Jiffy Lube and have them do the uh the oil change and the lubrication and such   yeah thats really dirty work isnt it   yeah  how about you   oh im a single woman so i have most of mine done and i my car died this year  and i went down and priced the new cars and there was no way i could afford a new car   uhhuh oh did it right   so i just i went and had mine rebuilt i had a rebuilt engine put in it and the week after that the transmission went out so i had to put a transmission transmission in it   uhhuh   but its running pretty good now after i had all that done   gosh what kind is it   its a Lincoln   um ours is a uh Voyager Plymouth Voyager   yeah   so and i really like that but thats about it i mean i dont do i used to i used to have a uh when i was single  and i had a a uh Mustang a fast you know an old Mustang sixty five i used to do everything a lot of things you know ill do all the oil changes and the tuneups and   yeah   uhhuh   and uh you know making it fast and putting carburetors and everything like that on it and uh i used to do all that but since since then really no since i got married actually and just find it easier to go to one of these uh you know fast places like Jiffy Lube or someplace like that   is it that you dont have the time to work on it like youd like to or youre just tired of it after doing it for so many years   yeah thats thats pretty much no its actually its more like i dont have the time you know because we also have two kids too and so then i you know i just   umhum   trying to find time for them and then try to do the car too i just you know and the house and the yard and you know everything else so   uhhuh   so usually i just uh try to make it as convenient as possible and go to one of those kind of places   umhum   but   well being a single person i cant afford much so i take mine to KMart and get the oil changed on it and i get   yeah   and i can get by pretty cheap on that and then i have a   yeah   friend that puts my plugs in it when i need new spark plugs and so he does that for me and thats that helps me a lot   uhhuh oh good       good deal   so   well i guess thats about it huh   yeah i need new im putting new tires on it now so yeah   oh are you oh yeah we did that too in fact that was that was the one right before this is uh we had to get some new tires in the back evidently one of the uh the right rear tire had one of the weights fall off it or something   um   and so consequently got a some kind of bubble in what they call out of round or something     umhum umhum   and so you can hear it when you sit in the back you know the thump thump thump thump thump thump and so we had to get a new one   umhum   so that was a recent one too   yeah   and tires arent cheap   well car car thats a car is never ending   yeah  yeah right   you   its always something thats true   thats right   yeah   and uh i tell my friend uh when my when i have car troubles he says well you just you have to remember its just a machine and its not going to last forever     thats right   i say well i want it to   yeah   i want it to last forever i put i put uh two thousand dollars in it and i want it to last   yeah youre right   at least a little while       least another year   yeah         yep well thats about all i have for stories on the car   yeah me too well what well how old are your kids     uh ones four and the other ones one   oh well theyre just little bitty kids   yeah so they take up a lot of time   really they do when theyre little like that   uh sure do   and are they a boy and a girl or   yeah uhhuh   oh well you thats youre lucky you got one of each   yeah i know we lucked out   hows the weather down there at Virginia Beach   very nice weve had a quite a warm last few days in fact its been in the in the well sixty sixty seven to seventy so weve
