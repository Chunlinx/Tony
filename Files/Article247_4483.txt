                                 How eBay Taught Me a Lesson                        One of the welldeserved perils of writing a column like this is thatoccasionally someone will come along and because of something youve writtencall youpardon my Frencha dumbfuck As it happens Im not plucking thatword at random from the ether because in Dumb Money  a forthcomingbook about his adventures as a day trader Joey Anuff the editor of Suck  calls me preciselythat The book by the way is terrific and you should buy it when it comesout this spring            The source of Anuffs ire was an item I did in one of my Weekend CocktailChats in the fall of  just after eBay went public The item mocked theonline auction site as yet another flybynight Internet company with no hopeof profitability and a market capitalization that bore no connection toreality Although Anuff eventually became a day trader eBay seems to have beenthe one company that he truly loved and invested in out of a real faith in itsbusiness and so my illadvised and illinformed scorn made him a bit moreannoyed than an item mocking say US Steel might have            I bring this all up because eBay reported earnings yesterday and the reportilluminated what now seems to me to be essentially indisputable which is thatthe economics of eBays business are tremendous and its future is very brightThis of course makes me wonder why I wasnt able to see then what I see nowand what Anuff saw then Because eBay is essentially just facilitatinginteractions between buyers and sellers and not building or even really sellinganything itself its gross margins that is the cost of actually providing itsgoods are almost guaranteed to remain high Although the company obviouslyneeds to invest heavily in technology to be able to handle its everincreasingvolume of items for sale there are no obvious limitations on how big itsvirtual marketplace can grow making it in that sense almost infinitelyscalable And the bigger it gets and the more people grow comfortable with itthe wider the variety of goods people will buy and sell on it            eBays real strength though is that it is the quintessential example ofthe socalled network effect which says that the value of any network to itsusers increases sharplyperhaps even geometricallyas the number of users ofthat network increases The network effect is often bandied about ascharacteristic of many businesses on the Net but in fact there is no networkon the Net like eBays Sellers want to go where there are the most buyers andbuyers want to go where there are the most sellers and therefore the positivefeedback loop here seems practically unbreakable For that very reason eBay isalso one of the rare examples in which the muchvaunted firstmover advantagealso seems to have been real although if eBay had not executed as well as ithas being first would not have been enough            There are a couple of quirks to this story For all the power of the networkeffect eBay has seen its domination of online auctions eroded by the entry ofAmazon and Yahoo into the market Im still not sure why whenever I buysomething on auction at Amazon I can never figure out why the person isntselling the item on eBay where I feel certain I would have been outbid ButAmazon and Yahoo do have powerful customer bases of their own and have set uptheir interfaces so that auction items find their way to regular customersfairly easily Also Amazon lets you buy a lot of items with a credit card andeBay has also faced price competition Still it now controls  percent of themarket and thats actually up from  percent            The other quirk is that over the past year eBays stock price has notreally moved much although it did jump  percent in the wake of this latestearnings report The stock is down  percent from its week high and itsup only  percent since last March One way of reading this is to say thatinvestors finally woke up to the fact that eBay is still making just four centsa share not much different than it was in  But another way of readingthis is that there were enough investors like Anuff at the beginning whounderstood eBays business and understood why they should own its stock thatthe company became fully valued not long after it went public In other wordsit may be that in eBays case the stock market was fairly efficient arrivingat the right price in a matter of months rather than years as arguably wasthe case with stocks like CocaCola or Microsoft That doesnt mean eBaysstock wont go up or down from here especially since volatility is now a wayof life for Nasdaq stocks But it probably means that expecting eBay to becomea proverbial tenbagger rise  percent from here is a mistake            The interesting thing about eBay for me is the way it crystallizes mychanging view of Internet companies and Internet stocks over the past twoyears What once appeared to be a bubble driven by hysterical investors nowlooks much more to me like as good an attempt as possible at quantifying thevalue of an economic opportunity that taken as a whole still lookspractically limitless Of course to almost everyone else it looks like abubble And while discussion of the Net remains swamped with hype andbuzzwords there clearly are companies like Yahoo and AOL and eBay thatdemonstrate that you can take advantage of that opportunity and still make aprofit Id say I knew it all along But my bank account wont let me
