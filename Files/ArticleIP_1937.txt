                                 BabySitting the Economy            Twenty years ago I read astory that changed my life I think about that story often it helps me to staycalm in the face of crisis to remain hopeful in times of depression and toresist the pull of fatalism and pessimism At this gloomy moment when Asiaswoes seem to threaten the world economy as a whole the lessons of thatinspirational tale are more important than ever            The storyis told in an article titled Monetary Theory and the Great Capitol HillBabySitting Coop Crisis Joan and Richard Sweeney published it in theJournal of Money Credit and Banking in  Ive used their story intwo of my books Peddling Prosperity and The Accidental Theorist but it bears retelling this time with an Asian twist            The Sweeneys tell the story ofyou guessed itababysitting coop one to which they belonged in the early s Such coopsare quite common A group of people in this case about  young couples withcongressional connections agrees to babysit for one another obviating theneed for cash payments to adolescents Its a mutually beneficial arrangementA couple that already has children around may find that watching anothercouples kids for an evening is not that much of an additional burdencertainly compared with the benefit of receiving the same service some otherevening But there must be a system for making sure each couple does its fairshare            TheCapitol Hill coop adopted one fairly natural solution It issued scrippiecesof paper equivalent to one hour of babysitting time Baby sitters wouldreceive the appropriate number of coupons directly from the baby sittees Thismade the system selfenforcing Over time each couple would automatically doas much babysitting as it received in return As long as the people werereliableand these young professionals certainly werewhat could gowrong            Well it turned out that there was a smalltechnical problem Think about the coupon holdings of a typical couple Duringperiods when it had few occasions to go out a couple would probably try tobuild up a reservethen run that reserve down when the occasions arose Therewould be an averaging out of these demands One couple would be going out whenanother was staying at home But since many couples would be holding reservesof coupons at any given time the coop needed to have a fairly large amount ofscrip in circulation            Now whathappened in the Sweeneys coop was that for complicated reasons involving thecollection and use of dues paid in scrip the number of coupons incirculation became quite low As a result most couples were anxious to add totheir reserves by babysitting reluctant to run them down by going out Butone couples decision to go out was anothers chance to babysit so it becamedifficult to earn coupons Knowing this couples became even more reluctant touse their reserves except on special occasions reducing babysittingopportunities still further            In short the coop had fallen into a recession            Since mostof the coops members were lawyers it was difficult to convince them theproblem was monetary They tried to legislate recoverypassing a rulerequiring each couple to go out at least twice a month But eventually theeconomists prevailed More coupons were issued couples became more willing togo out opportunities to babysit multiplied and everyone was happyEventually of course the coop issued too much scrip leading todifferent problems             If you think this is a silly story a waste ofyour time shame on you What the Capitol Hill BabySitting Coop experiencedwas a real recession Its story tells you more about what economic slumps areand why they happen than you will get from reading  pages of William Greiderand a years worth of Wall Street Journal editorials And if you arewilling to really wrap your mind around the coops story to play with it anddraw out its implications it will change the way you think about theworld            Forexample suppose that the US stock market was to crash threatening toundermine consumer confidence Would this inevitably mean a disastrousrecession Think of it this way When consumer confidence declines it is asif for some reason the typical member of the coop had become less willing togo out more anxious to accumulate coupons for a rainy day This could indeedlead to a slumpbut need not if the management were alert and responded bysimply issuing more coupons That is exactly what our head coupon issuer AlanGreenspan did in and what I believe he would do again So as I said atthe beginning the story of the babysitting coop helps me to remain calm inthe face of crisis            Or suppose Greenspan did not respond quickly enough andthat the economy did indeed fall into a slump Dont panic Even if the headcoupon issuer has fallen temporarily behind the curve he can still ordinarilyturn the situation around by issuing more couponsthat is with a vigorousmonetary expansion like the ones that ended the recessions of  and So as I said the story of the babysitting coop helps me remainhopeful in times of depression            Above allthe story of the coop tells you that economic slumps are not punishments forour sins pains that we are fated to suffer The Capitol Hill coop did not getinto trouble because its members were bad inefficient baby sitters itstroubles did not reveal the fundamental flaws of Capitol Hill values orcrony babysittingism It had a technical problemtoo many people chasingtoo little scripwhich could be and was solved with a little clear thinkingAnd so as I said the coops story helps me to resist the pull of fatalismand pessimism            But if its all so easy how can a large partof the world be in the mess its in How for example can Japan be stuck in aseemingly intractable slumpone that it does not seem able to get out ofsimply by printing coupons Well if we extend the coops story a little bitit is not hard to generate something that looks a lot like Japansproblemsand to see the outline of a solution            First wehave to imagine a coop the members of which realized there was an unnecessaryinconvenience in their system There would be occasions when a couple founditself needing to go out several times in a row which would cause it to runout of couponsand therefore be unable to get its babies sateven though itwas entirely willing to do lots of compensatory babysitting at a later dateTo resolve this problem the coop allowed members to borrow extracoupons from the management in times of needrepaying with the couponsreceived from  To prevent members from abusing this privilege however themanagement would probably need to impose some penaltyrequiring borrowers torepay more coupons than they borrowed            Under this new system couples would hold smaller reservesof coupons than before knowing they could borrow more if necessary Thecoops officers would however have acquired a new tool of management Ifmembers of the coop reported it was easy to find baby sitters and hard to findopportunities to babysit the terms under which members could borrow couponscould be made more favorable encouraging more people to go out If babysitters were scarce those terms could be worsened encouraging people to goout less            In otherwords this more sophisticated coop would have a central bank that couldstimulate a depressed economy by reducing the interest rate and cool off anoverheated one by raising it            But what about Japanwhere the economy slumpsdespite interest rates having fallen almost to zero Has the babysittingmetaphor finally found a situation it cannot handle            Wellimagine there is a seasonality in the demand and supply for babysittingDuring the winter when its cold and dark couples dont want to go out muchbut are quite willing to stay home and look after other peopleschildrenthereby accumulating points they can use on balmy summer evenings Ifthis seasonality isnt too pronounced the coop could still keep the supplyand demand for babysitting in balance by charging low interest rates in thewinter months higher rates in the summer But suppose that the seasonality isvery strong indeed Then in the winter even at a zero interest rate therewill be more couples seeking opportunities to babysit than there are couplesgoing out which will mean that babysitting opportunities will be hard tofind which means that couples seeking to build up reserves for summer fun willbe even less willing to use those points in the winter meaning even feweropportunities to babysit  and the coop will slide into a recession even ata zero interest rate            And this is the winter of Japans discontent Perhapsbecause of its aging population perhaps also because of a general nervousnessabout the future the Japanese public does not appear willing to spend enoughto use the economys capacity even at a zero interest rate Japan say theeconomists has fallen into the dread liquidity trap Well what you havejust read is an infantile explanation of what a liquidity trap is and how itcan happen And once you understand that this is what has gone wrong theanswer to Japans problems is of course             So the story of thebabysitting coop is not a mere amusement If people would only take itseriouslyif they could only understand that when great economic issues are atstake whimsical parables are not a waste of time but the key toenlightenmentit is a story that could save the world
