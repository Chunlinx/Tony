                                 Harry Potter Is the New Star Wars                        Dear Polly            Like you I began this assignment with a mixture of puzzlement andskepticism I was for one thing suspicious of the media hypeto which we arenow of course contributingaround these books and I still dread theeventual movies and the inevitable merchandising frenzy that will follow Myson has just graduated from the Tellytubbies to Arthur and I fear the dayisnt far off when TinkyWinky and LaaLaa and DW and Francine will have toshove over on his shelves to make way for Aldus Dumbeldore Hermione Grangerand the other musthave action figures not to mention the toy broomstickswands owls and endless other wee wizard paraphernalia sure to flood themarket soon And then there will be the McDonalds Harry Potter Magic HappyMeals the CDROMS the cutrate knockoffs and the other excrescences ofkidculture overkill Look what they did to poor WinniethePooh            I also had to overcome some grownup resistance to the books themselvesmostly owing to the atrophying of my capacity for the kind offlashlightunderthecovers breathless absorption you evoke so nicely Thatthe Harry Potter books restore this capacity with brilliant efficiency must bepart of the reason they appeal to adults But as you point out theyre hardlyunique in this Theyre not better than The Phantom Tollbooth  or UrsulaLeGuins Earthsea Trilogy or TH Whites The Once and Future King Nor are they better you asked for my favorites than EL Konigsbergs Fromthe Mixedup Files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler  or Louise Fitzhughs books Harriet the Spy is best known but the one I remember best isNobodys Family Is Going To Change  But that Harry Potter meritsmention in this company suggests that hes the real thing            I dont know why it is that adult readersincluding myself since myreading life which is to say my life is divided evenly between bedtimestories for younger children and serious adult fiction plenty of dreckthereeschew the pleasures these books afford especially since we arelikely to have fond intense memories of just those pleasures We try torecapture them with genre schlock as though the dream world of our youth werea tacky theme park And yet its evident that JK Rowling is a formidablytalentedand more important a rigorously competentnovelist much better atthe rudiments of effective fiction writing than any six American novelistsunder  Shes meticulous in her plotting economical in her descriptions andexact in her portraiture Theres no reason why solid storytelling briskprose and vivid characters should appeal exclusively or primarily tochildren though children are less likely to submit to being bored panderedto preached at or intimidated            In each of these booksingeniously structured around the cycle of theHogwarts school yearRowling manages to impart new information about thewizard world and slyly fill you in in case youve missed the earlierinstallments something that will become increasingly important as the seriesfills its projected seven volumes and sales figures mount into the trillionsto advance the longterm narrative conflict about Harrys search for hisorigins and his Manichean struggle with Voldemort a wizard whos gone over tothe Dark Side and to create and resolve enough satisfying short andmiddleterm conundrums to make the volume stand alone            She also understands the importance of evil both metaphysical Voldemortand human Petunia and Vernon Dursley the Muggle aunt and uncle who raiseHarry in his orphanhood along with their dotedon sublimely piggish sonDudley are grotesques worthy of Roald Dahl Draco Malfoy Harrys nemesis atHogwarts and Severus Snape shes terrific with names the diabolical potionsteacher are brilliant foils for Harrys flawed instinctual goodness AndRowling understands that goodness is not the same as innocence a concept inwhich children have no interest knowing as adults refuse to that they areentirely without it The threesome of Harry Ron Weasely and Hermione Grangerwho is likely to be everybodys favorite character are believablymischievous competitive vain and for all their intelligence prone tochildish foolishness eg the clever studious Hermiones stubborn crush onthe egotistical charlatan Professor Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets             The Potter craze I think is not unlike the Star Wars phenomenon summers ago which also took the world somewhat by surprise although StarWars was more carefully calculated to appeal to both kids and adultswhereas the adult appetite for Harrys escapades seems to have been anticipatedby nobody Like the first Star Wars movie the Harry Potter books havean instantly classic ineffably oldfashioned quality about them Theyingeniously recombine elements of fairy tale religious allegory Harry as thechosen one halfremembered childhood reading and pop culture includingfairly explicitly in the case of Potter the Star Wars cycle itselfinto something new fresh and irresistible You feel somehow that they havealways been there waiting for you to discover You also feel in spite ofbeing one of several million crazed fans that they were written for you alonea wizard stranded in an uncomprehending Muggle world waiting for someone torecognize that what everyone else calls your abnormalities are really powersThis I think is the deep appeal of these books and of a number of the othersweve mentioned They tap into a universal condition of childhoodthe senseof being misunderstood different special            But why these books why now Its probably a mistake to try to read to muchcultural significance into their extraordinary successjust as it would be inthe case of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil  AngelasAshes  or the other outoftheblue runaway bestsellers of the past fewyears But it must mean something no What do you think            BestTony
