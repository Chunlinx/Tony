                                  MauMauing the Dogcatcher            Americans hate racism andthey love dogs so maybe its not surprising that prejudice among the pugs andpoodles is a growing national concern Actually the purported prejudice isamong dog owners not dogs But increasingly dogs are being talked about as ifthey had the same civil rights as humans and that the same rules of civildiscourse apply to man and his best friend alike The implied parallel can beseen as either an insult to the struggle against human racism or a commentaryon its occasional excesses Or of course it can be seen as perfectlyreasonable            The Complete DogBook was first published by the American Kennel Club in  Widelyconsidered the bible of dog breeding it is essentially the blue book for dogbuyers The  th edition was released in  but was recalled inApril of last year because of an uproar from breeders who contended that thebooks breed profiles perpetrated pernicious stereotypes The hottest issuewas that  dog breeds had been reclassified as not good for children            Hardest hit by this development were dachshund andChihuahua breeders whose product is often sold to kidsand without warninglabels of any kind At least they are ostensibly for the kids How many adultshave the guts to buy a dachshund without blaming it on the children On ABCNews Roger Caras president emeritus of the American Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals got right to the point To say that allthese dogs are this and all these dogs are that thats racism canineracism Carl Holder the outraged secretary of the Dachshund Club of Americatold the New York Times  You just cant make such a blanket statementabout dachshunds            Wait Why exactly cantwe make blanket statements about these anklesnapping pipe cleaners with feetDogs are not vehicles stamped out of an assembly line asserted Holder Eachone is an individual A week after the AKCs announcement Dr Vicki Hearneauthor of Animal Happiness  joined the battle in a New York Timesoped piece where she raised the specter of genocide or at least breedcleansing To brand dogs such as Chihuahuas as not good with children is notjust an insult it is a dangerous statement in an age when every state and manytowns have adopted or are considering laws restricting banning or evenrequiring the killing of particular suspect breeds            Nicholas Dodman of the Tufts University Animal BehaviorClinic charged that labeling Chihuahuas as bad with children was essentiallyblaming the victim Its mainly the childs fault because theyre doing reallystupid things with the dogs He told ABC Theyre pulling on their tails andpulling on their ears and poking in their eyes and doing lots of things andyou know you have to have a pretty long fuse to tolerate that The problemin other words is that children are bad with Chihuahuas Perhaps the solutionis to ban children            Eventually the kennelclub caved like Dennys before a class action suit The club recalled over copies of its bookat a cost of nearly and declared that theprofiles had been published with inadvertently incorrect and controversialinformation Also The AKC sincerely regrets the distress caused to dogowners and breeders by the errors AKC neither agrees with nor endorses thematerial This is a good start But where one wonders is the AKCs apologyto the dogs            Dont ask me whether each of the breeds on the AKCsblacklist can accurately be labeled good or bad for children But the idea thatstereotypes are not valid about breeds of dogs is ridiculous While it is truethat all dogs go to heaven there is a bowl curve when it comes to dogabilities and personalities Basset hounds are sweet and stubborn Goldenretrievers are beautiful joyous dumb blonds Border collies work hardevenwhen theyre asleep Mastiffs are lazy but lovable Labradors are the kind ofdogs you want to have a beer with Chihuahuas are snappish andtemperamental            Judging humans by thecolor of their skin is different than judging dogs by the texture of theircoats It is different even if you leave aside the question which I find easybut some people find difficult of whether dogs have the same moral claims ashuman beings to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Lets say they doEven if so the analogy of dog stereotypes to human racism is mistaken            Racism among humans is overwhelmingly based upon culturaldifferenceswhat breeders might call training The actual geneticdifferences between human races are so infinitesimal that making sweepingstatements is rarely useful and often dangerous Genetic differences betweenhuman races are literally superficial But the differences between purebreddogs are anything but Thats why they call it breeding For example bordercollies instinctively herd anything that moveswithout any training Put aborder collie in the living room during a cocktail party and soon youll findeverybody scrunched into the corner            Strong geneticdifferences among dog breeds are not just the result of natural selectionEvolution among dogs has got a big push from humans On ranches border colliepuppies are taken from the litter and tested for their instinctual desire toherd sheep The most fearless and enthusiastic pups are the most likely to bebred to pass that herding gene on to the next generation            Doggy eugenicists sometimes disagree about what traits theyought to be pushing Many border collie breeders for example take greatexception to the dog industrys emphasis on ideal appearance rather thanbehavior They fear that if border collies are bred for the color of theircoats rather than the content of their character eventually their herdinginstinct will fade away            Another example ispointers One need not be an expert in evolution or zoology to understand thatpointing at dinner rather than catching it is not a successful evolutionarystrategy But the reason pointers point is not that they are responding to acapital gains tax cut or any of the other incentives known to affect thebehavior of human beings It is that pointing has been bred into them Rightnow something called the Dog Genome Project is trying to isolate the variousgenes for breedspecific behaviors including the basenjis genetic reluctanceto bark and the bassets genetic refusal to catch Frisbees            Lovers of certain breeds readily acknowledge the positivegenetic tendencies of their favorite dogs Newfoundland and Portuguese waterdog owners want pooches that can swim Rottweiler owners want beasts thatprotect German shepherders like a good running buddy And basset people likeme want dogs that have the good sense not to do any of those things Butsuggest that negative behavior might be genetic too and dog nutsandincreasingly their lawyersdeclare that this is like saying Jews arenaturally greedy or that laziness is a genetic trait of blacks            Take the pit bull themost discriminated against dog in the country In most breeds a litter ofpuppies will have one alpha dog The alpha dog is the most aggressive male inthe group the one that instinctively wants to be leader of the pack and willnot bow out of a fight Pit bull litters are nearly all alphas If a child letsa pit bull gain alpha dominance watch out A tea party with Fido could turninto a bloodbath The pit bulls brain chemistry is the product of selectivebreeding too Unlike say a German shepherd pit bulls were not bred toprotect humans but to kill other dogs They are more prone to become addictedto endorphins which often translates into a lust for pain Thus they dontquit when their opponent is licked or when they are told to go to a neutralcorner Also most dogs have an instinctual body language If two dogs meet onthe street and they dont want to fight they bow their heads exposing theirnecks and demonstrating their vulnerability Its a nice gesture and pit bullsbow too But unlike any other breed they have an instinct for attacking theother dog while hes still bowed            In  New York Mayor Ed Koch tried to impose strictrules on pit bull ownership He called them the Great White Sharks ofDoggiedom New York courts ruled that such laws were prejudicial because oftheir disparate impact on owners of different breeds of dogs Other citiestrying to curb pit bulls met with similar rulings Since then groups like theAnimal Legal Defense Funddoes the name sound familiarhave been arguinghard that the issue isnt owners rights but dogs rights In vet malpracticecases and other instances of dog deaths reports Evan Gahr in the WallStreet Journal  lawyers frequently argue that compensation should bedetermined by the intrinsic value of the dog In dog attack cases animalbehaviorists psychiatrists and activists try to claim that the dogs weresimply misunderstood But whether theyre defending a dog that kills oreulogizing a dog that was killed the mythology that dogs are simply productsof their environments holds sway            Many people dont realizethat dogs were not made by God Rather God gave man the raw materialstheancient offshoot of the wolfand said show me what you can do Purebred dogshave been selectively bred for thousands of years in some cases Even amillennium of unnatural selection still leaves room for some environmentalinfluence A cocker spaniel that wears a Kick Dog for Service sign from till  will be a lot more likely to bite than a Rottweiler that grew up in aloving home Some dogs will be closer than others to the Aryan ideal of theirparticular breed But the worst herding border collie in the world will stillherd better than the most masterful Mexican hairless            A poodle will bite you for forgetting to put the accentmark over the e in Andr But you could use a bloodhounds tail as a jumprope and the worst youd get is a fierce yawn Yes it is possible to teach abloodhound to hate kids just as it is possible to teach poodles to be sleddogs But this would be conditioning against the grain of the breedspersonalities Canine racism may be a convenient way to shake down courts andcorporations But it drains the moral currency from a very real and stillunfortunately useful concept in the world of humans            There is simply no such thing as canine racism Infact some of my best friends are German shepherds
