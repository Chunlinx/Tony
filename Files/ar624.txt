                    Introduction        Autoreactive T cells are primarily eliminated in the        thymus by negative selection central tolerance Some of        the autoreactive T cells however may escape from negative        selection and are released into the periphery These        selfreactive T cells are exquisitely regulated and their        activation can result in autoimmune diseases There is        accumulating evidence that in addition to        activationinduced cell death or anergy Tcellmediated        dominant control of selfreactive T cells represents one        mechanism for maintaining immunological tolerance              Studies conducted in a number of experimental models have        demonstrated the existence of regulatory Tcell subsets        that prevent activation of autoreactive T cells Recently        a subset of CD T cells was identified that is present on         of CD T cells in normal nave mice and expresses        CD the chain of IL receptor      Functional        analysis of murine CD CD T cells showed that those        cells which constitutively express cytotoxic Tlymphocyte        antigen CTLA       fail to proliferate or secret        cytokines in response to polyclonal or antigenspecific        stimulation but inhibit the activation of conventional        responsive T cells         The suppressive activity        of the CD CD T cells depends on signaling via the        negative regulator of Tcell activation CTLA    and        requires a cellcell interaction that possibly involves        cell surface bound transforming growth factor TGF               It has been shown that        BCD costimulation is essential for the development and        homeostasis of the CD CD regulatory T cells            which play critical roles not only in preventing        autoimmunity but also in controlling tumor immunity and        transplantation tolerance             Proteoglycaninduced arthritis PGIA is a novel        autoimmune murine model that is induced by systemic        immunization of BALBc mice with cartilage proteoglycans             The development of PGIA is based on the        crossreactive immune response between immunizing human and        mouse self cartilage proteoglycans in genetically        susceptible BALBc mice      Several lines of        evidence indicate Tcell involvement in the pathogenesis of        PGIA First CD T cells selectively proliferate in        response to proteoglycan antigens     Second        prevention of arthritis can be achieved by         in vivo treatment with antiCD        monoclonal antibodies     Third arthritis can be        transferred to nave BALBc or severe combined        immunodeficient SCID mice using T and B cells from        arthritic animals       Fourth a        proteoglycanspecific Tcell hybridoma Thelper type        can induce arthritis in BALBc mice     Finally CD        T cells from arthritic animals are resistant to        activationinduced cell death     These data suggest a        breakdown of peripheral tolerance and accumulation of        autoreactive T cells in the periphery        In order to determine whether CD CD regulatory T        cells play a role in the development of PGIA we monitored        the CD CD expressing regulatory T cells in mice with        PGIA during an entire immunization period We also        transferred purified CD CD T cells from nave BALBc        mice together with spleen cells from arthritic animals or        alternatively transferred CD CD depleted spleen cells        from arthritic animals into SCID mice and then monitored        disease development in SCID mice In addition we examined        disease incidence in CDdeficient mice which have        deficiency in CD CD T cells Our data suggest that the        CD CD regulatory T cells might not be essential for        controlling the development of PGIA                    Materials and methods                  Antigen mice and immunization

maintained under germfree          conditions                          Assessment of arthritis          A standard scoring system based on swelling and          redness of each paw was used for the assessment of the          severity of disease The first clinical symptom of          swelling was recorded as the time of onset of arthritis          Joint swelling was scored ranging from  to  in each          paw and expressed as acute cumulative arthritis score          resulting in a possible maximum severity score of           Typically in the primary form of PGIA BALBc mice          developed swelling and redness in one or more limbs           days after the third injection with proteoglycan and          adjuvant In the transfer system recipient SCID mice          developed a

regulatory T cells          in PGIA          To elucidate the role of these regulatory T cells in          autoimmune arthritis we first followed up the CD CD          expressing regulatory T cells in mice with PGIA during          the entire course of immunization To exclude the          possibility that different CD CD expressing T cells          may be a strain andor antigendependent phenomenon we          immunized BALBc mice PGIAsusceptible strain and          CBL arthritisresistant strain with human cartilage          proteoglycan or ovalbumin As shown in Fig  BALBc          mice immunized with human cartilage proteoglycan started          to develop arthritis after the third injection and the          incidence of arthritis reached  at day  following          the third immunization whereas BALBc mice immunized          with ovalbumin or CBL mice immunized with          proteoglycan were completely resistant to PGIA The CD          CD expressing T cells detected  days after each          immunization from each experimental group were similar          during the entire course of immunization Fig a This          observation suggests that the CD CD regulatory T          cells might not be involved in the development of PGIA          Although it has been shown that the CD CD regulatory          T cells can suppress the development of autoimmunity a          recent report    demonstrated that depletion of the          CD CD T cells is necessary but not sufficient for          induction of autoimmune gastritis          It has been shown that the CD CD regulatory T          cells express CTLA       which is a negative          regulator of Tcell activation The suppressive activity          of the CD CD regulatory T cells may in part be          ascribed to signaling through CTLA CTLA may          transduce an activating signal to CD CD regulatory T          cells     Although we did not detect any significant          decrease in numbers of the CD CD regulatory T cells          between proteoglycanimmunized BALBc and CBL mice          this might be due to reduced expression of CTLA in the          CD CD regulatory T cells from proteoglycanimmunized          BALBc mice To test this possibility we then detected          CTLA expression on the CD CD regulatory T cells          using intracellular staining There was no significant          difference between levels of CTLA expression in the CD          CD regulatory T cells from each group Fig b This          finding excludes the possibility that reduced expression          of CTLA in the CD CD regulatory T cells from          BALBc mice with PGIA may mediate the induction of the          disease                          CD CD regulatory T cells may not control          autoimmune arthritis          To further investigate whether the CD CD T cells          play a role in PGIA we performed adoptive transfer          experiments using SCID mice as recipients Purified CD          CD regulatory T cells     from nave BALBc          mice together with  spleen cells from arthritic mice          that were depleted of CD T cells and  g          proteoglycan were injected intraperitoneally into SCID          mice     and the incidence and severity of disease          were monitored Note that we used different ratios of the          CD CD regulatory T cells to the effector cells and          we did not observe any suppression of arthritis          development As a control the same number of CD CD          T cells together with arthritogenic spleen cells that          were depleted of CD cells and proteoglycan were also          adoptively transferred into SCID mice The transfers of          CD CD T cells did not have any impact on incidence          and severity of the disease in SCID mice as compared with          transfer of CD CD T cells Fig a suggesting that          the CD CD regulatory T cells did not protect SCID          mice from arthritis To further verify these results a          depletion experiment was conducted Spleen cells from          arthritic animals either depleted of CD cells or          without depletion were injected into SCID mice together          with proteoglycan The incidence and severity of          arthritis in SCID mice receiving spleen cells containing          CD cells or spleen cells depleted of CD cells were          identical Fig b Proteoglycanspecific Tcell          proliferation and production of IL interferon          IL TGF            and antiproteoglycan autoantibodies          were comparable in both transfer groups Fig c The          inability of the CD CD regulatory T cells to          suppress PGIA was not due to loss of their suppression          activity because           in vitro the CD CD T cells          could effectively inhibit the proliferation of the CD          CD T cells Fig d left panel Interestingly          proteoglycaninduced proliferation of CD CD T cells          could not be inhibited by the CD CD T cells Fig          d right panel which is consistent with a recent          report that the effective function of the CD CD          regulatory T cells is Tcell receptor TCR specific              Collectively our data suggest that the CD CD          regulatory T cells may not be involved in the          development of PGIA                          CDdeficient mice have severely reduced CD CD          regulatory T cells but are resistant to PGIA          It has been shown that CDB interaction is          essential for the homeostasis of the CD CD          regulatory T cells that control autoimmune diabetes              Consistent with that report the expression of CD          CD regulatory T cells was found to be significantly          reduced as compared with that in wildtype BALBc mice          Fig a To investigate whether a deficiency in the CD          CD regulatory T cells may lead to an increase in the          development of PGIA we immunized wildtype and          CDdeficient BALBc mice with proteoglycan and disease          incidence was monitored In contrast to the report in          autoimmune diabetes     CDdeficient BALBc mice          were highly resistant to induction of arthritis albeit          at a low percentage of the CD CD regulatory T cells          observed in these mice Fig b Note that T cells from          proteoglycanimmunized CDdeficient mice proliferate in          response to proteoglycan stimulation albeit at a rate          lower than that in wildtype T cells Fig c          suggesting that CDdeficient T cells can be effectively          primed                            Discussion        A controlled balance between initiation and        downregulation of immune responses peripheral tolerance        is important for maintaining immune homeostasis whereas        dysfunctional immune regulation may lead to chronic        inflammation or autoimmunity     The CD CD        regulatory T cells have been shown to suppress        autoimmunity in several animal models     To evaluate        the role of the CD CD regulatory T cells in PGIA        three approaches were used First the numbers of the CD        CD cells in spleens of susceptible versus resistant or        ovalbumin immunized mice were assessed by flow cytometry at        day  following immunization No significant change in the        numbers of the CD CD cells was observed among        experimental groups tested Fig a Moreover the levels        of expression of CTLA in the CD CD cells was similar        between groups These data suggest that the CD CD        cells may not be involved in the development of PGIA        Although the immune system had been perturbed by        immunization CD T cells isolated  days after        immunization of each group did not show significant        increase in CD expression as compared with that in nave        mice suggesting that T cells activated by immunization had        become resting memory T cells        To further evaluate the role of the CD CD cells in        PGIA an adoptive transfer system was employed Different        ratios of activated effector cells CDdepleted spleen        cells to CD CD cells were tested in our cotransfer        experiments No suppression of development of PGIA in SCID        mice was observed Although one could argue that the ratio        of effector cells to regulatory cells is not sufficiently        great to inhibit disease we tested a wide range of ratios        of effector cells to regulatory cells    in our        transfer system and similar results were observed We did        not observe any inhibition at the ratios used in the        present study However we cannot completely exclude the        possibility that    ratios may be required for        suppression of PGIA In view of the published literature        this is unlikely because most studies of this type used        ratios greater than        This finding is further        supported by the evidence that adoptive transfer of        CDdepleted splenocytes from arthritic mice does not        exacerbate disease in SCID mice The CD CD T cells are        functionally normal because the CD CD cells can        significantly inhibit the proliferation of the CD CD        cells induced by TCR stimulation Fig d left panel No        alteration in IL and TGF production could be detected        in two transfer groups Fig c Taken together our data        suggest that the CD CD regulatory T cells may not        regulate the development of PGIA        We found that CDdeficient mice which have a low        frequency of CD CD T cells are resistant to PGIA        Although one may argue that in the absence of CD Tcell        priming by proteoglycan immunization may be defective        However CDdeficient T cells from proteoglycanimmunized        animals can proliferate in response to proteoglycan        stimulation         in vitro  albeit at a rate lower        than that in wildtype T cells which is consistent with        the report by OliveiradosSantos         et al      It has been        demonstrated that in the absence of CD engagement T        cells require very high TCR occupancy and prolonged        stimulation whereas CD costimulation allows T cells to        respond to lower degrees of TCR occupancy      In        support of this observation CD mice can still mount        immune responses which vary in magnitude and efficiency        depending on the antigen or infectious agent             Our results and those reported by others    suggest        that CD may regulate the threshold for Tcell activation        In support of this notion immunization of CDdeficient        mice with high concentrations of myelin basic protein        induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis at        similar prevalence and severity as in wildtype mice            Our data suggest that the CD CD regulatory T cells        might be important for controlling spontaneous models of        autoimmunity but not for induced models of autoimmunity In        induced models of autoimmunity the CDB interaction has        been shown to regulate disease susceptibility by rendering        autoreactive T cells anergic or alternatively by        upregulating the threshold for autoreactive Tcell        activation     Furthermore we previously showed that        impaired Fasmediated activationinduced cell death AICD        of autoreactive Thelper cells may be responsible for the        development of PGIA     Therefore AICD andor Tcell        anergy but not the CD CD regulatory T cells may be        responsible for deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T        cells in autoimmune arthritis                    Conclusion        Our results showed that the percentage of the CD CD        regulatory T cells does not change during the development        of PGIA The CD CD regulatory T cells do not protect        SCID mice from arthritis when they are cotransferred with        spleen cells from arthritic mice and proteoglycan into SCID        mice Transfer of spleen cells from arthritic mice        depleted of the CD CD regulatory T cells into SCID        mice does not accelerate the disease Furthermore        CDdeficient mice which are deficient for CD CD T        cells are resistant to PGIA Our data suggest that the CD        CD regulatory T cells may not be essential for        controlling experimentally induced autoimmune        arthritis                    Competing interests
