        our topic today     uh yeah something about the school system here   right and now im sort of  dont know if this an advantage or disadvantage my wifes a school teacher so   well then ill uh ill walk softly   no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade and you know there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i dont think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh   yeah   for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even  even in the seventh grade   what school system does she teach in   Plano School System but but to give you an example uh   oh wow   you know one of her kids will come in and hes you could tell hes just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principals office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it youre not allowed to send them home you know if you do that then your allocations cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just its its a numbers game i dont think thats right if theyre especially if theyre interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning   well i think its more of a theres a bigger problem here than uh than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program   yes   um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and its a public system however youd think that it was a private school because theyve taken it the best teachers and the best students theyve taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the systems very difficult but once youre in uh they have they have selfpaced programs and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh theres probably some discrimination if you wanna say that uh because  most of the people that are in the academy system   sure   uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system   sure   and most of thats not all true but im saying a large percentage of them are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does and so theres i think that uh thats my justification for saying that the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they dont know what their children are learning theyre theyre saying do your homework let me see it dont get in trouble at school or were going to be all over you   oh yeah my son had such a tough time in uh the school he went to but there was through it wasnt all the schools fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was   yeah   but uh had to be done at least it took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something   but ill tell you what theres a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today   yeah i think what weve done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that were trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed   yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate   and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if youre not dont have the proper education uh including uh exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you cant use a computer today and do word processing and do   you bet   database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you cant function   you bet   you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says were not going to pay you   well its different   unless you have the education and then education and then then we what weve done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself   sure well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just are always fighting the system i dont know if its better than any you know we came down to Texas from the uh New York area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i dont care where youre from and they they i dont know if they learn more but they certainly uh they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities
