   well what kind of music do you like to listen to    im pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh   are you   alternative to uh to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so im pretty open on that   oh you like country western   countrys not bad i can i grew up in Nebraska so it was like um yeah i i listen to it once in a while but its its probably not my my top mode i guess thats pretty pretty popular down in Plano though uh   yeah um yeah weve i mean it you know theres you have all sorts here too um i went to a pretty uh well the school i went to was Texas AM an and uh  either you either you went country western dancing or uh   oh yeah so you didnt do anything at all right   yeah  pretty much pretty much so so i have i really liked i liked it there but i also also like some of the Christian um contemporary music that they have play   huh uhhuh are you into the Garth Brooks thing at all or is that popular down there right now i know that hes kind of a big name right now   yeah yeah yeah its popular here and  uh theres all   yeah and youre also into the Christian contemporary stuff   yeah   yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um groups like uh im trying to remember DMZ   umhum   Resurrection Band uh what else there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into Petra as well   yeah   in fact its interesting he hes actually an engineer i dont i im going to school in Florida and hes an engineer that does sound mixing mixing right now for a Christian bands   oh really   so yeah hes pretty into it   thats fun   its been its been lucratim for him   well what you you mentioned alternative music   well yeah um kind of like   what is that   i dont know in the early seventies i think it was called punk rock   oh okay   but then now its its kind of taken a different slant and i think its its gone more diverse toward um not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs really a wider more eclectic uh tone flow and things like that so its i dont know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so um   umhum you said youre also a performer   yeah yeah i well i play the trumpet um and also keyboards i played keyboards for about uh oh i dont know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so   what do you perform do you oh wow   it its good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all   yeah um not on a consistent basis at this point  ive got three kids and theyre preschoolers so i do good to  get a book book read or newspaper read or anything so   yeah oh wow sure sure free time is not much of a luxury uh   yeah yeah   i know that feeling   in fact i do good to  listen to anything but kids tapes at this point because i know all the kids tapes its like yeah   yeah  yeah well maybe hey that may be more quality you know after all   they do have they do have some good tapes out there for kids we  i dont know um   yeah   Joe Scruggs is a guy that is out of Austin here that has some wonderful kids tapes its really i mean they are really fun and uh Joe Scruggs hes with hes an educational   Joe Scruggs huh   um its called Shadow Play and if you ever see any of his stuff he is just hes really good and  and um kids really like it   interesting uh when you said Scruggs i was thinking because Earl Scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player   yeah   and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the Beverly Hillbillies   uhhuh   he actually played part of that   oh   uh he and Lester Flats so uh i was thinking wow wonder if this is a relative   i dont know i dont know  well um  have you  um  theyre not theyre more uh oh have you ever heard of Riders In The Sky i dont know if theyre   but anyway   if theyre big up there in fact i think they may have even had a television show on Saturday mornings for kids   oh yeah i havent heard much about that no   um theyre pretty neat theyre kind of a a a blue grass country uh theyre real fun i mean theyre   yeah   theyre the guys that i mean they can yodel and they can they play the fiddles and the and the saws and stuff and theyre real fun theyre a real fun group   all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit   yeah   im uh im not quite at that point in my life yet so   yeah well yeah   itll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids music in at all so    well we saw them originally at a at a club down here um probably about oh seven or eight years ago and um   yeah   then just in the last i dont know two years we saw them on a TV show  and i think they were i think they were doing kids music but   umhum   what we saw in the you know was adult in the but i dont know i dont know where they run the gamut and i dont know um   right   you know i dont know if the south is more towards the you know has more of that crowd or not i dont know i dont know do you   umhum well its yeah its hard to tell i know you know like in the Appalachian Mountain area there that things real popular yeah i ive had some friends from West Virginia thats you know that its real popular around there   uhhuh well   and
