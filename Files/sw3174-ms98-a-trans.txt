        uh i work at TI and we have um of course started drug testing um  random drug testing here and um i havent gotten called yet but um       i feel that its probably pretty its pretty good if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs   do they feel that way   um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at TI but i think our latest statistic statistic said something like ninety nine point nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the drug on on all the testing   umhum well i i think its a good idea just because im opposed to to the drugs i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it its uh i dont know i dont really liken it   uhhuh umhum   to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think its a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because youre   umhum right   i dont know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs i would think that is that how they do it at TI maybe that   right   right i at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then youre put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then youre called like six months after you complete the program program and if you test positive then youre terminated   umhum well   i guess i i draw a hard line but you know i would im im in favor of of that type of thing that um   yeah uhhuh   you  you have people out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they cant do as good a job um as they might do   uhhuh thats right umhum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people if theyre if theyre not uh you know fully functional   umhum   mentally while theyre doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other another people umhum   right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that  whatever theyre taking at the time and and it would be uh   uhhuh   you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools  so ive you know had a   uhhuh thats right oh yeah uhhuh so  right   they they talk a lot about drugs there and i think its good that theyre trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools   right   but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs  you know and   umhum     if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both Sams and WalMart and i dont know how many others are   umhum uhhuh   doing that and and i think thats good because  so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh   oh yes umhum thats right   i dont know its just a problem that problem no one is sure just how to handle i think   umhum you know i think personally im for it theres several reason why i i could think of right now why we shouldnt have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it   really its that high   and yes and oh yeah its very expensive and um umhum its not like a normal urinalysis its very expensive to run them and um   oh i didnt realize it was that expensive umhum   i didnt get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise   umhum just lucky to have jobs   but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they werent spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so see there you know theres different i dont think that thats that i think thats more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because theres really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it   umhum i just i didnt think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period and Sams and WalMart are are   umhum   owned by the same people he took one for for uh WalMart for job hiring and then Sams called him and and  he took another one and i you know i dont know why they both   uhhuh umhum right   made him do that since it was so close together i can see if   umhum   because you know if its a thousand dollars thats a thousand dollars they wasted   their theirs might not run a thousand dollars our from what i understanding here at TI they run close to a thousand dollars an employee     well maybe they run i dont know you know thats just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe its under a health     umhum   type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i i just cant imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them   uhhuh but no for all the the oh its
