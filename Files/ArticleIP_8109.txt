                                 A Hundred Years of Lassitude            In  Edmund Wilsonpublished an interview with himself in the second issue of the New YorkReview of Books  The subject was why a new intellectual journal was neededand how it came to be The disappearance of the Times Sunday booksection at the time of the printers strike only make us realize it had neverexisted Wilson explained            Im notsure what it means that this remark is quoted without comment in the newanthology that commemorates  years of the New York Times Book Review Wilson was saying the Times book section was relentlessly dull Does theTimes agree The  page greatesthits collection Im afraid supportsthe criticism For all the effect it has had on the countrys literature theTimes Sunday book section might as well never have existed Today years after Wilsons jibe it remains the drab wallpaper of the book world Ifit vanished in another strike it is hard to think many people would missit            Why is the NYTBR so dreary Michael Wolff the mediacolumnist of New York magazine  wrote an article a few weeks agocomplaining that the section fails to capitalize on the new commercialenvironment in which books are marketed and sold He thinks the NYTBRcould make more money by being less independent I kept waiting for Wolff tosay he was joking but apparently he wasnt The Times deserves to becongratulated not scolded for its determination to avoid pandering to thetrade by reviewing selfhelp manuals or boosting Oprahs book club            Buthighmindedness only gets you so far The real problem with the NYTBR for the  years or so that I have been reading it without much pleasure isits aversion to argument and controversy Pick up just about any issue and whatyoull find is a kind of literary balma quietly reverential attitude towardbooks in general combined with a disinclination to ruffle feathers CharlesChip McGrath the editor since  has elevated the tone somewhat Moredistinguished authors contribute longer reviews about weightier books Butsomehow the section still feels dutiful It reads as if the people writing forit and editing it arent having any fun and dont think readers shouldeither            Magazine editors generally try to make articlesas interesting as possible and to make them look even more interesting thanthey are At the NYTBR  the principle seems to be reversed Avoidanything too interesting and if you happen to get it anyhow disguise it Onthe cover where the widely read lead review once began there is now areliably hideous fullpage color illustration accompanied by a genericheadline Artist of Adventure says the cover of the issue that comes out onSunday This is the billing for a new biography of NC Wyeth the illustratorwhose family saga is a tasty Gothic talesomething of which you get no hintunless you read all the way through the jump The review is by Adam Gopnikone of the funniest writers around But somehow it feels as if his talent isbeing withheld You read the review and wish the author felt he could cutloose            The restof the  page section contains a mix of strong writers being stifled orperhaps preemptively stifling themselves and weak ones being given too muchspace to say too little This issue contains  regular reviews  reviews ofchildrens books in a special section  brief reviews  more paperbackreviews and a roundup of new science fiction titles Covering  plus books ina week the usual number is more like  to  pleases the NYTBR sadvertisers in the publishing houses by providing much fertile territory forblurb mining But the rest of us are drowning Inside the back page theresone article thats not a review the Bookend This weeks column is by MeghanDaum a freelance writer who says she cant figure out a topic to write a bookabout The reader staggering across the finish line can only pray that shedoesnt            People who write for the NYTBR all have storiesabout how the section resists strong criticism and colorful writing Theproblem starts with the bias in favor of specialists An assistant professor ofphilosophy given a new biography of David Hume is likely to assume an interestin the subject and focus on the significance of the book to his field A goodintellectual journalist given the same assignment would probably focus more onthe question of Humes relevance today and whether the book is interesting to anonphilosopher McGrath seems to have tipped the balance a bit in the directionof journalists But since good manners are the rule the generalists often endup sounding as obtuse as the experts In the current issue for instance areview of a book about WalMart says the author cant make up his mind aboutwhether WalMart is good or bad But the reviewer cant make up her mind eitherand passes up the opportunity to say somethinganythingabout a company thathas transformed American culture The result is waffling squared            The triedand true formula for an  word review is to meander on the general topic forthree paragraphs summarize the book in four more note a flaw in thepenultimate paragraph and close with an upbeat summation on the order ofStill Moon Over Nova Scotia is a valuable contribution to ourunderstanding of the shifting fortunes of the Atlantic eel fishing industryThe new anthology includes a review of Mein Kampf from  that followsthis form It spends three paragraphs pondering German history four describingthe intelligent Mr Hitlers book and ends with a complaint about his dislikeof the Jews which the reviewer regards as a flaw in an otherwise impressivelist of accomplishments Click for a sample of this wacko analysis            Excessive negativity has evidently always beendiscouraged Most reviewers have figured out that raves are often played bigBut if the reviewer trashes a book especially one that is in any way marginalthe odds diminish that his review will be published If it does run it willprobably be in the back near the ads for electric toothbrushes and the IttyBitty Book Light Moreover editors are likely to blunt the criticism in abackhanded way They may for instance as I heard from one contributorapologize for having to cut a reviewers most clever lines for space Howmuch easier then to be agreeable            Why woulda newspaper section avoid conflict the mothers milk of journalism I thinkthe instinct stems from the papers not unrealistic sense of its own power andresponsibility Though the NYTBR cant hurt Tom Clancy and probablycant help most academic specialists for a lot of writers in between notgetting reviewed in the Times or receiving a harsh review can nail thecoffin shut Other publications can be cavalier without worrying aboutsquashing an authors budding career The giant Times cant            So the review has grown a large bureaucracy designed toprevent any unfairness Half a dozen Preview editors leaf through thehundreds of books published each week to choose the lucky few that are worthreviewing relegating some to the Books in Brief section in the back Theythen look for someone qualified to write on the subject but without any biasNo one who is a friend enemy colleague or rival of the author is supposed toget an assignment PreMcGrath it was even forbidden to review a bookpublished by ones own publishing company This near cult of fairness preventsconflicts but it also prevents interest And the bureaucratic approachprevents the section as a whole from taking positions onor creatingliteraryissues Are biographies too long Does womens fiction get short shrift Isacademic literary criticism headed down a blind alley The NYTBR isntjust agnostic on such questionsit doesnt even like to consider them            Its instructive to contrastthis with the approach of the leading British papers The book review sectionsof the Sunday Times  Sunday Telegraph  and Observer  aswell as the Times Literary Supplement and the delightful LondonReview of Books  look to conflicts to generate interest The famous letterto the Times Sirs of all the people who might have reviewed my bookcould you not find one who was not my former wifemay be apocryphal But itgets at the spirit of British reviewing which is that the sometimes pettyclash of literary opinion is good sport Regular Sunday reviewers on the modelof Cyril Connolly the longtime critic for the Sunday Times  becometrusted guides And the British book reviews are more like publicationsrevolving around literary life than mere reviews They contain diaries poemspuzzles and interviews The best book review section in an American paper atthe momentthe Los Angeles Times Book Review is much closer to thisvariety model            The NYTBR could makeitself more interesting by going halfway British My suggestion would be todrop the rules against conflicts of interest in favor of a simple one that saysmaterial biases should be disclosed Hire a regular columnist to write everySunday The prodigious James Wood the most gifted literary critic of hisgeneration springs to mind Lose the dismal cover illustrations and return tohaving a lead review or cover essay Break the monotony of  sequentialreviews with fulllength author interviews which the Times used tohave letters from abroad debates and a gossip column Encourage a feistyletters page Blow off the brief reviews Take chances Crusade Quit being sodamned responsible
