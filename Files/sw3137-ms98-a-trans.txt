            well uh Cathy do you have any pets in your home   we do actually we have a a Golden Retriever a dog and we have a cat and we have we just got two um   how nice umhum   Russian Dwarf hamsters  which  dwarf hamsters lucky us huh   dwarf hamsters how big is a dwarf hamster   real small theyre maybe about oh two inches long theyre real small theyre real tiny theyre cute they really are cute     yeah my goodness where did you get those   uh my sons baseball coach uh had two and then had multiple  hamsters that he was trying to get rid of   uhhuh   and so thats thats where we got them from now weve been assured theyre both males and theyre in two separate cages so we dont want any   well okay i was going to say that   we dont want to go into the dwarf hamster business     oh   how about you   well right now we dont have any pets weve uh weve tried various things we you know obviously do have children   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh we tried a dog first and we had a a puppy a uh       a what did they call him a Westie   uhhuh is uh is are they very small uhhuh   theyre small uhhuh its a terrier and uh that didnt work out very well   oh uhhuh   and uh for a variety of reasons but the the dog was just all mouth and teeth it seemed like the only way it could of show affection was by nibbling you on things   oh really yeah oh no kidding uhhuh   yeah so it it never worked out and uh so we we have we gave up on that and then we tried cats   uhhuh   and we ended up with a a bad set of cats if thats possible but im a im a big fan of cats i always had cats growing up   oh umhum are you yeah   and uh my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and   uhhuh   uh so we gave it a try and uh they were impossible to house train   really boy thats real unusual for cats usually you just put down a litter box and thats the end of that yeah   thats the end of that and these it was real strange and uh they were both solid white cats   umhum   and uh one had blue eyes and the other had white regular you know yellow eyed cats   umhum umhum   brothers and sisters and we had them declawed and we had them neutered and uh invested all all that money in it into it but uh we simply one of them in particular we just could not uh train to use we tried different types of litter changed it frequently and it was just unbelievable   really really huh huh oh   and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to to give it a try with them   uhhuh   and sure enough it it worked worked worked for a little while and then they too couldnt seem to get them to use the litter box   really really hum   uh so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a try and thats when i lost track of these two cats   yeah really yeah yeah oh thats too bad   yeah that was that was pretty sad because uh it took a lot of lobbying just to get the cats in the house to begin with so we sure couldnt make another try at it   sure sure sure yeah yeah well we were real fortunate with our pets um when my husband and i were getting married we we had both been married before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families course through uh P I S T you know they how they have the effective parent parent training effectiveness effectiveness training   hum right right   and uh so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitt the person who was teaching the course said sometimes when you have children on this side and children on this side you have a you know a mutual child that brings the family together and we looked at each other and laughed and said well get a dog  and uh   yeah i bet thats funny   and uh so we i had always wanted a Golden Retriever i just think theyre real neat dogs that thats a nice breed you know theyre real calm and gentle and and whatnot so my husband thought well for Christmas he was going to surprise me with a puppy and he was looking around for a puppy and then um he saw he decided just on a whim i think ill call the SPCA   umhum   and he called the Dallas SPCA and he said you wouldnt happen to have a Golden Retriever would you and they said you wont believe it but we had one dropped off last night   good grief   and hed they said hes AKC registered hes two years old and hes going to go fast   ill bet yeah   so we thought okay whats wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know thats a nice dog somethings got to be wrong with this dog   right   nothing is wrong with it we have had him now for three years and just love him to death he is wonderful yeah he is hes a great dog hes hes   well thats great   he makes a real lousy uh watchdog though because he he just loves everybody and he wags his tail and you know hes hes great hes great we just we think hes wonderful and our cat just kind of you know pays us the time of day when hes in the mood and otherwise we dont see him   yeah is it primarily outdoor cat then or just   yeah he is he comes in and he goes out hes he kind of   yeah   you know is just around we we dont really dont see him except for feeding time you know or when he wants when hes in the mood for a little affection   thats interesting hell show up huh   hell show up yeah yeah but so thats our family and we just you know uh everybody seems to get along real well the kids the dog and the cat so were okay   umhum great   yeah   well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet   the hamsters actually its the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week   oh   and the first night we had them somebody knocked over the cage and we thought it was the cat we really did we blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had disappeared and had been eaten but we found him he he just he narrowly escaped with his life but he was found   umhum     but since then we have discovered the dog sits and watches them for hours on end   oh my goodness   you know theyll get going in the little wheel and hell sit there and just stare at them so im wondering now if it really was the cat who knocked them off the shelf it might have been it might have been the dog   yeah   but the cat doesnt seem to be too bothered with them its its the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters its its funny   ill be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and small birds   yeah yeah uhhuh   and its amazing what their cat has been able to do   really   i think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those small creatures   out really   eventually to get them out to get the cage down from wherever it is even if its the top of the refrigerator   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   to get that cage down and into it somehow   yeah yeah well we warned them you the kids you know we said you know with the cat in the house you know these may not last too long   umhum is that right   but he doesnt seem to be bothered with them you know hes real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know hes hes not too bad   umhum yeah   but so are you going to try again with another cat sometime   well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time   yeah yeah   and uh
