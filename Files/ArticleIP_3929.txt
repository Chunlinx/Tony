                                  Authorized Freud                        Some notes regarding theKatha PollittAndrew Sullivan dialogue in The Book Club about my new anthology Unauthorized FreudDoubters Confront a Legend              One of the few points onwhich these commentators fully agree is that I am a village atheist They arehowever sadly mistaken I was born and raised in Philadelphia             It is true alas asSullivan observes that I am not in command of my senses and that in fact Iam an outright maniac I must also concede that my articles on Freud and therecovered memory movement in the New York Review of Books articles thatSullivan hasnt readwere as he judges tirades But from now on by virtueof studying Sullivans own understated prose I hope to cultivate a morerational and deliberate manner             Does Crews need to see ashrink Sullivan is not the first reader to have posed this profounddiagnostic question Indeed it has been the standard retortpioneered by noless an authority than Freud himselfthat Freudians throw back at those whochallenge the empirical credentials of psychoanalysis See the concludingchapter of my book The Memory Wars              It is less than cogent toview the historical Freud through the lens of ones own contemporarypsychotherapeutic involvement Nor it is helpful to lump psychoanalysis andpsychotherapy together as Sullivan does I have never attacked psychotherapyby which I mean the general enterprise of helping people talk through theiranxieties and face the difficulties in their immediate circumstances Thetarget of my skepticism has been psychodynamic therapy whereby thepatients manifestly perceived problems beliefs and feelings are treated asmere compromise formations tossed to the surface by deep turmoil that canonly be resolved by dredging for repressed memories Oedipal cravings and thelike If I am to be deemed a maniac lets at least try to state correctly whatit is Ive been raving about             Nearly everyone who isignorant of the critical literature assumes that Freud made some genuinediscoveries but the list varies according to taste Sullivan for example isquite sure that Freud was right about repression resistance transference theOedipus complex dream interpretation and God help us the probable originsof homosexuality Thus when Sullivan found me asserting what nearly anyresearch professor of psychology could have told himthat not onedistinctively Freudian concept or hypothesis has survived independentscrutinyhe gave a horrified glance at my chapter titles abandonedUnauthorized Freud  and pronounced me insane If he had kept on readingas Pollitt did he would have encountered reasoned arguments by philosophersand historians challenging each and every Freudian notion that he considersselfevident             Pollitt and Sullivanalike deem me insensitive to the depth and complexity of the psyche andSullivan warmly endorses psychoanalyst Jonathan Lears admonition that we darenot reject Freud lest those qualities drop out of sight But neither Pollittnor Sullivan nor Lear understands that psychoanalysis has been a means ofsimplifying the mind by presuming sexual and aggressive motives to beinvariably primary and by invoking deterministic mechanisms that always leadto a few banal and arbitrary causative factors As my introduction points outpsychoanalysis would be helpless to address the intricacy of Freuds owndevious and supersubtle mind Only when we have grasped the full extent of theFreudian intellectual fiascoit is adumbrated in my book but exhaustivelyexplored in Malcolm Macmillans Freud Evaluated The Completed Arcwill we be able to talk about motives with an adequate respect fortheir actual variety and volatility            Finally Pollitt and Sullivan are disappointed that Unauthorized               Freud doesnt pay homage to Freuds cultural importance in our centuryTruebut I fully grant that importance Quite simply my book asks whether itwas attained with or without the benefit of accurate clinicalobservation defensible drawing of inferences and encouraging therapeuticresults The answer is without them Once that fact has sunk in a culturalhistorian can assess the true magnitude of the problem that UnauthorizedFreud only glancingly treats how  th century secularintellectuals not excepting journalists in therapy could have been sothoroughly bamboozled             FrederickCrews Berkeley Calif                           High andMighty A Low Blow                        About Seth

                Jacob Weisbergs Aug The Browseron uncritical movie critics is wrong I think to suggest that mainstreamcritics should ignore blockbusters or dismiss them in a paragraph Most readersof mass circulation newspapers and magazines are intensely interested in suchtitles and I find my reviews of movies such as Godzilla Armageddon  The Lost World  Starship Troopers  Lost inSpace  Halloween H  BASEketball  Air Force One etc to be invaluable opportunities to help open their eyes to the clichs andstupidities being retailed by the filmmakers He is wrong too to say of myfavorable review of The Negotiator that I overpraised it in acringemaking way I did indeed say it really hums along in the secondsentence of an opening paragraph which if he had quoted it all would havedestroyed his point I invite any                   Slate                reader to examine myentire review anddecide if it supports Weisbergs generalizations            The technique ofgeneralizing from an exception to the rule is an effective but not honorablejournalistic practice If Weisberg will take a closer look he will find I havegiven negative reviews to most of the bigbudget blockbusters of recent yearsand that I review more foreign art documentary and indeed films likePi and Taste of Cherry  in a month than                   Slate                doesin a year            Weisbergs technique is to selectively choose those titles from each criticthat illustrate his point while remaining deliberately oblivious to reviews bythe same critic that would weaken it The article works only if                  Slate                readers take him at his word for example that Gene Siskelgave Armageddon a rave he did not And it is not fair to criticizeJanet Maslin for praising Lethal Weapon  while suppressing theinformation that I for example disliked it because that would not help hiscasejust as the information that Maslin disliked many of the other films hementions would also not serve his thesis If you are going to criticizecritics you have to be a better critic than he is in this essentiallyunresearched piece which is excellent only as an example of the off the top ofthe head
