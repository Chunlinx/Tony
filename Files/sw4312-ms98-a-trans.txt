        what kind of music you into     well i have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music in fact its easier for me to say uh the types of music that i dont like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal   the opera yeah its right on track i like classical but i cant deal with opera at all   ive   and heavy metal uh its noisy im into uh some industrial music thats a a bit even harder than that but its its got to have a point to it   uhhuh oh i dont mind music thats difficult to listen to but uh the the uh       basic point of heavy metal which which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying     yeah       what kind of progressive stuff   oh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh oh you know im thirty so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and REM   uh   that sort of stuff uh REM makes me laugh because theyve gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and its not really that theyve changed their musical style so much as the stream changed   oh yeah yeah its a lot of people like like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out i think thats pretty much you know bull   uhhuh   because REM really hasnt changed its its its interesting theyre producing uh similar music and its good music but you know people have picked up on it   uhhuh   thats good im impressed   i think it is uh for a while there music seemed to really have popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh the Michael Bolton Michael Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes       oh yeah   and i could uh go down to a bar thats about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money   uh but he picked the right songs and   i guess   and that  thats about all he had going for him or still has for that matter   that that and a marvelous hairdo   oh yeah yeah im sure that that sold that sold a lot for him thats all you really need for a lot of lot of pop im kind ive kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop         it just seems like theres no no real point you hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises and   uhhuh well its its interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music   uhhuh   and i like a lot of classical music but i also dislike uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music       and feel that if if its not seventy five years old it hasnt stood the test of time     yeah i can i can believe that what kind of things are you do you like in classical whats the standard   uh stuff that i like uh i like Bach i tolerate Vivaldi i cant stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy           uh uh i like Tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when hes uh so inclined uh and some of some   oh yes   stuff that i like uh for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition   uhhuh   and thats interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded       uh philharmonic uh just because number one its Frank Zappa and hes weird number two isnt he still alive       you know were were much better off playing uh Beethovens ninth thats right you know well well do well do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it     its safe   and it it it just isnt chance taking enough for me       uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if youve heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
