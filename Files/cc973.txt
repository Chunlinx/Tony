                    Introduction        There is growing interest in intensive care medicine in        scoring systems for measuring the severity of illness and        predicting outcome in critically ill patients Since         the GCS   has been routinely applied in intensive care        units and emergency prehospital settings The GCS provides        a good basis for assessing the depth of consciousness and        coma This scale together with other neurological        assessments      should be administered as soon        as possible in emergency situations and may be repeated at        intervals especially when neurological function is        fluctuating          The GCS was developed as a means for grading patients        with traumatic brain injury and for predicting their        chances of neurological recovery Clinicians now use GCS as        the only neurological predictor in many prognostic systems        such as APACHE APACHE II APACHE III Acute Physiology        Score APS and Simplified Acure Physiology Score SAPS               The MEES is a descriptive scoring        system that includes the GCS assessment   In theory        the prognostic APACHE II and the descriptive MEES scoring        systems are more relevant to prediction of outcome in        critically ill patients because the GCS assessment is        included in these systems On the basis of other parameters        arterial pressure heart rate respiratory rate        oxygenation chronic health points age points the MEES        descriptive and APACHE II prognostic systems should be        better than the GCS at predicting outcomes        The purpose of the present study was to assess the value        of scoring systems in predicting outcome in nontraumatic        coma patients and to evaluate the importance of mental        status measurement in relation to outcome                    Patients and methods        This prospective study was undertaken over a year        period and included  consecutive patients hospitalized        for nontraumatic coma The inclusion criteria were GCS          and specific medical diagnoses as follows hypoxic or        ischaemic injury focal cerebral injury general cerebral        injury metabolic or septic encephalopathy and        druginduced coma or toxic injury including drug overdose        and coma persisting  h after discontinuation of toxic        substances        In the prehospital setting postintervention values        before admission of the patient to hospital for the MEES        and GCS scales were measured in each patient Table  The        APACHE II score was recorded on the day of admission to        hospital          The sensitivity specificity and predictive power of        each cutoff point were calculated from the twobytwo table        in SPSS for Windows MIcrosoft Washington USA for APACHE        II MEES and GCS   The Youden index was also used to        determine the best cutoff points the higher the index the        better the prediction at the cutoff point          Percentages of correct predictions of mortality were        obtained at these same cutoff points For each score ROC        curves were obtained    The ROC curve depicts the        relation between truepositive results number of predicted        deaths among those who actually died and falsepositive        results number of predicted deaths among those who        actually survived for each score The greater the area        under ROC curve the better the scoring system The ROC        curve was calculated using the Systat software Systat Inc        Evanstan IL USA The outcome predictions data were        analyzed using McNemars test The comparasions of the        areas under the ROC curves and the analyses of the        differences of Youden index were performed using the method        described by Hanley and McNeil            P   was considered        statistically significant Values are expressed as mean         standard error                    Results        Of the  patients included in the present study         died in hospital The patients who died were older than        those who survived    years versus           years         P   and a higher proportion        were males  The scores for all three scales were        better in survivors than in those who died APACHE II           versus             P   MEES    versus                    P   GCS    versus                    P   The distributions of        APACHE II MEES and GCS scores are given in Fig         Hypoxic or ischaemic injury

Subjective evaluations of clinical status by individual        clinicians may differ in terminology and even in        measurement of the severity of illness Hence various        descriptive and prognostic evaluation scales scoring        systems have been developed during the past three decades        Objective evaluation of clinical status would facilitate        comparison of methods staff clinical centres and studies                   The need for such        evaluation scales is particularly evident in coma patients        and even more so in patients with alterations in        consciousness The aim of research in this area is to        obtain a reliable and sensitive scale        In  such research resulted in the GCS           Since this scale was reported numerous studies have        examined its value in assessing clinical status and        prognosis Initially the scale was used in patients with        head injury   but later it became widely used in        evaluating central nervous system lesions and state of        consciousness        With the development of emergency medicine a need arose        for evaluation scales that would provide rapid triage and        objective status assessment On the other hand a        prehospital evaluation scale would be optimal if apart        from being descriptive it had a prognostic component and        would therefore be applicable to hospitalbased observation        of the patient Among the various scales MEES has        attracted attention because of its applicability in trauma        and illness   Cho and Wang   concluded that for        headinjured patients the GCS has good predictive value        for hospital mortality in comparison with other evaluation        scales The latter scale has also attracted attention        because of its simplicity        In view of the experience with these scales in traumatic        coma we conducted a comparative study in nontraumatic        coma The need for accurate prediction of mortality in        nontraumatic coma by GCS was identified by Plum and Levy        in    In their comparison of GCS with other        neurological tests Levy         et al   demonstrated that the GCS        has good predictive value A number of studies                 have emphasized the importance of        aetiology which together with GCS represents a good        combination for better prediction of mortality In our        work we have also observed the prognostic value of        individual elements of the electrocardiogram in coma        following cerebrovascular accident and organophosphate        poisoning Romera   demonstrated that GCS score        correlates with APACHE II score in patients who have        suffered a cerebrovascular accident also the former is        simpler and has fewer parameters It was concluded that GCS        was because of its simplicity and rapidity a better scale        than the Simplified Acute Physiology Score for prediction        of mortality in patients with cerebroventricular accident        Kriger         et al   identified a correlation        between intracranial pressure analyses of evoked        potentials and GCS score regardless of aetiology of coma        Those investigators also concluded that GCS is a good        prognostication tool as compared with other more        complicated methods        In the present study coma patients were grouped on the        basis of aetiology according to the method of Sacco         et al   No statistically        significant differences in accuracy of prognosis prediction        were identified for the three scales assessed For        prehospital work this finding is important because it        shows that GCS does not deviate significantly either from        the MEES scale which has more parameters or from the        APACHE II scale which is measured in hospital GCS has        important advantages over other scales because it enables        rapid evaluation of status and may direct necessary        interventions Furthermore it is possible to observe        continuously the state of consciousness and to identify        eventual improvement indicating efficacy of therapy or        deterioration GCS is widespread and clinicians are        familiar with it This scale therefore facilitates good        clinical communication between prehospital work and        further hospital procedures and treatments        The GCS values determined before hospitalization of the        patients and the APACHE II scores determined on the first        day of hospitalization enabled us to compare descriptive        and prognostic scales directly We compared the prognostic        value of postintervention prehospital values of GCS and        hospital values of APACHE II We found that the prehospital        GCS assessment was as good a predictor of mortality as was        the APACHE II score as measured in the hospital The GCS        is well established and its simple application before        admission to hospital and during hospital treatment        facilitates continuous evaluation of the patients state        and allows prognostic evaluation in nontraumatic coma
