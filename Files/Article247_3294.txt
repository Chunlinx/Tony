                                 Big Float From Brit IPO                        The Times headline Tuesday morning said Internet Stock FeverSpreads to Britain as Freeserves Issue Surges And indeed freeInternetaccess provider Freeserve did see its shares jump  percent on itsfirst day of trading Of course for US investors a  percent gain hardlyconstitutes Internet fever But thats in no small part due to one crucialdifference between the American model and the nascent European one WhenEuropean companies go public there are a lot of shares to buy and sell            In the short term after all the prices of many American Internet IPOs havebeen inflated by the fact that there are just too few shares out there to meetdemand A typical Internet IPO these days will offer somewhere between million and  million shares That has two consequences It means companiesdont raise as much cash in the IPO as they might otherwise and it means thatthe pop on the first day of trading is larger than it otherwise would be Andwhile those  percent and  percent leaps get lots of attention thecompany reaps no longterm benefits from them            Freeserve by contrast is no bigger as a business that most American Netstartups In fact with just  million pounds in its first eight months ofoperation its probably smaller than most But in the offering yesterday itfloated  million shares  million were offered by its parent and million by Freeserve itself raising almost  million pounds Now the million is still just a fifth of all the shares outstanding But the fact thatthe floatthe shares that can be bought and sold by the publicis so largealmost certainly kept the stock from rising even more sharply when it firstopened Of course thats kind of scary when you consider how audacious themarkets valuation of Freeserve is This is a company with less than million in annual revenue which now has a market cap of  billion            In the long run the size of the float doesnt determine anything If demandfor shares remains strong companies eventually offer more shares for sale insecondary offerings And if the company is a dog then not even having a smallfloat can save it When it comes to stocks rarity doesnt mean value in thelong run Given that more Net companies should think about forgoing thepleasure of getting big headlines after their first day of trading and chooseinstead to get a real sense of what the market thinks of them On the otherhand I suppose that finding out what the market really thinks of them is thelast thing that a lot of Net companies want
