                     Hi how are you                     Fine                     Whats your name                     Caroline Silva                     Caroline Silva Ill be asking you some questions         Uh what stories do you remember that your family members used to tell you                     Um stories about when they were little                     Any that you remember                     Not really because I was I think I was too young when they told me that I dont exactly remember         But like my mothers mother my grandmother she like told us about how when she was very young and her mother die so she had to go and work and help her family                              And from when you were little do you remember somebody telling stories other stories                     Um                  My mom used to tell us stories at night and they were sort of like be made up stories that she like made up sort of about the day so she used me and my sisters name in it and theyd be funny because they werent true but they had like I was a character in them and so was my sister         and we can be anything from animals to humans         And it sort of told about what you did during the day and how you acted                     Did you enjoy those stories                     I did                     Um do you remember at what time she used to say that                     Well         before we went to bed         But if it was like too late already well we didnt listen to them we couldnt she didnt tell them to us because we had to go to bed but whenever she had time she would tell us                     Do you remember how your bedroom used to look when you were that that young                     No                     Do you remem                      But I shared it with my sister         I know that                              Uh huh                     I think we lived in an apartment         And                              What city                     Miami Florida                     Uh huh         So you are from Miami                     Yes                              What about books         Do you remember reading books when you were young                     Um in kindergarten at five my kindergarten teacher Mrs Thorpe started teaching us how to read and the alphabet and so we used to have these um little books that had like a sentence or less per page and it had like a really big big picture on every single page         So if you didnt understand what it said you could sort of comprehend with the picture and that got me interested in reading more         So I started reading bigger books little by little                     Do you remember the names of those little books                     Um like some of them were like called Sam I Am         They didnt have more that a title probably like three words in it                              Uh hum         So youre saying you dont remember much about the house that you used to live                     Yeah                     Do you remember somebody telling you stories when you were little         When you were young                     Yes         I dont remember exactly what the stories were but I know that like the grownups in the house like during Christmas or reunions or whenever we saw each other we would talk at the dinner table and they like told about old times and wed laugh         or any where in the living room                     But you dont remember any about yourself                     Yes um like they used to tell me stories that went I was little I used to climb everywhere around the house         And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldnt reach and so you said my mom said to get to find a way to get it and so I dont remember what I grabbed but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didnt think that I would actually do it         Another one was when I think I was younger than that I was trying to climb up on a couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody shes going to fall shes going to fall shes going to fall she fell because I did fall and everybody laughed and I think they took a picture of me when I was like climbing up the couch or whenever I was on that couch         But they sort of told me that from climbing all over the couches I sort of ruined them                     Uh oh         Do you like to read                     Yes                     What kind of readings                     Fictional books mainly like about the future that like make me think and wonder and you know grab my attention                     Will you say that youre a good reader                     Yes                     Why                     Well mainly almost everybody does and I think I do read like really good         And like usually like my sister comes up to me and once Im done reading a book shell go like How can you read that fast         you know                     What you mean fast                     Well I can probably get a thick book and finish it in a day         It depends how long I like stay on it         And so         I mean everyone is different         Like she cant read that fast but I can read that fast and understand whats in the book and dont have to read it again         Um so thats what I mean by like I can read fast                     Do you have a collection of books or do you have a lot of books at your house                     Um I have a certain collection thats called Animorphs         Its like one of those fictional type of futuristic type books and I like to collect
