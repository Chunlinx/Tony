                       NOPESesame                        I am an artist and mymedium of choice is neon I just read Michael Dolans Sign o the Times whichwas very informative and accurate            As someone working in neonI have made a couple of OPEN signs As an artist though with a thing forlanguage and how it is transformed by how it is represented I had beenthinking about the power that the blazing OPEN sign has in our culture To thatend I made an OPEN sign sculpture in which the letter N swings from one endof OPE to the other alternately spelling OPEN or NOPE I only made onebecause I had to engineer the mechanical arm to swing that Nplus I had asmall microprocessor designed and programmed to control the swing over when agear motor turns on and switches the letter position            The wholeidea comes from the OPEN sign phenomenon where one might be rushing to thestore just before closing time or maybe during imagined weekend hours only tofind upon arrival that one is too late or too early NOPE             Michael RFlechtner                                       BoogieMan                        For the most part I have toagree with Alex Ross contention in Bogus Nightsthat indie films have been overpraised by critics Deconstructing Harrywas one of the most joyless excruciating moviegoing experiences Ive ever hadand Im glad to know Im not the only person who thought Boogie Nightswas wildly overhyped for a movie that was declared brilliantly original itsure looked derivative to methere was hardly a shot or sequence in the filmthat didnt echo a similar usually superior shot or sequence in anotherfilm And while I enjoyed Neil LaButes In the Company of Men for itsamazing trio of performances its true that the film itself was little morethan a rigged stuntDavid Mamet Lite            However Atom Egoyans TheSweet Hereafter does not I feel belong in this group Though it has flawsEgoyans decision to romanticize the fatherdaughter incest blunted the forceof the ending The Sweet Hereafter has none of the insufferablesmugness found in so much indie film in this Sundance era The ambiguity inthis case is necessary and the fact that we are never given a final solutionto the mystery of what happened to the bus is central to Russell Banks andEgoyans premise that it is the nature of some tragedies to beincomprehensiblebetter to spend our energies fighting the evils we ourselvesmake than to rail at the unfeeling universe            As for theCoens Yes its true their movies have no third acts But I cant help itIm a fan of their hyperliterate look what I can do with a movie camerashowoffiness They may never be great film artists but then how many greatAmerican film artists have there been other than Griffith and Welles butthey are reliable entertainers Sometimes thats enough             RussEvansen Madison Wis                           Coenhead                        In his review ofThe Big Lebowski  Alex Ross shows himself to be a true spokesman for thefilm establishment The Coens have reserved an independence they haventearned Im sorry but the only earnings that count come from the audience Aslong as the Coen brothers continue to please their audience they have earnedthe right to be free of the discipline Ross imagines will spring from havingstudio executives secondguess their every move            Insteadof lambasting studios for abandoning artistic principles in favor of thealmighty dollar Ross attacks the Coens for abandoning film school principlesin favor of their own He doesnt quite have the courage to say The BigLebowski isnt a good film so hes reduced to saying it could have been abetter film Please Mr Ross take a job with a studio so the Coens and wedont have to listen to you             BobFoster Minneapolis                           Plathos                        Regarding Franklin FoersGist on SylviaPlath and Ted Hughes What hasnt quite been picked up by reviewers and criticsis the extent to which Hughes rewriting of Plath in BirthdayLetters even the less allusive poemstakes on the voice of its subject Apoetic homage for sure since the two writers exemplify the stylistic dividebetween the confessional poets of the postwar United States count LowellBerryman Jarrell Sexton and others and their more objective Britishcounterparts think of Hughes Geoffrey Hill etc            So forHughes this volume is a deliberate suppression of his natural voice Writingof his dead wife he writes under her stylistic regime And that makessense             NickSweeney Oxford England                           If ItDoesnt Fit You Must Omit                        Knock offthe cheap OJ jokes Todays Papers March  It comes across as an attempt tobuild camaraderie on the assumption that were all in the  percent of whiteAmericans who think OJ got away with murder when in fact some of us are inthe  percent of AfricanAmericans who believe that reasonable doubt wasestablished In any case why use any divisive devices at allwould the editoruse sexist anecdotes these days Surely you can find alternatives to being tooPC on one hand and going for easy OJ laughs on the other             HillardPouncy
