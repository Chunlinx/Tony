                                 The Olympic Gene Pool            Why the human race keepsgetting faster                           By Andrew Berry                          words postedThursday July  to be composted Thursday July              On May   at OxfordUniversitys Iffley Road track Roger Bannister became by just half a secondthe first man to run a mile in less than four minutes The Holy Grail ofmiddledistance running was his Fortytwo years later however thatachievement seems less significant Fourminute miles are commonplace thecurrent record held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli is   more than percent faster than Bannisters speed What Iffley Road witnessed was justanother step along the road to an ever quicker mile part of the inexorableimprovement of athletic performance that we usually take for grantedparticularly when the Olympics roll around If you stop to think about itthough such constant progress is remarkable After all as biomechanicalmachines with a standard set of parts humans should be subject to the samelimitations we see in say automobiles How come they arent            A lotof entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has todo with discoveries in the world of sports technology A new Nike shoe istrumpeted as something that will shave at least onethousandth of a second offyour meter time Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid inyour muscles then claim that their programs will control it Nutritionistsfinetune athletes diets Even the old sexualabstinencebeforetherace dogmais being reevaluated under the allseeing eye of science But I consider allthis little more than tinkering Sports records would continue to tumble evenif training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly thesame today as they were in  when the first modern Olympics took placeThese minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training butof demographic patterns that affect us all            Over the past century the human race has been affected bya slew of what demographers call secular trends In this context seculardoes not refer to a trends lack of spirituality but to its longevity Seculartrends are longterm modifications not just brief fluctuations One suchtrend is an increase in average size You have to stoop to get through thedoorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smallerthan you are not because they had a penchant for crouching Another trend isin life expectancy People are living longer Life expectancy in Africaincreased over the past  years from  to  years Over the same period inEurope where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with lifeexpectancy increased from  to  years The global average was an increasefrom  to  years            Probably the most striking change though is how much more quickly childrenare maturing A yearold child in  who was in what the World HealthOrganization calls average economic circumstances was about  inches tallerthan his or her  counterpart This is not solely the product of the firsttrendthe increase in average sizebut also due to the fact that childrendevelop faster Girls menstruate earlier than they used to The age of menarchethe onset of menstruation has decreased by three or four months per decade inaverage sections of Western European populations for the past  years Thereis a good chance that our  yearold already had started to menstruateHer  counterpart would still have had three years to wait            What do such trends have to do with athletic performanceWell if were living longer and growing up faster that must mean wereproducing bigger better bodies Better bodies imply faster miles We runfaster and faster for the same reason it is now common for yearold girls tomenstruate But why are these things happening            Demographers have offered a variety of explanations but the main one is thatour diet is improving A yearold ate better in  than she would have inthe Victorian era This conclusion is supported by studies of the social eliteBecause its members were wellnourished even in the early years of thiscentury this group has experienced relatively little change over the past years in the age girls first menstruate Another explanation is that healthcare is getting better In  according to the WHO more than  percent ofall yearolds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseasesSmallpox that scourge of previous generations now is effectively extinctProbably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infantmortality which measures both the health of the mother a sickly mother ismore likely to produce a sickly baby and the health of the baby In the past years infant mortality around the world has dropped from  deaths per live births to just  A lot of this can be chalked up to primaryheathcareprograms in the developing worldthe African average for instance hasdropped from  deaths per  births to  But there are also significantimprovements in the developed world with infant deaths dropping in Europe overthe same year period from  per  live births to just             Better health care affects athletic ability directly Thisis true in the trivial case in which say antibiotics cure a runners feverbefore the big race but it may also be true in a more significant wayDiseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on healthnotnecessarily a big one but an impact nevertheless Previous generations borescars from all sorts of nonlifethreatening diseases the stuff everyonepicked up as a baby Nowadays though more and more people grow up with nohistory of disease Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiestsector of the population a generally superior system of health care means abigger pool of people to draw from You are much more likely to find someonewho can run a mile in  in a sample of several million superbly healthypeople than you are in a sample of             Thepool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways too First thepopulation has exploded Second we are coming ever closer to a worldwidemiddle class the class from which athletes typically are drawn Whether in anage of multinational capitalism we may talk reasonably about a postcolonialera is way beyond the scope of this article The fact remains however thatthe developing world is doing just thatdeveloping Even Mozambique whichranks at or near the bottom of national per capita gross national producttables has shown an increase of some  percent in adult literacy rates overthe past  years Literacy rates are merely an index of education whichitself is another way of talking about a global move away from a handtomouthlifestyle            The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries Britainwon on average  gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held inits imperial heyday before World War I That average has dropped to only fivemedals per Olympics in the  held since This is not a reflection of decliningathletic standards in Britain however its a function of how much morecompetitive other nations have become The Olympics originally were thepreserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nationsConsider this Only  nations participated in  but there were  in Black Africans didnt take part until the third modern games held in StLouis in  Even this was accidental Lentauw and Yamasami Zulu tribesmenentered the marathon because they happened to be in St Louis as part of anexhibit about the Boer war Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into acornfield by dogs            Sinceall these are changes in how we live not anything innate we have to concludethat what we are describing here are effects of environment not genes Let usassume that our  and  yearolds are identical twins magically born years apart The  girl still will grow up faster end up biggermenstruate earlier and live longer than the  girl Perhaps way way backin human history when our forebears were still fleeing sabertoothed tigersnatural selection for athletic prowess came into play But all that ended longago Indeed the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes thesedays Given the rigors of training schedules it is possible that todays topathletes have fewer children than average            Just because nurture has a more significanteffect on athletic performance doesnt mean that nature lies dormant thoughGenetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study and theability to run quickly would be no exception To take a trivial case we knowthat the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically It isquite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiringmilertheir genes have affected their athletic performance One genetic factorthat may be influencing performance trends is what is known as hybrid vigorCattle breeders have known about this for a long time Take two inbred lines ofcattle cross them and what you have is better say larger than any singleindividual in either of the two parental lines This does not require naturalselection it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolatedstocks There are a number of theories to account for this at the geneticlevel but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them It is possiblethat modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migrationand admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates Perhapsjust perhaps such hybridization is being translated into enhancedperformance            That doesnt mean however that genetic differences inathletic ability can be correlated automatically with race That is a claimthat is impossible to test because you cannot control in an experimentalsense environmental differences among the study groups Sure you will findmore Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end ofOlympic track events And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiumsBut can you therefore conclude that Africans have better genes for runningthan Asians do No Environmental differences between the two groups couldaccount for differing levels of athletic success It is scarcely surprisingthat Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else sincethey are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary schoolmiddle school and high school The training is whats crucial not theblackness The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormousand effective experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a directrelation to athletic ability Until recently a quick glance at the medalstable confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports Then theChinese decided to produce recordbreaking female distance runners andswimmers and boy did they ever In  China ranked fourth in theOlympicmedal haul            You canbring a single generation up to speed through training but the trends weredealing with transcend individual generations Which brings us to anotherquestion Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort ofnatural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling Inprinciple yes            There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken Wewill never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run  meters forinstance The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it Race horses seemalready to have hit that outer limit For years they were as good as humanathletes at pushing back speed records but then they simply stopped gettingfaster Take the prestigious British Derby From  to  winning timesdropped from  to  But from  to  the average time hasbeen Unlike people race horses are specifically bred and reared to runGenerations of careful genetic selection have ensured that todays race horsehas every possible speedenhancing characteristic Training techniques tooare tremendously sophisticated But you can go only so far You can only breedhorses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point the bones will breakunder stress if they get any lighter            Human improvement likeracehorse improvement must eventually bow to the basic constraints ofbiomechanics The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever On the otherhand it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past years that these longterm trends are with us still They may be slowing downin some more developed societies but they roar along in others And thesetrends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance Severalnew records will be set in Atlanta And in Sydney in  and wherever theOlympics are held in  We will continue running faster and jumping furtherfor a good long while to come
