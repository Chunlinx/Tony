                                 The Postmans Knock            And none will hear thepostmans knockWithout a quickening of the heart For who can bear to feelhimself forgotten WH Auden                        How archaic that now soundstechnologically And how true it is psychologically            No onehears the postmans knock any more I cant remember that I ever heard it Athome I get my mail from a clerk at the desk six floors below my apartment Atmy office I either find my mail on a shelf or have it placed on my desk by myhelper In either case I dont hear the postmans knock or ever see him            But the mailnow derisively called snail mailis notthe primary means of mediated communication that is communication at adistance beyond facetoface contact First there is the telephone todaygenerally equipped with voice mail which allows you to retrieve messagesleft in your absence Now increasingly there is email opening up a wholenew world of instantaneous written communication            Along withthis technological change have come some changes of attitude We no longer arein the position evoked by Auden passively awaiting a connection with theoutside world through the postman Now we increasingly seek the connection Wego to a clerk and ask for our mail we call our answering service to see ifthere have been any phone calls we log on to our computer to search formessages            With the proliferation of means ofcommunication has come a degradation of the messages In my youth ordinarymail was the standard means of communication among people who knew each othereven those who knew each other very well such as parents and childrenLongdistance telephone was reserved for the announcement of births or deathsToday I send or receive hardly any personal post office mail except whenprinted matter such as a newspaper clipping is enclosed There is one personwith whom I have a fairly regular postal mail correspondence and that isbecause we are both trying to make a literary exercise of our writing to eachother and he alas does not have email            Whateverpersonal communication there is in the mail I receive at home is buried in amountain of solicitations for contributions from people or institutions Ibarely know My usual response to receiving my packet of mail is not Audensquickening of the heart It is more likely to be ugh At my office my mailconsists almost exclusively of policy memorandums and pamphlets frominstitutions to whom I am but one name on an enormous mailing list This mailmakes me confront the feeling that I ought to study it all and the realisticknowledge that I ought to throw it out Not much quickening of the heartthere            There is plenty of junk in my email also When I log on inthe morning I am sure to find a couple of messages offering me pornographicvideos with one click of the mouse and at least one message from someone readyto tell me how to earn  an hour working from home But still the ratioof personal communication to garbage is higher than for snail mail            The proportion of personalcommunication is highest on the telephone But even there when the bell ringsand I pick up the receiver I am likely to hear someone asking How are youtoday Herberta sure sign of a stranger trying to sell me something            The oddsagainst getting a quickening of the heart by any of these media are high Butdespite the odds I find it worthwhile to try to make the connection We havebeen warned at the apartment building where I live not to disturb the deskclerk by asking for mail before  am But I am there at the desk at In my office two or three times a day I look into the room where the mail isshelved I call my home phone from the office at least once a day to see if anymessages have been left From home I call my office three or four times a dayOne of the saddest and most common responses is the operator saying HerbertStein no new messages Even more frequently than that I log on to one of mythree computers hoping to see the little message on the screen You havemail            Why am I so eager for the connection It is notthat I expect anything practical I am not going to get a letter offering mea six figure advance for the publication of a volume of my personal essays Noit is as Auden says I cannot bear to feel forgotten I seek from the mail ortelephone or email some sign of being rememberedand not just as a nine digitSocial Security number or a  digit credit card number            Thecontents of the communication dont matter It can be a postcard saying I amin Mexico It is hot here It can be a phone call asking How are you Itcan be an email message forwarding one of those slightly funny jokes thatcirculate around the Internet What counts is the connectionthe feeling ofnot being forgotten Even if the message comes from someone you are sure hasnot forgotten youone of your children for exampleit is a comfort to bereminded It is also a comfort if the message comes from a total stranger aslong as the message is for you specifically and personally and not for a nameon a mailing list            Possibly I am more avid in pursuit of such connectionsthan the average person I know people who dont go down for their mail untilafternoon who have no telephone answering service and who even if they havean email account dont log on to see their messages for days at a time Butstill in one degree or another the feeling described by Auden of not wantingto be forgotten must be nearly universal Whole industries rest on thatfeelingthe greeting card industry and the florist industry for exampleATT knows how important it is That is why it implores you to reach outand touch someone            In the Jewish tradition thedead live on in the memory of their survivors Something like that is true forthe living also The living are most alive when they feel that they areremembered That is why I go for my snail mail call for my telephone messagesand log on to my emailseveral times each day
