when in the mood turned out to be very abusiveverbally and have a major bad temper This affected her wellbeing butinstead of concentrating on the marriage or seeking treatment for him shedecided to blame our parents for all her ills  including the choice of ahusband                                       She spends hourstalking about the abuse we were subjected to as children Our parents werenot perfect but about average or maybe a drop below I believe that dwellingon the past is just an excuse and easier than dealing with the present Whatcan be done to convince her that despite all the psychobabble we are exposedto the past is not as important as the present I want her to get on with herlife get help for her husband and stop driving my parents and everybody inthe family nuts
