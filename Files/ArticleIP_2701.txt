                                 The GOPs Gamble            Ever since Bill Clinton ranfor president pundits have puzzled over his penchant for selfdestructionYes hes the Comeback Kid but only because he keeps getting himself intotrouble from which he must come back When things are going well he finds away to mess them up You know the old joke Clintons approval ratings are sohigh hes going to start dating again            Onereason why Clinton can make these recoveries is that he has no monopoly onselfdestruction When hes down his enemies are upand pretty soontheyre the ones who feel ready to start dating again Now thatClinton is in the deepest trouble of his presidency Republicans in Congressthink theyre on top of the world House Speaker Newt Gingrich has spurnedDemocratic entreaties to offer Clinton a plea bargain short of impeachment Onwith the hearings says Gingrich            The smartest course for Gingrich and the Republicans wouldbe to bend over backward to show mercy restraint and fairness to ClintonMost Americans would be impressed by their nonpartisanship grateful to bespared further lurid disclosures and increasingly open to voting Republican infuture elections Clinton would remain a cripple for the rest of hispresidency            Instead the Republicans areforging ahead with impeachment The charitable explanation is that theyrethinking shortterm hoping to energize their base and win extra congressionalseats in the November elections The less charitable explanation is thattheyre just as hot to nail Clinton as he was to nail Monica Lewinsky In thelong term this pursuit of Clinton will backfire for several reasons                            The Lewinskyinvestigation is out of ammo On that subject Independent Counsel KennethStarr took his best punch in the report to Congress The country has absorbedthe worst information about Clintons behavior yet hes still standing Itshard to see what further information about the affair would bring him down                            The publics angerat Clinton cant last It is already dissipating with the passage of timeand the venting of outrage by Democrats on the Senate floor pundits ontelevision and citizens in everyday conversation People will always besomewhat angry at Clinton But like heat anger inevitably diffuses and losesits force                            Anger at sexualdisclosures is growing Postvideo polls showing a six to nine point surgein Clintons job approval rating are a signal that people increasingly resentthe pursuit of sexual details about the ClintonLewinsky affair Even peoplewho deplore Clintons behavior are getting sick of seeing it rehashed ontelevision                            Anger at theimpeachment process will grow People may not care for Clinton but theycare even less for politicians who set aside the publics business in order tofocus on themselves Now that the public has heard Starrs information and hasvented its disgust the congressional impeachment inquiry is being reduced toan inside game The more it consumes Congress attention and the nastier itgets the angrier the public will become And the party most likely to beblamed is the one that controls Congress                            Clinton is a greattalker He has yet to lose a talking match with the GOP From a Republicanstandpoint the beauty of the Lewinsky investigation is that Clinton hasfinally been forced to shut up since nobody wanted to hear anything from himbut apologies But now that he has apologized and taken a beating he isgradually recovering the right to open his mouth again The effect of hisvideotaped testimony on public opinion shows what he can do If the Republicansdrag out the impeachment process and summon him for a verbal spanking beforeCongress they might well be in for an Ollie North for a reminder of Northsstellar performance before Congress click here                            The Democratic basewill awaken The Republican strategy for November has been to letDemocratic voters sleep through the election allowing the Republican base toturn out and unseat vulnerable Democratic officeholders So far the Lewinskyscandal has smothered issues such as HMOs that might have drawn Democrats tothe polls But if Republicans push the impeachment inquiry to the point ofantagonizing and mobilizing Democratic voters the GOPs lowturnout strategywill be ruined                            Starr will beinvestigated He already faces a court fight over whether he has unlawfullyleaked grand jury information to reporters Now that the background material hesent to Congress has been released the press has become interested in whetherLinda Tripp doctored her tapes and whether Starrs agents and prosecutorsimproperly detained Lewinsky or misrepresented their treatment of her in theJan  sting The wise course for Republicans might be to accept a pleabargain under which neither Clintons behavior nor Starrs will be furtherinvestigated with regard to the Lewinsky matter                            The media will turnon the GOP For more than a month Clintons debauchery and deceit haveconsumed journalists attention To the extent the Republicans have held theirfire they have left Clinton alone in the arena to absorb the medias scrutinymockery and incredulity By charging into the arena the Republicans areoffering the press an alternative political target This is particularly unwisebecause after weeks of raking Clinton reporters and pundits are inclined todemonstrate their balance by going after the GOP                           Should further revelations warrant impeachment Congress may have lost thenecessary credibility Polls show most people arent willing to impeachClinton over the Lewinsky affair but they do think hes been exposed as a liarand coverup artist Starr has yet to deliver his report on WhitewaterFilegate and other nonsexual scandals which no doubt will accuse Clinton oflying and covering up those matters as well That report could deliver aknockout blow to Clinton But Congress wont be able to impeach him if theRepublican majority has squandered its authority by overplaying an arguablylesser scandal that most people think boils down to lying about sex            Everynight thousands of people walk into casinos and rack up big winnings Butcasinos stay in business because few of those people have the prudence to walkout while theyre ahead Instead they keep playing until theyve losteverything Its human nature Thats how Bill Clinton squandered hispresidency And thats how his enemies will save him                           RecentFrame Games                        The Unjust War Clintonsmoral theory point by point as expressed in his testimony posted MondaySept
