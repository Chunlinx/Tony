                                  Demand an Explanation            Greetings pissedoff consumers It is I the greatShopping Avenger who has toiled without pause this past month all right Ipaused to right the wrongs inflicted on the buying masses by the dark forcesof turbocharged capitalism            Before writing the first installment of this columnlast month the Shopping Avenger had no idea that so many people would have somany complaints about so many different companies The Shopping Avenger alsohad no idea so many people read                   Slate                The complaints as AlanSimpson would say have come pouring in over the transom I received somewherearound  million emails from                   Slate                readers asking for help inthe battle against poor customer service Perhaps it was fewer than million but not by much            Only one correspondentwas hostile Youre probably just running a scam to collect a bunch of upscaleemail addresses he wrote dyspeptically and inaccurately I checked out hisemail addressits not upscale at all            But most of you turned to me in good faith and for this Iam thankful Alas I am but one superhero and could not come to the aid of allwho beseeched me So for those of you asking highly technical questionsconcerning the operation of your personal computers let it be known across theland that the Shopping Avenger still writes on papyrus And for those of youwho contributed not complaints but wacky observations such as I find itamazing how people will drive many miles out of their way to buy gas that is cents cheaper I thank you for your commentary            Now though a few observations of my own about thecomplaints the understandable ones I did receive             The American consumer believes that the telephoneis the instument of the devil             The people who answer  lines are spawn ofthe devil or at the very least incredibly thick             The typical corporation would much rather blowsmoke than actually apologize for doing wrong             American corporationsdo not yet understand the true power of the Shopping Avenger            As an example of all four phenomena I refer you now to thecomplaint of K who is chagrined by the errant behavior of the UHaulcompany            I signed up a truck from Friday until Monday twoweeks hence K explains A week later I called the local number to confirmand confirm they did They confirmed that my reservation was for Sunday Notonly was it not FritoMon indeed it couldnt be FritoMon becauseUHaul policy is not to rent trucks for more than one weekend day  Hey noproblem a fine policy But lets supplement it with DONT TELL ME OTHERWISEWHEN I SIGN UP            Though I am not one to endorse the use of CAPITALLETTERS TO MAKE A POINT I believe K earned that right here            K goes on to state that he canceled his rental andsought out a truck at Ryder where the saleswoman an exUHaul employee toldhim that it was UHauls policy never to turn down a reservation no matterwhat Overbooking is the norm she said            So I called UHaul to inquire about its rentalpolicies What I got was in technical terms a runaround            UHaul Internationalsspokeswoman Johna Burke told me that her company would never behave in such away Then she blamed the customer for misunderstanding what he heard This Iam learning is standard operating procedure across whole industries Iveheard variations of the customer didnt understand our phone prompts threetimes already leading me to the conclusion that theres a real problem outthere with deliberately obfuscatory phone prompts            Then Burke yelled at me for having the temerity to evensuggest that the exUHaul employee K quoted might be right The ShoppingAvenger can take the heat however I asked her for the UHaul policyconcerning weekend rentals but Burke said she could not cite policy becauseindividual UHaul operators set their own policies She asked me to identifythe state in which the rental was to occur which I did Then she suggestedthat K merely thought he made a reservation but actually only asked aboutprices This seemed a bit of a stretch to me but I checked with K whosupplied me with his actual reservation number He also confirmed that heplaced a deposit for the truck            Once again I called Burke to ask whether UHaul isin the habit of changing confirmed reservations behind the customers back butBurke even while knowing that the Shopping Avengers deadline approached didnot call back            The Shopping Avenger has himself been a victim ofthe reservation shuffle and so he sympathizes with Ks complaint And Kshould know that the Shopping Avenger will not rest except at night and onweekends until he shakes an adequate explanation out of UHaul            But let us turn now to aShopping Avenger victory            Our correspondent A wrote the Shopping Avenger to complainof his treatment on the Ticketmaster Web site As he explained he had loggedon to the site in order to buy tickets to a Bob DylanPaul Simon showEverything was going fine until he clicked to confirm his order The screenread We will now contact the Ticketmaster system to complete your orderPlease wait to see a response from the system with your confirmation            I waited and waited A wrote me Finally amessage appeared telling me to try later the gateway was not functioning So there I was wondering what the hell had happened to my credit cardinformation Even worse the phone number they gave me to call is longdistance Needless to say this was frustrating  I picked up the phone andcalled the longdistance number It was busy In fact it was busy for the NEXTTHREE HOURSthere are those capital letters again Even worse when Ifinally did get through I was put on hold for  minutes Let me emphasizeThat was  minutes of my long distance on MY phone bill to find out whatthey had done to MY credit card number            A then writes Ironically while on holdTicketmaster shamelessly plugged its online system finishing with Buyingtickets has never been easier             Ironic indeed            To add insult to injury when A finally spoke to a liveperson you will soon see why the word live is in quotation marks he askedto have the  convenience fee waived for each ticket he planned to buyAfter all I was making a longdistance call and they had bungled my initialattempt at a purchase            The operator a certain Nola from the misnamedcustomer service department told him he should have called his local serviceprovider Of course no one had provided A with the local service number Heeventually bought the tickets anyway paying the convenience charge            All this was too much for the Shopping Avenger whoswung into action Actually the Shopping Avenger swung into action even beforehe knew of As plight since As girlfriend had secretly forwarded AsShopping Avenger complaint to Ticketmaster Soon after I made inquiries A wasrefunded  in convenience charges            But  wasnt enough Iwanted an explanation and an apology for A which he got sort of            In a letter to A the executive vice president ofTicketmaster Multimedia Robert Perkins explains semigrammatically thatwhen tickets goes onsale it operates through telephone lines that maybecome busy He also explains Dozens of variables may determine the speedand continuity of your Internet connection are in the hands of your local phonecompany            Perkins does say hes sorry in a fashion Pleaseaccept our sincerest apologies and we hope you will continue to offer yourcomments as our site evolves in the future            A can accept the nonsensical apology he told mebecause Ticketmaster is also offering him a  gift certificate for histroubles Ticketmaster has shown the way When you screw up apologize makematerial amends and get the Shopping Avenger on your side            Score that Shopping Avenger evilbutcontrite corporation             Next month the Shopping Avenger hopes to focus onthe evils of the pest control and airline industries Dont ask why its toocomplicated to explain If you have complaints about these industriesor anyother for that matteremail the Shopping Avenger with as much detail aspossible at shoppingavengerslatecom
