            just outside of Dallas   uhhuh my mother used to work at the Plano location i think she moved back down into closer into Dallas   yeah   so okay let me let me hit one hold on a second here   okeydoke well punch one well get started okay     okay   okay i guess my my favorite eating out uh food is Mexican food   uhhuh   TexMex not real Mexican food       that real Mexican food is too hot   um okay uh my favorite i have a lot of favorites i like to try a lot of different things uh theres very few foods that i dont like i dont like asparagus and beets and anything else i can pretty much eat uh recently i went to a French restaurant and i had something called uh spinach fettucini and crawfish   hum   and it was so delicious ive been talking about it its my birthday and ive been talking about it ever ever since its been about a week now ive been talking about this plate of food and uh the real important part of it for me in a restaurant is the service   huh   uhhuh   uh in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again uh they were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables   yeah yeah   and something that really impressed me was that i asked one waiter for butter        and then the next second another a different waiter brought the butter out and and they hadnt even talked or anything and it was it was really amazing  and so that really impresses me the service in a restaurant   yeah    yeah well i i like a restaurant i like a restaurant that uh not necessarily for atmosphere you know uh the atmosphere isnt worth a dime if the food is good and the service is lousy   uhhuh exactly   and this little old Mexican restaurant we have right up here from the house i i dont guess itll hold more than twenty people   uhhuh   and its just a little small restaurant  pardon me and its uh just kind of like a hole in the wall but the food excellent   uhhuh   and and the service is just excellent and the price is very reasonable   and thats probably not a chain restaurant   its not a chain its a little a family owned restaurant   i find that most most family owned restaurant or or single restaurant you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody it it it has the family name on it   yeah right   and so whoevers in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where theyre just hiring you know people out of that really dont probably dont care too much about the establishment so theyre not going to worry about taking care of you   yeah   whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food   yeah yeah plus you you can go in after you youve youve uh uh gone to the place quite a few times uh they get to know you and uh uh you know appreciate you and say hello to you and how are you doing and   uhhuh exactly   exactly   and all you got to do is sit down and say well have our usual   uhhuh   and uh you know its just its real nice and   exactly the guy that took me out to this French restaurant he works in a hotel nearby and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guys restaurant   yeah   and and at the end of our meal you know were ready to go and were full and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert   um   that the restaurant has so it was like ten desserts on one plate and he just gave it to us to eat of course we couldnt eat it but you know he just did this and so the next time when we come in hell probably remember us   yeah yeah   just because we looked so weird at the dessert  you know but that that was   yeah plus you go you go to a big fancy restaurant and uh uh some of the price that you pay for the meal is strictly for the decor and for the atmosphere and you cant eat that   exactly exactly exactly       one of my favorite restaurants is Steak and Ale now thats a chain sort of a chain restaurant   yeah yeah   but they seem to i like i like atmosphere myself and and their food is good and i really like the salad bar and that that gets me in a restaurant if there is really good salad bar because i love salads and soups and things like that   yeah and i guess it depends you know if if its just you and your husband going out to eat uh unless its uh anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesnt mean that much but if youre taking another couple or taking relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice   right right   but uh and also we we uh   i would   i i wasnt too much on Chinese food until i tried it and i really liked it   uhhuh uhhuh   and i even bought me a wok and doing my own doing my own Chinese cooking now but     did you just recently try it uhhuh   uhhuh yeah weve tried it a couple of time and even had uh uh relatives over and i cooked some out of that and boy they just lapped it up   yeah uhhuh all right wow maybe i need to get me a wok and have some people over   but uh we saw this one advertised on TV its uh uh real  real good wok its hand hand uh   uhhuh   pounded not hand carved hound hand made of iron   right right um   its not one of these aluminum or steel woks that you buy     probably that it heats up real good and uhhuh   heats up real good and and the meat and stuff doesnt stick to it like it will uh uh aluminum or uh stainless steel   um and that was on a television advertisement one of them nineteen ninety five deals yeah okay   uhhuh yeah yeah   that sounds good yeah i dont like ive tried probably just about everything just because i dont like to   and it uh yeah   you know i dont i hate one thing i hate to do in a restaurant is to be with someone that want try things   yeah   because im also wanting to anything that they have i will try and uh you know sometimes i may not like it but i feel like i miss out you know if i had gone a long time without trying Chinese food i would have had to try it one day just because i hate to miss out   yeah well i love i love those fried vegetables   uhhuh   especially the uh watercress and the crunchy the crunchy ones   yeah yeah the little crunchy things i never know what they are i just call them the crunchers   yeah huh yeah we like uh we like seafood too and we found a little ole another little ole hole in the wall that makes excellent fried catfish   so uhhuh um   boy its good   that sounds good i love catfish   yeah i do too   uhhuh and i love shrimp and   we havent tried any of their seafood and we again had some relatives here last week and we went took them there she had never had catfish she was from Connecticut   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh she had never had channel catfish   uh   and she tried the scallops i asked her if they were any good because i new the scallops were probably oh you know not local like catfish is     right right   but uh she said they were very good   um yeah i dont like scallops too much their they have kind a funny taste i can eat them but theyre   and she yeah well being from Connecticut theyre theyre use to fresh seafood like shrimp and lobster and stuff like that   uhhuh hum yeah yeah yeah im originally from New York i grew up there so i got to eat a lot of uh i mean just fresh fresh i mean one   yeah   one day we were out just driving and they are always uh oriental people with their little stands   yeah   and theyre selling things and we decided we were going to buy this thing we didnt know what it was we got in the car and opened it up and started eating it and it was really really good and we figured out that it was octopus   hm   you know so we all kind of freaked out but you find all kinds of seafood things in up there where all the   uhhuh yeah   uh harbors are and things   i never have tried octopus it sounds looks like it would be good because its all meat theres no bones to it its not   yeah yeah yeah theres not a whole lot of taste its just basically meat and theres not a lot of taste not a lot to eat not to like you know so unless you think its bland or something   yeah yeah yeah one of these days i would like to try a rattlesnake too ive heard that its delicious   um ah now thats something i may not try yeah ive heard thats good ive heard frog legs are good i havent had any of those yet so ill have to try those one day   but uh oh i love frog legs yeah frog frog legs are good of course you know you ask somebody what meat taste like just about any meat you ask them had a it taste like they say like chicken   uhhuh exactly   but uh it does its similar to chicken but the meat   uhhuh   the meat is sweeter   uhhuh   and if youve ever i use to go frog gigging as a kid and gigging  the frogs and then uh and get their legs   uhhuh right   and the meat is its crystal clear meat its beautiful meat   hum   now it is a little bits stringy   uhhuh   uh because of uh because simply theyre frog legs because they you know they have the muscles and so forth   right right   but its its its sweet meat   um i think my favorite meat is lamb   now i dont i dont care a whole lot about lamb   no i think i think its its got i like the texture of it is why i like it not so much the taste but the texture its not real chewy or   yeah yeah   i mean its just real good to me i cant really describe why but   yeah lamb or veal im not real crazy over it   yeah i like veal too   but uh while i was i ive worked for Texas Instruments out in Ridgecrest California for eight years and one time we went down to uh Bakersfield   uhhuh uhhuh   and there was a Basque restaurant B A S Q U E   um uhhuh   and uh we stopped there and ate and i wish i could find another one here   um i bet   oh it was good they serve it family style everything in
