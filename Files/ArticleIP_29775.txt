                                  The Cure for Sinophobia            Trying to make sense of USChina relations thesedays can reduce even the most resolute Sinologist to a blubbering wreck At themoment Washington and Beijing are pummeling each other over the ChineseEmbassy bombing the Chinese espionage detailed in the Cox report Americantechnology export policies the renewal of Chinas normal trade formerly mostfavored nation status Chinas application to join the World TradeOrganization American support for Taiwanese democracy American sympathy forthe Dalai Lama the burgeoning military alliance between the United States andJapan Chinas friendship with North Korea Chinas wavering endorsement ofnuclear nonproliferation Chinas persecution of democrats Chinas persecutionof Christians and Chinas surging antiAmericanism            Oh and I forgot to mention that today is the th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre Happyanniversary            The China question hasproduced a kind of mass hysteria in the United States TheextremesSinoapologists and China bashershave kidnapped China policyBusiness interests insist that our economic partnership with China trumps allelse Many conservatives meanwhile are screaming for a Cold War demandingthat we confront the new Evil Empire before it grows too mighty Thisconservative opposition continues a long and deplorable trend described by                  Slate               s Jacob Weisberg last year in  The party out ofpresidential power inevitably accuses the ruling party of being soft on Chinabut then adopts the same accommodationist policies as soon as it wins the OvalOffice And the lobbies for the Christian right Tibet human rights andlabor demand that we break with China until it stops persecuting Christiansdestroying Tibet oppressing dissidents and mistreating workers            So whats a poor American to think Here are seven paths towisdom for US China policy                                           DisaggregateAmerican interest groups want to hold China policy hostage to their petissuessecurity democracy Tibet trade etc They are monochromaticDemocracy advocates judge China on its worst behavior toward dissidents andignore any good behavior while business apologists applaud Chinas dynamismand dont notice repression espionage etc Any reasonable China policy mustseparate issues of agreement and disagreement China and the United States cancooperate on trade but well never make common cause on Tibet So our policyneeds firewalls  The American business community shouldnt be able toforce the United States to cave on human rights just to improve economic tiesNor should human rights advocates be allowed to make trade agreementscontingent on Chinese kindness toward dissidents Until the United States candisaggregate its entire China policy will be held hostage to the mostcontentious issue of the moment                            Dontcriticize without offering a sensible alternative A key reason forour mangled China policy is that China hawks endlessly indict US policywithout proposing their own remedy In the New York Times last weekcolumnist Thomas Friedman whacked the China bashers for their belligerentcarping over the Cox report Where exactly do you guys think you are goingwith this  Do you want to declare war on China Is that what you want TheChina bashers slam Clintons economic coziness with China but theyre mumabout what they would do instead They dont want a trade war either OtherAmericans preach for Taiwanese independence but then refuse to say whetherTaiwan is worth fighting for                          Stop seeing China as the Soviet Union Unlike theUSSR China is not expansionist not interested in exporting communism andhardly interested in keeping the communism its got and incredibly keen aboutjoining the world economy This is not the Cold War China is not theimplacable enemy that the Soviet Union was and we should not treat it thatway We can do business with China On the other hand                             Dont helpChina become a superpower China may not be the Soviet Union but itsnot Great Britain either China wants to build sophisticated weapons anddethrone the United States as Asias dominant military power We dont have tohelp it The United States should limit technology transfers increase spyingon Beijing strengthen our military alliances with Chinas neighbors notablyJapan and Korea and stall Chinas weapons development as much as we peaceablycan             Take the long view US policy wobbles because itis always responding to the crisis du jourthe Cox report WTO the latestsuppression of dissidents etc But USChina relations are better consideredover a span of many years On democracy for example American activists areraging over Chinas recent suppression of all democratic dissent Thissuppression is an outrage but our policy must be more sophisticated than mereindignation Compare  China with  China  China permits vasteconomic freedom sponsors competitive village elections allows theestablishment of nongovernmental organizations tolerates environmental andwomens rights activism and is starting to develop a reliable legal systemThis is certainly not democracy but its not totalitarianism either CatharinDalpino former deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy humanrights and labor notes that Taiwan took the same preliminary steps on itspath to democracy Of course taking the long view on democracy also requirestaking the longer view China may have improved since  but it stillhas an unblemished history of authoritarianism five millenniums withoutsustained democracy                            Worry alot about Taiwan Amid all the fretting about normal trade statusWTO espionage and Tibet we tend to overlook Taiwan This is worrisomebecause Taiwan is by far the hottest issue between the United States and ChinaThere is an increased sense of desperation in China about Taiwan We canstumble into a war with China over Taiwan very easily warns Professor DavidShambaugh of George Washington University Chinese leaders are fretting aboutTaiwans prosperous democracy and its flirtation with independence They arealso irked by US military support for Taiwanespecially the US plan todeploy a Theater Missile Defense for Taiwan in the next few years Keeping thepeace in the Taiwan Strait must be the United States top China priority Itwill require immense prudence The United States must nurture a democraticTaiwan while discouraging a declaration of independence must arm Taiwanagainst Chinese invasion while promoting closer SinoTaiwanese ties             And finally dont be so melodramatic Ourrelations with China are messy partly because we worry too much about them Wehave never been able to look at China like we would look at Brazil or India Weare always swept up in some idealized notion of what China is or should besays Brookings Institution scholar Bates Gill On daytoday issues we havenever learned to have normal reactions China is not  feet tall Yes Chinais an emerging power and yes China may be the great American rival of thenext century but Americans have transformed China into an otherworldly nationa mysterious angel a baffling demon            Here a historical analogy is illuminating Only adecade ago after all America was frantic about another mysterious ominousAsian power that was not quite friend not quite enemy This nation tooseemed antagonistic toward America and bent on global domination Today Japanis more like Americas kid brother than a mortal threat China too is just anation like any other with ambitions and fears strengths and weaknesses Anduntil we recognize that USChina policy will be more fraught than it shouldbe
