                                 Memories of Underdevelopment            There are some epic momentsin this slim volumememories of bitterness and shame magnified by theflythick heat of the western Cape Boyhood Scenes From Provincial Lifeby JM Coetzee the Booker Prizewinning white South African novelist andauthor of Waiting for the Barbarians  and Life  Times ofMichael K  tells of barren spaces The first of these is a smalltown named Worcester where Coetzee spent part of his childhood and wherenothing grows The second is the city of Cape Town where his family returnedafter a stint in the hinterland and where dead babies rot in brown paperpackets            Part  ofan autobiographical trilogy Boyhood is the story of a boy forced toendure and imagine his way out of that barrenness It is a writers memoirminutely detailed and finely polished Framed by a dystopic postWorld War IISouth Africawhere the economy has moved from rural to urban Afrikanernationalists have risen to power and apartheid is testing its wingsthe storyairs these larger happenings through the muggy lives of its young protagonistthe book spans years  through  and his family his father anonpracticing attorney whom he despises his mother who is too close to himand to whom he is too close and a younger brother who he suspects may atheart be normal            This last you understand is not a good thing Normalcyto which John the memoirists father is doomed and against which his mother ishis own last bastion must be avoided at all costs On young Johns rejectionof normal that twee tired word turns the action of this book He canisolate his every sensation indulge his every impulse in the untested spaceon either side of the n and the l  He identifies himself as aRoman Catholicnot because he is one his family is nondenominationallyChristian but because of Rome because of Horatius and his two comradesswords in their hands crested helmets on their heads indomitable courage intheir glance defending the bridge  against the Etruscan hordes Thebathetic discovery that Roman Catholicism has little to do with Horatius has noeffect on his philosophy of life asked to choose between the Russians and theAmericans he chooses the Russians as he chose Rome because of the letterr  particularly the capital R  the strongest of all lettersbut theres a larger reality that will not be ignored the fact that hethinking only of Leonidas at Thermopylae has by his choice of faiths isolatedhimself in a Protestantmajority school From that day forward his socialoptions are severely limitedto the other outcasts Greenberg and Goldsteinwho are like him in a despised religious minority            Isolationand introspection those staples of the Bildungsroman  scrape at youngCoetzees sensibilities refining them raw Exposureof ignorance of softpink feet in a classroom of callused solesis anathema Lessons must bemastered and feet remain shod Ugliness and sloth thin the nostrils and raisethe gorge Appearances must be maintained and the desperately unhappy worlds ofhome and school kept separate and they almost are Above all is the yearningfor greatness for acts of wondrous heroism But shy brainy and unpopularCoetzee must make do with hyperbolic fantasy instead            Thewater from the waterbottle is magically cool but he pours no more than amouthful at a time He is proud of how little he drinks It will stand him ingood stead he hopes if he is ever lost in the veld He wants to be a creatureof the desert this desert like a lizard            Boyhoods grand fumblings put me in mind ofVS Naipauls semiautobiographical novel A House for Mr Biswas  whoseprotagonist is similarly prone to selfromanticization Like Coetzee Naipaulhas been accused of avoiding politics when he writes Thats a mystifyingcharge Biswas paranoias the magistrates coming apart in CoetzeesWaiting for the Barbarians  the antiheros inability to connect with theworld around him in his Life  Times of Michael K  are all directlytraceable to the traumas of political change and the individuals need to findstability within it            Likewisethere is no mistaking the political underpinnings of Boyhood  There arecozy images of empire Johns obsession with cricket not a game  the truthof life his description of beloved train rides sleeping snug and tightunder the crisp white sheets and navyblue blankets that the bedding attendantbrings There are scenes from provincial life that derive from absolutehierarchies which in turn are built on Manichaean oppositions TheAfrikaners with whom he must share a last name are crude their languagefilthy beyond belief The Coloureds fathered by whites upon Hottentots arepoor and therefore good naturally qualified by their lack of booklearning tofix a broken gadget or a leaky faucet The Natives rightful owners of theland are immutable their pithy pidginisms Man builds great boats of ironbut the sea is stronger deserving of the utmost reverence You must rememberwhat he said He was a wise old man intones Mrs Coetzeethis observesJohn is the only time he has heard his mother use the word wise Atop thisheap are the English the fascinating remote English people who have notfallen into a rage because they live behind walls and guard their hearts wellThe stereotyping is powerful the more so because it appears deceptivelyunquestioned            There is explicit racism too What for example does onedo with a cup sullied by Coloured lips Does one wash it or does one discardit One bleaches it It is among these careful calibrations that John mustcome into his own Painfully aware of the limitations of class occasionallyable to peer outside the prison house of race he strains to exceed hisinheritance He despairs of his father the failed lawyer the gunner who canthit a bird that doesnt bother with flight the pajamaclad alcoholic whosquelches his cigarettes in his own excrement The son copes as any kid wouldby leaving out the details that most offend him When he tells his friendsabout his fathers service in the South African army during World War II forinstance he drops the lance before corporal But the father remainscommon He cannot aspire            The mother however isanother matter She has tragic potential She lives in fear of breast canceradores Ingrid Bergman learns to ride a bike then ridiculed by her familyabandons it Underneath it all is her rocksolid oppressive devotion to herson Her tolerance feeds his tantrums her servitude his warped sense of selfShe like him is denied wholeness by her downwardly mobile lot and remainsfluttery and distracted almost to the last when she has the moment of clarityher son has dreaded Unlike the mother however the son can and did flee intohis books and beyondto the pastoral beauty of his grandfathers farm forone and toward his future Not that Coetzee invites you to celebrate with himIn Boyhood  as in his other work astringence remains his firstprinciple Frosty of tone flinty of edge he doesnt tell you what to feel orhow to escape Youre on your own
