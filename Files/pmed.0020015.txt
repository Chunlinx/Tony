                    Introduction        The protective effects of antibody to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides have been        appreciated since the development of serum therapy in which passively transferred        serotypespecific antipneumococcal serum reduced mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia by        half  The development of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines for adults  and the        efficacy of pneumococcal polysaccharideprotein conjugate vaccines in infants and children         have confirmed that active immunity to the polysaccharide can provide excellent        protection against invasive disease from pneumococci of the same serotype and in some        cases protection against crossreacting serotypes within the same serogroup        While the ability of passive or vaccineinduced anticapsular antibodies to protect        against pneumococcal disease is clear less is known about the natural development of        immunity to pneumococcal disease in unimmunized persons In unimmunized populations the        incidence of invasive disease follows a wellknown age distribution peaking in the first         y of life declining by more than an order of magnitude by the second and third decades of        life and then rising at an accelerating pace with incidence in persons over  y        approaching that in infants  The reason for the decline in incidence has not been        conclusively determined yet it is often suggested that the acquisition of anticapsular        antibodies plays a critical role in this decline  Indeed it has been proposed that        the human immune system sees each serotype of         Streptococcus pneumoniae as a distinct independent pathogen                The hypothesis that protection from invasive pneumococcal disease is caused by the        acquisition of anticapsular antibodies directed against each of the pneumococcal serotypes        yields two simple predictions about the agespecific epidemiology of pneumococcal disease        First it predicts that the agespecific timing of the decline in invasive disease should        be different for different serotypes those that are rare poorly immunogenic or both        should decline later in life than those that are common and immunogenic Second it        predicts that protection against invasive disease from a given serotype should coincide        temporally with the acquisition of anticapsular antibody to that serotype both at an        individual level and at a population level We tested these predictions using data from the        United States Finland and Israel                    Methods                  United States Dataset          Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was measured in eight sites around the          United States participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Active          Bacterial Core Surveillance between  and  The data used here are restricted to          those periods during which serotyping was routinely performed  for the Georgia          site  for the Minnesota site and  for all other sites  Data were          not available on the timing of anticapsular antibody acquisition in these same          populations but we compared the timing of the decline in pneumococcal disease against          previously published data on agespecific prevalence of anticapsular antibody levels          greater than  mcgml                           Israel Dataset          Antibody concentrations were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA          with absorption by cell wall polysaccharide but not by F polysaccharide in blood          samples that were obtained from  toddlers at enrollment and at approximately  and           mo after enrollment in a doubleblind controlled trial of a ninevalent pneumococcal          conjugate vaccine The toddlers analyzed for this study were those in the control group          which received meningococcal C conjugate vaccine the details of the trial  were          previously described Preliminary analyses of these data confirmed previous findings           that ELISA measurements were highly correlated and therefore likely revealed          crossreactions for all pairs of serotypes except for type  for which correlations          were minimal consistent with previous findings of little crossreaction For this          reason we chose to analyze age trends only in serotype  antibodies                          Finland Dataset          Mandatory reporting from all microbiological laboratories in Finland to the National          Register of Infectious Disease httpwwwktlfistat identified all blood and          cerebrospinal fluid isolates of           S pneumoniae obtained in the years  Incidence          within mo age groups was calculated using population denominators obtained from          Statistics Finland Helsinki Finland Since the primary purpose of examining incidence          in Finland was to compare agespecific rates against published distributions of antibody          concentrations for the same age groups  we restricted our attention to serotype           and serogroup  for which subsequent investigations suggested antibody measurements in          Finland were relatively unaffected by crossreactions  ELISA measurements for          published data from Finland used a special type B polysaccharide that was found to          minimize crossreactions                             Results                  United States Findings          Figure  shows the agespecific incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by          capsular serogroup obtained from populationbased active surveillance in the United          States prior to the introduction of the conjugate vaccine Figure  shows agespecific          incidence by type of infection for the same age range          Incidence peaks between the ages of  and  mo and falls in an approximately          parallel fashion thereafter for each of the seven most important serogroups which are          those included in the sevenvalent conjugate vaccine and for the remaining serogroups          put together The same pattern is observed for both pneumonia and bacteremia For each          serogroup incidence by age  mo is approximately half that in the peak age group and          by  mo incidence for each serogroup has fallen to  of its peak          The consistent timing of the pattern across multiple serogroups argues for a common          mechanism rather than for independent acquisition of immunity to each serogroup as a          separate event Since most individuals do not suffer from invasive pneumococcal disease          in this age range carriage or mucosal disease otitis media from pneumococci may be the          immunizing event for anticapsular antibodies in the general population  although in          principle immunity to some serogroups could be generated in response to crossreacting          antigens from other bacterial species or other sources  Different serogroups have          vastly different frequencies among pneumococci isolated from carriage  and          otitis media  for example serogroups  and  and the nonvaccine serogroups are          isolated far less commonly than several of the other pneumococcal types identified in          Figure  One could postulate that these differences in frequency of carriage are offset          by differences in immunogenicity however there is little evidence that serotypes  or          C are more immunogenic than other far more common serotypes  One could also          postulate that the frequency of isolation of serotypes from carriage depends on duration          as well as incidence so that the serotypes for which carriage appears rare are simply          carried for a shorter duration While the data to address this speculation are limited          the duration of carriage of types  and C seems to be comparable to that of other more          frequently carried serotypes  Thus the most parsimonious interpretation of the          data on the timing of the decline in agespecific susceptibility is that one or more          common mechanisms are responsible for the decline in disease from all serotypes          Testing the second prediction against data is hampered by the fact that to our          knowledge no study has characterized the agespecific distribution of antibody          concentration in a large population using the currently accepted methodology which          includes absorption with both cell wall polysaccharide and serotype F polysaccharide           Analyses by Soininen and colleagues have found that antibodies measured by          standard ELISA in unimmunized children are highly crossreactive between different          serotypes and that crossreactive antibodies lack opsonophagocytic function and often          appear in the absence of any documented exposure to a given capsular serotype As a          result agespecific antibody concentration data for any given serotype are          contaminated to a greater or lesser degree by crossreactive antibodies with other          specificties          The most important exception to this problem occurs for antibodies to serotype  for          which crossreaction is minimal  A recent publication describes the agespecific          proportion of children in the United States with antitype polysaccharide antibody          concentration exceeding the putative protective concentration of  gml Figure  of           At  mo  of the population falls below this level and at  mo           remains below itdespite a  drop in disease incidence from  mo to  mo At           mo  of children remain below the putative protective level although by this age          incidence has fallen more than  from its mo peak In summary if the gml          concentration were truly the threshold for protection the  reduction in the          unprotected population between ages  and  mo would be inadequate to explain the           decline in disease incidence Clearly  gml is not a precise dividing line between          being protected and unprotected a threshold that if it exists may vary by          serotype but given the available data there is reason to doubt that antitype          antibody alone is responsible for the decline in disease in this age range                          Israel Findings          To assess whether the limitations of the United States antibody described aboveie          the availability of only one cutoff point for antibody concentrationsmight be providing          an incomplete picture of the distribution of antibody levels by age we examined an          additional dataset from Israeli toddlers For the reasons described above we examined          only antibodies to serotype  for which the distribution of concentrations by age is          shown in Figure  These data indicate that between the ages of  and  mo the          median antibody concentration increases by about fold These data are broadly          consistent with those published for the United States antibody levels rise very          gradually though detectably during the second and third years of life It is difficult          to believealbeit not impossiblethat the dramatic declines in disease incidence over          these years are explained simply by this small rise in antibody concentrations                          Finland Findings          Incidence of serogroup  and serotype  invasive pneumococcal disease by mo age          groups in Finland shown in Figure  is broadly similar to that found in the United          States albeit with lower absolute incidence for both serogroups Peak incidence occurs          in the mo age group and incidence declines to  of its peak rate by  mo          of age This decline in incidence may be compared against the cumulative distributions of          antibody concentrations in Finnish toddlers shown in Figure  of  Between ages           and  mo there is a discernible increase in the concentration of antibodies in the          population but the median concentration increases by only about fold in this period          Moreover the proportion of the population with antibody concentration below any          particular threshold that may indicate protection changes little in this period For          example the proportion of the population with antitype antibody concentrations less          than  gml declines from approximately  to approximately  and the proportion          with less than  gml is reduced from about  to about  Similar patterns are          seen in the Finnish antibody data for type B  Thus as in the Israeli data only a          very small shift in the distribution of typespecific antipolysaccharide antibody          concentration is observed during the second year of life yet incidence of invasive          disease from the serotypes in question declines substantially                            Discussion        We have assessed two lines of epidemiological evidence analyzed ecologically that bear        on the role of anticapsular polysaccharide antibody as the determinant of protection        against invasive disease that develops during the second and third year of life The        simultaneous and approximately parallel nature of the decline in disease incidence for the        seven most important serogroups in the United States suggests that one mechanism rather        than seven independent mechanisms account for the declines in invasive disease from these        serogroups Moreover only a slight increase in anticapsular antibody concentration is        measurable in Finnish United States and Israeli toddlers during the same age range As we        discuss below each of these lines of evidence is subject to caveats but we believe that        taken together these observations make a strong case for the importance of one or more        factors other than acquisition of anticapsular antibodies in the development of protection        against pneumococcal disease        There are several possible candidates for mechanisms that could explain this agerelated        decline in pneumococcal disease These include the following acquisition of antibodies or        cellular immune responses to noncapsular pneumococcal species antigens agerelated        changes in host biology that are not related to acquired immunity such as maturation of        the innate immune system or changes in anatomy or receptors for pneumococcal attachment        changes in other risk factors such as exposure or changes related to other        microorganisms including changes in the resident flora or changes in the incidence of        viral infections        Systemic antibodies to several pneumococcal protein antigens which are conserved across        pneumococcal strains and serotypes develop following pneumococcal carriage and otitis        media and are present by the beginning of the second year of life  In both Finland         and Kenya  there is an increase in the concentration of antibodies to the        pneumococcal proteins pneumolysin and pneumococcal surface protein A over the first two or        more years of life In Kenya antibodies to another conserved protein pneumococcal surface        adhesin A showed similar distributions in the first second and subsequent years of life        while in Finland levels of these antibodies were already high equivalent to adult levels        in the first year of life and increased above these levels in the second year In mice        either passively transferred human serum IgG against pneumococcal surface protein A or        vaccineinduced antibodies to pneumococcal surface protein A andor pneumolysin are        protective against invasive disease Such data are consistent with the hypothesis that        antibodies to these or perhaps other conserved pneumococcal proteins are in part        responsible for the decline in invasive disease in the second and subsequent years of        life        A number of investigators have tested the hypothesis that antibodies to the pneumococcal        teichoic acid known as cell wall polysaccharide CWPS are capable of protecting        individuals against pneumococcal invasive disease While studies in animals  and humans         have failed to find a protective effect of antibodies to CWPS or its components a        recent study showed that passive transfer of human IgG against phosphorylcholine a        component of CWPS could protect mice against invasive pneumococcal infections         Notably such antibodies might be elicited by a number of bacteria in addition to        pneumococci such as         Haemophilus influenzae which also produce phosphorylcholine We are        unaware of studies on the timing of acquisition of antiCWPS antibodies        We have recently shown that mice that are exposed thrice at weekly intervals to        intranasal colonization with encapsulated pneumococci are protected against subsequent        carriage that this protection is effective for heterologous as well as homologous capsular        types and that it is effective even in MuMT mice which lack the ability to produce        antibodies Malley R Trzcinski K Srivastava A Thompson CM Anderson PW et al        unpublished data We have also shown that intranasal immunization with unencapsulated        killed pneumococci protects against nasopharyngeal colonization in a fashion that is        independent of antibody but requires CD T cells at the time of challenge The relevance        of cellular immune mechanisms in protecting humans against pneumococcal colonization or        disease is not known        Another candidate for a factor that may be changing with age is susceptibility to viral        infections especially influenza which may predispose to pneumococcal colonization  or        disease  Recent evidence from clinical trials of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines        shows that the vaccines can reduce the incidence of infections such as bronchiolitis that        are usually associated with viruses  and of documented virusassociated pneumonia         These findings raise the possibility that the decline in pneumococcal disease with        age reflects in part a decline in the incidence or severity of viral infections so that        fewer such infections lead to secondary pneumococcal disease        Exposure to pneumococci probably changes in some fashion over the first  y of life        However for changes in exposure to account for the sharp drop in disease incidence        following the first birthday it would be necessary for exposure also to drop severalfold        per year over this age range Studies of pneumococcal carriage do show gradual changes in        the prevalence and serotype composition of the nasopharyngeal flora in these years but the        prevalence of carriage changes much more gradually than the incidence of invasive disease                We are not aware of data that bear strongly on the plausibility of other possible        mechanisms for the agerelated decline in pneumococcal disease such as changes in anatomy        physiology receptor expression or resident bacterial flora However factors other than        antibodysuch as innate or acquired cellular immune responses agerelated anatomical        changes or changes in exposure to pneumococcicannot be ruled out and more than one        factor may be involved Indeed the peak of pneumococcal meningitis incidence in the mo        age group see Figure  suggests that the mechanism of protection against meningitis may        differ from those against pneumonia and bacteremia        Although we suggest that anticapsular antibody is not primarily responsible for the        agespecific decline in invasive pneumococcal disease there is no question that the        capsule is an important virulence factor that interacts with the innate and acquired immune        system in a number of ways It is clear that the pneumococcal capsule interferes with        various host clearance mechanisms  It would be unsurprising if different capsular        types were differentially effective in permitting pneumococci to evade phagocytosis and        other host defenses  M Melin H Jarva S Meri and H Kyhty unpublished data If        this were the case then one could envision that certain capsular types might in fact        follow a different agespecific incidence In particular recent analyses suggest that        serotypes  and  have relatively stable incidence over a range of age groups W P        Hausdorff D R Feikin and K P Klugman unpublished data        The evidence adduced here is subject to several limitations With respect to the        relative timing of acquisition of protection against different serotypes one could        postulate that because some of the most common pneumococcal serotypes such as B F and        F are also among the least immunogenic  the effective exposure of the immune system        is more consistent across serogroups than it appears from serogroup frequency alone        However this pattern is not general for example serotype  is both very common and        highly immunogenic  With respect to the absolute timing of protection relative to the        acquisition of antibody one could argue that low levels of anticapsular antibody perhaps        of low affinity may be present and even active at levels below those that can be reliably        detected by current assays or that B cell memory may be present and protective at an        earlier age than that at which high levels of antibody are measurable Inferences about        protective antibody concentrations from animal studies and from concentrations achieved by        vaccines suffer from several uncertainties Making allowances for all of these limitations        we nonetheless believe the data suggest that mechanisms other than anticapsular antibody        are primarily responsible for the agespecific decline in pneumococcal invasive disease        that starts at the age of  y        The likelihood that mechanisms other than anticapsular antibody confer immunity to        pneumococcal disease has important implications with respect to vaccine design As        experience with conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in children unfolds it is becoming        increasingly clear that such a strategy suffers from several limitations including the        possibility of serotype replacement already confirmed in several clinical trials a        modest effect on nasopharyngeal colonization limited serotype coverage cost and        difficulties in production that have led to shortages since licensure A better        understanding of the mechanisms that underlie natural immunity to pneumococcus could pave        the way for the development of more effective speciesspecific pneumococcal vaccines
