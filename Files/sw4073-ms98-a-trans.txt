                okay i guess were recording now so   yeah   i think they could uh uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program and youve got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff   yeah   and then they get paid for recycling it so  i dont know if thats very fair or not   well Dallas is talking about starting something like that too its going to be i i dont know if its three dollars a week i think its three dollars a month is what we are going to have to pay   um   uh we do recycle an awful lot of stuff here i i up until a couple of years ago i use to get paid   oh   maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and   yeah   something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and nowadays its like i i cant find one place thats going to take everything   yeah well thats   and i am trying to recycle my kitchen my kitchen waste by building a compost pile and thats not easy either i wish i could figure out an easier way   thats for sure   of doing that but uh   uh well we we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that and then take it to WalMart because they use to have a recycling bin   yeah   and but they got rid of them because theres a lot of people were throwing their trash and stuff in there so   and they just got rid of them well Krogers uh at least in Dallas Krogers will pay for aluminum and will collect the glass and the plastic   yeah   but they dont collect newspaper and they dont collect tin cans and they dont collect cardboard and i know that the place at Galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area thats for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there   yeah   so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and i have all these you know cardboard packaging stuff left over then i go and i recycle that over there but its you know i have to run around town to get my stuff recycled   yeah that i always say they should have just one central place you know where you can just dump them all   yeah uh   or in you know cause really i am not really looking for the the money portion of it you know i just     well i use to it use to be a good deal us to give instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them   oh yeah     some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and   yeah ive heard   but know its just you know i cant do that because they dont earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but   yeah   you know and i would also id like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community theyre recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff thats four or six doesnt get recycled   yeah yeah and uh and you know and if its recyclable why cant they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know its just   well or if it has to be separated by number why doesnt someone take it i mean i cant find its i cant even find somewhere that will take the stuff   yeah yeah thats   yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance   yeah   and to define recycle paper as paper that includes you know material that had actually been used as paper before     yeah   one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends   yeah   you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes   yeah   well thats what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it thats what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they dont have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber   yeah   and they call that recycled paper   um   you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to you know how to clean up
