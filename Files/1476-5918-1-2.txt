                    Background        Aging has been associated with decreased function and        exercise performance      Decreased exercise        performance has been related to decreased oxidative        capacity     and decreased muscle mass     Vascular        alterations in structure and function due to aging could        also contribute to decreased exercise performance through        impaired blood flow     Decreased capillary density           and a thickening of vascular walls    are present with        aging        Vascular function is altered with aging and may        influence muscle blood flow and exercise performance        Altered vascular function in older individuals is evidenced        as impaired endothelial function       an altered        ratio of endothelin receptors     andor altered        reactivity of the smooth muscle to sympathetic activity             Reduced endothelial function is related to impaired        formation and decreased activation of nitric oxide            and is particularly prominent in older subjects with        evidence of cardiovascular disease     diabetes            or obesity     Interestingly aging does not appear        to effect endothelium independent vasodilation                    These structural and functional alterations in the        vascular system may explain age associated reductions in        muscle blood flow Decreased leg blood flow and vascular        conductance are present in elderly compared to young        subjects during whole body exercise    and in response        to reactive hyperemia     Decreased basal limb blood        flow was related to increased vasoconstriction in the        elderly compared to younger individuals     However        not all studies have shown age related changes in blood        flow Resting blood flow and post exercise hyperemia was        similar in elderly compared to younger subjects            Blood flow responses to single limb exercise have also been        preserved in older individuals      Discrepancies in        aging effects on muscle blood flow may be due to the use of        active    or inactive subjects     In addition it        is not clear whether the age related changes in blood flow        were a result of reduced cardiac output during whole body        exercise or reduced local vascular capacity These        inconsistent findings of reduced blood flow in older        subjects suggest that other ageassociated factors are        involved        Physical activity status influences vascular function        and may explain alterations in muscle blood flow Exercise        training increases cardiac output during exercise and        increases skeletal muscle blood flow in response to        reactive hyperemia     Arterial diameters             capillary density      vascular reactivity             and endothelial function     are improved with        training and reduced with inactivity        The purpose of this study was to determine if aging had        an influence on muscle blood flow independent of habitual        physical activity levels Specifically we examined single        leg blood flow in response to reactive hyperemia with        active and inactive older subjects in comparison to active        and inactive young subjects We tested the hypothesis that        aging would result in reductions in limb blood flow        independent of physical activity                    Methods                  Subjects          Thirtyfive subjects participated in the study between

Older Inactive          OI mean   years n   Subjects were classified          as active if they reported participating in  minutes of          moderate intensity exercise at least three times a week          for the previous six months The subjects classified as          inactive reported no regular physical exercise All          subjects reported no history of disease or other          confounding

Georgia                          Protocol          Subjects rested in a supine position for  minutes          prior to testing Resting blood pressure was obtained          Ischemia was induced in the

Doppler ultrasound was recorded using an          insonation angle of  The velocity gate was set to          include the entire arterial diameter Doppler waveforms          were analyzed to determine the time average maximum          velocity by General Electrics advanced vascular program          software Bmode images were measured during diastole to          determine vessel diameter Peak systolic blood flow was          calculated as the product of the vessel cross sectional          area and time average maximal velocity Blood flow          response to  minutes of cuff ischemia was an index of          peak blood flow response     Conductance was          calculated by dividing the maximal blood flow by the mean          arterial pressure MAP Half time to recovery was          determined as the time where blood flow dropped to one          half the magnitudes between maximum flow and resting flow          values                          Near Infrared Spectroscopy NIRS          Muscle oxygen delivery was determined by the half time          of recovery of oxygen saturation after cuff ischemia              Oxygen saturation was measured using a continuous          light source dual wavelength NIRS device Runman CW          NIM Inc Philadelphia The probe contained two small          tungsten filament lamps  cm apart which emit white          light and two photo detectors with filters for  and           nm light located between the lights Brief flashes of          light migrated through the tissue and were collected by          the detectors at wavelengths

at  and           nm was used as the index of relative oxygen          saturation                          Leg volume          Leg volume measurements were determined by Doppler          ultrasound measurements of fat thickness and by          circumference measurements of the lower leg Subcutaneous          fat was determined by Bmode images of the thickness          between skin and muscle fascia Measurements were          attained every three centimeters over the Medial          Gastrocnemius and over the Anterior Tibialis muscles          Based on the circumference and fat measurements total          leg fat and lean area volume were calculated                          Analysis          An analysis of variance ANOVA SPSS version           was conducted to test for aging and activity effects as          well as to test for differences by group Data was          analyzed to verify normality and to test for any          outliers Analyses were conducted at a significance

activity had an effect on peripheral blood flow The        primary finding of this study was that peak blood flow        capacity was related to activity level while there was no        age effect independent of activity level Our results are        consistent with others which have reported no agerelated        changes in maximal flow capacity after exercise              A strength of this study was that maximal blood flow        capacity was normalized to estimated lean muscle mass to        correct for agerelated decreases in muscle mass                   We did not find age related changes in resting blood        flow or resting diameter In contrast other studies have        found agerelated changes in resting blood flow which have        been attributed to increases in sympathetic tone             Aging has been associated with reduced blood flow and        vascular conductance during whole body exercise            The reduction in blood flow and conductance have been        related to alterations in cardiac output and blood volume        due to aging     Several of our resting blood flow        variables approached significance p values below         indicating that our results may have been significant with        a larger sample size However the significance of age        related changes in resting blood flow are unclear other        than serving as a marker for altered sympathetic tone        especially if maximal blood flow capacity is not changed        with age        We found that our active subjects had greater maximal        blood flow capacity   than our inactive subjects        regardless of age Consistent with our results Martin et        al    reported a greater vasodilatory capacity in        trained than untrained subjects independent of age        Inactivity has been associated with impaired efficiency of        peripheral oxygen extraction    and reduced blood flow        after cuff ischemia     Conversely exercise training        results in greater maximal flow capacity             Regular aerobic exercise also prevents the ageassociated        loss in endothelium dependent vasodilation maintaining        maximal flow capacity     Our findings support previous        research that maximal flow capacity is maintained by        aerobic exercise and is independent of age        Because blood flow is dependent on perfusion pressure        blood flow data is often presented as conductance flow        divided by mean arterial pressure This is important in        aging studies as age is associated with increases in blood        pressure      We found that maximal conductance was        reduced in our older subjects consistent with a higher        mean arterial pressure in these subjects We also found        higher maximal conductance in the young active group        compared to the older inactive subjects again explained by        differences in mean arterial pressure Another study has        reported aging to be associated with reduced conductance            However it is unclear how important differences in        maximal conductance between groups is when there is no        difference in maximal blood flow The lack of difference in        blood flow suggests that oxygen delivery is not compromised        despite the reduced conductance It is possible that the        vascular system in the older subjects has compensated for        the higher mean arterial pressures        Consistent with the lack of age differences in maximal        blood flow we found no age differences in oxygen delivery        as measured by NIRS Oxygen delivery after exercise has        been found to be similar between healthy active older and        younger subjects     It was expected however that        oxygen delivery would be different between the active and        inactive individuals The older inactive did appear to have        prolonged oxygen delivery but the young inactive did not        This suggests that oxygen delivery may be more sensitive to        the interaction of age and inactivity Future studies are        needed to clarify the influence of age and activity level        on oxygen delivery        An interesting finding in this study was that the half        time to recovery of blood flow was prolonged   in the        older compared to young subjects independent of activity        status This is one of the first studies to our knowledge        that has investigated blood flow recovery kinetics in these        populations Slow recovery of blood flow has been used as        an index of reduced vascular reactivity in coronary        arteries     The hyperemic response to ischemia is        dependent on the presence and response to metabolic factors        and vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide and        adenosine     The prolonged recovery of blood flow in        our study could be due to either a greater buildup of        metabolic factorsvasoactive substances andor a diminished        ability to remove them in the older subjects This study        however was not designed to determine the mechanism for        the increased time for blood flow to recover A prolonged        half time to recovery has been associated with a decreased        nitric oxide and prostanoid production    and a loss of        endothelium dependent vasodilation     Reduced vascular        reactivity is associated with many diseases that are        associated with aging       We did not find        activity effects on half time to recovery This finding        contrasts other previously published studies which have        shown decreased vascular reactivity in individuals who are        required to be on bed rest     and in individuals        with spinal cord injuries     It is possible that the        differences in activity levels between our groups in this        study were not large enough to produce the same effects        that are seen with bed rest and spinal cord injury        In summary we found that maximal blood flow capacity        was significantly related to activity level but was not        related to age Blood flow calculated as conductance was        related to aging and activity consistent with the reduced        blood flow in the inactive subjects and the higher blood        pressures in the older subjects In addition the older        subjects had evidence of reduced vascular reactivity as        measured by prolonged half time to recovery independent of        activity status The prolonged half time to recovery in the        older subjects is likely related to a reduced vascular        reactivity associated with increased cardiovascular disease        risk Thus maximal flow capacity and the half time to        recovery of blood flow are influenced by different        mechanisms in young and older active and inactive        subjects
