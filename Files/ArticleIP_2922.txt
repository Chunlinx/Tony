                                 Wandering Jew            ByChristopher Benfey                           posted Tuesday May                         Youregreeted at the door by the page boy from Maxims his hand extended for apourboire  Page Boy at Maxims  circa  At first the figurelooks almost cute in his fire engine red suit but is that a roll of bills inhis left hand or is he making an obscene gesture And those hollow black eyesscarred hands and sunken chestdont they seem just a bit sepulchral Is hewelcoming us to Maxims or to the underworld            For the moment atleast hes guarding the entrance to the stunning show at the Jewish Museumdevoted to the work of Chaim Soutine  the Lithuanianborn Jewishpainter who worked in Paris between the world wars This is the first majorexhibition in a New York museum to be devoted to Soutines work in nearly yearssince that is the epochmaking retrospective of  at the Museum ofModern Art The timing of that show mounted just seven years after Soutinesdeath was in one sense perfect and in another highly problematic It coincidedexactly with the extraordinary rise of Abstract Expressionism and the seismicshift of the center of the art world from Paris to New York Artists andcritics were eager to see in Soutine a Parisian precursor of Willem deKooningwho claimed to be crazy about Soutineand Jackson Pollock Theextraordinary landscapes that Soutine painted around  in the provincialtown of Cret with their swirling wreaths of thick paint and decenteredstructure could easily be mistaken for early de Koonings Click here for an example Was Soutine at this time what mightbe called an abstract expressionist the critic and curator Monroe Wheelerasked rhetorically in the MoMA catalog            But in other ways the timing of the MoMA show was awkwardand even potentially embarrassing As France was welcomed back to the postwarcommunity of nations no one felt like asking tough questions about Frenchacquiescence in the Holocaust In the  catalog Wheeler implied thatSoutines death in  had little to do with the Occupation Soutine hewrote suffered no specific persecution or violence during the war In he was offered an opportunity to come to America but he would not takeadvantage of it He lived with a friend  in Touraine And so on But asthe art historian Remy Golan notes in a catalog essay for the current showafter having provided hospitality to Soutine and thousands of Jewishimmigrants like him for three decades the French essentially abandoned them totheir own fate during the years of German occupation Soutine wasnt justliving with a friend in the countryside He was in flight from the Nazis andtheir French functionaries hiding and constantly on the move He returned toParis only when a severe stomach ulcer condition necessitated a lastminuteoperation It came too late and he died            So the current show atthe Jewish Museum offers an opportunity both to reevaluate Soutinesconnection to de Kooning and Pollock and to dig more deeply into Soutinesrelation to French culture and to his own Jewishness The show is arranged in amanner to do just that though with a resulting wrenching of chronology andlittle attention to Soutines life The  paintings in the show are hung inthree sections each corresponding to one of the three ways critics have viewedSoutine Soutine as an untutored primitive painter which is how he was seenin the s Soutine as a master and the last great hope for traditionalpainting in Francehis reputation in the s and Soutine as a prophet ofAbstract Expressionism which is what critics thought in the s when theyrediscovered him It is this third phase that leads to the biggestdislocation in the show since visitors see the abstract paintings of theCret period last though they were among the earliest Soutine painted Thefirst two phasesfrom primitive to masterhappen to follow pretty muchdirectly from the circumstances of Soutines life to the extent that we knowthem            The youthful Soutine seems to step right out of an IsaacBashevis Singer story Since he left almost no paper trailfew letters nodrawings no artistic manifestoesthe same stories gleaned from friends anddealers have been recycled over the years Soutine was born the  thof  children to an impoverished tailor or more precisely a mender and hiswife in Smilovitchi a village near Minsk Legends about his childhoodofwhich he may have been the sourceinclude his theft of some kitchen utensilsto buy his first colored pencil and his early portrait of a local rabbi Therabbis son evidently responding to the Jewish injunction against gravenimages beat up Soutine then paid a reparation of  rubles toward Soutineseducation Soutine trained first with artists in Minsk and Vilna then made thejourney to Paris where he studied briefly in a formal art academy while livingin the most abject poverty            Some of his earlieststill lifes dating from  to  look like little parables ofdeprivation three anorexic herrings on a plate with two forks why twogroping across them  Still Life With Herrings  circa  The table istipped upward almost meeting the picture plane Such paintings along with theswirling Cret landscapes struck collectors of the s as naive just thesort of unschooled stuff youd expect from a Slavic child of the shtetl The critic Waldemar George wrote in  Is this not the art of an exile oreven a savage Soutines big break came in  when one of thoseconnoisseurs of the primitive the eccentric Philadelphia art educator DrAlbert Barnes bought up  of Soutines paintings making Soutine an art worldcelebrity almost overnight            But almost as soon as he had experienced thisCinderellalike reversal of fortune Soutine developed second thoughts abouthis work up to that point and tried to destroy as much of it as he could gethis hands on No longer the wild and visionary improviser Soutine nowapprenticed himself to the great painterly painters of the past CourbetChardin and Rembrandt If you preferred his early landscapes it was easy toregard this new Soutine asin the words of Clement Greenberg who reviewed theMoMA showa victim of the museum But if you liked the later paintings asFrench critics of the s tended to do they seemed like the next step in thegreat French tradition Soutine the SlavicJewish outsider quickly becameSoutine the quintessential insider a masterly upholder of the standards ofsophisticated French art            Neverable to paint anything unless he had it before his eyes Soutine set aboutreenacting some of the classic paintings he loved most He persuaded peasantwomen to hike up their skirts and stand in cold streams just as Rembrandt haddemanded He acquired a skate from the fishmonger and painted a looseparaphrase of a Chardin still life In imitation of Rembrandts flayed ox ondisplay at the Louvre Soutine hung a carcass of beef in his studio In acarnivalesque reassigning of roles he hired a model to sweep away the fliesfrom the decaying meat To keep the colors fresh he dabbed the carcass withblood from a pail then grabbed his paintbrushes to capture those lurid reds oncanvas This was the kind of scene that an action painter could relish DeKooning could have been thinking of his idol Soutine when he observed Fleshwas the reason why oil painting was invented            Youd think Soutine with his obsessive delight in fleshwould paint nudes but no he painted only one in his whole career and its aminor painting But at the same time he was painting his carcasses of cattleand fowl around  Soutine painted a series of portraits of uniformedworkersbellhops pastry cooks groomsof which the Maxims page boy isprobably the best known This parallel obsession elicited the interestingsuggestion from the critic Maurice Tuchman that both animals especiallysacrificed animals and uniformed domestics were scapegoats of sorts WhileSoutineunlike Chagall to whom he is sometimes compareddid not paintstereotypically Jewish subjects he may have been alluding with those dangling fowl to a Yom Kippur rite in which a slaughteredchicken was whirled around a rabbis head in a ritual of absolution It mayalso be worth noting that with their red or white uniforms these servantsallowed Soutine to retain his lurid fleshy palate            It hasbeen tempting to see in Soutines flayed forms a premonition of things to comeThe curators of the Jewish Museum show in a volley of questions invite such aresponse            Mightnt the evisceratedcows and the fowl in the throes of death be experienced as modernist mementimori fetishistic reminders of the darkest cruelest and most primitive humaninstincts Couldnt Soutines eruptive vertiginous landscapes be construed asrecollections of a ravaged Europe or even as the foreshadowing of anapocalyptic postatomic future            And soon            The irony is that Soutine seems to have viewed the arrivalof the Nazis at least initially with a certain equanimity more cheerful thanfatalistic Perhaps he had so thoroughly identified his art at this point withFrench national traditionswas he not the legitimate heir of Courbetthat hehardly imagined himself to be a potential victim One of his mistressesrecalled him reading with admiration editorials by the collaborationistidealogue Charles Maurras of Action Franaise  and explaining that heapproved of social inequality because it presented magnificent opportunitiesfor everyone One day she said to him You have had great unhappiness in yourlife havent you Soutine He replied No What makes you think that I havealways been a happy man            Nonetheless the image fromhis late work that stays with you is a little picture from the PhillipsCollection called Return From School After the Storm circa  Herethe paint is as swirling and thick as in Soutines earliest landscapes The twochildren hold hands fearfully as storm clouds hover ominously above them Thetwo vulnerable figures are literally molded of paint the girls left hand jutsout a quarterinch from the canvas in one thick dab The title is notSoutines I dont think its a school that these children are running fromand I dont think the storm is behind them
