                                 The Business of Net Campaigns             Twelveyears ago I worked at a small leftleaning think tank in New York City As the presidential primary election approached we thought the voters might wantto differentiate between the various candidates So we drew up  questionscovering everything from reflagging oil tankers in the Persian Gulf a hotissue at the time to gay and lesbian rights            Wethen mailed letters to the dozen or so declared candidates from both partiesand requested position statements from their campaigns We deliberately ccdthe issues managers figuring that this clever move would expedite theresponses It didnt The Republicans practically ignored us The Democrats hadto be wooed cajoled and mildly threatened before they coughed up theiranswers Ultimately we printed a decentsized booklet and sold severalthousand copies at  apiece It was a modest contribution to the cause of aninformed electorate and it yielded an equally modest return on the investmentof our  or so hardworked hours            Todayit would take just a couple of hours for a person with a Web connection and aprinter to produce a similar document for the  presidential race Each ofthe declared presidential candidates maintains a sophisticated Web site thatdetails positions on a wide range of critical issues Granted if you visithttpgopatgoorgclick on Issues and read Pat Buchanans statement on the environment youmay find the air a bit thin But this is presidential politics and vaguepositions are hardly unique to cyberspace            Aswith other areas of the Net email is the great connector Any campaign cannow take a press release that at one time would have gone to a few dozenpolitical reporters and email it to tens of thousands even millions ofInternet users That remarkable development helps to bind a portion of theelectorate more tightly to the campaigns But were still talking about a pressrelease and any reporter will tell you that the value of such releases isinversely proportional to the volume received            Thatsjust one illustration of how the Nets contributions to American Democracyremains nascent and hard to define While the  campaign will be the firstpresidential contest in which the Web plays a significant role it is unclearhow profound that role will be see Jacob Weisbergs accompanying piece            One ofthe premises of the Standard is that the Internet has seeped into andchanged every important business in the United Statesand will soon have thesame effect around the world Politics is not exempt Although its all toooften overlooked as a business American politics is a multibilliondollarindustry that employs millions So its the Standard s job to cover howthe Internet will shape it And thats the mandate for our onceaweekcontribution to Net Election                           Politics               Meets Ecommerce                        Whatdoes politicsasNetbusiness mean In the most salient case campaignsthemselves are businesses albeit shortlived ones that cannot legally make aprofit As of midJuly more than six months before anyone could cast a votefor Bill Bradley the former basketball star had raised more than through his Web site Thats only about  percent of his contributions But thesite wasnt operational until January Moreover it wasnt until June that thefederal government said it would match online credit card contributions withpublic funds just as it matches money raised the oldfashioned way With thatdecision every campaign has been rethinking its Internet fundraisingstrategies Well be closely examining their renewed efforts            Onequestion that leaps to mind is Are there viable forms of ecommerce that playoff of a political audience To date the answer is essentially no Sure youcan connect to the Arizona Democratic Partys online gift shop Buthow many donkey Beanie Babies do you think have been sold there eBay is notyet disturbed            Stillthe tip of political ecommerce is beginning to poke up through the Webssurface In May Texas Gov George W Bush tried to quash the parody sitewwwgwbushcom sayinginfamously There ought to be limits to freedom The result The site got million hits in a month Net logic holds that eyeballs equal dollars and sureenough the controversial site was soon peddling Tshirts and bumper stickersfeaturing Bushs quote Another site looking to cash in on the campaign iswwwgorecom  Its not officially affiliated with theGore campaign but the site sells a wide array of Goreparaphernaliaeverything from buttons to gourmet coffee And it gives apackage of free collectibles to any Webmaster who picks up its banner                           Online               Advertising Gets Political                        TheInternet has already begun to transform the general advertising industry andit will soon hold sway over the tens of millions of dollars spent everyelectoral season on television and radio ads Web advertising holds the strangeposition of being almost entirely unregulated Fraud and defamation lawspresumably apply to Net advertising just as they do to all advertising Butthe specific sections of communications law that constrain political speech inthe electronic mediaincluding provisions for equal time for allcandidatesdo not apply to the Internet            Consider how such loopholes can alter the electronic media landscape Eachweekday Steve Forbes records a brief commentary about his pertinent issuesThe Forbes campaign claims that more than  stations in  states carrythis commentary Just because they carry it of course doesnt mean theyactually play it five times a week According to federal regulationsbeginning  days before a primary any radio station that carries a preparedaudio message from a presidential candidate is required to give equal time toany other candidate who requests it As a practical matter most radio stationsin that situation would simply drop the Forbes editorials But his Web site cancontinue to pump out a Netcast with no interference            Changes like these should spur Net piggybacking throughout the  raceHeres how it works Say a candidate is adamantly opposed to any form of newtaxes regardless of whether they are advocated by the opponent So thecandidate crafts a second TV spot that does not directly attack her opponentbut warns viewers of an ominous hightax future and instructs them to punch upwwwnonewtaxescom where theyll find a complete history of the opponentsrecord on taxation Viewers might be asked to fill out petitions with their ZIPcodes and email addresses which would be used to alert them to the ads nextinstallment These techniques have already been used in a number of Senate andcongressional campaigns            Finally well also bewatching the Net polling Net focus groups and Net organizing that follow theflow of money around an election Our goal shared with editorial partner                  Slate                is to capture the way the unfolding  presidential racelooks from the Web Whether youre a political junkie or not we hope youllfind Net Election informative enlightening and fun At least as much fun aspresidential politics will allow
