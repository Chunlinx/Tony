              well ive kind of resisted having any pets because well i had some pets as a child   uhhuh   but uh now that i have two kids theyre sort of like pets       you have to take care of them a lot and they require a lot of time and um neatness and plus you know now that im married i have a husband that i do some things that you know help him   uhhuh   and so it seems like i have plenty things to do and so i thought that if we got a pet that that would be just one more person   what kind of pet did you have as what kind of pets did you have as children   well the kids you know the kids wanted   the kids love all kinds of pets you know cats and dogs and things and i know some kinds of pets are more   uhhuh     independent and as a child i had um you know like a we had a dog and we had turtles and we had um you know small lot of the small things like i know we got a little bunny at Easter once and   uhhuh uhhuh   a little baby chicken and all that but they say you shouldnt do that any more but um   yeah well i have um i have a cat that ive had for about eight or nine years   uhhuh oh yeah   and i wouldnt trade her for anything  i also have a child   uhhuh   cats lot easier  to take care of than the child you can go away and leave her for a few days   yes they can take care of themselves especially cats are pretty good about being independent   yeah ive left her well ive left her alone up to about four days   uhhuh   because she doesnt shes real good she doesnt overeat or anything   uhhuh   and so i can leave food out and know that you know she only eats when shes hungry i know some people have cats that no matter how much you put down theyll eat it all   oh yeah   and then if im if im gone longer than that then ill have somebody come in and um you know make sure that she has food and and fresh water usually i just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen and ive even she drinks out of the toilet     well we just last week we got a gerbil thats a thing that i picked for the kids because they were wanting to have a pet and i i didnt want to have one i picked gerbils because   uhhuh   they apparently they arent like you know they dont smell as bad as other   uh well you have to keep uh if you dont keep them clean my friend had gerbils and you could smell it as soon as  you walked into their her house   yeah oh thats awful and i dont like that odor and um and they dont require as much but well see how it works out it wasnt as its not something that um i had to like learn to   yeah   something thats going to be running around your house that if youre unaccustomed to that you wouldnt like such a big change and they stay in their little cage and  you throw a few things in there theyre not loving you know you know like a cat   yeah yeah can you hold did they let you hold them or   well were just getting used to them right now were kind of just letting you know touching them   uhhuh   and weve picked them up before but that was kind of scaring them pretty bad right now   was it are they young do you know how old they are   well they they seem like you know they were smaller compared to some of the other ones   uhhuh   but we we i did that i let the kids have a pet because i wanted them to have practice in caring for someone else and you know not being so selfish   uhhuh how old how old are your kids   theyre four and five   okay mines five   and i thought it would be good for them to just practice you know having someone else to care for and everything i know that a lot of pets a lot of people have pets because they make good companions and   yeah   friends and   they do or my cat does to me like she doesnt like anybody but me in fact no one would know i had her because if anyone comes over she immediately goes into hiding   uhhuh     but um i i had a dog for a while before i had my son and i grew up we grew up having dogs and id like to have a dog but   uhhuh   kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so   uhhuh   you know i cant leave a dog like i can leave a cat   yeah   and plus they require a lot in the way of training and which now that im home would probably be a good time to do it if i were going to do it but you know i just dont you know there i dont know why but with dogs it seems you have to have a lot more vet bills   yeah   plus theyre more expensive to get   yeah   now my cat ive had her for eight or nine years i had her spayed and i had her declawed which you know was an initial expense but then she has not been sick one day i have never had her to the vet other than just her you know her maintenance stuff and it seems like whenever ive had a dog you know something always theyre always getting sick or you know breaking a leg or   uhhuh   something   yeah   and i just i dont need that expense right now plus they eat more and   expensive to maintain and keep the flea powder and the flea dip and   yeah that yeah i dont know if thats such a big problem here in Dallas       my cat stays inside because shes declawed so i dont really have a problem with that but yeah if you had a dog you know they need exercise and you have to walk them   uhhuh uhhuh thats true they are a lot i guess thats the number one reason why im im not really ready to have a pet too much  i kind of consider these gerbils just kind of something you look at     not really pets just kind of things   yeah they are not because they dont really acknowledge that they know you you know its not like a pet pet a pet is someone that comes up to you and is happy to see you and that kind of thing   yeah yeah yeah well they make you feel special you know i live alone with my five year old and my cat and she really does she makes me feel like she cares about me and   but uhhuh   you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because im cooped up in the house all day   thats true   and um i would like to have what i would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really nice fish   um   but until i get in a place where i feel like thats where im going to be for  a long time theyre just their so hard to move   a long time yes and they they take up a lot of you know good space you know kind of like a bookcase   yeah now i have some friends who have aquariums and i enjoy watching the fish and looking in at them you know but thats something that you really i feel need to learn about and read about you know you need to learn how to take care of them and you need to learn   uhhuh huh   what fish are compatible you know and what ones you can put together and what ones you cant you know how to feed them and how to you know to clean them you know the thought of cleaning an aquarium is not very  pleasing but   no   with filters and all that stuff that they have now i mean theyre almost maintenance free   yes and i noticed um thats kind of what i was attracted to these gerbils for is that they they have a certain area that they use like their bathroom   uhhuh   and you can just um you know rinse that out its kind off to the side it unscrews and   yeah well thats good   and so you can just take it out with a garden hose rinse it out   oh   and you supposedly you dont have to change all of the the bedding and everything except every three weeks which is not very often   well thats good yeah thats not bad i had two i managed i guess when i was in high school or junior high i managed to talk my parents into letting me have a gerbil   uhhuh   i wont tell you what happened to it  if you just got them you dont   oh no its something awful  oh   poor thing part of it was my fault i guess i just didnt take care of it like i should have   um well im hoping that itll be a little bit of diversion for the kids and a little bit of a   do they like to watch him   they do and theyre anxious for us to be able to hold it but i these just arent going to be as tame as the book i got a book first   uhhuh   they just dont seem like um well i guess weve have them about a week now and theyre just not kind of   how many did you get did you get two are they male or female does that make a difference   two well we hope that we got two females so that theyre supposed to get along better   uhhuh   and they wont have any babies   but you dont really know   i guess we wont know unless they never have any babies   really until there are about six more in the cage     well you know the people that sold them go well its hard to tell but we think and were going oh great     oh no   so if they have babies then well have to get rid of one of them     but ive heard that it that after they have babies that you have to separate the then you have to separate the male from the female or the male could hurt the babies   yeah thats what i hear so im hoping i think they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something   yeah   so within a month i guess or two well know     oh no thats funny   well i guess i better run go   okay well it was nice talking to you   yes nice   and good luck   well thanks and it was nice to hear that youve had such good luck with your cat   yeah i i i know my cat shes reaching her life expectancy and im already thinking oh no
