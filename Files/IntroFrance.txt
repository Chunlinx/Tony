                      FRANCE AND THE FRENCH        For many years France was a nation of internal contrasts         between the more urban and industrial north and the rural south        between the intellectual elite and the largely agricultural workforce        between chic Paris and the less sophisticated provincial cities  and a        nation that saw itself as standing alone distinct from all others        Much has changed in recent times Paris is no longer the        ultimate mecca for ambitious young French from the provinces cities        around the country are attracting young professionals who want to        escape the more frenetic life in the Ile de France the number of        agricultural workers has shrunk dramatically industrial and hightech        centers have sprung up around the country provincial cities are        developing their own international reputations and immigration and        increasing migration of populations within a borderfree European        Union are blurring the edges of the French identity        France remains however a splendid and individualist        country that has much to offer to the foreign visitor The French        people  despite occasional rumors to the contrary  welcome tourists        and are eager to show off their country their way of life their        traditions and their beliefs in short their essential joie de vivre        They are proud of their nation and have a right to be        Quality of life remains their paramount preoccupation It is        no accident that the French are best known for their food and wine        their clothes and perfumes their dashing art and monumental        architecture Their love of perfection serves them well        Give French cooks a couple of eggs and they wont just boil        them fry them or make an omelette all of which theyre quite        prepared to do superlatively  they feel obliged to produce a delicate        souffl or a rich hollandaise sauce that makes an egg proud to be an        egg Even a lowly croquemonsieur is a world away from a ham and cheese        sandwich You will still find the elegant spare plates of nouvelle        cuisine but there is a new focus on heartier dishes and an acceptance        of cuisines of other countries        The French attention to detail is found in all walks of life         from the way a scarf is tied to the planning of the summer flower        displays found in small villages national prizes for the prettiest        village are hotly contested        France is blessed with an astonishing variety of landscapes        long high dunes on the Atlantic Coast craggy coves in Brittany        vineyards in Burgundy steep gorges in the Tarn olive trees and        vineyards umbrella pines and cypresses in Provence and lazy beaches        in the Cte dAzur All these are as typical of France as the more        conventional images of rolling green meadows bounded by straggling        hedgerows and arrowstraight avenues lined with plane trees a village        visible on the horizon clustered around its church        The country is a veritable compendium of geography The        plains and plateaus of Picardy in the north and Alsace to the east lend        themselves to largescale agriculture before ending in the gentler        rolling green fields of Normandy to the west and the vineyards of        Burgundy that herald the beginnings of the south        The Alps of Savoie and the Dauphin peter out in the rugged        little Alpilles of Provence The formidable barrier of the Pyrnes        forms the frontier with Spain        With these mountain ranges protecting the eastern and        southern frontiers the mild Atlantic winds penetrate deep inland        bringing with them all the rain and sun needed for a highly productive        agriculture while avoiding the extremes of a continental climate        Inland from the Atlantic coast  Aquitaine Dordogne        Prigord  the southwest is rich in farming and vineyards Its the        land of good duck and goose of fine Bordeaux wines Pointing out into        the Atlantic on the countrys western edge Brittanys spectacular        shoreline has earned the region a reputation for rough weather In fact        it enjoys the mildest of climates even in winter and provides many a        pleasant seaside resort in summer        The kings and counts and feudal lords have gone from the        Loire Valley and the forests and marshes of Sologne but the hunting        and fishing country remains At the countrys heart slightly north of        the geographical center Paris nestles in a basin ideal for industrial        and commercial enterprise comfortably surrounded by the forest and        farmland of the IledeFrance And the Champagne area lies conveniently        to the east to help celebrate its successes        If the land itself is the most obvious source of French        pride the nations cultural wealth is just as important Philosophy        and the fine arts do not intimidate the French as something to be        confined to a small lite For most people intellectual is not the        dirty word it seems to be in so many other countries Museums are as        popular as sports stadiums and crowds flock to theater and music        festivals in spring summer and autumn all over the country Even        popular arts such as advertising the cinema comic strips and fashion        are elevated to the level of high culture with their own museums and        festivals        An active government cultural policy in recent years has        preserved the architectural monuments of the national patrimony from        the ravages of time weather war revolution and urban development        Throughout the s partly in preparation for the  Millennium        celebrations faades were scrubbed and buildings generally        refurbished Innovative use has been made of outdoor facilities for        summer festivals especially Roman ruins and medieval monasteries In        addition to recorded commentaries you will find bright young art        historians who are enthusiastic about the places where they work and        their areas of knowledge Their descriptions are fresh and informative        and theyre glad to answer questions that go beyond the brochure or        guidebook Many important monuments are beautifully lit at night        making city centers an evening treat        While Paris is still a major destination for sightseers        travelers should not ignore the charms of such provincial cities and        towns as Lyon Montpellier Rouen and Strasbourg All feature a blend        of ancient and modern of dignity and fun and strive to make the        visitor feel welcome and treasured        The country offers plenty of outdoor enjoyment too        swimming and other water sports or just sunbathing on Alpine lakes        on the beaches of Normandy and Brittany or at the famous resorts of        the Cte dAzur firstclass skiing in the Alps and Pyrnes canoeing        down spectacular gorges and marvelous hiking around the countrys        national parks and nature reserves Evidence that France is far from        being a country of hidebound highbrows is the fact that the Marne        Valley east of Paris was selected for Europes firstDisneyland        France is internationally acknowledged to be a leader in        high technology and is happy to share its pride in these advances With        its flagship Gode entertainment center the Cit des Sciences et de        lIndustrie in La Villette on the outskirts of Paris attracts science        buffs young and old La Cit de lEspace in Toulouse is dominated by a        replica of the Ariane rocket Even if you dont get on one of the        highspeed TGV trains you are almost certain to see one zoom past        The people are as varied as their landscape but dont let        anyone tell you the French national clich is a myth The rednosed        mustachioed fellow with a beret on his head a crumpled cigarette        drooping from his lip and a long baguette or two under his arm        certainly does exist and can be seen in all regions of the country But        theres all the difference in the world between the prudent        closemouthed Norman and the vociferous easygoing Provenal between        the pious Breton and the pagan sophisticate of Paris        For a people so fiercely proud of their identity the        French are a rich mixture In Picardy the Flemish influence is        unmistakable and although Alsace may celebrate Bastille Day at least        as proudly as any other French province its cuisine wines and        dialect all reveal a profoundly Germanic influence The Cte dAzur and        Corsica both have a distinctly Italian flavor and the people on the        northern slopes of the Pyrnes are not so very different from their        Spanish cousins to the south        France has always been a haven for foreign artists Not by        accident did Van Gogh come from the Netherlands Picasso from Spain        Max Ernst from Germany and Chagall from Russia to make their home in        France One of Frances greatest poets of the th century Wilhelm        Kostrowitsky better known as Guillaume Apollinaire was born in Rome        of a Polish mother and an Italian father Irishman Samuel Beckett        happily wrote plays in French And Kenzo Lagerfeld and Cerruti design        in the international but inexorably Parisbased language of haute        couture        Despite occasional tensions perhaps inevitable in times of        economic uncertainty today French people increasingly recognize that        the immigrants from Frances dpartements in the West Indies and from        former colonies  Algeria Tunisia and Morocco  enrich the national        culture and add spice to the countrys cuisine And as the European        Union matures Europeans are taking advantage of opportunities to live        and work in different countries British families are buying second         or first  homes in France French young people are choosing to settle        in London or Dublin for a time It all makes for a wonderful and        exciting mix adding to that greatest of French assets  a vibrant and        varied street scene        For the firsttime visitor France will seem at once        delightfully different and comfortably familiar a country of exciting        and infinitely attractive contrasts
