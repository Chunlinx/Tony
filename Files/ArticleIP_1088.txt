                                 Lying Lawyers            President Clintons lawyerBob Bennett last week heatedly declared that the allegations concerning thepresident and Paula Jones Monica Lewinsky Kathleen Willey and others werescurrilous products of Clinton haters Jones in particular has no case She was never harassed            It ispossible that Bennett actually believes his clients story on all thesematters But suppose like almost everyone else he believes Clinton islying to some degree Is a lawyer free to tell with as much passion as hecares to muster something he believes to be a lie            Lewinskys lawyer William Ginsburg has made aproffer  In exchange for immunity from prosecution his client willtestify under oath that she and President Clinton had sex So far SpecialProsecutor Kenneth Starr has not accepted the proffer Without a deal isGinsburg free to revert to Lewinskys earlier sworn testimony that she andClinton did not have sex Having offered to tell one version of eventsmay a lawyer really choose to tell a contradictory versionas if the offer hadnever existed            Officially the American Bar Associations model code of professionalresponsibility forbids a lawyer to knowingly make a false statement of law orfact The code forbids lawyers from making any statement true orfalse outside the courtroom that has a substantial likelihood of materiallyprejudicing a trial In practice however these restrictions meltaway             Alawyer may not knowingly lie but he or she isunder no obligation to know the truth or to draw logical inferences from whathe or she does know Since the lawyer was rarely at the scene of the crime shecan plausibly maintain that she doesnt know for sure what happenedand istherefore free to argue whatever version of events best suits herclient  Indeed in the absence of that very rare absolute certainty theethical obligation of zealous advocacy virtually requires a lawyer toargue his clients version of eventshowever implausible To guard againstcertainty some lawyers take the precaution of not asking their clients to sayexactly what happenedor even of asking them not to say what happened            Lyingreally only arises as an issue in the absurd warhorse of law school ethicsexams a client who simultaneously confesses to a crime and insists ontestifying that he is innocent The ethical issue even here is not whetherthe lawyer is allowed to participate in the clients lie butwhether he is actually required to do so The answer is not quite If alawyer knows with ontological certitude that a client is planning to lie on thestand she is not allowed to report this to the court She is allowed to quitthe case Orto avoid being guilty of suborning perjuryshe may put herclient on the stand and let him testify without asking him specific questionsbeyond Tell your story            If a lawyer finds that his client has perpetrated a fraudon the tribunalie told a lie in courtthe rules say the lawyer shouldinform the court unless the information was told to him in confidence orsecret But of course just about everything that a client ever tells a lawyeris a secret or a confidence  Similarly there appear to be specific andsevere rules forbidding extrajudicial remarks such as lawyers statements tothe press about a pending case But the reality is better characterized by theconduct of Bennett and Ginsburg It is almost unheard of for anyone to get intotrouble for giving interviews when a case is pretrial The rule requires asubstantial chance of material impact on the case both of which are nearlyimpossible to prove            Just tomake sure they are not violating the rules against lying lawyers can choosetheir words carefully  Bennett clearly intended to communicate that hisposition is the same as his clients The Jones Lewinsky and Willey storiesare all false But his words can be interpretedif necessaryto meansomething else For example he could be saying that Jones was not harassedbecause her description of Clintons behavior even if true doesnt fit thetechnical definition of harassment To say that allegations are scurrilous isnot necessarily to say that they are false And so on            In a proffer session a witness defendant orpotential defendant provides the prosecution with a preview of theevidence he or she could provide or the testimony they would give Theprosecution is invited to buy this information with leniency            Proffersare increasingly common in the criminal justice system especially since theenactment of federal sentencing guidelines in  which substantiallyrestricted a judges discretion in sentencing One of the few remaining ways toobtain a coveted downward departurea sentence below the official rangeisthrough cooperation with the government  In Lewinskys case lawyerGinsburg rather than turning states evidence after indictment is asking forimmunitya guarantee that his client will never face charges at allUnfortunately this leaves Ginsburg trying to explain that if granted immunityLewinsky will testify one way and if indicted shell stand by her depositionThis does not do well for Lewinskys credibility            Normally these discussions are kept secret Not becausediscussing them in public might violate the rules but because making profferspublic seldom makes tactical                sense  In discussing Lewinskysproffer Ginsburg suggests that Lewinsky either has already lied or will do soin the future for the right deal This doesnt look good            But these contradictionscannot be used against Lewinsky at trial The federal rules of criminalprocedure prohibit the government from using any statements made in furtheranceof a plea bargain and Lewinskys attempt to gain immunity is essentially aform of plea bargaining Additionally most proffer sessions involve what isknown as a queen for a day agreement under which both sides agree thatinformation discussed at such a session will not be admissible against thedefendant at a trial These protections enacted to encourage truth beforetrial have the paradoxical effect  when publicized of making Lewinskyappear crazy mendacious guilty or some combination thereof
