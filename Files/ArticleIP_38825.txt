                                  Elephants in Pinstripes             The kids page on George W Bushs campaign Web siteexplains that Running for president is a lot like playing baseball  Thereare two divisions in professional baseballthe American League and theNational League In politics there are two large parties the Republicans andthe Democrats The Ames Iowa straw poll the site advises is likebaseballs regular season the primaries are the playoffs and the generalelection is the World Series The Federal Election Commission apparently isthe umpire The implicit message of all this seems to be that because Dubyawas president of baseballs Texas Rangers he certainly can be president of theUnited States            If politics is like baseball baseball can be a lotlike politics This weeks World Series for example is a political contestThe Bronx Bombers are well the Yankeesthe original Republicans This beginsat the top with owner George Steinbrenner who is the very model of theRepublican businessman Steinbrenner recoils at the socialistic demands of thepoorer smallmarket teams of Major League Baseball that want rich teams suchas the Yankees to give them a cut of their revenue Steinbrenner loathes thisredistribution of wealth He considers it a welfare program that rewards badteams for not trying and robs successful teams of their hardearned richesLike all good Republicans Steinbrenners Yanks buck regulation When otherowners tried to stop Steinbrenner from signing a separate endorsement deal withAdidas arguing it would undercut the entire leagues endorsement plan he toldthem to get lost It is no accident that the Yanks wear pinstripes Thebusiness of the Yankees is business Steinbrenners Republicanism runs deepHe funneled illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon in the early swinning himself a twoyear suspension from baseball in the process            Steinbrenner may be arighty detesting all who might intervene in his business but hes happy tobat lefty when it comes to government aid He has eagerly petitioned New YorkCity to spend  million or more to build him a new stadium            The Braves by contrast are Dixiecrats The Yankees mostfamous fan is New York Citys Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani Atlantas No fan is leftwing icon Jane Fonda owner Ted Turners wife Steinbrennerscharitable contributions go to orchestras Turner is giving  billion to theUnited Nations The Braves Web site devotes almost as much space to the teamscommunity service projectsStraight A Program the Atlanta BravesFoundation Opportunity Through Baseball Neighborhood Revitalization ProgramWeekend of Caring etcas it does to triumphs on the diamond Steinbrennerspent the last years of the Cold War bidding on Navy contracts for his nowdefunct shipyard Turner spent those years organizing the Goodwill Games hissquishy plea for SovietAmerican friendship            The Braves are democraticin their recruiting efforts They reintroduced the open tryout to baseballan audition where any schlub has a chance to make the squad They endorse anopendoor immigration policy The Braves have eight foreign players on theirroster compared to the Yankees five The Braves foreign players hail fromthe Dominican Republic and Venezuela The Republican Yankees by contrast haveCuban refugee Orlando El Duque Hernandez the anticommunist antiCastropitcher and Hideki Irabu who comes from wealthy capitalist Japan            The GOP Yankees like all good Republicans favor anextremely strong defense They are among the best fielding teams in the majorsThe Braves who represent former Sen Sam Nunns state are equally strong ondefense            The teams mimic theirparties greed The Yankees like the GOP brazenly take enormouscontributions wherever they can be found fans cable TV operators Adidasetc The Yankees pull in close to  million a year more than any teamand own baseballs highest payroll  million in  Like the GOP theyexhibit no shyness about raising and spending record amounts of cash to ensurevictory Like the Democrats the Braves are as rapacious as their rivals butsubtler The Braves collect tens of millions from their nationally broadcastgames and strong ticket sales and they pay lavishly for players They raiseand spend more than all but a handful of teams As the Democratic Party claimsto speak for the little guy while dunning Fortune  companies so the Braveshold themselves out as a modest smallmarket underdog            The Braves and Yankees resemble the Democrats andRepublicans in one more important way In this World Series as in mostAmerican elections too little separates the contestants Elections matchcorporatized moneyed and ideologically similar parties The World Seriesmatches corporatized moneyed and athletically similar teams Both the Yankeesand the Braves play highly competent professional baseball They rely oncareful teamwork and roleplaying eschewing superstars and flash They areimpossible to dislike Here again the Yankees mirror the Republican PartyYankeehaters used to despise Bombers such as Babe Ruth Mickey Mantle andReggie Jackson just as the American left abominated hardcore conservativessuch as Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan Gradually that conservatism hasbeen accepted and embraced by America So too have the Yankees who are nolonger the villains of the Bronx Todays Yankees have assuaged theYankeephobes with their skill and modesty            This similarity of style and talent between theYankees and the Braves flattens the World Series as it flattens politics Theregular season and playoffs have eliminated more quixotic teams The DonaldTrumplike Baltimore Orioles willing to spend endless millions to prove theirincompetence the Alan Keyesian Chicago Cubs hopeless but mesmerizing theReform Partyesque Boston Red Sox erratic crazy but with just enoughbrilliance to be dangerous We are left with the wealthy talented mainstreamlikable achievers George W Yankee and Albert Brave
