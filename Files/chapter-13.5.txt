Afghanistan probably dropping out either                because he changed his mind or because his family intervened            In December  while still in high school in Saudi Arabia Hamlan became involved                with a group that gathered periodically to watch jihad propaganda tapes and was                encouraged by a mentor named Bandar Marui to pursue jihad especially as practiced                in the BosniaHerzegovina and RussianAfghan wars and a book titled Gladiator of                Passion As instructed Hamlan acquired a passport on February   and agreed                to go to Afghanistan after the hajj in midMarch  He and two travel companions                obtained Pakistani visas in Sharjah UAE and traveled to Islamabad where al Qaeda                facilitator Hassan Ghul took them to a guesthouse managed by Abu Zubaydah Days                later two men helped Hamlan cross the Pakistan Afghanistan border            At the Khaldan camp Hamlan received military training courses Upon hearing that the                camp was to be closed he and others traveled to al Faruq camp near Kandahar where                they received more training He also met and proclaimed allegiance to Bin Ladin at                this time Injured during a further training session Hamlan was assigned to guard                the airport where he met future hijacker Ahmed al Nami whose recent laser eye                surgery had interrupted his training An individual named Abu Basir al Yemeni                indoctrinated the two in Bin Ladins antiUS position and extolled the virtues of                martyrdom Hamlan and Nami eventually agreed to approach Abu Hafs al Mauritani about                participating in a suicide operation The day after visiting Abu Hafs Hamlan and                Nami heard from Abu Basir that Bin Ladin was planning an attack against the United                States After taking their passports Abu Basir arranged for Hamlan and Nami to meet                Bin Ladin and instructed them to use the following phrase to express their desire to                become martyrsI want to be one of this religions bricks and glorify this                religion The al Qaeda leader accepted both applicants In October  Abu Basir                took Hamlan and Nami to Kandahar to meet KSM who impressed on them the high                expectations for martyrs and instructed them on using coded telephone numbers He                returned their passports which had been altered and now contained forged tourism                stamps for Singapore Malaysia Turkey and Egypt KSM told them to meet with Atef                before returning to Saudi Arabia where they should contact hijacker future                 hijacker Waleed al

made for them to fly to Qatar From Qatar they                traveled onward to the UAE and then to Mecca Nami contacted KSM and received coded                instructions to go to Jeddah call Waleed al Shehri and obtain visas at the US                consulate In Jeddah they briefly shared an apartment with Shehri who provided                them with directions to the consulate and showed them how to fill out the visa                application After acquiring visas Hamlan and Nami presented their passports to                Shehri for inspection and returned to Mecca Nami called KSM who told them to                return to Afghanistan the next day Despite instructions to the contrary Hamlan                insisted on calling his family before leaving Saudi Arabia because he had begun to                have second thoughts after acquiring the visa Told by his brother that their mother                had fallen ill Hamlan decided not to return to Afghanistan even after Nami reminded                him of his allegiance to Bin Ladin and commitment to complete the suicide mission                In Riyadh he told his brothers that he had been on jihad in Chechnya Fearing that                they might ask for his passport he removed the US visaas later confirmed by                forensic analysis performed by Saudi authorities Hamlan returned to college and                resumed living with his parents who confiscated his passport Thereafter Hamlan                received a visit at the college from a former associate at al Faruq camp Khalid al

in July  Spanish investigators contend that members of the                Spanish al Qaeda cell were involved in the July meeting and were connected to the                 attacks In an indictment of the Spanish cell members dated September                  the Spanish government relies on three main points First is a  trip to the                United States by Ghasoub al Abrash Ghalyoun a Syrian living in Spain During the                trip Ghalyoun videotaped a number of US landmarks including the World Trade                Center The Spanish indictment alleges that an al Qaeda courier was in Ghalyouns                town in Spain shortly after the trip and that the courier probably delivered the                tape to al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan Second the Spanish government contends                that during the relevant time period an individual named Muhammed Belfatmi was near                the town where the AttaBinalshibh meeting took place and that Belfatmi traveled to                Karachi shortly before September  on the same flight as Said Bahaji one of Attas                Hamburg associates and even stayed at the same hotel Finally Spanish authorities                rely on an intercepted telephone conversation between cell leader Imad Eddin Barakat                Yarkas and an individual named Shakur in August  in which Shakur describes                himself as entering the field of aviation and slitting the throat of the                birdShakur has been identified by Spanish authorities as Farid Hilali Although                we cannot rule out the possibility that other facts will come to light as the                Spanish case progresses to trial we have not found evidence that individuals in                Spain

Khallad Jan   CIA cable source debriefing Jan                  The FBI agent informed us that he was unaware how such internal CIA communications                worked or that the operational cables even existed and so did not know to ask for                them Such messages are routinely not shared in order to protect intelligence                sources and methods In this case application of the routine procedure did not                serve that purpose because the FBI agent was aware of the sources identity as well                as the methods used to obtain the information Moreover the FBI agent also may have                been absent from the room when the identification was made The source had brought a                sheaf of documents with him that the FBI agent left the room to copy while the                interview of the witness continued Because of the circumstances of the interview                site the agent would have been absent for a significant period of time In                addition the case officer was frequently given photographs from a broad range of                CIA stations to show to this particular witness He did not focus on the purpose

Jane did not seek OIPRs permission to share this information at the meeting                Jane also apparently did not realize that one of the agents in attendance was a                designated intelligence agent so she could have shared all of the information with                that agent regardless of the caveats No one who was at the meeting suggested that                option however DOJ Inspector General interview of Steve B Sept   DOJ                Inspector General interview of Jane July   These caveats were different                from the legal limits we discussed in section  The Attorney Generals July                 procedures concerned FISA information developed in an FBI intelligence                investigation This however was NSA information These particular caveats were the                result of the Justice Departments and NSAs overabundance of caution in December                 During the millennium crisis Attorney General Reno authorized electronic                surveillance of three US persons overseas Because the searches were not within                the United States no FISA warrant was needed Reno approved the surveillances                pursuant to section  of Executive Order  with the proviso that the results                of these particular surveillances not be shared with criminal investigators or                prosecutors without the approval of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review                Because of the complexity of determining whether particular reporting was the fruit                of particular surveillances NSA decided to place these caveats on all its Bin                Ladinrelated reporting not just reporting on the surveillances authorized by Reno                As a result these caveats were placed on the reports relating to Mihdhar even                though they were not covered by Renos December  order See DOJ memo Reno to                Freeh FISA surveillance of a

RequestAug                             The analysts email however reflects that she was confusing a broad array of                caveats and legal barriers to information sharing and rules governing criminal                agents use of information gathered through intelligence channels There was no                broad prohibition against sharing information gathered through intelligence channels                with criminal agents This type of sharing occurred on a regular basis in the field                The courts procedures did not apply to all intelligence gathered regardless of                collection method or source Moreover once information was properly shared the                criminal agent could use it for further investigation             FBI email Jane to Steve NSLU Response Aug   Jane says she only                asked whether there was sufficient probable cause to open the matter as a criminal                case and whether the criminal agent could attend any interview if Mihdhar was found                She said the answer she received to both questions was no She did not ask whether                the underlying information could have been shared Jane interview  July                  The NSLU attorney denies advising that the agent could not participate in an                interview and notes that she would not have given such inaccurate advice The                attorney told investigators that the NSA caveats would not have precluded criminal                agents from joining in any search for Mihdhar or from participating in any                interview Moreover she said that she could have gone to the NSA and obtained a                waiver of any such caveat because there was no FISA information involved in this                case There are no records of the conversation between Jane and the attorney                Jane did not copy the attorney on her email to the agent so the attorney did not                have an opportunity to confirm or reject the advice Jane was giving to the agent                DOJ Inspector General interview of Sherry S Nov   Jane asked the New                York agent assigned to the Mihdhar search to sign a FISA acknowledgment form                indicating the agent understood how he had to treat FISA information Because no                FISA information was involved she should not have required him to sign such a form                To the extent she believed incorrectly that the Attorney Generals  procedures                applied to this situation there was in fact an exception in place for New York DOJ                Inspector General interview of Sherry S Nov   More fundamentallyJane                apparently understood the welter of restrictions to mean in workday shorthand that                any information gathered by intelligence agencies should not be shared with criminal                agents This was incorrect DOJ Inspector General interviews of Jane July                  Nov               FBI emails between Steve B and Jane re NSLU Response Aug   While the                agent expressed his frustration with the situation to Jane he made no effort to                press the matter further by discussing his concerns with either his supervisor or                the chief division counsel in New York             Attorney General Ashcroft testified to us that this and similar                informationsharing issues arose from Attorney General Renos  guidelines                discussed in chapter  and specifically from a March  memorandum of then Deputy                Attorney General Jamie Gorelick John Ashcroft testimony Apr   DOJ memo                Gorelick to White Instructions on Separation of Certain Foreign                Counterintelligence and Criminal Investigations Mar              We believe the Attorney Generals testimony does not fairly or accurately reflect the                significance of the  documents and their relevance to the  discussions                Whatever the merits of the March  Gorelick memorandum and the subsequent July                 Attorney General procedures on information sharing they did not apply to the                information the analyst decided she could not share with the criminal agent As                discussed earlier the reason Jane decided she could not share information was                because the initial information on Mihdhar had been analyzed by the NSA This reason                was unrelated to either of the  documents The Gorelick memorandum applied to                two particular criminal cases neither of which was involved in the summer                 informationsharing discussions As the FBI agent observed in his email Part A of                the  procedures applied only to information obtained pursuant to a FISA warrant                None of the Mihdhar material was FISA information There was an exemption for the                Southern District of New York from Part B of the  procedures so they did not                apply Also the  procedures did not govern whether information could be shared                between intelligence and criminal agents within the FBI a separation that the                Bureau did not begin making formally until long after the procedures were in place                The  procedures governed only the sharing of information with criminal                prosecutors Even in that situation the restriction obliged running the information                through the OIPR screen What had happened as we discussed in chapter  was a                growing battle within the Justice Department during the s and between parts of                Justice and the FISA Court over the scope of OIPRs screening function and the                propriety of using FISAderived information in criminal matters The FISA Courts                concern with FBI sloppiness in its FISA applications also began to take a toll the                court began designating itself as the gatekeeper for the sharing of intelligence                information the FBI was required to separately designate criminal and intelligence                agents and the court banned one supervisory FBI agent from appearing before it By                late  these factors had culminated in a set of complex rules and a widening set                of beliefsa bureaucratic culturethat discouraged FBI agents from even seeking to                share intelligence information Neither Attorney General acted to resolve the                conflicting views within the Justice Department Nor did they challenge the strict                interpretation of the FISA statute set forth by the FISA Court and OIPR Indeed                this strict interpretation remained in effect until the USA PATRIOT Act was passed                after             Simply put there was no legal reason why the information the analyst possessed could                not have been shared with the criminal agent On August  Jane requested the                NSAs permission to share the information with the criminal agents but she intended                for the information only to help the criminal agents in their ongoing Cole                investigation She still did not believe they could be involved in the intelligence                investigation even if the NSA permitted the information to be shared DOJ IG                 Report July   p  The next day the NSA notified its representative at                FBI

the telephone                listing A search on the car registration would have unearthed a license check by                the South Hackensack Police Department that would have led to information placing                Hazmi in the area and placing Mihdhar at a local hotel for a week in early July                 The hijackers actively used the New Jersey bank accounts through ATM debit                card and cash transactions until September  Among other things they used their                debit cards to pay for hotel rooms and Hazmi used his card on August  to purchase                tickets on Flight  for himself and his brother and fellow hijacker Salem al                Hazmi These transactions could have helped locate them if the FBI had obtained the                bank records in time There would have been no easy means however to determine the                existence of these accounts and obtaining bank cooperation pre might have been                problematic

combined with a media campaign This alone might have delayed or                disrupted the plot even if the men had not been physically located before September                 But this would have

June   DOJ Inspector General                interview of Greg J July   FBI letterhead memorandum Zacarias Moussaoui                Aug               DOJ IG  Report July   p              Criminal search warrants must be approved by Department of Justice attorneys                before submission to the court Therefore approval from the Minneapolis US                Attorneys Office was required before a criminal search warrant could be obtained                DOJ Inspector General interview of Coleen Rowley July   Another agent                however said that he spoke to an Assistant US Attorney in the Minneapolis office                and received advice that the facts were almost sufficient to obtain a criminal                warrant DOJ Inspector General interview of Greg J July   The Assistant                United States Attorney said that if the FBI had asked for a criminal warrant that                first night he would have sought it He believed that there was sufficient probable                cause for a criminal warrant at that time DOJ Inspector General interview of                William K May   Mary Jo White the former US Attorney for the Southern                District of New York told us that based on her review of the evidence known                pre she would have approved a criminal search warrant Mary Jo White interview                May   Because the agents never presented the information to the                Minneapolis US Attorneys Office before  we cannot know for sure what its                judgment would have been or whether a judge would have signed the warrant In any                event the Minneapolis agents were concerned that if they tried to first obtain a                criminal warrant but the US Attorneys Office or the judge refused the FISA Court                might reject an application for a FISA warrant on the grounds that the agents were                attempting to make an end run around the criminal process Therefore it was judged                too risky to seek a criminal warrant unless it was certain that it would be                approved DOJ Inspector General interview of Greg J July   In addition FBI                headquarters specifically instructed Minneapolis that it could not open a criminal                investigation DOJ IG  Report July   p  Finally the Minneapolis                Field Office mistakenly believed that the  Attorney General procedures required                OIPRs approval before it could contact the US Attorneys Office about obtaining a                criminal warrant             The FISA definition of foreign power includes a group engaged in international                terrorism or activities in preparation therefor

manuals containing prescripted announcements                corresponding to a number of specified emergencies Once the FDNY arrived on the                scene however all decisions relating to evacuation or other emergency procedures                were left to its discretion             When a notable event occurred it was standard procedure for the onduty deputy                fire safety director to make an advisory announcement to tenants who were affected                by or might be aware of the incident in order to acknowledge the incident and to                direct tenants to stand by for further instructions The purpose of advisory                announcements as opposed to emergency announcements such as to evacuate was to                reduce panic PANYNJ interview

consider in determining whether and to what extent stairwell A was                actually a viable exit Knowing that the stairway was initially passable from at                least the st floor down we can conclude that it was likely open from top to                bottom on floors farther removed from the impact However in areas near the impact                zone some doors leading to the stairwell may have jammed We know that access to                stairway A was possible from at least the st and th floors and from several                other floors between the th and st floor It is likely that access was possible                from floors higher up as well It is not known however whether  callers had a                clear path to the stairwell entrance from their locations Damage caused by the                impact of the plane and the resulting smoke and heat may have prevented some from                being able to reach the entrance to the staircase but the stated locations of at                least some callers indicate that they were near stairwell A on their floor Based on                conditions described by civilians who descended stairwell A from at or above the                impact zone we conclude that stairwell A may have become effectively impassable as                the morning progressed             Commission analysis of PAPD calls

          propertyenvironment conservation Within ICS incident command is organized into                five major components the command function the planning section the operations                section the logistics section and the financeadministration section When                multiple agencies or jurisdictions are involved in a response ICS provides for and                can evolve

killed below the impact zone either by falling debris by the fireballs that                exploded into the lobby or by being trapped in an elevator Individuals below the                impact zone may have been killed for the same reasons Individuals may also have                been killed while in the process of evacuating             Ironically had the towers remained up longer scores more first responders                would have died Twentysix additional FDNY companiesmore than                 firefighterswere en route at the time of the South Towers collapse and scores                more PAPD officers on Church and Vesey were preparing to enter the towers             The advisory announcement directed by protocol without the expanded                instruction for occupants to return to their floors would have given greater leeway                to those who judged based on a firsthand awareness of conditions on their floors                eg some could feel heat from North Tower explosion that evacuation was                warranted In retrospect occupants would only have had to reach a point below the                th floor to be safe             Appended to the directive was a list of different types of emergencies with                designated Incident Commanders Terrorist incidents were subdivided according to the                types of attack Conventional weapons and bomb threats were assigned to the NYPD                while chemical biological and nuclear attacks designated NYPD or FDNY as the                Incident Commander The directive notedThe handling of a threat of a chemical or                biological release or the use of conventional weapons falls to the NYPD Dealing                with the consequences of the explosion or release is the responsibility of the FDNY                The investigation that follows once the consequences of the event have been                mitigated is the responsibility of the NYPD Any conflicts regarding the issue of                Command at these incidents will be resolved by OEM New York City memo Office of                the MayorDirection and Control of Emergencies in

South Tower but instead                responded to the North Tower where he was instrumental in saving many lives after                the South Tower collapsed Some FDNY units dispatched to the South Towerwhere they                would have perishedinstead were mistakenly sent to the North Tower and in many                cases survived             For the FDNY addressing these issues see

have had an impact on the total                fatalities was the alleged failure of ESU officers descending past at least two                firefighters after  in the North Tower to share their evacuation instructions                It should be noted however that at least one firefighter has conceded that he                too descended past other stationary firefighters without telling them to evacuate                In addition according to one of the ESU officers and one of the firefighters in the                North Tower at least some FDNY personnel were unwilling to take evacuation orders                from police that morning             Based on more than  interviews we conducted and our review of  internal                FDNY interview transcripts we conclude that out of these  companies all onduty                members of  companies are likely to have known to evacuate Engine Companies                           and  Ladder Companies       and                Rescue  We also conclude that at least some members of each of five companies                knew to evacuate two firefighters from Ladder Company  the officer of Ladder                Company  all but the officer of Engine Company  at least two firefighters from                Squad  and at least three firefighters from Engine  We do not know whether                members of the eight other companies knew to evacuate Engine Companies   and                 Rescue   and  Hazmat  and Squad  because they all died and we have                come across no onpoint eyewitness accounts related to their operations It is very                possible that at least some of these firefighters did hear the evacuation order but                nevertheless failed to evacuate in the only minute period between the collapse of                the two towers In addition it is possible that several of the eight companies for                which we have no record of their receiving evacuation instructions were in the South                Tower and thus died in its earlier collapse             Eric Lipton A New Weapon for Firefighters New York Times May   p                  Wartime             All times are Eastern Daylight Time Sometime around  after the decision had                already been made not to return to Washington a reported threat to Angelthe code                word for Air Force Onewas widely disseminated in the Presidential Emergency                Operations Center PEOC and aboard Air Force One Notes from the morning indicate                that Vice President Cheney informed President Bush in a phone conversation shortly                after  that an anonymous threat had been phoned into the White House that was                viewed as credible At about the same time news of the threat was conveyed on the                air threat conference call The Secret Services Intelligence Division tracked down                the origin of this threat and during the day determined that it had originated in                a misunderstanding by a watch officer in the White House Situation Room The                director of the White House Situation Room that day disputes this account But the                Intelligence Division had the primary job of running down the story and we found                their witnesses on this point to be credible During the afternoon of September                 the leadership of the Secret Service was satisfied that the reported threat to                Angel was unfounded            At the White House press

Cheney and Karen Hughes before the briefing and they had decided to let                people know about the threat all of them believing it was true According to                Fleischer only weeks later did he learnfrom press reportsthat the threat was                unfounded We have not found any evidence that contradicts his account Ari                Fleischer interview Apr   Chuck Green

Inspector General investigated the issuance of these press releases and concluded                that the agency did not have enough data about the range of possible pollutants                other than asbestos to make a judgment lacked public health benchmarks for                appropriate levels of asbestos and other pollutants and had imprecise methods for                sampling asbestos in the air it also noted that more than  percent of the bulk                dust samples collected before September  showed the presence of asbestos above the                agencys  percent benchmark

improperly influenced the content of the press                releases so that they would intentionally mislead the public The EPA press releases                were coordinated with Samuel Thernstrom

were not coordinated through the                White House Although the White House review process resulted in some editorial                changes to the press releases these changes were

documentary evidence supports this claim Although Whitman told us she spoke                with White House senior economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey regarding the need to get                the financial markets open quickly she denied he pressured her to declare the air                was safe due to economic expediency We found no evidence of pressure on EPA to say                the air was safe in order to permit the markets to reopen Moreover the most                controversial release that specifically declared the air safe to breathe was                released after the markets had already reopened The EPA did not have the                healthbased benchmarks needed to assess the extraordinary air quality conditions in                Lower Manhattan after  The EPA and the White House therefore improvised and                applied standards developed for other circumstances in order to make pronouncements                regarding air safety advising workers at Ground Zero to use protective gear and                advising the general population that the air was safe Whether those improvisations                were appropriate is still a subject for medical

matched to their faces                and their names run through FBI case records to see whether they had surfaced                before Rolince and Watson briefed Robert Mueller the director of the FBI about                the issue and how they were handling it The State Department played a role as well                in flights involving government officials or members of the royal family State                coordinated with the FBI and FAA to allow screening by the FBI of flights with Saudi                nationals on board There is no evidence that State tried to limit the screening

chief Having an opportunity to check the Saudis was useful to                the FBI This was because the US government did not and does not routinely run                checks on foreigners who are leaving the United States This procedure was                convenient to the FBI as the Saudis who wished to leave in this way would gather                and present themselves for record checks and interviews an opportunity that would                not be available if they simply left on regularly scheduled commercial flights             These flights were screened by law enforcement officials primarily the FBI For                example one flight the socalled Bin Ladin flight departed the United States on                September  with  passengers most of them relatives of Usama Bin Ladin                Screening of this flight was directed by an FBI agent in the Baltimore Field Office                who was also a pilot This agent coordinating with FBI headquarters sent an                electronic communication to each of the field offices through which the Bin Ladin                flight was scheduled to pass including the proposed flight manifest and directing                what screening should occur He also monitored the flight as it moved around the                countryfrom St Louis to Los Angeles to Orlando to Washington Dulles and to Boston                Logancorrecting for any changes in itinerary to make sure there was no lapse in FBI                screening at these locations Again each of the airports through which the Bin                Ladin flight passed was open and no special restrictions were lifted to accommodate                its passage James C interview June              The Bin Ladin flight and other flights we examined were

Two of the passengers on this flight had been the                subjects of preliminary investigations by the FBI but both their cases had been                closed in  and March  respectively because the FBI had uncovered no                derogatory information on either person linking them to terrorist activity Their                cases remained closed as of  were not reopened before

author expressed disappointment at the                limited options immediately available in Afghanistan and the lack of ground options                The author suggested instead hitting terrorists outside the Middle East in the                initial offensive perhaps deliberately selecting a nonal Qaeda target like Iraq                Since US attacks were expected in Afghanistan an American attack in South America                or Southeast Asia might be a surprise to the terrorists The memo may have been a                draft never sent to Rumsfeld or may be a draft of points being

least three of the hijackers Nawaf al                Hazmi Salem al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar were in information systems of the                intelligence community and thus potentially could have

the hijackers Satam al                Suqami and Abdul Aziz al Omari presented passports manipulated in a fraudulent                manner that has subsequently been associated with al Qaeda Based on our review of                their visa and travel histories we believe it possible that as many as eleven                additional hijackers Wail al Shehri Waleed al Shehri Mohand al Shehri Hani                Hanjour Majed Moqed Nawaf al Hazmi Hamza al Ghamdi Ahmed al Ghamdi Saeed al                Ghamdi Ahmed al Nami and Ahmad al Haznawi held passports containing these same                fraudulent features but their passports have not been found so we cannot be sure                Khalid al Mihdhar and Salem al Hazmi presented passports with a suspicious indicator                of Islamic extremism There is reason to believe that the passports of three other                hijackers Nawaf al Hazmi Ahmed al Nami and Ahmad al Haznawi issued in the same                Saudi passport office may have contained this same indicator however their                passports have not been found so we cannot be sure             Khallad Bin Attash Ramzi Binalshibh Zakariya Essabar

admissibility and withdrew his                application for admission after an immigration inspector remained unpersuaded that                he was a tourist All the hijackers whose visa applications we reviewed arguably                could have been denied visas because their applications were not filled out                completely Had State visa officials routinely had a practice of acquiring more                information in such cases they likely would have found more grounds for denial For                example three hijackers made statements on their visa applications that could have                been proved false by US government records Hani Hanjour Saeed al Ghamdi and                Khalid al Mihdhar and many lied about their employment or educational status Two                hijackers could have been denied admission at the port of entry based on violations                of immigration rules governing terms of admissionMohamed Atta overstayed his                tourist visa and then failed to present a proper vocational school visa when he                entered in January  Ziad Jarrah attended school in June  without properly

States between June  and August   There were possible grounds to deny                entry to a third hijacker Marwan al Shehhi One hijacker violated his immigration                status by failing to enroll as a student after entry Hani Hanjour two hijackers                overstayed their terms of admission by four and eight months respectively Satam al                Suqami and Nawaf al Hazmi

among the vulnerabilities exploited by terrorists possibly including                two of the  hijackers Three models exist for strengthened prescreening                 better screening by airlines such as the use of improved document authentication                technology  posting of border agents or inspectors in foreign airports to work                cooperatively with foreign counterparts and  establishing a full preinspection                regime such as now exists for travel to the United States from Canada and Ireland                All three models should be pursued in addition to electronic prescreening              Among the more important problems to address is that of varying transliterations                of the same name For example the current lack of a single convention for                transliterating Arabic names enabled the  hijackers to vary the spelling of their                names to defeat namebased watchlist systems and confuse any potential efforts to                locate them While the gradual introduction of biometric identifiers will help that                process will take years and a name match will always be useful The ICAO should                discuss the adoption of a standard requiring a digital code for all names that need                to be translated into the Roman alphabet ensuring one common spelling for all

the different                intelligence analysis centers in a letter sent by Secretary Ridge DCITenet FBI                Director Mueller andTTIC Director Brennan to Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin                on April   The letter did not mention any element of the Department of                Defense It stated that the DCI would define what analytical resources he would                transfer from the CTC to TTIC no later than June   DCI Tenet subsequently                told us that he decided that TTIC would have primary responsibility for terrorism                analysis but that the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency would grow their own                analysts TTIC will have tasking authority over terrorism analysts in other                intelligence agencies although there will need to be a board to supervise                deconfliction George Tenet interview July   We have not received any                details regarding this plan  TTIC has no operational authority However TTIC                has the authority to task collection and analysis from Intelligence Community                agencies the FBI and DHS through tasking mechanisms we will create The analytic                work conducted at TTIC creates products that inform each of TTICs partner elements                as well as other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate Letter from Ridge                and others to Collins and Levin Apr               Donald Rumsfeld prepared statement Mar   p              In this conception the NCTC should plan actions assigning responsibilities for                operational direction and execution to other agencies It would be built on TTIC and                would be supported by the intelligence community as TTIC is now Whichever route is                chosen the scarce analytical resources now dispersed amongTTIC the Defense                Intelligence Agencys Joint Interagency Task ForceCombatting Terrorism JITFCT                and the DCIs Counterterrorist Center CTC should be concentrated more effectively                than they are now              The DCIs Counterterrorist Center would become a CIA unit to handle the direction                and execution of tasks assigned to the CIA It could have detailees from other                agencies as it does now to perform this operational mission It would yield much                of the broader strategic analytic duties and personnel to the NCTC The CTC would                rely on the restructured CIA discussed in section  to organize train and                equip its personnel              Similarly the FBIs Counterterrorism Division would remain as now the operational                arm of the Bureau to combat terrorism As it does now it would work with other                agencies in carrying out these missions retaining the JTTF structure now in place                The Counterterrorism Division would rely on the FBIs Office of Intelligence to                train and equip its personnel helping to process and report the information                gathered in the field              The Defense Departments unified commandsSOCOM NORTHCOM and CENTCOMwould be the                joint operational centers taking on DOD tasks Much of the excellent analytical                talent that has been assembled in the Defense Intelligence Agencys JITFCT should                merge into the planned NCTC              The Department of Homeland Securitys Directorate for Information Analysis and                Infrastructure Protection should retain its core duties but the NCTC should have                the ultimate responsibility for producing net assessments that utilize Homeland                Securitys analysis of domestic vulnerabilities and integrate allsource analysis of                foreign intelligence about the terrorist enemy            The State Departments counterterrorism office would be a critical participant in the                NCTCs work taking the lead in directing the execution of the counterterrorism                foreign policy mission The proposed National Counterterrorism Center should offer                onestop shopping to agencies with counterterrorism and homeland security                responsibilities That is it should be an authoritative reference base on the                transnational terrorist organizations their people goals strategies                capabilities networks of contacts and support the context in which they operate                and their characteristic habits across the life cycle of operationsrecruitment                reconnaissance target selection logistics and travel For example this Center                would offer an integrated depiction of groups like al Qaeda or Hezbollah worldwide                overseas and in the United States The NCTC will not eliminate the need for the                executive departments to have their own analytic units But it would enable                agencybased analytic units to become smaller and more efficient In particular it                would make it possible for these agencybased analytic units to concentrate on                analysis that is tailored to their agencys specific responsibilities            A useful analogy is in military intelligence There the Defense Intelligence Agency                and the service production agencies like the Armys National Ground Intelligence                Center are the institutional memory and reference source for enemy order of battle                enemy organization and enemy equipment Yet the Joint Staff and all the theater                commands still have their own Js They draw on the information they need                tailoring and applying it to their operational needs As they learn more from their                tactical operations they pass intelligence of enduring value back up to the Defense                Intelligence Agency and the services so it can be evaluated form part of the                institutional memory and help guide future collection            In our proposal that reservoir of institutional memory about terrorist organizations                would function for the government as a whole and would be in the NCTC             The head of the NCTC would thus help coordinate the operational side of these                agencies like the FBIs Counterterrorism Division The intelligence side of these                agencies such as the FBIs Office of Intelligence would be overseen by the                National Intelligence Director we recommend later in this chapter             The quotation goes onIt includes gaps in intelligence but also intelligence                that like a string of pearls too precious to wear is too sensitive to give to                those who need it It includes the alarm that fails to work but also the alarm
