                                  The Phantom Menace            The B stealth bomber hadbarely touched down after its first ever combat mission last week when two ofits most loyal allies staged a press conference to claim vindication Standingbefore one of the sleek black aircraft on the tarmac at Missouris Whitman AirForce Base Democratic Reps Ike Skelton of Missouri and Norm Dicks ofWashington scorned skeptics who had doubted the  billion each airplaneWe have seen this type of criticism on every major weapons system saidDicks and when they go to war they work            Inside the same mediamoment footage of Serbian villagers frolicking beside the wreckage of a downedF stealth fighter punctured the technologys invincibilityand rekindledthe debate over US reliance on hightech weaponry In  at the dawn ofthe stealth era James Fallows warned in National Defense thatairplanes tanks ships and missiles have grown too complex expensive anddelicate to be useful in warfare or credible for deterrent purposes Fallowsargued in vain that the United States should instead spend its defense budgeton cheap and simple armaments and the military pumped around  billion intostealth programs alone Then a decade ago as the military redefined the Bsmission from an Hbomb taxi to a deliverer of conventional bombs a Republicansenator from Maine articulated the silliness of the concept Its theequivalent of saying were going to send a RollsRoyce down into a combat zoneto pick up groceries Today as secretary of defense William Cohen sends theB out on Balkans milk runs            Although the B stealth bomber manufactured by NorthropGrumman Corp and the F stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin arebased on different underlying technologies their names conceal alittleappreciated similarity Theyre both                bombers  The Fwas originally imagined as an invisible dogfighter but the Pentagon reframedthe planes mission when the geniuses at the aircraft skunkworks failed to pushthe technology far enough While not a fighter the  million F aint nosissy either It carries a pair of pound bombs into combat but itsslow and hard to maneuver The plane fleet only flies at night whichexplains why its painted black because it has no airtoair combatcapabilities If an enemy fighter spots and engages the F its toast Veryexpensive black toast            At least the stealthbomber begins to live up to its name Designed as a longrange weapon thatwould penetrate deep into the Soviet Union to wage nuclear war today itsubsists on a nonukes diet carrying  satelliteguided oneton bombs oreight pounders into battle Editorial writers love to note that ouncefor ounce the B is five times pricier than gold Its incredible cost stemsfrom endless development snafus and such mindbending design features as asurface smoothness measurable to  th of an inch The AirForce defends the cost by saying that one B with its heavy payload can dothe work of several conventional bombersrisking fewer pilots in a saferplane But even the hawks who considered the Bs sticker price a bargain whenthe game was nuclear deterrence grudgingly admit that nobody would ever buildsuch a device to drop conventional bombs on Serbian factories            With its subtle curves smooth surface and intimidatingbat wings the B is the cooler big brother of the two planes But the smallerFs boxy and angular look gives it a nerdy cachet The two designsrepresent different strategies for evading radar The B absorbs enemy radarwaves the Fs awkward geometry mostly scatters them            Neither design isflawless Its commonly assumed that stealth planes are invisible to radarTheyre nottheyre just very difficult to see And sometimes theyre not hardto see at all Stealth technology is vulnerable to older longwave radars andwellcoordinated radar systems Also the planes are exponentially easier tospot when they open their bombbay doors even during simple bank turns Forthose reasons the Pentagon has abandoned its original boasts that stealthplanes would be truly invisible            The previous watershed for stealth technologywas the  Gulf War in which the F pounded Baghdad with impunity andapparent precision The General Accounting Office however later downgraded byhalf the Pentagons claim that stealth fighters had scored an  percentmission success rate Naysayers continue to heap scorn on the two stealthbombers insisting that the weapons have yet to be truly battletested becausethe Serbs and the Iraqis who have faced the technology have put up no more thana token resistance            Even so the anecdotalsuccess of the Balkans adventure has refueled the hightech crusade Despitethe Bs piddling role over Serbia so fartwo missions involving a total offour planesthe Wall Street Journal s Paul Gigot thumbed his nose lastFriday at Democrats who had opposed the bomber cracking wise about B Billand suggesting the Pentagon could use  more of the machines The stealth warnews comes at a critical moment for the Pentagon which is pushing for theproduction of a newgeneration stealth fighter the F Raptor This onereally is a fighter The cost About  billion to build more than Fs at  million apiece Thats nowhere near five times the Fs weightin gold but still  times dearer than an F            The national love affair with stealthy weapons will endurefor several reasons Although decades old the technology is perenniallyfuturisticit was the Romulans of Star Trek  after all who firstinvented cloakingand it advances the ethos of American candoism Planesacquire an added allure whenever theyre developed in secret The militarydidnt even confirm the Fs existence until  after  were built andflying And then theres something perversely sexy about the vehiclesmaxtech black sheen something peepingtom kinky about the planes advertisedinvisibility something magical about striking without being struck back            Despite their technological limitations stealthweapons appeal to us because they indulge our fear of commitment And this iswhat ultimately makes them pose their own kind of stealthy threat to us Asweve seen stealth weapons blind the riskaverse public and policymakers tothe genuine perils of combat in the opening days of any military engagementturning war into an out of sight out of mind proposition They encourage theview that theres nothingfrom Iraqi germ weapons programs to Serbianatrocitiesthat a few invisible planes cant fix Enticing us into believingthat wars can be won with Futurama technology and without American bloodbeing shed the seductive charms of stealth weapons ultimately evaporate intonothingness We are left unfulfilled by their limitations and cheated by theircosts
