                 for NIST the National Institute of Standards and Technology   oh okay so its right up your alley then   i suppose so let me push the button   all right     okay um i guess im supposed to be all for switching to the metric system but uh i sense that its not gonna happen anytime soon   yeah i dont think its gonna happen either but i wish it were because im a i got my bachelors in mechanical engineering im at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric stuff   umhum youre now in what   acoustics   acoustics ah   yeah so everythings metric and then you go to read some old book or something and its all confusing so i dont understand as much so i think we should get one adopted permanently   well i guess that is the policy but its been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens uh i suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that thats happening having a new generation come up thats more used to it   yeah a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff just because they have to   they have to for international trade   yeah   but i guess guess its its easier to switch back and forth than it used to be uh because because because of of uh of computers coming into everything   umhum yeah i dont think switching back and forth is that big a deal i think people need to understand more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something just get used to using all the terms because someone says a kilogram no one knows what that is   everyone wants a wants a conversion of that before put a recognizing it as a as as as as a concept to hold in mind   yeah   um i i i dont see that it it it can change it very quickly i mean were not the kind of society that  that uh that something can be posed upon uh by government will   yeah no one seems to be adopting it the metric system no ones very uh no one wants it at all seems like   uh the the the the public is just very conservative that way in in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that   yeah   and and it and it it obviously makes no sense that were practically alone in the world in in using the old system   yeah i dont know its pretty tough when you get everything confused though i think two systems is worse than one though because i know we do a lot of problems and things and theyre half English and half metric and you you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems i think they should just get one even if its i prefer metric but even if its just English they should at least have one   well i mean unfortunately i think people like you are relatively rare rare who are coming up against this problem everyday   yeah   yeah i think so because your your average guy driving down the highway  wants to know how many miles it is to his destination   uh i mean there there are things you could do uh we have signs up on the NIST campus here speed limit twenty five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour   yeah   uh but that hasnt been adopted very widely   yeah they have some of those in Ohio theres this one signs kind of funny it says uh metric signs next hundred miles           but uh i mean and no one will will go a step further to remove the English signs   yeah thatd force everybody to use it or to quit selling tape measures in inches   uh you know or i mean you have highway signs saying speed limit um eighty eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number   yeah i guess a hundreds sixty two   hundred car is going sixty two yeah so it would be more like uh like ninety i guess car is going fifty five uh you suddenly have a  have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now     yeah you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety   do  do do you know where you are do the schools emphasize the metric system   yeah in the engineering they all do pretty much   no i i i meant i meant down like in the elementary schools   oh in the elementary schools i dont know i wouldnt think so i remember a ways back we did like conversions but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system   i mean i think yeah i mean i think my children learned the metric system but it doesnt get get emphasized over the other   yeah they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and thats about it
