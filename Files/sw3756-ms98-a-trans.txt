        okay have you painted something lately        yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom   yeah oh yeah another bedroom   yeah i showed you that one too didnt i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle   hm yeah yeah yeah oh yeah  oh heavens well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom but i get i have that trouble with the the ceiling you know the uh what is that blow the blow ceiling   yeah yeah oh yeah   you know where you get around the edge   well ive heard now i asked Janice somebody recently about how how you do that   uhhuh   oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that theyd have special rollers   uhhuh   that are real soft and furry that youd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful   well how do you get the edge though the the straight edge oh i see   we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant   uhhuh uhhuh   and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes   huh   but     well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too   well yeah i think im going to do it this spring actually   oh really   therere therere six houses see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials theres three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses   oh oh nice   yeah   so im thinking im gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think im gonna put something like a brown on it   uhhuh oh thatd be nice   on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something something where itll stand out a little   hm or two tone or two tone   what colord you paint what yeah   you know   theres some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house   uhhuh well the white but i have a problem i cant get up high and we cant paint the chimney   on the outside well you got to get one of those ladders   well we have one of those ladders were just not willing to get up that high   oh yeah well  a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood hes done his house and thats what he i was out there last weekend hes finished everything except the chimney   well we did too we did it in the fall  and its just its too high its really scary but   yeah   and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional   yeah yeah i know our house in New Mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it   yeah   and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff   uhhuh   so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with with his own rafter uh what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing   uhhuh the blowers oh oh oh oh i know what youre talking about um scaffolds thats it   yeah scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up   huh   and literally i wouldnt have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he knew that  so   its yeah oh my  so that was worth it getting a professional for that   yeah plus he cleaned up my mess   oh i think thats what we might have to do with the chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself     yeah   it wasnt too bad i mean you save   how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside   shoot maybe a hundred and fifty   yeah   you know since its a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know youre assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it   yeah that yeah that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to  oh Furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh my word   and anyway he when he checked out they only and and he was using his Furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something   umhum umhum oh my word   and he had he had the bill he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint   uhhuh uhhuh   so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something   uhhuh oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house   and he saw it i guess yeah it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff   oh my word oh my word well he really saved in that way  but yeah i think were gonna to do uh another bathroom   yeah uh   but uh i think ill probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little   yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore   oh i know but its that its the textured wall   well still a paintbrush   he can still
