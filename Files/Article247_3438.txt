                                 Lucent Should Stick With What It Knows                        For a company whose roots are in Bell Labs source of innumerabletechnological breakthroughs Lucent is surprisingly unembarrassed about buyingtechnology that it cant or doesnt want to build itself Since it was spunoff from ATT three years ago Lucent has made  acquisitions at a cost of billion including a major deal it closed today when it agreed to acquireExcel Switching Corp for  billion            While its now well known that at least half of all mergers failin thesense that they destroy rather than create shareholder valueits also becomewell known that certain companies are exceptionally good at integratingacquisitions into their existing operations Not coincidentally perhaps twoof the best are competitors namely Lucent and Cisco which reader beware Iown shares in Cisco in fact closed a small deal today spending million to acquire MaxComm Technologies which specializes in highspeed Netaccess And before the year is out expect Lucent and Cisco to announce moredeals Its a kind of acquisition arms race            For the most part the logic behind that race is compelling Lucent withits roots in more traditional telephone equipment is trying to move stronglyinto computer and data networks Cisco for its part wants to build on itsalready commanding position in data networking even as it shifts more and moreof its business to take advantage of the explosion in the Internet And withtechnology shifting and developing as rapidly as it is its difficult letssay impossible for any company to keep everything inhouse Instead smallercompanies create and develop technology and Cisco and Lucent step in buy upthese companies with their pricey stock and reap the benefits Needless tosay this strategy works only if youre good at bringing companies on boardwithout wrecking them or yourself Both Lucent and Cisco are            The danger in all this though is overreaching stretching a company beyondwhat its really good at Take last weeks  billion acquisition by Lucentof International Network Services a telecom consulting firm that helpscompanies design install and maintain computer and data networks The dealwas hailed by analysts and the press as a powerful move by Lucent intoservices offering the possibility that companies will now be able to come toLucent for onestop shopping Not only will we sell you the equipment Lucentcan now promise but well help you install it and keep it running Hell welleven tell you why you should buy it in the first place            That last point signals one of the obvious problems with the deal which isthat INSs business depends on the fact that companies trust it to give themthe best advice possible If every time a company asks an INS consultant whatkind of system it should install the consultant says Why Lucent ofcourse companies arent going to be trusting INS much longer            But even aside from that this was a dubious acquisition because in essenceLucent paid  billion to buy a business whose profit margins and earningsgrowth are significantly lower than Lucents This may seem counterintuitivegiven that all you hear about lately is how important it is that IBM is movinginto servicesie its ebusiness initiativeor that HewlettPackard isrevitalizing itself as a services company But the truth is that its better tomake hardware or software than to be in services Consulting is a finebusiness on its own terms But next to making switches or routerslet aloneWindows its mediocre at best            The reason is obvious Services require people and always will When youremaking hardware or even better licensing software all your costs are underyour control and once the product is actually developed your profit marginsare very high And production lines can be automated Consulting though is bydefinition a laborintensive timeintensive business Profit margins are muchlower INSs net marginsprofit divided by revenueare around  percentwhile Ciscos are at  percent This is inherent in the nature of thebusinessLucent wont be able to change it            Its understandable what with the new vogue for onestop shopping thatLucent would want to offer services in addition to equipment But in acquiringINS Lucent appears to be forgetting one of the most important lessons of thepast two decades Companies do best when they do only what they do best
