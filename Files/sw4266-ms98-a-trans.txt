        Jonathan um       it seems to me that most people rather make a decision between going all out particularly males go all out on the career or they go or they spend some real quality time with their kids when their when their kids are still young and and are willing to spend time with the parents what do you think about that   umhum uh yeah thats an interesting point i work in uh the computer business which tends to be pretty high pressure and time consuming and i work with a lot of guys who are just now having first and second kids and its interesting to see how they handle it because in a lot of cases theyre still trying to put in the hours but theyre also trying to spend a lot of time at home and in many cases theyve got spouses who work so its its an interesting juggling pattern i my impression is that people try to uh to do both if they can as tough as that is   do you think its possible   uh boy thats a good question ive my kids are eight and a half and six now and ive been working in this business you know while they were growing up and you know its  its tough uh there have been plenty of times where ive had to work long hours so that you know during a particular week i might not see them as much as i wanted to   umhum   but i i do sense that peoples expectations today are often different than they were maybe in my parents generation where you know child raising was kind of seen as the the womans responsibility and if the man had to work extra long hours or travel you know thats just the way it was i think today men have somewhat different expectations when they try to tailor their schedules as much as they can   i got uh my office mate um he he got divorced and and uh he was talking about that the thing that he was gladdest about in in the relationship that he was in before that uh he spent like a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out um ice skating and water skiing and and i mean just if there was something that that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it   uhhuh   and now now that hes hes no longer the the wife has custody of the kids he still has a good relationship with the kids   uhhuh   which you know a lot of people even in marriages that stay together try to all of the sudden get to know their kids when they turn eighteen or something like that   sure   but but i think i think he did the right thing is is making sure that the kids really i mean they might get mad as heck at at at the parents but making sure that the kids know from you know one two three that that theres no one that loves them as much as uh as dad and mom you know   yeah i think theres a lot to that you you really have to establish the relationship early on yeah certainly read a lot or heard a lot of stories about people who grow up saying i felt i never really knew my father   yeah   and i you know its its hard to say i dont travel in a wide social circle but its my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are are trying to change anyway   i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad now and and its really its really way too late i i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to to try let his sons know that that he loves them and its   um   i mean to some extent its too late my dad im sorry go ahead   yeah yeah i was just saying yeah   yeah my dad um i always knew that my dad loved me he but he never really said it until uh   um   oh i dont know i think i was in college the first time i actually heard him say it but uh i always knew it i mean he always he always did things so that i knew it but i think i i mean granted its easy to say i dont have kids but uh i i i think thats one of the things i really want to make sure that i do a lot is is say it       as many times as as just so that they get oh you know come on dad stop that but you know i mean you know i dont know     yeah actually ive heard a lot of that from uh my son who you know goes through periods were hes particularly attached to mom and when i say i love you you know he says i hate you       and things like that not just kidding around not really meaning it but you know not as comfortable with uh an overt display of affection from me anyway   uhhuh um what kind of stuff do you do with them   uh try to uh plan outings to museum say take them to playgrounds you know baseball in the back yard that kind of thing a lot of times following his lead hes currently obsessed with Legos i mean he he
