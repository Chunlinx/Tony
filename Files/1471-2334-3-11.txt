                    Background        Communityacquired pneumonia CAP is the th leading        cause of death in the USA and the leading cause of death        from an infectious disease     Approximately  million        adults are diagnosed annually and mortality averages  in        hospitalized cases    From the standpoint of cost and        quality of care a key decision in management is whether to        treat patients as outpatients or as inpatients There is        general agreement that a substantial number of inpatients        admitted on the basis of conventional criteria might be        safely managed as outpatients An estimated  billion is        expended annually on CAP patients with inpatient therapy        costing as much as  times outpatient antimicrobial        therapy    Risks and probable outcomes in patients with        communityacquired pneumonia have always been assessed        intuitively by clinicians but are now being intensively        and formally studied Several riskscoring systems have        been developed to assign patients to different risk        categories with respect to important outcomes such as        mortality or intensive care unit admission    The need        for determining hospitalization criteria led to the        development of the Pneumonia Severity Index PSI by the        Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team    The PSI index        stratifies patients into five classes with those in class I        and II PSI   representing low risk individuals        that can be safely managed at home        This study uniquely integrates analyses of demographic        social and financial factors in addition to clinical        factors in an attempt to evaluate their significance in        decisions involving hospital admissions of lowrisk CAP        patients This would provide a better understanding to the        interaction of physician patient and health system factors        in admitting lowrisk CAP patients In addition comparing        the average cost of hospitalization of lowrisk patients        with the average cost of outpatient CAP antimicrobial        therapy provides a picture of potential financial savings        to the health care system                    Methods                  Statistical analysis          The principal study objective was determination of          statistically significant differences in variables          assessed between PSI class II ED discharged patients and          those admitted SAS v was used in all statistical          analyses The raw data was read into SAS from EXCEL          data sheet Based on the categorical nature of the data          collected chi square tests using PROC FREQ option were          used to determine statistically significant associations          between each demographic clinical and          laboratoryradiologic parameter and disposition ED          discharge versus hospitalization PROC MEANS option was          used to determine the mean age in years and mean cost of          care for each group of patients Associations were          considered statistically significant where p            twotailed hypothesis                            Results        A total of  patients were evaluated in the emergency        department with a diagnosis of simple community acquired        pneumonia ICD  during the study period

   hospitalized group p    of patients seen on        outpatient basis ED class II discharged were whites while         of those admitted were AfricanAmereican p          There were no patients with either tachypnea RR          or altered mental status in either group but statistically        significant differences were seen for  clinical parameters        temperature and pulse rate p   Majority of        patients in both ED discharged and admitted groups were        covered by private insurance p   The average        length of stay for PSI class II patients seen and        hospitalized was

longterm        care placement and there were complications noted One        hundred and eighteen  of the  of the ED discharged        groups were successfully reached via telephone for        interview Three  of the one hundred eighteen        patients interviewed in the ED discharge group had a second        ED visit within thirty days with fever cough and sore        throat which may be attributed to failed outpatient        therapy Interestingly these patients visited different        emergency departments Five patients  visited the        primary care doctors within one week for failure to        tolerate the initial antibiotics prescribed and persistent        malaise None required rehospitalization Seven patients         felt they should have been hospitalized for better        care and more intense investigations                    Discussion        Management of community acquired pneumonia has been        progressively complicated by several factors expanding        spectrum of causative organisms rising prevalence of        antibiotic resistance increasing population of patients        with advancing age and with comorbidities and the interest        in reducing the number of unnecessary admissions The        initial site of care decision is perhaps the single most        important clinical decision made by physicians during the        entire course of illness for patients with CAP It has a        direct bearing on the intensity of laboratory testing        microbiologic evaluation antibiotic therapy and costs of        treating this illness The estimated average cost of        inpatient care for CAP is  compared with  for        outpatient care           The pneumonia severity index shows a direct correlation        between risk class and risk of death and has been validated        as a guide for decisions regarding hospitalization Age is        a major component of the PSI The age of the patient is        added to other parameters used in the index Patients above        the age of fifty were excluded in the study These patients        are more likely to have chronic comorbid conditions which        places them in higher risk CAP group in contrast to the        target CAP population of our study Several factors that        the rule does not take into account may greatly influence        the decision to admit a patient the most important being        factors related to the patient such as poor social support        inability to maintain oral intake and history of substance        abuse The admission decision may also be influenced by the        availability of outpatient support services home nursing        home intravenous therapy and alternative sites for care        subacute care services        Demographic and social parameters are clearly important        considerations in the quality of care delivered to all        patients In this study statistically significant        differences for gender were seen between the class II        patients seen in the ED and subsequently discharged and        those hospitalized The odds of a PSI class II male CAP        patient being seen and managed on outpatient basis was         times the odds of a female patient in the same risk class        being managed as an outpatient  CI         Table         In a study looking at sex differentials in health        Verbrugge found that females generally show a higher        incidence of acute conditions more shortterm restricted        activity more use of health services and medicines and        were more willing than men to seek medical care for        perceived symptoms    Women have also been shown to        have greater willingness to acknowledge and report illness           Our findings agree with the view that women are more        predisposed than men to rate their health poor and        therefore more likely to accept hospitalization compared to        males especially if there is agreement between the ED        physician and their primary care doctor on admissions           Statistically significant higher hospitalization was        found among PSI class II AfricanAmericans compared to        whites OR   CI  This finding is        interesting in view of the disparities believed to exist        between blacks and whites in both need and access to health        care services Previous studies have shown that blacks are        less likely to receive medical services particularly        intensive care than whites     So what could be        responsible for the statistically significant higher        proportion of blacks in the PSI class II hospitalized        group A national phone survey found that blacks were more        likely than whites to report that their physician did not        inquire sufficiently about their illness did not tell them        how long it would take for prescribed medicine to work did        not explain the seriousness of their illness or injury and        did not discuss test or examination findings    In        addition blacks were less likely than whites to be        satisfied with the care provided during their most recent        hospitalization or ambulatory care visits    One        hypothesis may therefore be that physicians subconsciously        prefer to err on the side of caution when managing African        American low risk CAP patients in view of their lower        socioeconomic status weaker social support systems and        their prevailing higher level of dissatisfaction seen with        medical services        Factors such as education and the skills that come from        it inevitably restrict the ability of some black patients        to gain access to and negotiate effectively for the best        medical treatment available which in this case may not be        hospitalization for a PSI class II patient    In        addition Schoenbaum et al have shown that blacks are less        likely to demand or receive adequate information about        their disease process and more likely to report themselves        to be in poor health than whites of the same age group and        gender    It has also been speculated that blacks and        whites may differ in terms of their treatment preferences        but such a difference has not been documented and may        merely be a result of the interaction of complex        sociocultural and economic factors           PSI class II patients with medical insurance coverage        had a statistically significant higher hospitalization rate        than uninsured patients of the same PSI class OR         CI  Numerous studies have shown that        uninsured persons have greater difficulty accessing        inpatient care fewer procedures and shorter        hospitalizations and are more likely to receive        substandard care for medical injury     A study by        Jackson that looked at the impact of health insurance        status on emergency room services revealed uninsured        emergency patients were less likely to be admitted to the        hospital than insured emergency patients    Weissman        et al in their study compared hospitalized patients and        found that after adjusting for diagnosis related group case        mix uninsured patients had on average  shorter stays         vs  days and underwent  fewer procedures         vs  than insured patients the differences        varying with hospital type    Halm         et al theorized greater involvement        by primary care physicians who are more likely to admit low        risk patients could be responsible for the similar        differences seen in their study since uninsured patients        are often admitted to the service of house staff and        frequently have their need for hospitalization reassessed        by a senior physician    The decision to hospitalize        is not necessarily a commitment to longterm inpatient care        but rather a decision that certain patients should be        closely observed until it is clear that therapy can be        safely continued out of the hospital Even in institutions        with established clinical guidelines for CAP admissions        adherence is highly variable and associated with a variety        of patient system and physician factors Since criteria        for admissions have not been uniformly applied by        clinicians studies have reported wide geographic variation        in hospital admission rates for CAP    In the same        study by Halm et al  of  low risk CAP patients were        hospitalized despite recommendation for outpatient therapy            Physicians reasons for admission were the        presence of active comorbidities  primary care        physicians wish for hospitalization  the presence of        worse pneumonia than the guideline indicated  patient        preference  and inadequate home support  In some        studies physicians have overestimated the risk of death for        patients with CAP leading to unnecessary admissions while        in other studies they have failed to recognize patients as        being severely ill at the time of initial evaluation                   The result of our study concurs with others in        suggesting factors other than clinical demographic        socioeconomic frequently influence physicians decisions        for hospitalizing low risk CAP patients     High        fever and tachycardia were the only clinical parameters        with statistically significant differences between the two        groups p   No significant differences were        identified for other clinical parameters included in the        PSI altered mental status hypotension and tachypnea p          There were also no significant differences        noted for laboratory and radiological parameters arterial        pH BUN Na glucose hematocrit and pulse oximetery ABG        pleural effusion p          Pressure from overcrowding in the ED or bolus admissions        multiple potential admissions at the same time may        influence physician decisions for hospitalizing low risk        CAP patients but this factor is not easy to determine        retrospectively Resident physicians in teaching hospitals        like St Agnes Hospital frequently raise objections to        hospitalizing lowrisk CAP patients especially early in        their training They however soon realize it is almost        easier to write admission orders and send patients to        appropriate medical floors rather than spending hours        arguing with attending physicians in the ED only to finally        admit the same patients It is interesting that neither        time of initial ED assessment ampm versus pmam or        day of ED evaluation weekdays versus weekends were        associated with differences in hospitalization rates of low        risk CAP patients No other studies have found time to be a        statistically significant variable in predicting        hospitalization of low risk CAP patients Table         Although Fine and colleagues state that lowrisk        patients should be considered as candidates for outpatient        therapy there is evidence that a substantial number of        patients in the low risk group would still require        hospitalization    A study by Roson and colleagues in        Spain    found that  of admitted CAP patients were        low risk out of which approximately half did not have        irrefutable reasons for admission Certain studies have        also suggested that the use of PSI as the principal        variable in making the admissions decision could compromise        patient care especially in the economically disadvantaged           This study is limited by its retrospective nature        and relatively small sample size Our study also excluded        patients greater than fifty years of age limiting its        significance in older populations There was also poor        documentation by physicians on valid reasons for        hospitalizing low risk patients such as persistent nausea        and vomiting dehydration homelessness and failed prior        outpatient management A similar study found that many        patients with a low predicted mortality risk were likely        admitted for these reasons    There was no mortality        recorded in the PSI class II hospitalized group All the        patients in the admitted group were discharged directly        home there were no short or longterm care placements        While the outcomes of all patients discharged from the ED        could not be determined a substantial number of these        patients were reached by telephone to ascertain their        outcomes Potential recall bias due to the greater than one        year between the index hospitalization and followup        interviews is possible The noneblinded structure of the        interviews is also likely to contribute information and        investigator biases Even after considering the potential        limitations of this study no irrefutable reasons for        hospitalizations were identified        Despite the fact that some patients might have been        hospitalized due to mitigating circumstances like poor oral        intake and weak support systems which were inadequately        documented in the charts the average length of stay for        hospitalized low risk CAP patients  days is hardly        justifiable for lowrisk patients This is indicative of        overutilization of resources through unjustifiable        hospitalizations No hospitalized patient was transferred        to a nursing home or required other forms of placement that        might influence the length of hospital stay Alcohol and        substance abuse related diagnoses were also not        statistically different between the two groups p                 All patients were treated with the current empirical        standard of care for CAP ie combination of a third        generation cephalosporin and a macrolide or flouroquinolone        as monotherapy with necessary prescription adjustments        after bacteriology results where applicable The average        cost of inpatient care was  compared to  for        outpatient care The latter reflects the cost of ED        assessment and cost of oral outpatient antibiotics These        figures depict an eightfold higher cost of care in the        hospitalized group compared to the outpatient group The        cost of inpatient care in this study is much lower than the         average cost reported by Niedermann et al and may be        because of the differences between our study populations        younger age group without major comorbidities                       Conclusions        This study demonstrates existing overhospitalization of        low risk CAP patients in the community hospital studied        Nearly threequarters of PSI class II communityacquired        pneumonia patients seen during the period covered were        admitted without irrefutable reasons contrary to clinical        management recommendations AfricanAmerican female and        medically insured patients were more likely to be admitted        with low risk CAP Tachycardia and high fever are strong        clinical predictors for hospitalizing low risk CAP        patients There is poor documentation by physicians of        reasons for hospitalization of low risk CAP patients The        association between demographic socioeconomic and clinical        variables with physicians admissions decision of low risk        CAP patients indicate the need to incorporate such        variables in the clinical management guidelines of these        patients The eightfold higher cost of care seen in        hospitalized patients compared to outpatients of the same        risk class is indicative of potential cost savings to the        health care system with unifying admission criteria It        would also limit the health care human resource crisis        notably nurse to patient ratio and serve as a quality        indicator The findings of this study adds to existing        literature in assisting clinicians adjust their admissions        criteria and supports the American Thoracic Society ATS        and Infectious Disease Society of North America IDSA        recommendations for use of the PSI in initial decision        making for CAP patients However the role of the PSI might        best be as a component in the algorithm along with social        and economic considerations Such considerations must be        clearly and adequately documented to justify such        admissions Similar larger
