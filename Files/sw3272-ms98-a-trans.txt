        okay i dont  do you have a opinion on that on the USR     well  the  i think im im skeptical about the whole thing uh and a little still a little bit worried about them because of the history the history of Russia   uhhuh   and theyre in a in a state of flux right now changing uh you uh changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress   sure umhum sure   and even in that situation uh the it seems like to me from what ive read in in the history of Russia and and you know different authors uh there has always been a paranoia theyve always suspected everybody and and thats why they put you know thats why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years and thats why they put a lot of people to death   sure sure that happens   yeah Stalin Staling was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than uh you know the Russian army killed anybody else   uhhuh sure i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together but i could not foresee them  severing what they have with the US um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation um from what ive been hearing is the USSR uh USSR has been uh almost bankrupt for years and its people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people  but i dont think the US would get involved with it because uh theres too close of ties to where   yeah   i think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run them like we run the US and that they have to make their own independent decision so i guess i really have no fear at all of the USSR verses uh you get these small little uh places like Iraq and all of that that   sure   might be something that id be more concerned about with nuclear weapons versus a a small uh or the big country of USSR i i i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally  you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time   yeah   so i mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of you know doing whatever uh for their country theyll do it uh   yeah youre uh i think youre right theres a little more craziness down there       uh the Russian people i think are not that much different from us you know i think theyre that it would be the leadership that id id uh mistrust   sure sure umhum  sure i have a daughter thats frustrated shes on a a stool that she can get up on but it if she cant get down on it its like get me down right now  but anyway it was really good talking to you and you have a good weekend   yeah   you to thank you byebye   uhhuh thank you bye now
