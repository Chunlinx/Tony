                                 Public Funding of Art                                       Received last night                        Dear Ester            Alas this is my second attempt to respond to your last message ApparentlyI was writing to slowly for my service provider It inquired whether I wantedto stay online and despite my assurance that I did I was promptlydisconnectedlosing my draft in the process            What I was writing about was your initial discussion of art and funding asrepresented by the Brooklyn Museum dispute Frankly I sidestepped the issuebecause I am of a very mixed mind about the whole thing On the one hand Itreasure the principle that artists should be able to express themselves inrelatively unrestrained fashion On the other I have concern about publicfunding of art I am uncertain about the extent to which public funds should beused to fund artwhether that art be kitsch or politically controversialstatements            Likewise I am perplexed by public funding of churches to provide certainkinds of social or other kinds of public services In each case my concern isnot just on the impact on the public or public policy but also about the impacton artists or the church Is it possible that the public funding of art orchurch social services or schooling has a deleterious impact on theirintegrity Moreover should the state be funding activities that the generalpublic finds offensive or services that compete with public services As Inoted above I find myself really quite confused in each case School vouchersalternative schools charter schools and church schools all compete withpublic schools and probably challenge public schools to improve Moreover suchschool programs offer the working class and the poor the same opportunitiesthat the wealthy have to send their children to alternative schools Yet it isfair to ask whether the diversion of public funds from public schools weakensand further threatens what was once a powerful institution of upward mobilityfor the poor and immigrants            I guess that pushed to the wall I would choose school choice if onlybecause schools have suffered from the same kind of stifling bureaucraticclimate that has so hindered so many public services Yet             So as you note this is an awfully late breakfast Tomorrow my responsewill be at breakfast            Be wellGeorge
