                                 The Lie of the Land            I have a very clear memoryof the meeting declares one central figure Bill Clinton in Washingtonsongoing sexual and legal battles and I told the truth            I proceeded to explain to Newsweek s Michael Isikoff says another figure onetime KathleenWilley friend Julie Hiatt Steele that Ms Willey had asked me to lie tosupport her version of the event and that I had in fact done so            There are people who talk alot observes a third participant Monica Lewinskys lawyer William HGinsburg and as part of that scenario peccadilloes they may tell fibslies exaggerations oversell                           USAToday  summing up the experience of the past two months asked in aheadline Who can claim truth or objectivity anymore            Ah that old question What is truth demanded PontiusPilate John  during his interrogation of Jesus He received no replyPerhaps because it is less accessible or at least less prevalent the act oftruth telling has garnered far less attention in popular speech than the act oflying In Rogets Thesaurus  words associated with falsity outnumberthose associated with veracity by

the matter is  When Ginsburg describedcertain testimony as being totally reliable  the words were served upin press accounts as unavoidably they also are here within an isolatedsetting of quotation

summarily dropped from the ticket is now an ironicsynonym for dont bet on it or even not on your life            In much the same way categoricaldenials have suffered an irreversible erosion of face value owing to theirroutine issuance by bombastic politicians aggrieved miscreants andrepresentatives of liberation armies and international terrorists Categorical denial  with its serration of easy consonants and regularlyspaced vowels seems to be within pronunciation range of all nonEnglishspeakers Once intended to endow a denial with the qualities of pervasivenessand totality the adjective categorical absolute unqualifiedexplicit now raises doubts and eyebrows The British poet and screenwriterJames Lasduns recent protestationI categorically deny being aneoformalistplants the suspicion that his sympathies are indeedneoformalist Responding to rumors that Disney was planning to add newsequences to the classic animated film Snow White  a spokesman for thecompany declared I categorically deny that we would ever touch SnowWhite             Stillthe idea of category as it applies to lies is worth exploringand leads intothe realm of theology Say what one will about Catholic theology it offers acosmological taxonomy in which all things have an appointed place and awellthoughtout definition rendered with lapidary minimalism Truth for instance is helpfully defined in The Catholic Encyclopedia as theaccordance or conformity between what is asserted and what is or theconformity of intellection with being Falsity  in turn is thedeformity of intellection and being            In the weeks ahead it will be important to maintain cleartheological distinctions per the Encyclopedia  among various kinds oflies There is the mendacium jocosum the lie told in jest A secondtype of lie is the mendacium officiosum  or officious lie whosepurpose is to achieve some useful end or to prevent some distinct harmExamples might include a doctor misleading a terminally ill patient or aprisoner lying to enemy interrogators A third type of lie is the mendaciumperniciosum  or pernicious lie a lie that is intended to do harm            A fourthtype of lie might be called the mendacium universalis  the universal orendemic lie This is the type of lieif it is indeed a liethat we seem tobe encountering most frequently these days If a lie by definition becomes alie only in the context of communication speech writing gesture and if alie is immoral because it destroys the fundamental trust that makescommunication possibleif all this is so can a lie be told in a context wherecommunication is understood to have no objective value to begin with I givethe floor back to the theologians            In theextremely difficult situations being considered there is no mutual trust orconfidence to destroy In fact a maximum of distrust prevails between theparties and no man in such a position could prudently take the words of theother at their face value In such a case words would cease to a degree tobe a medium for the exchange of thought Communication would be broken downand to the extent in which communication of mind with mind has becomeimpossible it would be equally impossible to realize the idea of a lie It seems incontestable that if no communication in the ordinary sense of theword is possible there can be no lie            Not all falsehoods of course are lies thekey ingredient in a lie is intentionality Nor are all lies deceptionssomelies are told without any intention to deceive Youve lost weight Lets dolunch Moreover some deceptions are technically not lies theologicallyspeaking A person could tell a truth with sufficient clarity to avoid makinga false statement and sufficient ambiguity and evasiveness to avoid revealing atruth which he wants to keep hidden For instance if youre a presidentialcandidate and are asked if you have ever smoked marijuana and you have butonly in England you might reply that you have broken no state laws Astatement that successfully picks its way across this dangerous terrain is saidto exhibit an economy of truth  and a person who has uttered such astatement is said to have been economical with the truth  Thesecharacterizations too were originally conferred with a sense of professionalappreciation I first heard them on the lips of some Jesuit friends but theyhave also been pulled out of truths orbit and into the atmosphere ofmendacity Today an economy of truth sometimes just means a liealbeit one whose seriousness may be debatable Julie Burchill wrote recently inthe Guardian  The idea that one party has to overcome the naturalresistance of the other party to sexual intercourse by a combination of giftsand being economical with the truth takes us perilously near todaterape territory            The concept of an               economy of truth may have lost its purity but it retains considerableutility If nothing else it adds a timely new dimension to the hortatoryreminder Its the economy stupid
