        okay uh we keep a monthly budget i just recently stopped working so i can be home with my kids  so we keep a a monthly budget and we try to stick to it     i know its really its really difficult here all because theres always something breaking car needs tires or you know something   yeah yeah thats thats the kind of things that throw you off   uh uh we we do ours more monthly than long range um we uh my husband gets paid once a month and when he gets paid i pay all the bills   uhhuh umhum   and out of his check they take a savings and out of my check they take savings   uhhuh   and retirement both out of both checks so as far as extra savings we really dont have that much extra to save um   yeah yeah   his check once a month pays all the bills my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of thing and it works out real well that way so we dont run into a lot of problems   oh how nice yeah yeah yeah   but budgets are horrible   well i know we do my husband gets paid twice a week and so we pay all of the little bills uh one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill you know those big bills the second   uhhuh   yeah   second pay and then um again he does have a savings that comes out you know for Christmas and stuff that kind of thing   yeah yeah when the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them well send me some money   yeah that kind of thing   yeah  it uh it would be nice if we didnt have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings   but its nice thats there you know   but we do yeah it im just glad that it is there for car insurance medical bills whatever happen but uh   yeah yeah yeah its nice that its there   i know but i you its just really is difficult uh neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years   yeah   and of course the cost of living keeps going up so my groceries are outrageous and i keep saying my check does less and less but   yeah yeah yeah thats kind of how i felt when i was working because it seemed like we spent more we bought more things and it seemed like we spent more then a lot of it was going to uh day care and that kind of thing   umhum   yeah   so it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut but we save more  i dont know how and i dont know why but we it seems like we do   well i uh i know that since i do work i buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and uh well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that and ill stop by the deli and pick up   yeah yeah you kind of try and buy bigger quantities   uh chicken or whatever where if i did not work im sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot a lot uh better   yeah thats how i felt too it just you could take a little longer and just watch a little bit more i guess   yeah   well you   i guess thats kind of like the way we do we i i dont i dont know how it comes it just seems like we save a little bit more whereas where i was working   well im sure you do um i do not  well i do not have to pay child care during the winter my sons old enough that he likes to come home   oh   uh from school but in the summer hes still young enough that i cannot leave him by himself so in the summer i have that extra and ours is seventy dollars a week plus   yeah   all activities and thats usually movies one day skating on day swimming one day   yeah yeah and it adds up   yeah so you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week and thats a lot of money   yeah it is  it is yeah   but you know if theyre gonna be in day care then they need to have some activities other than just being there   umhum   how do you have two children   i have two one is four and a half and the other ones two and a half   well theyre expensive too uh  just the outgrowing of their clothes so im sure the budget   so yeah yeah that yeah i just came back to find jeans for the little one and it does add up yeah but um   yeah and medical bill   yeah   although the insurance we had was good uh when Thomas was younger a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front and then you were reimbursed so it was nice when youd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the insurance but in the meantime you had to put out the money first     yeah yeah       well that thats thats hard but im enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can   but yeah it is oh i would too i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to to   for the i know its not forever and thats whats so sad but   well you probably wouldnt wanna do it forever i dont know though when
