        okay do you have any um ideas on universal health insurance do you have any strong opinions you do   yeah i think its probably a good idea um i think given that um well given that therere so many people who dont have health insurance its probably a real smart thing that at least have some basic coverage for everyone i mean you hear these horror stories of people   uhhum   homeless people going to the hospital and and being thrown out because they have no insurance and having to go to someplace else you know it would be nice if   yeah right   no matter where you are or who you are or what happened you know what happened to you you go to the hospital and they say okay just just take him dont worry about who or what he is later so   yeah yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um   that would be a nice thing   kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and its going to be six times more expensive as what   yeah no that that is certainly true but i wonder about like in Canada in Canada where everybody everybody um automatically has insurance in Canada   yeah uhhuh right and they have that in England too but i think it is a pretty poor they get a lot lower quality care than we do now i know that some people dont agree with me but um i know you have to wait real long time to get for certain surgeries that arent emergencies and you do have the kind of choices that we have here   yeah   and um ive worked a lot in doctors offices and hospitals and i really dont want to give up having those choices   thats true thats something i havent thought about   because i think i mean there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors and good hospitals and bad doctors hospitals and   thats true thats true   and in England at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be   no oh so you dont get any choices at all or anything   no no i mean that yeah   oh thats a problem yeah because i i mean i know i even even among you know even even now the way we have it now theres   its getting worse isnt it  yeah   there are some places yeah i mean like we have an an HMO that allows us to pick our own physicians   right right uhhuh   and we picked a primary care physician and just didnt like him you know and and had to switch because i felt he was a quack   right thats exactly the problem theres just so many such variation in it but you see i guess what what they had in England and i guess in Canada is socialized medicine so maybe thats like the extreme of it do you think   yeah yeah that is the extreme and what what that i what that i think tends to do though is i think that tends to that probably has two a a good and a bad side for young people wanting to become doctors i mean what you get is other people who are motivated to be because the money isnt i guess as much for doctors anymore so they would wind up getting   uhhum uhhum right right   the people who really want to be doctors being doctors but then again you know you dont get those people whod be good and are real smart and decided hey i i wanna make a lot of money so i will go into medicine you know you dont get those   really want to right right or that yeah exactly or people also get the feeling that well geez you know you do have to worry about you have a lot of job security there and its more of a seniority i would imagine kind of thing instead of having a skill or whatever to advance and so you dont necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of   yeah thats true   i dont know   i think we have to have something i really do   yeah and it would be nice to see something where at least right i mean even something that said you know look free major medical to all you know to everyone and then beyond that you sort of work out on your own if you want   yeah yeah i know i i dont know i  ive having worked in doctors offices and stuff i see it from a physicians point of view and i   uhhuh   i think the problem with the skyrocketing costs right now is the insurance companies because i dont see doctors getting all rich   oh yeah   and i think hospitals do make money but not nearly as much as insurance companies do i think they are really making a killing and nobodys talking about it nobodys   oh right no yeah theyre the ones who make i mean theyre the ones they have you know decide although i mean the unfortunate part of that is that is that people tend to forget that doctors are humans as well   uhhum   so that so that you know insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people or certain physician types of of doctors given that you know someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them well they could take you know it could be millions i mean unfortunately and and if the doctor whether it was you know i mean i feel those cases where the doctor was wrong or malicious or something you know but there are you know i mean   right right right there are mistakes are made right sure sure yep   mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes unfortunately and and it shouldnt be a billion dollar you know industry it should be i made a mistake and this is this is fair compensation not   so is i guess yeah i think thats the legal part it coming in to too that i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for   yeah that is a big problem thatd be nice   or  or i dont know because then thats where the insurance company benefits if if people werent having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage   uhhuh it would be a lot better yeah and im sort of in a in a government run medicine program sort of im im in a well well im a graduate student at and uh   you know yeah are you okay at where oh okay uhhuh are what im in Texas yep yep yep   at University of Rochester in Rochester New York ill bet youre in Texas up yeah i was gonna bet that okay um yeah and as as it turns out my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company and can get me covered as well   uhhuh oh great yeah   but uh which is great except and because the university but the university offers two plans they offer what they call the mandatory portion which is basically major medical and then they offer the waiveable portion   uhhuh oh yeah uhhuh   which is which is you know every you know sort of everything else you need so your your your your basic care beyond major medical separate stuff   uhhuh okay   and they dont and even though my my wifes insurance covers me for everything i still have to pay them a hundred some odd dollars a semester for the mandatory portion of the insurance   yeah uhhuh oh no that that that cant be legal   yeah im not actually sure it is or not but no one people keep sort of fighting it and im and i keep meaning to fight it but you know i just dont want to spend my time   oh my gosh how can they how how can they make you pay for insurance coverage   well the reason the i mean their rational is is they make everyone pay for it so that it it keeps the cost of university health services down and everyone can use it you know it   how how does it keep the cost down   because everyone is now forced to pay for this   oh so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy   and theres like a uh well no what yeah well what they used it no they what they use it for is is is university health services we have a we have a hospital here and a subportion a subportion of the hospital was   okay okay okay so youre subsidizing the hospital   right so im basically paying for a welfare state now as it turns out as it turns out um my wife and i have chosen to use the university as health services as out primary care physician we can do that     uhhuh okay oh good   so in in but in effect i am pay twice for one service   you are you are i know and see thats the thing that is the thing now that im in my thirties now and i have three kids and im i mean im very liberal im extremely liberal and um and i say but now in the last couple years i have gotten to the point where i am saying i just can not afford to pay any more   uhhum   to help people out i i wanna keep helping people out but i need the federal for the government or the agencies to find a way to do it on the amount of money  you know that i can afford i just cant afford any more its its out its just outrageously   yeah yeah   its just starting to get me angry and for the first time in my life im starting to feel like i well i guess it has a lot to do with a lot of the stuff that i find out that im paying for now you know   yeah well thats thats certain true   i mean i cant afford to have some kind of some kind of voluntary optional operation for myself because our our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over say the past five years to the point now where even if we need surgery our insurance only covers eighty percent of it   right which is ridiculous   and right and so no matter what happens to me if i get in to a car accident this afternoon i have no idea you know  no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical cost because my insurance is now only eighty percent of what ever its going to be   yeah   and um so on top of that um then what if i  what if we decide to have universal health insurance so i am subsidizing   everybody else   and and what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program thats going to say okay well you really need to have those varicose veins or fixed or your teeth fixed or something like that and im paying for it   right   you know it stuff like that has happened with education and other things that you hear about and its just wait a minute  you know my kids arent getting that how come their kids kids are getting   exactly i dont i dont uh   and and i know that its only in a few cases and i dont want them to to uh cut funding for welfare programs or anything i dont want them to do that because i know a lot of people they live right on the edge and they need that   uhhuh yeah its its one of the strange i i think its strange as you get older i i i think the tendency is that as people get older   but but i uhhum uhhuh   and gain i dont i dont i dont want to say more responsibilities but you know things like homes and kids and so forth they tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger   uhhum right well yeah thats and its uh its funny because a couple years ago i hear a  quote from Winston Churchill lets see if i can remember it anybody whos not a liberal in his twenties has no heart and a person whos not a conservative in his fifties has no brain   that is probably very true   it was something like that  yeah and uh i dont know i guess thats whats happening to me but i i i think its just starting um its i i dont know maybe other people i do you think its a sign of the times that people are starting to say alright really we really mean it no more taxes or maybe is it my own personal   no i i think think people are starting to really mean it i mean everywhere you look youre getting something new i mean you start off you know especially um you guys i believe in Texas you dont have state tax do you   yeah no no income tax   right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline um you know because our our so on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline so were just   yeah oh oh wow yep yeah but i tell you um we have incredible property taxes down here   or that could be yeah making up for the difference   so yeah and we dont have the services that other states
