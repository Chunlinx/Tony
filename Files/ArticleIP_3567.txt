weekend with friends at theirrestored Pennsylvania farmhouse On Monday morning I wanted to thank them butwhen my fingers went instinctively to the email Send button I wondered ifemail was socially correct for such purposes                                       Whatare Prudies thoughts on the evolution of email and the socialgracesassuming there is any connection                                       Polite butPuzzled                        DearPo            Prudie supposes if youreBrooke Astor email might not cut it but the handwritten bread and butternote is starting to seem like the whalebone corset given the modernpossibilities Because snail mail is not always reliable many people withsocial graces have substituted the fax ensuring both timeliness and actualarrival Since email is even quicker and just as dependable as faxing by allmeans feel at ease being electronically grateful It is after all the thoughtthat counts Prudie is assuming your hosts are wired            A goodtest for you to figure out your comfort level about this matter is to imaginehow you would respond to receiving a thankyou note on the Net            Prudie currently                                             DearPrudence                                                      I am fortunate enough tohave two mothersinlaw one who gave birth to my wonderful husband and one whois married to his father I get along famously with both of them and they getalong famously with each other  I thought                                       Recently mystepmotherinlaw has taken to saying some unkind words about my motherinlawOn two occasions these were said just to me and on one occasion they were saidin front of others Both times I quickly changed the subject but felt as thoughI had been punched in the stomach                                       I feelthe need to express my intolerance of this type of behavior but it isimperative that it be done in the nicest way possible How do you suggest Iapproach the topic I want to be understood perfectly but also dont want tocause problems with my stepmotherinlaw                                       Please sign meTryingTo Be Graceful                        DearTry            You are admirable in tryingto head off wives Nos  and  from morphing into the Israel and PLO of thefamily Why dont you try something like this I know you and insert namehave a very nice friendship and I cant figure out where your new unfriendly remarks are coming from Perhaps I am misunderstanding you It hasalways meant so much to insert husbandfathers name that the socialrelationship was cordial It would be a shame to change the balance and makehusbandfather unhappy            With thisapproach you will not be attacking her you will be offering her a benigndirectional signal and she will get the message If she does not take thehint then you and Prudie will dope out a way to up the ante            Prudie disarmingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      May I offer a comment onImpatiently Waitings situation her Steady Freddie of four yearssays hes not ready for marriage If so its this Ultimatums and headgames are a terrible way to start a marriage What you need instead is ahearttoheart not about the marriage potential in your relationship but aboutwhere each of you is going individually and what each wishes to achieve Thiskind of conversation will give you more information about your place in hisheart                                       At thesame time you need to ascertain why you want to marry Fred Are you lookingfor security Children Or maybe you just think its time to get married Thenassess whether the reasons are specific to Fred and worthy of your own lifelongcommitment If your desire is to spend forever with Fred tell himsobluntlywith no allusion to marriage If he seems even a tad lukewarm tothe idea run for the hills But if he passionately agrees start in on foreverand shut up about a wedding More than likely it will pop up before you knowit                                       Been There                        DearBeen            What wisewords for our friend in romantic turmoil It was good of you to take the timeto be a Prudie I suspect you would agree that it is easier to ride a horse inthe direction in which it is going            Prudiephilosophically                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am writing on myhusbands email password When he left the hospital he was treated fordepression and a sleep disorder he got an email address for a woman he metthere It was a secret affair for three weeks until I found out Then he saidthey were just friends He said he could talk to her on subjects he canttalk to me aboutintellectual thingsclaiming that I cant give him what hedesires on a cerebral level Was I jealous Hell yes and hurt                                       I should tell you that afew years ago he had an impotence problem and couldnt manage on a physicallevel so I got into cybersex I considered it enhanced masturbation and thinkit saved our marriage And we had counseling                                       So I agreed to let him have his intellectual friend Now he wants to meet herfor coffee just to have a chat I expressed to him that having an emailgirlfriend is fine with me but going out for coffee without me is a majorproblem I checked his mailbox and found he had deleted many messages to herHe is also being secretive and in denial that this situation is unfair Mypartners are anonymous and so am I She is not anonymousand an extherapistyet I dont have a degree but I know it is wrong when a man goes outside hismarriage to fill a need whether it be intellectual or sexual I am feelinghelpless And now he claims I am ugly when Im jealous Can I get off thisroller coaster from hell                                       Hurt

is full of all kinds of thingsthat are not very appetizing            Since yousay youve had counseling we can skip that option Cyberflings yours and hisare just symptoms of a marriage that is not working The writing is on thescreen The elements that make a decent marriage are no longer there Prudieunderstands that you guys are between a rock and a hard drive but recommendsthat you sign off
