                                 The Man With the Bandwidth            In this brandnew digitaleconomy were supposedly inhabiting competitive advantage can be eroded in aninstant and large companies with lots of fixed assets are doomed to beingoverrun by quickmoving startups who can adapt better to a world of rapidtechnological innovation By that logic the cable industrywith itsoverpriced services monopolistic market control and unwieldy operatingstructuresmust be headed for the graveyard            But asthe recent return to center stage of cable pioneer John Malone head of TCIsuggests the cable industry has never been healthier despite having committeda rather staggering array of strategic missteps in the past few years In theend owning billions of dollars of infrastructuresuch as cablewirescertainly has its flaws as a business strategy but it also has one hugebenefit Owning those wires allows you to make a lot of mistakes without goingout of business And in an industry dedicated to gambling on futuretechnologies thats a benefit that cant be overvalued            Of course Malone did not become famous becausehis company owned a lot of cable wires On the contrary he was as responsibleas anyone for hyping the digital economy and the transformation of the homeinto a multimedia center of information entertainment and commerce Withoutthe Malone of the early s the whole concept of the informationsuperhighwaywith its  TV channels its interactive television itshighspeed Internet access and online banking and shoppingcould scarcelyhave existed For a man with a masters degree in electrical engineering and adoctorate in operations research Malone has always had a keen sense of howimportant futurist rhetoric was to the new media world Convincing people thatcool things were just around the corner was essential to convincing them thatthey wanted those things            Ofcourse Malone did temper his visionary side with a hardboiled business sideWhen he talked about the information superhighway it was always in terms ofcollecting tolls on it The technologies Malone championed were designed toservice meatandpotatoes taskssuch as banking and shoppingrather than theneeds of some ideal virtual community Malones reputation as the Darth Vaderof cable and a guy who knows how to run over people spoke to his ferociousability as a negotiator and dealmaker When he joked in early  thatFederal Communications Commission chief commissioner Reed Hundt should be shotfor ordering rate reductions the idea that the dark side of the Force wasshaping the digital future was hard to resist            Afew months earlier in October  Malonehad announced that TCI and Bell Atlantic planned to merge in a deal that at thetime dwarfed all previous mergers The result was going to be a massivevertically integrated company offering  million customers across the countryevery communication and information service they could want Had the deal gonethrough todays media landscape would obviously look very different But byFebruary  the plan had collapsed and its failure deflated both thesuperhighway hype and Malones reputation as an irresistible force            Itseems odd that one blown deal could have changed everything but TCI had billeditself as a growth company which meant it had to keep getting bigger in orderto remain valuable in the eyes of Wall Street And the FCCs rate rollbackwhich happened around the same time put a real dent into TCIs cash flowSince the company has always carried a huge debt loadtoday its north of billionslowing cash flow was hardly a recipe for success Whats more thetruth was that the technology could not live up to the hype In retrospect infact whats most interesting about that time is how little progress weve madetoward the kinds of things Malone assured us were just around the corner Fivehundred channels onscreen banking onscreen shopping interactive news Noneis available via cable television today Even cable modems which would make aqualitative difference in the experience of using the Web have minusculemarket penetration though thats supposed to changewink wink nudgenudgein the next year or so            Over the following three years the cableindustry was everyones favorite selection as the industry most likely to failEither the regional Bell companies were going to take away the cable companiesbusiness or satellite television was going to steal it or the companies weregoing to collapse under the weight of their own debt In fact if Microsofthadnt invested  billion a year ago in cable provider Comcast that mightstill be the conventional wisdom But Microsoft did invest that moneypointingonce again to television as a gateway to the digital futureand almostovernight cable was hot again            Microsofts investment in Comcast drew attention to the obviousthat the nameof the game in the new media economy is bandwidth Amazing leaps in digitaltechnology are largely irrelevant unless you can bring them inside the homeAnd no industry is better positioned to provide that bandwidth than the onethat has  percent of US residences wired with highbandwidth coaxial cableMalone believed that all along which is why he never moved TCI out of thecable business and why when the company sought to make its subscriber basemore manageable it traded subscribers for minority stakes in other cablecompanies            The Streets new love affair with cable has putMalone back on the business pages nearly every day and back in visionary modeThis is more than a little ironic when you consider that TCI has become theleast technologically advanced of all American cable companies after Maloneslashed capital spending in the past couple of years in order to keep thecompanys finances in order But with the digital settop box which Malonesees as the vehicle that will finally deliver highspeed Net accessinteractive television and hundreds of channels hes found his latestcantlose gizmo And everyone from Microsoft to Intel to Sun Microsystems hasjumped on board            The digital box may well bethe harbinger of a truly wired future once the struggle over whichtechnologies will be included in it is resolved and the cable companies figureout how to get subscribers to pay for it But even if the settop box is notthe answer Malone will just wait until the next one appears With  millionsubscribers and minority stakes in everything from the Learning Channel to TimeWarner he has the resources to be patient and the experience of the last fouryears shows he has the will to be patient as well The myth of John Malone wasbuilt around the image of someone able to see the value inherent in a futurethat no one else could grasp The reality of John Malone is that hes someoneable to see the value inherent in a mundane presentthe present of cable wiresand the E Networkthat everyone else was too quick to write off
