                                 Endless Summer                           NotePlot Holes is an occasional series assessing the narrative logic ofmovies                        It was a busy summer for theLogic Squad The assaults on plausibility began in the first frames of ConAir  as Nicolas Cages character returned home from Operation Desert Stormin a tugboat and did not subside until Sam Neill mutated into some kind ofspace devil at the end of Event Horizon  whereupon his face inexplicablybroke out in a crosshatched design that made him look like a slab of grilledahi tuna            None ofthis should be surprising Summer is the season of action movies and inHollywood velocity has always been a greater virtue than coherence One of themost damning things that can be said about a script is that it is episodicmeaning that it dawdles when it should accelerate that the writer is lessinterested in the ruthless propulsion of the story than in leisurely details oftone and character As long as a movie is kept at a high enough idle thethinking goes the viewer wont mind an engine knock or two when it comes tocredibility            Sometimes this theory works as in Air Force One Though the movie asked us to believe that the president of the United Stateswas a superhuman jungle warrior of unyielding principle it didntsignificantly insult our intelligence further And its probably unsporting totake a movie like FaceOff to task for issues of verisimilitude JohnWoo its director has long demonstrated a rousing indifference to merereality and this moviein which the characters routinely somersault throughthe air firing guns from both handsis just his latest salute to impossibleoperatic violence Still haunting questions linger Im happy to buy thenotion that John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were able to swap facesafter allthey were aided by a stateoftheart morphogenetic templatebut I neverquite understood how Cage who is as lean as a rattlesnake and Travolta whohas the sort of gentlemanly proportions that inspired relaxedfit jeansmanaged to trade bodies as well            It iscertainly worth a passing mention that Nicolas Cage gets shot in the same armin both FaceOff and Con Air  though neither wound interfereswith his ability to hang from firetruck ladders or leap from speeding boatsThese two movies along with the incomparable Speed   make up what filmhistorians may one day deem the improbability trilogy of all time Though thereis not enough room in cyberspace to catalog all the ways in which these filmspart company with reality special mention must be made of Speed  svillain who as richly embodied by Willem Dafoe is a buzzing hive ofbefuddlement When he steps onto a cruise ship carrying a set of explosive golfclubs and a jar of leeches when he murmurs to the leeches in the bathtub as heapplies them to his skin You take care of me and Ill take care of theship we know we have entered a world that the light of reason will neverpenetrate            Contact was supposed to be an antidote to all thissummer nonsense a passionate think piece about the possibility of alien lifeand the existence of God It is to be applauded for trying to make us thinkinstead of just react but sometimes too many brain waves are just as bad astoo few I first suspected that Contact s logic circuits might be friedwhen early in the movie Matthew McConaughey as a roving Christian Zen masternamed Palmer Joss strolls through a Costa Rican palapa nibbling from abox of Cracker Jack While it is certainly possible that a box of Cracker Jackmight be for sale in a remote Central American jungle I submit that thechances of finding one are no greater than stumbling upon say a Zagnut barTo be fair though I did believe it when McConaugheys callow mushycharacter is later hired by the Clinton White House as a spiritualadviser                           Contact s central premise is intriguing A radio astronomer played byJodie Foster receives a blizzard of binary mathematical data from acivilization in distant space The task of decrypting these data stymies themost brilliant minds on earth but when the puzzle is finally solved thescientists behold a set of blueprints for building a highly unconventionalspace transport For all its earnest credibility about radio astronomyContact is breezy in the extreme when it comes to almost everythingelse We are asked to believe not only that President Clinton shanghaied bythe filmmakers into a notorious cameo could inspire the nation to spendtrillions of dollars on this machine without even a raised eyebrow from GeorgeWill but also that a crosseyed homicidal doomsday prophet would be hired toput the finishing touches on it and that after he sabotages the whole projectin the name of Jesus it would be rebuilt at a secret location on the island ofHokkaido by a zillionaire eccentric who floats around in orbit aboard his owncustommade Mir            Even more troubling are the cryptic motives of the aliensWhen Jodie Foster finally sets forth in the transportread no further if youdont want to hear the movies endingshe lands on a peaceful tropical beachthoughtfully provided by the aliens to cushion her culture shock The aliensthemselves take the form of her beloved dead father who holds the weepingearthling in his arms and tells her shell never walk alone Incredibly thealiens dont have much more to say than that and she cant seem to think ofmuch more to ask Shes traveled halfway across the universe to be patted onthe head and told to run on home And another thing If these aliens are soadept at replicating the many moods of our planet if they can speakEnglish  how come they had to communicate with us in the first placethrough a byzantine binary code Thats like God deciding to communicate to usvia that cinnamon bun shaped like Mother Teresa way too coy
