                                 Viacom Dios            The LosAngeles Times  New York Times and USAToday each lead with Viacoms acquisition of CBS a  billiontransaction resulting if approved by shareholders and the federal governmentin a huge new multimedia entity The Washington Post topfronts the deal but leads instead witha story breaking in the Russian press that none of the other American bigdailies has A Swiss investigations fresh evidence that a company receivingmajor Kremlin contracts paid tens of thousands of dollars in bills on creditcards belonging to Boris Yeltsin and his two daughters and  million to aHungarian bank account associated with Yeltsin            For those scoring at home the WP says ViacomCBS is the thirdlargest media deal ever with thenew company becoming the thirdlargest media enterprise while both theNYT and LAT say its the biggest media deal ever resulting in theNo  media outfit behind only Time Warner The papers explain that the dealexemplifies the virtues of vertical integration nicely defined by theWP as the ability to produce entertainment and simultaneouslydistribute it The LAT notes that this feature of the deal tying up asit does many production and distribution entities could stimulate othersimilar mergers among companies now needing more than ever to tie up theirown            The coverage notes the two largest speed bumps for the gettogether Viacomowns half of UPN and current federal rules prevent a company from owning twobroadcast networks Also there is a rule limiting a media companys TV reachto  percent of all households and the new company will reach  percent Thepapers note that Sumner Redstone Viacoms No  and his counterpart at CBSMel Karmazin will be visiting the FCC in Washington today to appeal forspecial dispensation on these matters            The deal coverage is shot through with the usual attempts at dramatizing theessentially undramatic activity of guys in suits writing themselves checks TheLAT  for instance bathetically refers to a series of secret meetingsat Karmazins penthouse apartment during which Redstone grew to see themagic of the marriage Karmazin was proposing Perhaps the days definitivemerger porn is this line from Redstone about Karmazin quoted in one of theNYTs seven  inside stories about the deal This began as a dealinvolving some television stations Then he started talking about cablenetworks Then I could see it coming He is a master salesman and he began toturn me on Just about the only relief from all this breathlessness comes fromthe WP  which quotes an academic as saying It seems to me that thisis by any definition an undemocratic development The media system in ademocracy should not be inordinately dominated by a few very powerfulinterests            Everybody reports that just ahead of a looming Friday deadline a group ofPuerto Rican nationalists has accepted the politically explosive clemencyrecently offered by President Clinton This means they will have to foreswearviolence or its advocacy Two prisoners offered the deal declined it            The NYT and Wall Street Journal run stories reporting that TreasuryState and White House officials learned last spring of massive Russianmoneylaundering involving the Bank of New York but didnt pass the informationalong to Al Gore or President Clinton The WP buries this informationnear the bottom of its lead            The LAT  the NYT  and WP front reports that on the eveof former HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros trial on various charges stemming fromhis payment of hush money to a paramour Cisneros pleaded guilty to a singlecount of lying to the FBI when asked about the cash netting a fine but nojail The case had been developed by an independent counsel under thenowlapsed statute The NYT and WP headlines emphasize theincommensurability of the cases cost  million and its result            Yesterdays NYT ran a sprawling frontpage special report raising the question of whether the nowconfirmedability in recent years of China to miniaturize nuclear weapons was a result ofspying on the United States or just hard independent work The effortconducted by one of the papers most able science writers William J Broadsays high up that the congressional report issued late last year asserting thatespionage was the main explanation went beyond the evidence and that histhorough review shows that perhaps thousands of individuals had access to theinformation that the report and the federal investigation suggest came from onedismissed scientist Wen Ho Lee Now given that the Times ran hard andoften with the congressional report and the line it took does this piecerepresent some sort of aboutface Or worse some sort of illegitimate attemptby the paper to revise its history of coverage on the subject Todays Papersdoesnt think so The papers coverage has generally been clear in attributingthe Wen Ho Leeprobablydidit line to particular named and unnamedgovernment sources And anyway a paper should be encouraged to revisit a topicas more information becomes available and better understood Todays Papersonly complaint about Broads relook is that it somewhat unfairly chips away atthe impression the paper had originally created The threepage piece waitsuntil the secondtolast column to state that the consensus of the Americanintelligence agencies is that espionage played a role in Chinas catchup evenif there is no smokinggun evidence for this
