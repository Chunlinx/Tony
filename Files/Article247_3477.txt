                                 Rowling As Novelist                        Dear Tony            Why these books why now Boy thats a hard one Could be a simple matterof demographics Boomers kids are old enough to know what they like and sayso and there are enough of them to give their collective voice a certainvolume Or maybe its a cyclical thing Fantasy was last in fashion during thes when as you point out Star Wars had its astonishing apotheosisIs it coming back like platform shoes Or maybe the explanation is Rowlingsquick enchanted penshes turned out three Potter stories in two yearsleaving her readers no time to lose their appetites Or could it be ourambivalence about the recent furious surge of moody technology giving usapparently magical powers that we cant quite control Or is someone atScholastic a secret marketing genius Or is Rowling herself a wizard Whatsyour pet theory            I wonder whether its true as you claim that children are less likely thanadults to put up with being preached at The authors of childrens books on thewhole certainly dont seem to think so Classics like Little Women andThe Secret Garden preach shamelessly without losing their passionateyoung groupies even today Kids after all get plenty of lecturesdiscipline limits from their beloved parents The more recent crop ofbooks continue to preach though they promote psychological health rather thanmoral rectitude American writers are far worse in this respect than theBritseven Konigsberg and Fitzhugh whom I love as you do can occasionallysound like guidance counselors Maybe one of the reasons Rowling hit it bigwith grownups is her refusal to drum in lessons Instead her books get theirdepth from a combination of allegory and genuine human interactions thathavent been prechewed She lets her characters learn from their mistakes orfail to do so Adults like thattheyre can dish out the preaching but theycant take it            One of the pleasures of reading Rowling as a grownup which you touch onis seeing her develop as a novelist The first book had a simplish dramatictrajectory Harry is sure he knows who are the good guys and who are the badguys but he guesses wrong In the second book I thought at first that she waspulling the same trick but I should have trusted her The apparent villainreally is a villain of sortsbut she adds surprises As we learn more andmore clearly in each volume there are lots of ways to help the forces ofdarkness You can join them with all your heart but you can also succumb toprejudice or selfrighteousness or some apparently silly temptation AsHagrid the gruffbutloveable caretaker makes clear you can love the wrongkind of folks in his case dragons and monstrous spiders Or you can just bea vain goofball In each book the enemys helpers become increasinglyrefined            The series also has some of the excitement that Dickens readers must havefelt as they read his novels in serial form knowing he was home workingfrantically on the next installment Publishing the first books before sheswritten the later ones Rowling hunts out bits and pieces from earlier on andputs them to new uses The Whomping Willow for example which seems like a bitof inspired slapstick in Volume  has an important gesture to make in Volume furthering the plot One tiny character introduced in the first book swellsto chilling proportions at the end of the third Its like watching Rowlingrummage around for mice and rats to enchant into horses and coachmenAmazingly none of it seems artificial            I wonder how shes going to handle the Great Battle that comes with thegenre where Good meets Bad for something like a final showdown So far shesgiven us small if important skirmishes and sketched out a grand battle pastThe danger of series like this is that they can so easily collapse at the endbecoming too allegorically complex or too morally simple How do you thinkshell handle it            And do you think Percy Ron Weasleys perfect prefecthead boybig brotherwill play a villainous role in one of the next books I hope so
