        what well what kind of job do you have   well right now im just working um temporary just for a week or so at a uh communication center   uhhuh   and so basically i wear um i can wear casual dress or casual pants   oh okay   i dont really dress up a whole bunch but   is is that because youre a student or oh   no um im ive just been at home for a while and so im   oh okay okay   just   well im a student thats why i was asking and uh i um   oh  that   i havent been working this semester   uhhuh   so i dont really have uh  much to say about that but i do work in the hospitals once a week um i dont get   oh they have really strict clothing rules dont they   yeah i have i wear a uniform a nursing uniform   umhum   so i dont really have much choice   yeah i went to school with some nurses and the cost of those was kind of expensive i thought   yeah they they tend to be pretty expensive   they look like theyd last a while   um yeah they should uh unless you just buy a few and wear keep wearing those all the time   oh yeah thats what i do   and yeah and and people tend to use bleach on them because you know you want them to stay white and that kind of deteriorates it a little bit   uhhuh disinfectant yeah   but um  im hoping mine my one uniform will last me a long time until i have to start working more days   yeah   and theres not much of a selection at least in my price range like styles or things so   yeah they seem to all be all the uniforms even like in the fast food and everything i mean theyre the its just different colors it seems like   yeah   theyre all kind of alike   so um   i i used to work in a dentist office and there i had to dress up and   oh you did   yeah and i usually wore a dress most of the time or dress pants and   oh okay   that gets expensive  yeah   that sure does yeah were you a receptionist oh okay   uhhuh i mean sometimes i think its cheaper to stay home than because at home i just wear like joggers or Levis or you know whatever comfortable and i dont care what people think   yeah definitely uhhuh that sounds good   right also the shoes are expensive that   uhhuh and to find ones that are comfortable you really have to pay   yeah thats really tough before i went back to school i worked as a uh   yeah   what do you call it cant even remember its been so long  um office administrator or whatever it one of those titles     oh wow like an office manager like   uh sort of   uhhuh   and it was more a more of a casual uh atmosphere but i still wore dresses and things like that so i mean it was for a uh nonprofit organization   oh yeah   so   well you always try to look professional but its just   right   i dont know i always have a hard time between comfort and looking nice because when youre working all day sometimes you i dont know comfort seems to come first   yeah i agree i i really  i totally agree i have a friend that has a knack for looking really stylish but always comfortable   i uhhuh oh wow   yeah shes really good at doing that   because ive seen a lot of people that always look really hot but id never i could never make it through a day wearing what theyre wearing you know i was like how did you fit in that but and the high heels i i dont know i guess im just wacky   exactly umhum yeah yeah well she she you dont have to wear high heels to look good      thats true that is   yeah she never wore high shes an engineer and she never yeah she never wore high heels just   oh wow   flats and low low heels   and a longer skirt see thats what i like yeah   umhum more of a classic look yeah see that doesnt have to be uncomfortable   i think that looks nice it looks so much more natural   yeah but youre right i think those things tend to be more expensive   yeah well and quality because i dont know i try to find find things that   yeah   um even if im not working that i can wear or else that i know will last you know not just for this year itll be out of style or something and   uhhuh right   those usually cost a little bit but sometimes in the long run im sure theyre cheaper   yeah because um also you tend to those things dont go out of style so much and uh i find   yeah some of the fads   right yeah and since im a student i never buy fad clothes because i know theyll be out of style the next season and then i have to go buy more  so i just dont buy any     yeah i where i went to school though a lot at college a lot of them i mean i mean ive never been one to feel pressured into wearing styles just because everyone else is but i couldnt believe how some of the college people dress because you know i always think of low income i at least i was low income going to school you know and it was like   umhum   i know
