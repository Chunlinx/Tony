        why dont you go ahead and say what you feel and then ill respond   all right well im uh im very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling im afraid we um recently moved here from North Carolina and they had curbside recycling and it was very easy    put everything out there but we dont have it in at least in our neighborhood right now   yeah   and uh so ive been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where they belong   well how long have you been here   well weve been here since January  so we we still feel very new but i its working up to a year now so  i guess were oldtimers compared to some people   well yeah   yeah i think thats a good excuse you need to get into the  the system a little more and know where to take things   uh yeah   weve been here probably two and a half years and and we didnt recycle at all before we came so i think were doing well we weve saved most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now   uhhuh uhhuh where do you take those things   well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to WalMart they have um in behind WalMart they have bins   uhhuh   and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money   where do you do that because weve been saving cans for my daughters choir um but i didnt know where to take them     umhum um theres a place on Parker Road um its just over the overpass before you get like to KMart i think theres a a service station there theres usually a semi truck that has a a person there that will weigh them and   oh   now they arent worth much right now but  its better than nothing so and   yeah better than nothing right   what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully well be getting them in the month of October   yeah i it seems like ever since weve moved here weve been hearing that you know its coming in a couple of months but     yeah and  i think its been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for February but the trucks that were supposed to do it theres been some problems with   oh   from what ive read in you know the mail that we get and i cant wait for that that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the garage   right yeah yeah it gets to be a bit much before  haul it off but   i feel guilty we dont recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste   well they do yeah they theyre a lot of bulk anyway and yeah     yeah yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage pail so ill be glad when the bins do come and i think thats when ill ill start doing the plastic too   right yeah it was real easy with the bins it really was and it was it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage so um i   yeah ive gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and things like that its not that big of a deal i mean its nicer to just throw them out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two   right yeah yeah well how much do you earn on the cans i i didnt know how what kind of an idea to give her for   oh when we first were were here it was like wed take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full and itd be like two dollars   uhhuh yeah   but since last time weve gotten more like a dollar   so its gone down yeah   yeah which is understandable i think more people are are recycling but  thats something that we we dont really make any effort to   right yeah   and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans and that was kind of fun but we havent done that for a long time   uhhuh yeah   so   well that sounds like a pretty good project well   well the boys think its fun plus you get your exercise and you  you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest so but     oh  well ill ill have to kick myself and and get get on it my neighbor across the street um       is so careful about  recycling and so i   umhum   keep telling myself ill ill get it organized but maybe maybe theyll beat me and and do the city wide first and   well hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on so  all right well it sounds like were doing our part and at least starting so   right right i dont have any excuse then thats for sure thinking about it anyway yeah but  well um have you do they time this thing for us or do we   yeah trying  thats all you can do so that um yeah you can do it as long as you want they you know if its been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say say we dont have anymore room for recording so so we can say goodbye now it was good talking to you and maybe well get on line again  thanks Sherry byebye   you cant you cant chat all day huh  okay okay byebye
