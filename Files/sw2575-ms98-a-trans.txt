           well whats your views on it   i think its uh a good idea um i grew up uh my teenage years were spent during the sixties graduating uh high school in sixty eight um i remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about and i thought it was a very good idea at the time i was one of those uh Kennedy children if you know what i mean and uh   uhhuh   right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do   yeah   and theres a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and i think that weve got the the people power to do it its just uh we need   sure sure   to channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up um   yeah   some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carters been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people   uhhuh   and theres a lot of housing ah i know in the area that i live in thats run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and its just you know sitting there wasting away   yeah uhhuh yeah were not too far  behind i graduated in seventy one so im im same generation i im its going to be a short conversation because i agree with you i i think uh  i dont i dont even think it ought to be uh voluntary i think it ought to be mandatory       uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because im a im a hard ass or anything its just that   uhhuh   like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck theyre going to do and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus and i think that it might stop us some problems later on i mean you know you these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something uh its i think it would be good for them uh it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is   yeah i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions like what the worlds about   oh yeah   a lot of it has to do from too much TV   oh yeah yeah   and uh you know its theres theres a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is   uhhuh   uh i remember uh ive ive worked since i was well i started delivering papers when i was ten and i had a real job when i was thirteen so ive you know worked most of my life but i remember when i got out of high school all through high school was boy i cant wait to get out of high school i cant wait to get out of high school and i wanted to go to college and i had the grades to go to college and i got accepted to college but when i got out of high school i kind of said you know what am i going to do now you know its like   uhhuh   you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school i uh thought i was smart ran away and got married and uh i remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldnt i give to get be back in school   uhhuh   and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job because life and the reality of working for a living and trying to make ends meet is just so overwhelming to someone   yeah yeah   if they arent prepared for it   and and most of them arent i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right out i mean even in high school   thats true   and you know you you wonder where are the parents in all of this you know why isnt somebody stepping in and and stop putting a stop to this kids in high school are just too young to be married they have they have no idea what the world is like they dont how tough it is out there to make a living   yeah yeah a   uh i mean i was in the same boat when i left high school i my parents wanted me to go straight to college and i didnt you know i was ready i was ready i had wanderlust i wanted to get out and see some things so i joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years   um   um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things aint the way they seem   yeah   and i i did a lot of growing up there uh   yeah i think once once kids get out and see how other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good theyve got it   uhhuh yeah thats right   and what it takes to have that good life and if youre willing to work for it then theyre probably be more inclined to work for it   thats right uhhuh well you know its just like you say theres so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh like a uh uh a Peace Corps sort of organization i mean this would be so useful just in uh for instance just helping old folks   uhhuh exactly   you know they you know they need help they dont have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that and   you know ive ive so i my my parents are in their late sixties now and um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore   yeah   and its its really hard on them and the you know the thought that i i see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone   uh yeah   and uh you know you theres a uh a nice warm feeling i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger i mean i was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and   yeah yeah my moms in the same position late sixties and and it got to the got to the point where i mean me and my brother both were were gone and she couldnt maintain the house without large expenditures of money you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment   yeah   and uh i im not im not saying that that wouldnt have happened anyway but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and painting and stuff like that   yeah i think thered thered be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services   oh yeah sure sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel   yeah   you know you so uh people people just dont help people anymore theyre theyre out for themselves   yeah i think uh President Bush covered that in his uh State of the Union address this year when he said that you know its time for you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything   yeah well thats thats the thats the point weve gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government and you the governments going to be limited i where are they going to get the money theyre going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we dont need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program   yeah exactly   um the thing that Carter works on uh Habitat For Humanity i was involved in that was uh in Montgomery before i came up to North Carolina   uhhuh   and u h it was it was a pretty neat little program wed just go out and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders and everybody else would donate their their time       and uh the materials were at cost and wed put up houses and that was kind that was kind of neat i uh in a way i think its a little bit inefficient but but its better than nothing   yeah   and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just wont   yes   because its far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare   yes   so theres no incentive for them to do anything far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money      yeah one of the things they tried to push through in Maryland and uh werent very successful was that if you were an able bodied person on welfare   you had to do something   you had to do some work and   yeah and and and thats been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down   yeah   i dont and i dont understand the reasoning for it i really dont it it seems perfectly logical that if somebodys going to take public money then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage   thats exactly what they were trying to get them to do   yeah what do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners   um both   yeah that thats the way they did it in Alabama too   yeah they use both   usually usually youd see these big chain gangs out there  picking up trash   uh they have a they have another program in Maryland thats called AdoptAHighway      uhhuh uhhuh yeah we have that here in North Carolina
