financial audits Therefore thereliability of such data has become more and more importantHistorically computerprocessed data have been treated as uniqueevidence However these data are simply one form of evidencerelied on although they may require more technical assessment thanother forms of evidence In addition the very nature of theinformation system creating the data allows opportunities forerrors to be introduced by many peopleThis guidance is intended to demystify the assessment ofcomputerprocessed data It supplements GAOs Yellow BookGovernment Auditing Standards  Revision which defines thegenerally accepted government auditing standards GAGAS andreplaces the earlier GAO guidance Assessing the Reliability ofComputerProcessed Data GAOOP Sept For all types of evidence various tests are usedsufficiencycompetence and relevanceto assess whether the evidence standardis met You probably have been using these tests for years and havebecome quite proficient at them But because assessingcomputerprocessed data requires more technical tests it mayappear that such data are subject to a higher standard of testingthan other evidence That is not the case For example many of thesame tests of sufficiency and relevance are applied to other typesof evidence But in assessing computerprocessed data the focus ison one test in the evidence standardcompetencewhich includesvalidity and reliability Reliability in turn includes thecompleteness and accuracy of the dataThis guidance therefore provides a flexible riskbasedframework for data reliability assessments that can be geared tothe specific circumstances of each engagement The framework alsoprovides a structure for planning and reporting facilitatesbringing the right mix of skills to each engagement and ensurestimely management buyin on assessment strategies The framework isbuilt onmaking use of all existing information about thedataperforming at least a minimal level of datatestingdoing only the amount of work necessary to determinewhether the data are reliable enough for our purposesmaximizing professional judgment andbringing the appropriate people including management tothe table at key decision pointsThe ultimate goal of the data reliability assessment is todetermine whether you can use the data for your intended purposesThis guidance is designed to help you make an appropriatedefensible assessment in the most efficient manner With anyrelated questions call Barbara Johnson focal point for datareliability issues at   or Barry Seltser the ActingDirector of GAOs Center for Design Methods and Analysis at Nancy KingsburyManaging Director Applied Research and MethodsSection  IntroductionThis guidance explains what data reliability means and providesa framework for assessing the reliability of computerprocesseddata It begins with the steps in a preliminary assessment whichin many cases may be all you need to do to assess reliabilityThis guidance also helps you decide whether you should follow upthe preliminary assessment with additional work If so it explainsthe steps in a final assessment and the actions to take dependingon the results of your additional work The ultimate goal indetermining data reliability is to make the following decision Forour engagement can we use the data to answer the researchquestion See figure  for an overview of the factors that help toinform that decision Not all of these factors may be necessary forall engagementsFigure  Factors to Consider in Making the Decision on Usingthe DataSource GAOIn addition this guidance discusses suggestedlanguageappropriate under different circumstancesfor reportingthe results of your assessment Finally it provides detaileddescriptions of all the stages of the assessment as well as aglossary of technical terms used see p  An online version ofthis guidance which will include tools that may help you inassessing reliability is currently being developed The overallprocess is illustrated in figures  p  and  p Section  Understanding Data ReliabilityData reliability refers to the accuracy and completeness ofcomputerprocessed data given the intended purposes for useComputerprocessed data include data  entered into a computersystem and  resulting from computer processingComputerprocessed data can vary in formfrom electronic files totables in published reports The definition of computerprocesseddata is therefore broad In this guidance the term data alwaysrefers to computerprocessed dataThe Yellow Book requires that a data reliability assessment beperformed for all data used as support for engagement findingsconclusions or recommendations This guidance will help you todesign a data reliability assessment appropriate for the purposesof the engagement and then to evaluate the results of theassessmentData are reliable when they are  complete they contain allof the data elements and records needed for the engagement and accurate they reflect the data entered at the source or ifavailable in the source documents A subcategory of accuracy isconsistency Consistency refers to the need to obtain and use datathat are clear and welldefined enough to yield similar results insimilar analyses For example if data are entered at multiplesites inconsistent interpretation of data rules can lead to datathat taken as a whole are unreliable Reliability also means thatfor any computer processing of the data elements used the resultsare reasonably complete and accurate meet your intended purposesand are not subject to inappropriate alterationAssessments of reliability should be made in the broader contextof the particular characteristics of the engagement and the riskassociated with the possibility of using data of insufficientreliability Reliability does not mean that computerprocessed dataare errorfree Errors are considered acceptable under thesecircumstances You have assessed the associated risk and found theerrors are not significant enough to cause a reasonable personaware of the errors to doubt a finding conclusion orrecommendation based on the dataUS General Accounting Office Government Auditing Standards GAOOGCWashington DC June  ppA data element is a unit of information with definableparameters for example a Social Security number sometimesreferred to as a data variable or data fieldPage  GAOG Assessing ReliabilityWhile this guidance focuses only on the reliability of data interms of accuracy and completeness other data qualityconsiderations are just as important In particular you shouldalso consider the validity of data Validity as used here refersto whether the data actually represent what you think is beingmeasured For example if a data field is named annual evaluationscore is this an appropriate measure of a persons jobperformance Considerations of data validity and reliability issuesshould be addressed early in the engagement and appropriatetechnical specialistssuch as data analysts statisticians orinformation technology specialistsshould be consultedSection  Deciding If a Data Reliability Assessment IsNecessaryTo decide if a data reliability assessment is necessary youshould consider certain conditions The engagement type and planneduse of the data help to determine when you should assess datareliability See figure  for an illustration of the decisionprocess that you should useFigure  Decision Process for Determining If a Data ReliabilityAssessment Is RequiredSource GAOConditions Requiring a Data Reliability AssessmentYou should assess reliability if the data to be analyzed areintended to support the engagement findings conclusions orrecommendations Keep in mind that a finding may include only adescription of the condition as in a purely descriptive report Inthe audit plan for the engagement you should include a briefdiscussion of how you plan to assess data reliability as well asany limitations that may exist due to shortcomings in the dataConditions Not Requiring a Data Reliability AssessmentYou do not need to assess reliability if the data are used only as background information or  in documents withoutfindings conclusions or recommendations Background informationgenerally sets the stage for reporting the results of an engagementor provides information that puts the results in proper contextSuch information could be the size of the program or activity youare reviewing for example When you gather background or otherdata ensure that they are from the best available sources Whenyou present the data cite the sources and state that the datawere not assessedSometimes as a best practice however you may want to do someassessment of background data Your judgment of the datasimportance and the reliability of the source as well as otherengagement factors can help you determine the extent of such anassessmentFinally for financial audits and information system reviewsyou should not follow this guidance in assessing data reliabilityFor financial audits which include financial statement andfinancialrelated audits you should follow the GAOPCIE FinancialAudit Manual FAM and the Federal Information System ControlsAudit Manual FISCAM In an information system review allcontrols in a computer system for the full range of applicationfunctions and products are assessed and tested Such a reviewincludes  examining the general and application controls of acomputer system  testing whether those controls are beingcomplied with and testing data produced by the system To design such areview appropriate to the research question seek assistance frominformation technology specialistsGeneral controls refers to the structure policies andprocedureswhich apply to all or a large segment of anorganizations information systemsthat help to ensure properoperation data integrity and security Application controlsrefers to the structure policies and procedures that apply toindividual application systems such as inventory or payrollGuidance for carrying out reviews of general and applicationcontrols is provided in theUS General Accounting Office Federal Information SystemControls Audit Manual GAOAIMDWashington DC Jan Section  Performing a Data Reliability AssessmentTiming the AssessmentTo perform a data reliability assessment you need to decide onthe timingwhen to perform the assessmentand how to documentitA data reliability assessment should be performed as early aspossible in the engagement process preferably during the designphase The audit plan should reflect data reliability issues andany additional steps that still need to be performed to assess thereliability of critical data The engagement team generally shouldnot finalize the audit plan or issue a commitment letter until ithas done initial testing and reviewed existing information aboutthe data and the system that produces the data In addition theteam should not commit to making conclusions or recommendationsbased on the data unless the team expects to be satisfied with thedata reliabilityDocumenting the AssessmentAll work performed as part of the data reliability assessmentshould be documented and included in the engagement workpapersThis includes all testing information review and interviewsrelated to data reliability In addition decisions made during theassessment including the final assessment of whether the data aresufficiently reliable for the purposes of the engagement should besummarized and included with the workpapers These workpapersshould be  clear about what steps the team took and whatconclusions they reached and  reviewed by staff with appropriateskills or if needed technical specialistsSection  Viewing the Entire Assessment ProcessThe ultimate goal of the data reliability assessment is todetermine whether you can use the data to answer the researchquestion The assessment should be performed only for thoseportions of the data that are relevant to the engagement Theextensiveness of the assessment is driven bythe expected significance of the data to the finalreportthe anticipated risk level of using the dataandthe strength or weakness of any corroboratingevidenceTherefore the specific assessment process should take intoaccount these factors along with what is learned during the initialstage of the assessment The process is likely to be different foreach engagementThe overall framework of the process for data reliabilityassessment is shown in figure  The framework identifies severalkey stages in the assessment as well as actions and decisionsexpected as you move through the process The framework allows youto identify the appropriate mix of assessment steps to fit theparticular needs of your engagement In most cases all of theelements in figure  would not be necessary in completing theassessment Specific actions for each stage are discussed insections Figure  Data Reliability Assessment ProcessSource GAOSection  Taking the First StepsReviewing Existing InformationThe data reliability process begins with two relatively simplesteps These steps provide the basis for making a preliminaryassessment of data reliability  a review of related informationand  initial testing see figure  In some situations you mayhave an extremely short time frame for the engagement this sectionalso provides some advice for this situationThe time required to review related information and performinitial testing will vary depending on the engagement and theamount of risk involved As discussed in section  these stepsshould take place early in the engagement and include the teammembers as well as appropriate technical staffFigure  The First Steps of the AssessmentSource GAOThe first stepa review of existing informationhelps you todetermine what is already known about the data and the computerprocessing The related information you collect can indicate boththe accuracy and completeness of the entry and processing of thedata as well as how data integrity is maintained This informationcan be in the form of reports studies or interviews withindividuals who are knowledgeable about the data and the systemSources for related information include GAO the agency underreview and othersGAO GAO may already have related information in reports Thosefrom fiscal year  to the present are available via GAOsInternet site This site also provides other useful informationfor example as part of the annual governmentwide consolidatedfinancial audit GAOs Information Technology Team is involved withreporting on the effectiveness of controls for financialinformation systems at  major federal agenciesAgency under ReviewOfficials of the agency or entity under review are aware ofevaluations of their computer data or systems and usually candirect you to both However keep in mind that information fromagency officials may be biased Consider asking appropriatetechnical specialists to help in evaluating this informationAgency information includes Inspector General reports FederalManagers Financial Integrity Act reports Government Performanceand Results Act GPRA plans and reports ClingerCohen Actreports and Chief Information Officer reports Some of thisinformation can be found in agency homepages on the WebOthers Other organizations and users of the data may be sourcesof relevant information To help you identify these sources youcan use a variety of databases and other research tools whichinclude the Congressional Research Service Public Policy LiteratureAbstracts and organizations Web sitesPerforming Initial TestingThe second stepinitial testingcan be done by applying logicaltests to electronic data files or hard copy reports For electronicdata you use computer programs to test all entries of key dataelements in the entire data file Keep in mind that you only testthose data elements you plan to use for the engagement You willfind that testing with computer programs often takes less than aday depending on the complexity of the file For Though an indepth discussion of qualityassurance practicesto be used in electronic testing and analyses is beyond the scopeof this guidance it is important to perform appropriate checks toensure that you have obtained the correct file All too oftenanalysts receive an incorrect file an early version or anincomplete file Appropriate steps would include counting recordsand comparing totals with the responsible agency or entityPage  GAOG Assessing ReliabilityDealing with Short Time Frameshard copy or summarized dataprovided by the audited entity orretrieved from the Internetyou can ask for the electronic datafile used to create the hard copy or summarized data If you areunable to obtain electronic data use the hard copy or summarizeddata and to the extent possible manually apply the tests to allinstances of key data elements or if the report or summary isvoluminous to a sample of themWhether you have an electronic data file or a hard copy reportor summary you apply the same types of tests to the data Thesecan include testing formissing data either entire records or values of key dataelementsthe relationship of one data element toanothervalues outside of a designated range anddates outside valid time frames or in an illogicalprogressionBe sure to keep a log of your testing for inclusion in theengagement workpapersIn some instances the engagement may have a time frame that istoo short for a complete preliminary assessment for example arequest for testimony in  weeks However given that allengagements are a function of time as well as scope and resourceslimitations in one require balancing the othersDespite a short time frame you may have time to review existinginformation and carry out testing of data that are critical foranswering a research question for example You can questionknowledgeable agency staff about data reliability or reviewexisting GAO or Inspector General reports to quickly gatherinformation about data reliability issues In addition electronictesting of critical data elements for obvious errors ofcompleteness and accuracy can generally be done in a short periodof time on all but the most complicated or immense files From thatreview and testing you will be able to make a more informeddetermination about whether the data are sufficiently reliable touse for the purposes of the engagement See sections  and  forthe actions to take depending on your determinationSection  Making the Preliminary AssessmentFactors to Consider in the AssessmentThe preliminary assessment is the first decision point in theassessment process including the consideration of multiplefactors a determination of the sufficiency of the data reliabilitywith what is known at this point and a decision about whetherfurther work is required You will decide whether the data aresufficiently reliable for the purposes of the engagement notsufficiently reliable or as yet undetermined Keep in mind thatyou are not attesting to the overall reliability of the data ordatabase You are only determining the reliability of the data asneeded to support the findings conclusions or recommendations ofthe engagement As you gather information and make your judgmentsconsult appropriate technical specialists for assistanceTo make the preliminary assessment of the sufficiency of thedata reliability for the engagement you should consider allfactors related to aspects of the engagement as well as assessmentwork performed to this point As shown in figure  these factorsincludethe expected significance of the data in the finalreportcorroborating evidencelevel of risk andthe results of initial assessment workFigure  The Preliminary AssessmentSource GAOExpected Significance of In making the preliminary assessmentconsider the data in the context of the final report Will theengagement team depend on the data alone tothe Data in the Final Reportanswer a research question Will the data be summarized or willdetailed information be required Is it important to have precisedata making magnitude of errors an issueCorroborating Evidence You should consider the extent to whichcorroborating evidence is likely to exist and will independentlysupport your findings conclusions or recommendationsCorroborating evidence is independent evidence that supportsinformation in the database Such evidence if available can befound in the form of alternative databases or expert views It isunique to each engagement and itsstrengthpersuasivenessvariesFor help in deciding the strength or weakness of corroboratingevidence consider the extent to which the corroboratingevidenceis consistent with the Yellow Book standards ofevidencesufficiency competence and relevanceprovides crucial supportLevel of Riskis drawn from different types of sourcestestimonialdocumentary physical or analytical andis independent of other sourcesRisk is the likelihood that using data of questionablereliability could have significant negative consequences on thedecisions of policymakers and others To do a risk assessmentconsider the following risk conditionsThe data could be used to influence legislation policyor a program that could have significant impactThe data could be used for significant decisions byindividuals or organizations with an interest in thesubjectThe data will be the basis for numbers that are likely tobe widely quoted for example In  the United States owed theUnited Nations about  billion for the regular and peacekeepingbudgetsThe engagement is concerned with a sensitive orcontroversial subjectThe engagement has external stakeholders who have takenpositions on the subjectThe overall engagement risk is medium or highThe engagement has unique factors that strongly increaseriskBear in mind that any one of the conditions may have moreimportance than another depending on the engagementResults of Initial Assessment WorkAt this point as shown in figure  p  the team willalready have performed the initial stage of the data reliabilityassessment They should have the results from the  review of allavailable existing information about the data and the system thatproduced them and  initial testing of the critical dataelements These results should be appropriately documented andreviewed before the team enters into the decisionmaking phase ofthe preliminary assessment Because the results will in whole orin part provide the evidence that the data are sufficientlyreliableand therefore competent enoughor not sufficientlyreliable for the purposesOutcomes to Consider in the Assessmentof the engagement the workpapers should include documentationof the process and resultsThe results of your combined judgments of the strength ofcorroborating evidence and degree of risk suggest differentassessments If the corroborating evidence is strong and the riskis low the data are more likely to be considered sufficientlyreliable for your purposes If the corroborating evidence is weakand the risk is high the data are more likely to be considered notsufficiently reliable for your purposes The overall assessment isa judgment call which should be made in the context of discussionwith team management and technical specialistsThe preliminary assessment categorizes the data as sufficientlyreliable not sufficiently reliable or of undeterminedreliability Each category has implications for the next steps ofthe data reliability assessmentWhen to Assess Data as Sufficiently Reliable for EngagementPurposesYou can assess the data as sufficiently reliable for engagementpurposes when you conclude the following Both the review ofrelated information and the initial testing provide assurance that the likelihood of significant errors or incompleteness isminimal and  the use of the data would not lead to an incorrector unintentional message You could have some problems oruncertainties about the data but they would be minor given theresearch question and intended use of the data When thepreliminary assessment indicates that the data are sufficientlyreliable use the dataWhen to Assess Data as Not Sufficiently Reliable for EngagementPurposesYou can assess the data as not sufficiently reliable forengagement purposes when you conclude the following The review ofrelated information or initial testing indicates that significant errors or incompleteness exist in some or all of thekey data elements and  using the data would probably lead to anincorrect or unintentional messageWhen the preliminary assessment indicates that the data are notsufficiently reliable you should seek evidence from other sourcesincluding  alternative computerized datathe reliability ofwhich you should also assessor  original data in the form ofsurveys case studies or expert interviewsWhen to Assess Data as of Undetermined Reliability and ConsiderAdditional WorkYou should coordinate with the requester if seeking evidencefrom other sources does not result in a source of sufficientlyreliable data Inform the requester that such data needed torespond to the request are unavailable Reach an agreement withthe requester toredefine the research questions to eliminate the need touse the dataend the engagement oruse the data with appropriate disclaimersRemember that younot the requesterare responsible for decidingwhat data to use If you decide you must use data that you havedetermined are not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of theengagement make the limitations of the data clear so thatincorrect or unintentional conclusions will not be drawn Finallygiven that the data you assessed have serious reliabilityweaknesses you should include this finding in the report andrecommend that the agency take corrective actionYou can assess the data as of undetermined reliability when youconclude one of the followingThe review of some of the related information or initialtesting raises questions about the datas reliabilityThe related information or initial testing provides toolittle information to judge reliabilityThe time or resource constraints limit the extent of theexamination of related information or initial testingWhen the preliminary assessment indicates that the reliabilityof the data is undetermined consider doing additional work todetermine reliability Section  provides guidance on the types ofadditional work to consider as well as suggestions if noadditional work is feasibleSection  Conducting Additional WorkWhen you have determined through the preliminary assessmentthat the data are of undetermined reliability consider conductingadditional work see figure  A range of additional steps tofurther determine data reliability includes tracing to and fromsource documents using advanced electronic testing and reviewingselected system controls The mix depends on what weaknesses youidentified in the preliminary assessment and the circumstancesspecific to your engagement such as risk level and corroboratingevidence as well as other factors Focus particularly on thoseaspects of the data that pose the greatest potential risk for yourengagement You should get help from appropriate technicalspecialists to discuss whether additional work is required and tocarry out any part of the additional reliability assessmentFigure  Choosing and Conducting Additional WorkSource GAOTracing to and from Source DocumentsTracing a sample of data records to source documents helps youto determine whether the computer data accurately and completelyreflect these documents In deciding what and how to traceconsider the relative risks to the engagement of overstating orunderstating the conclusions drawn from the data for example Onthe one hand if you are particularly concerned that questionablecases might not have been entered into the computer system and thatas a result the degree of compliance may be overstated you shouldconsider tracing from source documents to the database On theother hand if you are more concerned that ineligible cases havebeen included in the database and that as a result the potentialproblems may be understated you should consider tracing from thedatabase back to source documentsThe reason to trace only a sample is because sampling saves timeand cost To be useful however the sample should be random andlarge enough to estimate the error rate within reasonable levels ofprecision Tracing a random sample will provide the error rate andthe magnitude of errors for the entire data file It is this errorrate that helps you to determine the data reliability Generallyevery data file will have some degree of error see example  forerror rate and example  for magnitude of errors Consultstatisticians to assist you in selecting the sampling method mostsuited to the engagementExample  According to a random sample  percent of the datarecords have incorrect dates However the dates may be off by anaverage of only  days Depending on what the data are used for days may not compromise reliabilityExample  The value of a data element was incorrectly enteredas  rather than  The documentation of thedatabase shows that the acceptable range for this data element isbetween  and  Therefore the electronic testing donein the initial testing phase would have confirmed that the value of fell within that range In this case the error could becaught not by electronic testing but only by tracing the data tosource documentsTracing to Source DocumentsConsider tracing to source documents when  the sourcedocuments are available relatively easily or  the possiblemagnitude of errors is especially criticalTo trace a sample to source documents match the entered datawith the corresponding data in the source documents But inattempting to trace entered data back to source documents severalproblems can arise Source documents may not be available becausethey were destroyed were never created or are not centrallylocatedSeveral options exist if source documents are not available Forthose documents never createdfor example when data may be basedon electronic submissionsuse interviews to obtain relatedinformation any corroborating evidence obtained earlier or areview of the adequacy of system controlsTracing from Source DocumentsConsider tracing from source documents instead of or inaddition to tracing a sample to source documents when you haveconcerns that the data are not complete To trace a sample fromsource documents match the source documents with the entered dataSuch tracing may be appropriate to determine whether all data arecompletely entered However if source documents were never createdor are now missing you cannot identify the missing dataUsing Advanced Electronic TestingAdvanced electronic testing goes beyond the basic electronictesting that you did in initial testing see section  Itgenerally requires specialized computer programs to test forspecific conditions in the data Such testing can be particularlyhelpful in determining the accuracy and completeness of processingby the application system that produced the data Consider usingadvanced electronic testing for following up on troubling aspects of the datasuch asextremely high values associated with a certain geographiclocationfound in initial testing or while analyzing the dataReviewing Selected System Controlstesting relationshipscrosstabulationbetween dataelements such as whether data elements follow a skip pattern froma questionnaire andverifying that computer processing is accurate andcomplete such as testing a formula used in generating specificdata elementsDepending on what will be tested this testing can require arange of programming skillsfrom creating crosstabulations onrelated data elements to duplicating an intricate automated processwith more advanced programming techniques Consult appropriatetechnical specialists as neededYour review of selected system controlsthe underlyingstructures and processes of the computer in which the data aremaintainedcan provide some assurance that the data aresufficiently reliable Examples of system controls are limits onaccess to the system and edit checks on data entered into thesystem Controls can reduce to an acceptable level the risk thata significant mistake could occur and remain undetected anduncorrected Limit the review to evaluating the specific controlsthat can most directly affect the reliability of the data inquestion Choose areas for review on the basis of what is knownabout the system Sometimes you identify potential system controlproblems in the initial steps of the assessment Other times youlearn during the preliminary assessment that source documents arenot readily available Therefore a review of selected systemcontrols is the best method to determine if data were enteredreliably If needed consult information system auditors for helpin evaluating general and application controlsUsing what you know about the system concentrate on evaluatingthe controls that most directly affect the data These controlswill usually include  certain general controls such as logicalaccess and control of changes to the data and  the applicationcontrols that help to ensure that the data are accurate andcomplete as well as authorizedThe steps for reviewing selected system controls aregain a detailed understanding of the system as it relatesto the data andidentify and assess the application and general controlsthat are critical to ensuring the reliability of the data requiredfor the engagementIn some situations it may not be feasible to perform anyadditional workUsing Data offor example when  given a shorttime frame too short for a complete assessment  originalcomputer files have been deleted or  access to Reliabilityneeded documents is unavailable See section  for how toproceedSection  Making the Final AssessmentDuring the final assessment you should consider the results ofall your previous work to determine whether for your intended usethe data are sufficiently reliable not sufficiently reliable orstill undetermined Again remember that you are not attesting tothe reliability of the data or database You are only determiningthe sufficiency of the reliability of the data for your intendeduse The final assessment will help you decide what actions to takesee figure Figure  Making the Final AssessmentSource GAOThe following are some considerations to help you decide whetheryou can use the dataThe corroborating evidence is strongThe degree of risk is lowThe results of additional assessment  answered issuesraised in the preliminary assessment and  did not raise any newquestionsThe error rate in tracing to or from source documentsdid not compromise reliabilityIn making this assessment you should consult with appropriatetechnical specialistsYou can consider the data sufficiently reliable when youconclude the following On the basis of the additional work aswell as the initial assessment work using the data would notweaken the analysis nor lead to an incorrect or unintentionalmessage You could have some problems or uncertainties about thedata but they would be minor given the research question andintended use of the data When your final assessment indicates thatthe data are reliable use the dataSufficiently Reliable DataNot Sufficiently Reliable DataYou can consider the data to be not sufficiently reliable whenyou conclude the following On the basis of information drawn fromthe additional assessment as well as the preliminary assessment using the data would most likely lead to an incorrect orunintentional message and  the data have significant orpotentially significant limitations given the research questionand intended use of the dataWhen you determine that the data are not sufficiently reliableyou should inform the requester that sufficiently reliable dataneeded to respond to the request are unavailable Remember thatyounot the requesterare responsible for deciding what data touse Although the requester may want information based oninsufficiently reliable data you are responsible for ensuring thatdata are used appropriately to respond to the requester If youdecide to use the data for the report make the limitations of thedata clear so that incorrect or unintentional conclusions will notbe arrived at Appropriate team management should be consultedbefore you agree to use data that are not sufficientlyreliableFinally given that the data you assessed have seriousreliability weaknesses you should include this finding in thereport and recommend that the agency take corrective actionData of Undetermined ReliabilityYou can consider the data to be of undetermined reliability whenyou conclude the following On the basis of the information drawnfrom any additional work as well as the preliminary assessment use of the data could lead to a incorrect or unintentionalmessage and  the data have significant or potentiallysignificant limitations given the research question and theintended use You can consider the data to be of undeterminedreliability if specific factorssuch as short time frames thedeletion of original computer files and the lack of access toneeded documentsare present If you decide to use the data makethe limitations of the data clear so that incorrect orunintentional conclusions will not be arrived atAs noted above in the case of not sufficiently reliable datawhen you determine that the data are of undetermined reliabilityyou should inform the requesterif appropriatethat sufficientlyreliable data needed to respond to the request are unavailableRemember that younot the requesterare responsible for decidingwhat data to use Although the requester may want information basedon data of undetermined reliability you are responsible forensuring that appropriate data are used to respond to therequester If you decide to use the data in your report make thelimitations clear so that incorrect or unintentional conclusionswill not be arrived at Appropriate team management should beconsulted before you agree to use data of undeterminedreliabilitySection  Including Appropriate Language in the ReportSufficiently Reliable DataIn the report you should include a statement in the methodologysection about conformance to generally accepted government auditingstandards GAGAS These standards refer to how you did your worknot how reliable the data are Therefore you are conforming toGAGAS as long as in reporting you discuss what you did to assessthe data disclose any data concerns and reach a judgment aboutthe reliability of the data for use in the reportFurthermore in the methodology section include a discussion ofyour assessment of data reliability and the basis for thisassessment The language in this discussion will vary depending onwhether the data are sufficiently
