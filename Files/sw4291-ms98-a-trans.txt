              okay well   yep   i guess if i was going to advise a parent on um well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing id be interested in is whats the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that theyd want to be interested in you know courses that theyd want to be taking um   umhum   and then the second thing id probably look at is uh what they can afford   umhum   you know in terms of you know how much money do they have or does the child have to pay are there any scholarships or anything that they could uh manage either you know through maybe an open system or maybe from a school itself   umhum   and then kind of go from there you know thats kind of where id start   yeah thats thats uh those are some good thoughts i i found for myself that to start off at a junior college in your local community and find   umhum   that way what you do is that you find what topics youre interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh a say   umhum   a student out of high school they might think that they have some interests but they havent explored everything so they dont really know   umhum   so if they go to a junior college and and start taking some general education classes and things if they look through the catalog and think they find things that theyre interested in   umhum yeah   well then they can they really they can really find what theyre interests are and then it plus its also a lot more more inexpensive to do it that way   yeah yeah thats true   and be and then then then they can choose a college and then they can they can transfer yeah i guess uh the location is um is something you know its uh whether they want to be close to their family or whether you know uh farther away or something   umhum umhum i think those are good points i think one thing i might i might differ with or or maybe we would agree on this is that uh i think theres some i think there some kids who who probably dont really know what they want to take   right right   you they dont have any work experience or whatever maybe theyve taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give is is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are student there are students out there who know what they want to take   umhum umhum   and uh i might advise them to jump right in and and find you know a good school that they you know that has good standing uh in that area you know has a good faculty has a good reputation   oh sure   uh thats what i did   sure   i knew what i wanted and i was i was i was exactly almost exactly right   yeah yeah it just that just helps the decision process when you know whats available because when youre when youre a a kid in school high school and stuff like this is it youre only cognizant of sort of your immediate area environment and surroundings so you just dont know whats there you might just you know like go oh wow thats neat you know   umhum umhum   but another another thing and this is i think is really important is that the college hype okay   umhum   and they send this they send these brochures and uh pamphlets and stuff to the the students and you know send us this money and were going to give you these services and things like that   umhum yeah   that isnt so they theyre theyre theyre two horses of of three different colors and i had an experience uh i had to i stayed in the dormitory     umhum umhum   and i they forced you to have a mean plan okay and so you were forced to go to the dining room and   umhum   the food was terrible you were you were treated like a second rate human being and the dormitory was hinged on a Nazi concentration camp   umhum okay   and you just you just really didnt have any you know any rights and you just just its just really structure like that and so one of my main suggestions would be to   umhum   for the parents to go to the college and just spend some time and talk to people if they want to send their student to the dorm well go to the talk to some people in there you know talk to the people and get the true information because as i said its it theyre just thats just two different things   yeah umhum yeah i knew uh i i think thats a good idea and in general i think its a good idea to to go to the school i mean once once youve narrowed down   right   two or to to two or three or whatever number you know go visit the school school you know both the parents and and the student   right alright but dont fall for the you know the the student the school tour and and all the hype dont fall for it because thats thats not because once you get in there sometimes you you make these commitments and youre not able to change them you know commitments so   yeah umhum yeah i mean and thats the thing you have to sit down and look at the uh at the individual needs you know ive you know there there some there some students who even as freshmen would be ready to go live in an apartment and and start cooking there own meals and everything but there some who wouldnt be   oh exactly exactly   i had a very good experience i was in the dorms for three or four out of my four years   uhhuh   and uh i had a really good dorm experience
