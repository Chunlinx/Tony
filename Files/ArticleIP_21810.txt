                                  The Agony of Victory            Online auctions are theInternet flavor of the moment The bestknown auction site eBay went publicin September  at  and shot up to  by the end of its first day Itsnow at about  which means that investors value the company at around billion despite only  million in sales over the last  months Traditionalbusinesses want in on online auctions as well You have until March  for instance to bid on the pink satin eye mask Faye Dunaway wore in MommieDearest current high bid  at Universalstudioscom            A technology that allowsyou to bid on a  Chteau LafiteRothschild Winecom  without leavingyour study is impressive But it cannot repeal the laws of economics One suchlaw is dubbed the winners curse and holds that the winner of an auctionalmost always overpays As an understanding of this law makes clear onlineauctions make the winners curse even worse            Auctions are often thought of as models of economicefficiency uniting buyers and sellers at just the right price to maximizetheir mutual satisfaction put resources to their highest and best use and soon But three petroleum engineers writing in the Journal of PetroleumTechnology explained in  why this is not the case            Suppose several petroleumfirms are bidding on the drilling rights to a piece of tundra No firm is surehow much oil is underneath the property so they hire a team of engineers topoke at the surface rocks and make a guess The guesses will likely range fromtoo low to too high Some firms engineer will probably guess right but thatfirm wont win the auction The winner will be the firm whose engineer was themost overoptimistic The winning firm wont ultimately get as much oil as theirengineers promised meaning the firm paid too much In short the auctionwinner is ultimately a loser            This is a particularly clear example because the thingbeing auctioned will have a definite value in the future that is unknowable atpresent But the winners curse afflicts auction bidders whenever there isuncertainty over the current or eventual value of the item on the block Thisis true even when bidders have no intention of reselling the item and when itsinnate value seems inherently subjective            For example bidders forFaye Dunaways pink eye mask must make some judgment on how much they careabout Faye Dunaway If that were all the winner would likely be the person whocared the most That would be economically efficient in two senses  theutility of Dunaways eye mask would be maximized by placing it with the personwho can extract the greatest pleasure from it just as uncertainty aside thehighest bidder for an oil field will be the person who can extract the most oilfrom it and  that person would pay no more for the eye mask than thepleasure of owning it was worth to him            But the course of love is as uncertain as the petroleumcontent of a pile of rocks Bidders must also try to guess how much theyllcare for Faye Dunaway in say  years The more you overestimate your undyingaffection the more likely you are to win the auctionand the more likely youare to feel like an idiot in             Economists have pointedout that if bidders were truly rational theyd simply reduce their bids tocorrect for the winners curse There is even a mathematical proof that aperfectly rational actor can avoid the curse But experimental evidencesuggests that even experienced bidders dont reduce their bids by enough Forinstance a study of oil field auctions shows that even seasoned firmstypically pay far too much for drilling rights given the amount of oil theyeventually recover The same phenomenon has been observed when corporatetakeover wizards bid on other companiesthe winner often overpays In otherwords oil firms and corporate takeover specialists keep on getting burned inauctions but persist in bidding too high They simply dont learn            Irritatingly a rational person who understands thewinners curse cant do anything about it so long as the other bidders continueto bid irrationally If you bid rationally lower you wont win any auctionsif you bid what it takes to win auctions higher youll lose money because ofthe winners curse Economist Richard Thaler wickedly suggests a solutionExplain the theory to your competitors He posits that this is exactly why thethree oil engineers published their article explaining the curse in  Theirhope was to induce other firms to reduce their bids If so it didnt worksince oil firms continue to overpay            Online auctions worsenthe winners curse by increasing the number of bidders The craziest poorsucker in a group of  bidders on the Internet is likely to be crazierthan the craziest one among  in a Burbank hotel ballroom Thats anotherthing that experimental economists have confirmedthe larger the group thebigger the winners curse Theres no satisfactory way to buy rare or one of akind items but online auctions are a particularly bad method            On the other hand if buyers at online auctions arepersistently disappointed its possible that after a while theyll stopbidding Its also possible that experience will lead them to approximaterationality and theyll reduce their bids Either way sellers would findtheir inflated profits eroded But auctions have survived the winners cursefor millenniums and even the Internet is unlikely to change that            To be sure not all auctions are ripoffs Rememberthere is no danger of the winners curse if you are sure about the valueof an item to you  In that situation the auction device serves itsproper purpose of putting the item in the hands of whoever values it the mostFor instance suppose you are buying a Beanie Baby for your little brother or adiscounted airline ticket to Cabo San Lucas Most folks have a pretty clearidea of how much pleasure theyll get from their brothers smiles or a few daysof sand and surf And sane consumers wont bid more than these respectivepleasures are worth to themmeaning that they cant feel cheated            The winners curse also doesnt apply when there aremany identical items being auctioned off In those cases where there is enoughquantity available to satisfy most bidders the going price will be set by thesensible middle of the pack rather than by the most overoptimistic extremistThe leading example of such an auction is the stock market So the winnerscurse cant explain the extravagant price of shares in eBay itself Unless ofcourse when it comes to Internet shares there is no sensible middle Ifeveryones gone crazy economic theory isnt much help
