                                 The Chinese Chance            On a gray Beijing afternoonin May I found myself back at Nantang Church an otherwise nondescriptbuilding that rests on ground given to a Jesuit missionary by the emperor fourcenturies back In the courtyard outside I bumped into several parishionersall politely curious about where I was from and what I thought of China            Ordinarystuff in most places Yet for most Chinese ordinary is a huge stepforward At the first Mass I attended in this very church almost a decade agothe Chinese who made up most of the congregation kept their distance fromforeign Catholics such as myself This time was quite different and AmericanChristian leaders calling for restrictions on trade with China would do well tokeep in mind that the greater freedomor at least the lower levels ofapprehensionwith which many Chinese Christians now practice their faith owesitself in large measure to Chinas economic opening to the world            This is not to say that Beijing now respects freedom ofreligion But when American critics declare that things are getting worse itprompts the great unasked question Compared with what With what China was  or  years ago With what we are likely to get even in the best ofcircumstances today Or with some romantic abstraction about what we would likeChina to be Also see Christians as Victims Part  Franklin FoersCrossPurposesThe spurious campaign against the persecution of Christians            Viewedfrom Asia much criticism now leveled by American Christian activists seemsless a snapshot of China in the late s than a caricature drawn from thehigh days of Maoism a generation ago Perhaps thats because few of thesecritics have taken the trouble to spend muchor even anytime there or toconsult with their fellow Christians in Taiwan and Hong Kong who are activelyexploiting opportunities in China One notable exception is Nina Shea of thePuebla Institute whose wider experience may explain why her recent article inCrisis magazine at least acknowledges that many friends in Taiwan andHong Kong and many Chinese dissident intellectuals argue against tying Chinesetrade to human rights            At the heart of the problem there exists asimple impatience for the longterm giveandtake any real China policydemands The immoderate language employed moreover is often both intolerantof those who would achieve human rights by other means and out of touch withcurrent realities For example an open letter to Vice President Al Gore on theeve of his  visit to Chinasigned by former Pennsylvania Gov RobertCasey Christian right activist Ralph Reed and the Rev Richard JohnNeuhausclaimed that the campaign against men and women of faith has beenintensifying rather than diminishing The Family Research Councils GaryBauer another signatory claimed in the Weekly Standard that humanrights are being sold out in order to sell a few more Big Macs            For thoseof us who have seen firsthand the dramatic improvement in the lives of ordinaryChinese that opening the market has brought this agitation against Americansdoing business in China is baffling Indeed for unregenerate antiCommunistssuch as me it is the height of irony to now find ourselves attacked as beingproChina Nor do I speak as a Rockefeller Republican My family has helpedbuild two churches in China my daughter is from Yangzhou and I doubt thatanyone has devoted more editorial space to Chinas repellent onechildpolicy            Undeniably China remains a nasty place for manyChristians who in many parts of the country risk harassment and detentionsimply for practicing their faith And their coreligionists abroad should beencouraged to continue to document and publicize these abuses such as theransacking of the home of Bishop Joseph Fan Zhongliang of Shanghai just beforeEaster But as one missionary who has been building churches in China for twodecades put it to me Almost everything that is said about the church in Chinais true for some part of China But it no longer comes from the centerBeijing            Friends inthe United States to whom I mention this have little patience for such finedistinctions But in China they can make a world of difference Just lastmonth Seth Faison reported in the New York Times how economic growth isfast eroding the governments control over peoples daily lives in this casewith respect to the onechild program The new mobility of labor means thegovernment simply cannot exert the control it could when everyone stayed putand depended on the work unit for everything At an even more basic level asFaison pointed out more and more Chinese women are now able to escapeoncemandatory abortions by simply paying a fine As anyone involved in Chinawill tell you you can do a lot more than the rules suggest as long as youdont rub the authorities noses in it How many Catholics who signed theletter to Gore know for example that some twothirds of thegovernmentappointed Catholic bishops have been reconciled with Rome            This kind of progress is messy but it is realand palpable Surely it is no coincidence that the countries most cut off fromtrade and business and embargoed by the United States have been among themost miserable for Christians and human rights Cuba North Korea Vietnam Itis a slow process but daily China looks more and more like Taiwan or SouthKorea in the s Ask Chinese Christians what they want from the UnitedStates and they will not talk about linking trade with human rights It ismore likely they will talk about help in building churches and developingstronger links with their coreligionists overseas            Whatmatters most for Chinas struggling Christians is not where religious freedomranks on some abstract scale of good and bad What matters is how to make a badsituation better how to widen the cracks in the Communist concrete Instead ofwalking away from China American Christians should be rushing in
