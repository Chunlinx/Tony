                                 Stolen Dream            Its a common debatingtactic to assert that some respected figure of the past would endorse yourposition on some controversy of the present There is little doubt that theoriginals would find the views attributed to them surprising sometimes AbrahamLincoln for example has been claimed as a forbear by everyone from Communiststo Dixiecrats Lately opponents of affirmative action have donned the mantleof the civilrights movement claiming direct descent from Martin Luther KingJr The idea presumably is to insulate themselves against charges of racismeven as they pursue policies certain to prove detrimental to large numbers ofblacks            Toachieve this feat they define King as a champion of colorblind laws andreduce the civilrights movement to an effort to end the classification ofcitizens by race In this way programs that take race into account can bedemonized as violations of Kings memory Proponents of the ingeniously namedCalifornia Civil Rights Initiative which would forbid all state governmentaffirmativeaction policies routinely invoke the sentence from Kings I Havea Dream speech looking forward to the day his children would be judged not bythe color of their skin but by the content of their character Calling forthe abolition of affirmative action in his book The End of RacismPrinciples for a Multicultural Society  Dinesh DSouza claims to befollowing in Kings footsteps even though he advocates repealing the CivilRights Act of  one of Kings crowning achievements            Ahigh or low point in this invention of a usable King camein May Clint Bolick a prominent Washington conservative and frequentspokesperson for the antiaffirmative action view used the centenary of theSupreme Courts Plessy vs Ferguson decision which upheld racialsegregation to argue that since segregation was a system of racialclassification affirmative action is its modern equivalent Thus in Bolicksview opponents not proponents of affirmative action are Kings legitimateheirs            But therevisionists are quite wrong His writing and actions make it clear that MartinLuther King Jr was a strong supporter of what today would be calledaffirmative action The phrase itself was not widely used during hislifetime but King spoke repeatedly of granting blacks special preferences injobs and education to compensate for past discrimination            In Why We Cant Wait  published in  as themovement to dismantle segregation reached its peak King observed that manywhite supporters of civil rights recoil in horror from suggestions thatblacks deserved not merely colorblind equality but compensatoryconsideration But he pointed out special measures for the deprived were awellestablished principle of American politics The GI Bill of Rights offeredall sorts of privileges to veterans Blacks given their long siege ofdenial were even more deserving than soldiers of special compensatorymeasures            Kingsaid much the same thing in his last book Where Do We Go From Here waspublished in  and in the intervening four years Kings optimism had givenway to foreboding prompted by the emergence of a white backlash and therealization that combating the economic plight of black America would prove farmore difficult than eliminating segregation He called for a series ofprograms including full employment and a guaranteed annual income to upliftthe poor of all races But he saw no contradiction between measures aimed atfighting poverty in general and others that accorded blacks special treatmentbecause of the unique injustices they had suffered A society that has donesomething special against the Negro for hundreds of years he wrotemust now do something special for him            Throughout the s King targeted both economic andracial inequality His policy proposals embraced a variety of approaches fromcolorblind assaults on poverty to demands such as setting specific goals forthe employment of blacks by private companies that today would be calledracial quotas            In one sense what Kingbelieved has little bearing on the s The civilrights era has long passedand affirmative action must be defended or attacked on its merits King asidewhat is most striking in current discussions of civil rights race andaffirmative action is the absence of any sense of history Segregation was notsimply a matter of racial classification or thinking by race as JusticeAntonin Scalia has written but part of a complex system of racialsubordination whose political economic and social elements all reinforced oneanother The slogan of the  March on Washington was not colorblind laws butJobs and Freedom and the movements ultimate goal King insisted was tomake freedom real and substantive for black Americans by absorbing them intothe mainstream of American life            This goal remains aselusive today as it was during Kings lifetime Kings real heirs are thosewho like him see affirmative action not as a panacea or an end in itself butas one of many ways to reduce the gap between blacks and the rest of Americansociety bequeathed to us by history
