                                             The guest of honor at theFeb  party was Lanny Davis President Clintons outgoing minister of damagecontrol The venue was the Holeman Lounge at the National Press Club indowntown Washington DC And the celebrants includedamongothersinvestigative reporters from the Washington Post  the WallStreet Journal  and the Los Angeles Times  all gathered for a finalkiss of the master spinners ring            Why didthe top reporters make merry with Davis for three hours and pay tribute to himwith bawdy toasts After all Davis had earned a reputation as one of thecitys most egregious news twisters during Sen Fred Thompsonscampaignfinance hearings spinning any reporter who came near that thehearings findings were old news In the early days of the Lewinsky eruptionDavis provided the same obfuscating service            The truth is that we Washington reporters love beingspunor to put it bluntly love being lied to The underlying reasons aretransparent If politicians and their mouthpieces gave it to us straight wedhave nothing to interpret and write So we swoon when important people returnour calls Weve been asked to dance We thrill at the telephone game ofquestion and evasion thinking our guile and cunning will ultimately yieldtruth We play the tortuous game of spin and leak because we must feed thedeadline beastthat is serve a new piece of the puzzle to our reading publicevery day So what if some of the pieces are illfitting and manufactured frompartial truths            There arefew new steps in this dance In his book on Henry Kissinger Walter Isaacsonrecounts how the diplomat would summon reporters for supposedly intimatediscussions and solicit their opinions Then hed feed them junk which theydpublish Lee Atwater was more cynical deliberately telling reporters thingsoff the record knowing that theyd view that information as more credible anduse it            Technically the Davis party wasnt acelebration it was a roast Davis aide Adam Goldberg booked the roompurchased appetizers and conjured the crowd At least it was a cash barGlenn Simpson an aggressive reporter at the Wall Street Journal  agreedto lend his name to the party to make it seem like a pressrelated event Theinvitations were faxed around town with Simpson as the RSVP contact JoiningSimpson at the party were a bunch of White House types and about two dozenjournalists including Susan Schmidt from the Washington Post herself avictim of recent White House spinning Thomas Galvin from the New YorkDaily News  and Marc Lacey of the Los Angeles Times             Simpsondeclines to talk about the party citing Journal policy He was anythingbut speechless at the party itself serving as master of ceremonies anddelivering what many thought was a hilarious speech            One attendee conceded that the appearances of the Davisfete are all wrong We were treating it almost as a birthday party thereporter said asking for anonymity We all wrote a big card and signed it andthanked him            I wrote on this card if youcome across any news call me said Lacey He insisted that such socializing isa cost of doing business in Washington For me it was a sort ofsourcedevelopment thing But he added You wonder whether it just shows thatfolks are too close            Laceys anonymous colleaguespots a parable in the Davis prom In this town you are judged by how wellyou can get a story leaked to you not how well you can develop a story on yourown and connect the dots she said You get stuff leaked to you in the castesystem You dont have a lot of people out there filing FOIAs or figuring outsome path that hasnt been walked before            Butreporters dont need artful seducers like Davis to make news One of mycolleagues who worked for the New York Times  Washington bureau duringWatergate says that getting your calls returned by official sources like Davisis a false overvalued currency You claw your way into a position to get yourcalls returned by actually breaking stories but that reward is empty It meansthat youre the seventh or eighth on the call list to be lied to instead ofthe  th             Although Davis has officially retired from thegame hes still mixing sense and nonsense for public consumption Just twoweeks ago I watched him on Rivera Live spin the nation on the subjectof the president and Monica Lewinskys relationship            She was not like interns Davis said She had come to know Betty Currie very well She hadcome to know the president through proximity and through being around thatoffice very well The president and Betty Currie had some concern abouther            I know that most internsdont get a chance to know Betty Currie and dont have the many contacts thatMonica Lewinsky had with the president  It certainly was a fact that MonicaLewinsky by her own intentions as a matter of public record spent a lot oftime around the Oval Office getting to know Betty Currie and thepresident            As amatter of fact I would agree that it is unusual to have that kind of accessand relationship with the presidents personal secretary and the presidenthimself and his friend Vernon Jordan Yes factually its unusual            Icalled Davis to ask about the foundation of his statementsand what he could add to them Actually you cant call Davis You page him andhe joy of joys returns your call            Davis denied any firsthandknowledge of the Lewinsky affair claiming that he was merely spewing back whathe had read in published reports            I was making a statisticalcomment out of all the interns that work in the White House he said I cantcharacterize the relationship between her and the president  I used theword unusual as a statistical comment            But you didnt qualify yourremarks on television I said            When you are on televisionyou have to respond quickly Davis explained            Now I understood            If you write anything youshould know that I have no personal knowledge whatsoever about anything            Thanks Lanny heres toyou
