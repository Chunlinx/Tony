                okay tell me about your home   well its an older home it was made back in the early sixties its a pier beam house   uhhuh uhhuh   got three bedrooms one bath and that just makes me scream   thats pretty tough what area do you live in   i live in Houston   oh okay i see is that pretty typical for your area   well for the neighborhood im in yeah this is one this is one of the more uh established neighborhoods   it is uhhuh that sounds really interesting i live in a suburb of Dallas and um i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least i have two bathrooms thats not so bad but uh its pretty typical for the area as well um ive always been interested in older homes personally so its i think you can end up you can end up doing more with them it seems like what is it what about uh yard space do you have lot of uh a big lot or anything like that   well the whole the whole lot im sitting on is roughly half an acre   oh i see   well half about half of that about a quarter acre of that ive got a garden   humum oh thats nice because i have just a like a very small you know those basic tract houses like that we have a very small yard and um i do have garden but its its extremely small but uh it seems like though for your area thats thats sort of different in a big city like that most houses i would think would be sort of like uh what we live in just a you know a basic tract house   well in the um newer neighborhoods development communities that theyve put together the houses are so close together if your neighbors having an argument you can hear it blow for blow   yeah thats exactly right thats the way we are we have uh one thing that we really do enjoy is we have a hot tub in the back so we have we have quite a few parties and uh it seems like everyone that lives around us ends up you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside you know with everyone so uh thats true thats one thing that i dont enjoy about it is the houses are too close together but uh you know its its fine for now hopefully eventually well move into a larger home the only thing that i dont like also is that the the rooms are so small you know its its very difficult to arrange furniture and and things like that so are are the rooms in your house bigger since its a a sixties home it seems like then that they built the rooms much larger is that true   and theyve got better closet space than most of the new houses that ive seen   yeah yeah yeah thats really it thats a plus at least we do have uh like three walkin closets here so thats thats maybe not so so typical but uh   it helps a bunch   yeah it really does except when you you know have to fill them up and then you get those Visa bills in and so anyway um anything else about the area about um you know that it compare can you can compare your house to anything around there   most of the neighborhood im in is pretty typical this whole neighborhood was kind of built in between sixty and sixty five   yeah so its just its just   so everybodys got a usually a pretty good size yard i think ive got probably the biggest   yeah   if not the biggest yard ive got pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood   yeah thats nice that is nice but you know too the only bad thing about that is then you have to keep up you know you have   well thats   the yard to deal with and   i enjoy that though   do you you must have more time than than i have im sitting out here right now we had this terrible rain and im looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and  it seems like now thats thats i almost wish i was in an apartment or something you know   praying for rain down here   but uh yeah well um i dont know do we just terminate this or or do you have to talk for a a certain amount of time do you know   no we can  the after you go to i think its five somewhere between five and ten minutes theyll get a little master recording on here that   okay okay well can you tell me anything else about the house are you working on it i mean do do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation   yeah this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice   yeah thats thats nice yeah the the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town and its like the typical the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds   wow   and i renovated a house there and that was you know that was so much fun i mean there if you dont live in a house thats at least seventy five to hundred years old you know youre just youre just nobody practically and that was really it that was a good experience for me you learn a lot of discipline and and uh that was what considered typical for that area so uh it its it was quite a change for me to come to a house like this now thats just you know a very square little box and you know theres not theres not a whole lot you can do with it but uh anyway   living in the city living in the city has some advantages but given the choice im getting out   yeah thats true oh really well i had lived in a small town for you know this this town was like less than ten thousand people and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas and i you know i didnt move out of there until i was you know twenty seven and out that was just you know so i i love the big city because you know i had lived in a rural area for for so long so ive enjoyed it but uh it can get it can get kind of tough it is like a rat race sometimes   thats just something ill never adapt to i dont i dont want to be a part of the rat race i want to be basically just kind of left alone if i want to if i want to sit around and mess mess with my garden ill mess with my garden if i want to work in the flower beds fine   yeah yeah yeah it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well i i really yeah i really do enjoy that i havent planted anything yet or   very much   you know i usually have got flowers coming out the gazoo but ive i havent done that yet ive had finals this week so uh   uh oh   you know im just kind of been trying to trying to uh stick in with that but uh since thats over with now maybe i can i can get this yard in shape do you do a lot of gardening   uh landscaping more than the garden the gardening ive got my beans peas ive got some onions out   yeah yeah yeah   tomatoes im not real sure what theyre going to do this year   i never have much luck with tomatoes i do i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the the uh bugs get on them so easily and i have a real problem with anything pesticide like pesticides or anything like that so the only thing that i use is soapy water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them but uh i dont have luck with that on tomato plant so i hate to spray them with anything um what do you do  do you have any tips you could give me   um my favorite one is putting on the um tomato plant is to put uh seven dust   yeah yeah   and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time and   thats true thats true ive my dad is a farmer so you know ive heard him talk about that forever i guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that so it wont make you sick lets see what else do you do to your house   well ive done some rewiring on it   yeah   eventually im gonna have if if we stay here im gonna have to rewire the entire house   oh really do you plan on uh like adding any rooms or you have enough space you could probably do that or is it   ive talked well ive talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on   yeah  i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms thats thats tough thats really tough do you not like have a half bath   not even a half bath   yeah yeah thats thats rough the house that i used to live in had like one bath and a half and that was even just with two people that was a pain   the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works were getting ready to go to work at different totally different times   thats good   so that its not like were tripping over each other in the morning trying to get ready   really that that could account for a lot of marital problems i think  you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom   yes       it doesnt work if youre trying to shave and shes trying to put her eyeliner on and youre both fighting over the mirror   no thats right its its not it does not make for a for a happy situation thats true well do you have any children   got one   one child and they enjoy they enjoy where theyre living   well hes nine months old now   oh so he doesnt know right i guess hes a big help out in your garden right   uh he he likes to dig around a little bit then his mother comes in and says how why did you let him play in the dirt like i said he was enjoying himself   yeah   thats right its healthy why not   as long as he wasnt eating the dirt i wasnt to worry about it   yeah nah it wont hurt them i i was a big dirt eater supposedly when i was a child and i turned out okay so dont worry about it just let him enjoy himself   so you think that you want to move away from the big city huh   well thats what ive always  i was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people   yeah so youre just the opposite from me you want to go back to that huh   and then after youre getting married move ended up moving to Houston the Houston area   yeah yeah so are you from Texas or you are   yes   so its not you know thats thats true Houston in itself is a pretty tough place you
