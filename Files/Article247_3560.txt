                                 How To OutTravel Your Travel Guide                        My trip to Chicago began fantastically thanks On Sunday morning I jumpedout of bed early and headed to the Maxwell Street Market the citys famousonceaweek openair bazaar In recent years the citys Mexican population hasboomed and the market now hosts a veritable food fair of Mexican delicaciesSqueezed amid the booths hawking used car fenders lacy underwear and bootleg copies of Microsoft Windows  are makeshift restaurants constructedfor the day out of tarps and folding chairs I wandered for two hours samplinga cevichelike fish salad spiked with lime cilantro and hot sauce tamalescoated in a green mole sauce that tasted differently with every second itlingered on my tongue and for dessert golden empanadas filled with creamyrice pudding Nothing I ate cost more than  I want to go back next Sundayso I can try the cold shrimp soup the goat tacos and theBavariancreamflavored churros            But I didnt find out about the markets delights from any of my Chicagoguidebooks Its charms are no secretin the past few years the market has beenwritten up in the New York Times  the Washington Post  the LosAngeles Times  the Chicago Tribune  and Saveur magazinebutFodors which boasts of its coverage of off and on the beaten path sitesand Access the cover of which claims to make the world your neighborhooddont mention the market even once Insight Guide describes its pastincarnationsas a center for Eastern European peddlers in the s aSouthernstyle farmers market in the s and a place to watch busking bluesmusicians in the s and sbut says its now just a place to buy fake Rolexwatches My Compass Guide dismisses the current market a sanitized successorto the old And Lonely Planet with its orthodox adherence to alternativetravel has some good historical scrapsa block of the old market once secededfrom the United States and established an anarchist countrybut barely mentionsany reasons to go now            Oddly Frommers did Maxwell Street Market more justice than the othersmentioning the food vendors if not their offerings Even better it lists themarkets Web site The other books contain a smattering of travel sitesbut Frommers is alone in listing Web addresses for every restaurant hoteland attraction that has one This is an easy and obvious solution to one of thebiggest weaknesses of guidebooks which is that theyre out of date from themoment theyre printed Yesterday for example you could have theoreticallylogged on to the Statue of Libertys Web site to find the correct departuretime for the ferry            However this was pretty much Frommers only virtue The first page of thebook unironically quotes a Travel  Leisure review calling the bookthe Walter Cronkite of guidebookswith all that implies Clearly this is nota guidebook for jetsetters adventure travelers or anyone else who mightconsider Cronkite a lessthanideal tour guide As you say Frommers is verymuch our fathers Oldsmobile            But even older and tamer travelers deserve better than Frommers The bookbreezes through the architecture of the LoopChicagos spectacular downtowninfour pages Most buildings are dismissed in two or three sentences Dates andarchitects for some buildings are listed but others are mysteriously omittedIn contrast the Insight Guide gives Loop architecture  pages Fodors Frommers devotes an average of  times more copy to hotel dcor than to thedesign of Chicagos great buildings For example the ninesentence review ofthe Hampton Inn notes that its interior takes inspiration from the Prairiearchitectural style and the twostory woodsy lobby with slipcovered furnitureand a few Chicago architectural artifacts feels like a friends great roomGuest rooms are residential and warm with framed collages of vintage Chicagopostcards on the walls Meanwhile the Rookery Building and its famous FrankLloyd Wright lobby get one line I also found a historical errorFrommers saysthat Chicagos first recorded settlement was established in  Not toquibble over two years but Frommers could have checked the ChicagoPublic Librarys timeline or the other guidebooks which list the correctdate as             What fun it was to write that last paragraph Did I detect a similar note oftriumph in your voice when you caught the guidebooks flubbing the Statue ofLiberty schedules Maybe this is the answer to your excellent question aboutwhy we buy and tote around guides we know are flawed outdated and out ofstyle My trips often become contests between myself and my guidebooks Can Ido them one better finding more inside information local color novel tastesand great prices than the experts When I saw the paltry descriptions of theMaxwell Street market I felt a small rushI had outtraveled the travelexperts            Or at least Ive outtraveled my fellow tourists Youre right about howquick these books are to ridicule other voyagers Rather than showing realconcern for the impact of cameratoting hordes or kneejerk irreverence Ithink the books are dispensing gardenvariety flattery making you feelsuperior to the next guy on the museum ticket line Traveling has become subtlycompetitive with all of us vying for maximum independence authenticity andadventure Buy me boast the books and you wont be the Ugliest American            But theres only so much exoticism to be had especially in welltroddencities like Chicago and New York In fact hipster travel magazines likeTime Out and Wallpaper have recently been taking a camp approachto oftvisited locales telling their readers to embrace their tourist statusto take Circle Line cruises in New York and ride to the top of the Eiffel Towerin Paris Could this be the backlash to the neverending search for novelty andvirgin territory Im not sure where the backlash would hit in Chicago butIll keep my eyes open for fashion models wearing Hawaiian shirts and whitepatentleather shoes            Thanks for the thumbnail sketches Ill try to cover more books tomorrow Inthe meantime if you had to take one guidebook to New York which would it beAnd which one have you already chucked into the Hudson
