tinkering with it you know its pretty hot down here during the summer we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes so but you know we dont do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that but   uhhuh you right yeah you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess   yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid March i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that     uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks   uhhuh   as soon as were sure were not going to have another freeze then ill finish it   yeah youve had more freezing this winter or this yeah winter i think   yeah weve had just a few you know freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April and its pretty tough   more bad weather umhum umhum umhum are you do you work or are you retired or you   no i work um im only forty years old i have to work   uh  uh my husbands retired but hes not a gardener he he hes been helping me more but he really isnt real uh real crazy about gardening     well      but   i i really enjoy it it gives me time outdoors and you know im a golfer but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house and and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and   uhhuh uhhuh  uhhuh oh uhhuh   getting ready to start to for the Spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn i usually have a pretty nice lawn its a lot of work you know but its   umhum huh oh yeah but its a pleasure to like you said its good to get outside and   yeah it is   and i like i like my garden too  we didnt have to we have just a small garden but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space and   uhhuh   we we didnt have too good luck with it because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didnt get too much   oh yeah   corn last year   were going through that we going through the dust storms down here now so   uhhuh   but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame thats five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side   uhhuh   and then i put uh like a black plastic its really not a black plastic it they call it Weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that   oh uhhuh hum   and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week   umhum umhum oh thats great   and its pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting   uhhuh uhhuh yeah we dont we dont usually cover ours we did a few different  times sometimes weve covered with the plastic and other years weve tried newspapers and uh but we generally dont we do our watering from our spring   oh   uh yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till its down and then it stops   oh you have a spring how nice uhhuh   and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden   oh thats uh thats pretty nice   with so   but you actually enjoy it huh   oh i do i love  it   get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around     id rather be doing that than housework   i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or     uh         not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the yeah   with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and havent figured out how to get rid of those yet   uh uhhuh uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides   yeah i try to no i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn but i sometimes i cant manage   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know its just the its just a lawn  if uhhuh do you eat any of them     yeah yeah well mines full of dandelions now so no i never have i dont know how to prepare them   oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad   no huhuh   oh its delicious and it  goes  real good on dandelions umhum   really huh ive never eaten dandelions now ive tried dandelion wine     umhum uh   but ive never tried any dandelions just to eat   uhhuh this is use the greens and you get them when theyre young and tender you know before they have grown too too taut because they do get a little stringy   yeah all right   but u h theyre kind of fun to to try get a get a few and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes   yeah ill try that i sure will   yeah yeah     oh   i dont know uh but ive been cutting our grass too lately because my husbands back and hes been having trouble with so wasnt allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass   oh oh you   and we have we have hills im afraid of the hills  but im getting on to it i just pretend theyre not there and i just go ahead and do it   so you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh   yeah   yeah i only got well i guess i got um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre   uhhuh   and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know ive got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends   uhhuh oh thats great great thats a lot of people dont have that much space even   no and its nice im just inside the city limits im probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and im only a mile and a half from work   that uhhuh so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and and the country also   yeah its pretty nice i have the room outside i need and i dont really have all the room in the house i need but   uhhuh  well you never have enough room do you think   no   no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or   yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the they called uh rolypoly bugs thats what my son calls them anyway   uhhuh rolypoly what   rolypoly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball i dont know what theyre called   is it a bug you mean   they look like theyve got yeah no no its not like a no   a worm a cut worm not a grub worm   you find them under bricks and all that stuff where its moist and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball   oh   i dont know what they call them but im plagued with those things down here and i havent figured out i even called the nursery either though see   um umhum im trying to think of what they are what kind they could be   i i dont know   you find them under bricks usually and that   yeah under bricks or under wood or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at night but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up thats been laying around no   theyre not a slug not a   a slug is actually kind of slimy and and these are just he plays with them all time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio   yeah yeah yeah oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm   no no theyre not real hard   theyre not a hard  huh   theyre like a a water bug of sorts i dont know what theyre called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up   oh are they black then but they roll up i cant think of what kind they would be uhhuh im no help on that then because i cant think of what they are   but im plagued with those   what they would be but i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have   you know i think its because probably because were in more of a tempered zone you know we dont really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most you know   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens   yeah i got fire ants too and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   your your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but were not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and and uh   yeah  you keep trading them  yeah uhhuh uhhuh ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now theyre theyre big now so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but theyre just beginning to come out the end bud   yeah yeah yeah see mine are up and bloomed already   oh   and they sure are pretty i like them and the Snap Dragons are starting to come up   oh oh theyre such a nice bright early spring color   yeah and then in in my back flower bed i have uh tiger lilies   umhum umhum   and they bloom in you know late June mid July and theyre yeah they are theyre real nice but theyre theyre nice and green you know theyre up above a foot maybe eighteen inches   umhum and theyre beautiful too yeah theyre beautiful uhhuh oh my   they come up real pretty every year no problem   yeah no we wont have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah yeah were having its raining today   is it still pretty cool up there yeah well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow uh Bermuda or rye or   well our grass like i said is just grass we really didnt plant anything its just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even   okay yeah see we i have Bermuda in my yard now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there but   and uh uhhuh umhum its probably very pretty   Bermuda seems to be yeah Bermuda seems to do pretty good down here   uhhuh uhhuh we have some people that have done their lawns and and uh
