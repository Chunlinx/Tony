                    Background                Plasmodium falciparum  a parasitic        protozoan is the causative agent of the most lethal form        of human malaria It is responsible for  million        infections per year in some  countries and regions        throughout the tropical and subtropical world Of these        clinical cases approximately  million result in death        annually   In areas where mosquito abatement has        failed chemotherapy consisting of a limited selection of        antimalarial agents is the only defense against this        disease The increase in drug resistance throughout the        malaria endemic regions is cause for great concern and        calls for the development of new antimalarial measures        which would involve a larger variety of drug targets as        well as a wider array of vaccine strategies reviewed in                  The study of malaria will be greatly helped by the        publicly available complete genome sequence of         P falciparum  The sequencing        project driven by the Sanger Centre the Institute for        Genomic Research TIGR and Stanford University is        essentially complete   The sequence of the completed        chromosomes are available for download from each sequencing        center and from the         Plasmodium Genome Resource PlasmoDB           Preliminary analysis of the  megabasepair Mbp                P falciparum genome indicates the        presence of approximately  genes spread across         chromosomes a circular plastid genome and a mitochondrial        genome Strikingly more than  of the predicted open        reading frames ORFs lack orthologs in other genomes          This fact underscores the need to elucidate gene function        yet many of the tools that have propelled the study of        model organisms remain inefficient or nonexistent in         Plasmodium  Despite recent        improvements in         P falciparum transformation        techniques   the efficiency of stable transfection        under a direct drug selection remains approximately          making knockout and gene replacement experiments difficult        and genetic complementation strategies nearly impossible        Genomewide expression profiling by microarray technology        provides an easy alternative for the functional genomic        exploration of         P falciparum         In organisms ranging from bacteria to humans expression        profiling has proved a powerful tool Profiling has been        used to gain important insights into processes such as        development responses to environmental perturbations gene        mutation pathogen and host response and cancer                Expression profiling has already been        successfully applied to the partial genome sequence of         P falciparum  and has been used to        characterize the role of previously unannotated genes                   Here we present the design and assembly of a        longoligonucleotide         P falciparum genespecific        microarray using the currently available genomic sequence        generated by the Malaria Genome Consortium            During the course of this work we have developed software        improved by experimental data and an opensource policy        for rapidly selecting unique sequences from predicted ORFs        of any genome Subsequently we constructed a        longoligonucleotidebased         P falciparum microarray which we        used to evaluate changes in the global expression profile        between two distinct stages of         P falciparum erythrocyticstage        asexual development  midtrophozoite and midschizont The        large number of differentially expressed genes detected in        this analysis suggests that extensive transcriptional        regulation has a major role in the functional        specialization of parasite development                    Results and discussion                  P falciparumORF predictions          At the outset of these studies a total of  Mbp of                    P falciparum genomic sequence was          obtained from the publicly available sources presented by          the Malaria Genome Consortium     in October           The sequence comprised two completely assembled          chromosomes the complete mitochondrial and plastid          genomes and the sum of all the partial contigs from the          remaining chromosomes ORF predictions were carried out          using GlimmerM a genefinding tool trained with           P falciparum specific sequences             Using default parameters GlimmerM frequently          yielded a large number of overlapping predictions          competing gene models and thus additional filtering of          the initial prediction output was required As slight          overprediction of ORFs is generally desirable for the          purpose of expression array building the postprediction          filtering of the GlimmerM output was modified with          respect to the process used by the Malaria Genome          Consortium   Briefly individual predictions that          overlapped and were on opposite strands or in different          reading frames were retained For competing predictions          within a given GlimmerM gene model ORFs that were          extended downstream by at least  bp and were within           bp of the total size compared to the size of the          largest prediction were chosen In all other cases the          largest predicted ORF was selected This selection method          resulted in  ORF predictions for chromosome  whereas          the Malaria Genome Consortium selected  for the same          chromosome            The first round of predictions carried out on the          publicly available genomic sequence as of August           yielded  putative ORFs The predicted ORFs are          available as additional data with the online version of          this paper see Additional data files and from   As          a first step to annotation the translation of all          predicted ORFs were used to search the Astral SwissProt          and nonredundant NR databases for sequence          similarities using the SmithWaterman algorithm   In          addition all ORF predictions were linked to their          counterparts in PlasmoDB                             ArrayOligoSelector array element design          To construct a genespecific microarray of the           P falciparum genome we designed           mer oligonucleotide array elements We chose this          length for a number of reasons Long oligonucleotides are          a highly sensitive alternative to PCR products and          provide a means to readily distinguish between genes with          high degrees of sequence similarity   In addition          the presence of various types of repetitive sequences and          highly homologous gene families in the ATrich           P falciparum genome contributes to          a high rate of PCR failure   and JLD unpublished          results A software program ArrayOligoSelector was          developed specifically for the purpose of systematically          selecting genespecific long oligonucleotide probes for          entire genomes The latest version and complete source          code for ArrayOligoSelector is freely available at            For each ORF the program optimizes the oligonucleotide          selection on the basis of several parameters including          uniqueness in the genome sequence complexity lack of          selfbinding and GC content Figure  Similar          approaches to oligonucleotide design have previously been          described but the exact algorithms source code andor          accompanying hybridization data are not available                       ArrayOligoSelector helps ensure complete genome          coverage and optimal array hybridization while avoiding          several potential problems originating from the peculiar          characteristics of the           P falciparum genome The algorithm          attempts to minimize crosshybridization between the          oligonucleotide and other regions of the genome To          evaluate the potential for crosshybridization early          versions of ArrayOligoSelector used a simple BLASTN          alignment identity   Although this method prevents          the selection of troublesome sequences it does not take          into account the effect of mismatch distribution or base          composition Subsequent versions of ArrayOligoSelector          were improved by calculating a theoretical energy of          binding between the oligonucleotide and its most probable          crosshybridization target in the genome second best          target The binding energy kcalmol is calculated          using a nearestneighbor model using established          thermodynamic parameters        Thus          a sequence with high crosshybridization potential will          have a more stable binding energy with a larger absolute          value In contrast a sequence unique in the genome will          yield a smaller absolute value for the binding energy A          representative plot of the calculated binding energies          for all possible  bp oligonucleotides from a putative           var gene PlasmoDB v annotated          gene ID PF is shown in Figure a          An important aspect of oligonucleotide design for          microarray hybridization is avoiding secondary structures          within the oligonucleotide as these are likely to be          detrimental to hybridization performance To avoid          selecting oligonucleotides with secondary complex          structure ArrayOligoSelector uses the SmithWaterman          algorithm with the PAM DNA matrix to calculate the          optimal alignment score between the candidate          oligonucleotide sequence and the reverse complement of          that sequence   A high SmithWaterman score          indicates the potential to create secondary structures          Figure b          The presence of lowcomplexity sequence could also          result in significant nonspecific crosshybridization          For example the           P falciparum genome contains a          large number of lowcomplexity sequence elements as a          result of a high frequency of continuous stretches of A          and T nucleotides in both the noncoding and the coding          regions ArrayOligoSelector automatically detects such          sequences by subjecting candidate oligonucleotide          sequences to a lossless compression   The          compression score calculated as the difference in bytes          between the original sequence and the compressed version          is inversely proportional to complexity Figure c          Using this score repeats of essentially any nature are          detected in a computationally efficient manner          In addition in order to avoid specific sequence          features ArrayOligoSelector supports filtering based on          userdefined patterns This feature can be used to          implement filtering rules based on empirically derived          data Finally the melting temperature of an          oligonucleotide is largely determined by its GC content          As is the case with most ORFs there exists a large range          of GC values   to   over a  bp window          Figure d For this reason a userdefined GC target          range is used by ArrayOligoSelector such that the          majority of the array elements will share a similar base          composition and hybridization properties across the          array          Given the above parameters ArrayOligoSelector          evaluates every  mer sequence within an ORF and chooses          an optimal set on the following criteria The          uniquenessfilter requires oligonucleotides to satisfy          two simultaneous threshold criteria based on the          calculation of the binding energy to their secondbest          target the best target is itself First the          oligonucleotide must rank among the top  of the unique          or almost unique  mers in the entire ORF Second its          binding energy must be within  kcalmol of the best          candidate for the ORF In addition an optional          userdefined energy threshold can operate in conjunction          with the default threshold Initial settings for the          lowcomplexity and the selfbinding terms allow the          topscoring  of  mers to pass to the next selection          step Finally an optional userdefined sequence filter          simply eliminates the  mer candidates containing the          defined sequences These four filters operate on the          entire set of  mer candidates for a particular ORF and          generate four independent output sets The intersection          of the four outputs is then subjected to the final          selection If no common oligonucleotide is identified in          the first intersection the selfbinding and complexity          filters are incrementally relaxed until an intersection          becomes available The final selection of candidate          oligonucleotides depends upon the GC filter and end          proximity ranking Initially oligonucleotides are          allowed to pass if they meet the userspecified GC If          no oligonucleotide with the desired GC content is found          the target GC range is relaxed by one percentage point          in each direction until one or more oligonucleotides          pass As a final step a single candidate closest to the           end of the gene is chosen Finally ArrayOligoSelector          generates an output file containing the oligonucleotide          selections for each putative ORF          From our initial set of predictions a total of            mer oligonucleotides were selected and synthesized          For our first pass of malaria oligonucleotide selections          the earlier version of ArrayOligoSelector utilizing the          BLASTNbased identity threshold was used The identity          cutoff was adjusted to a very conservative value of            bp of identity The initial setting of the GC content          filter was set to  GC C T           m  Subsequently with the release of          additional sequence information a new set of predictions          was generated in April  and an additional           oligonucleotides were selected using the upgraded version          of ArrayOligoSelector In this selection the          userdefined uniqueness threshold was set at           kcalmol the value at which crosshybridization is          essentially eliminated Figure  The GC content target          was set at  The sequence and location of each          oligonucleotide is available online   The          experiments described in the following section were          conducted with the first set of predictions only As          additional annotations become available for the whole          genome sequence additional oligonucleotides will be          selected and added to the existing collection We expect          the final set to contain approximately           oligonucleotides                          Oligonucleotide performance          Hughes           et al   showed that  mer          oligonucleotides make highly sensitive specific          microarray elements for expression profiling of           Saccharomyces cerevisiae   The          oligonucleotides used in that study were synthesized           in situ using inkjet technology          whereas the oligonucleotides used in our study were          commercially synthesized and subsequently printed using          mechanical deposition Similarly to the experiments of          Hughes           et al  we wished to test          experimentally the effect of mismatches on sensitivity          and specificity of  mer oligonucleotides in the context          of a complex hybridization mixture            P falciparum total RNA Ten          separate malaria ORF predictions were arbitrarily          selected for analysis and for each of these ORFs a set of          ten oligonucleotides were synthesized The first          oligonucleotide in each set represents the original           mer selection from ArrayOligoSelector Each successive          oligonucleotide within a set contains an increasing          number of mutations made in increments of  Thus the          second oligonucleotide in each set had seven bases           altered while the last oligonucleotide had  bases           mutated For the first set of five ORFs Figure          abcde which is referred to as the distributed          set both the position and the identity of each mutation          was random For the second set of five ORFs Figure          ghijk referred to as the anchored set the          mutations in each oligonucleotide were limited to the          ends of the sequence In this manner a contiguous          stretch of perfectly matched bases was always preserved          in the center of each oligonucleotide          Figure summarizes normalized hybridization          intensities of control oligonucleotides obtained from the          global geneexpression comparisons between trophozoite          and schizont stages The results originate from the six          microarray hybridizations presented in Figure and           additional hybridizations available as additional data          files   The resulting hybridization intensity          measurements for each oligonucleotide were averaged          across all hybridizations and scaled as a fraction of the          average intensity of the perfectmatch oligonucleotide          for each set As is evident from Figure abcde          the presence of internal mismatches bubbles and bulges          had a large effect on hybridization performance          oligonucleotides with  mismatches  bases suffered          an average reduction of  in hybridization intensity          when compared to the perfect match while          oligonucleotides with   bases or more mismatches          were reduced by an average of  Figure f For the          anchored set Figure  ghijk a more gradual          hybridization trend was observed Mutating the terminal           bases  bases at each end resulted in an average          loss of  of the maximal hybridization intensity Not          until  bases had been mutated  bases at each end          did the relative intensity of hybridization drop by an          average of  Figure l In agreement with the          findings of Hughes           et al   the data from the          anchored set of oligonucleotides reveal a strong          relationship between the length of contiguous match the          equivalent of oligonucleotide length and overall          hybridization performance          To measure the extent to which the energy calculation          implemented in ArrayOligoSelector matches reality we          have plotted in Figure the calculated energy of the           control oligos shown in Figure and their relative          intensities of hybridization The calculated energy and          relative intensity of hybridization correlate at            r    For comparison the          relative intensity of hybridization and number of          nucleotide identities correlate at            r    This indicates that a          calculated binding energy approach may be used to          estimate the potential for crosshybridization for any          sequence relative to the rest of the genome The          specificity for each oligonucleotide is uniquely and          computationally determined and expressed as a binding          energy kcalmol          To further address the question of specificity of          oligonucleotide hybridization to their targets in a          complex sample we introduced a set of probes targeting a          set of  nonrepetitive sequences from           S cerevisiae to the microarray To          control for the nucleotide bias of the malaria genome          relative to yeast the selection criteria for this set          were identical to selection of the plasmodial microarray          elements The average GC content of the           S cerevisiae oligonucleotides was           whereas the average GC content of plasmodial          oligonucleotides is  The average          signaltobackground ratios across all hybridizations for          these negative control spots was less than twofold which          is well below the conservative fivefold          signaltobackground threshold used to filter data see          Materials and methods In addition a series of           hybridizations was carried out where total RNA from an          asynchronous parasite culture was hybridized against PCR          products corresponding to the negative control           S cerevisiae sequences In these          hybridizations the yeast PCR fragment hybridized strictly          to its cognate sequence while the average signal to          background value for plasmodial elements in the same          channel was    In no individual case did a          plasmodial element yield a signal greater than  of          the target hydridization signal intensity The results of          these microarray hybridizations are available as          additional data files            To assess whether separate oligonucleotides designed          to represent the same target gene perform in a similar          manner we examined three distinct situations elements          dispersed over a long single exon ORF Figure a          overlapping oligonucleotides Figure b and          oligonucleotides representing multiple exons of a single          gene Figure c In each case we observed consistent          oligonucleotide performance                          Geneexpression profiling of trophozoites and          schizonts          We chose a direct comparison of the trophozoite and          schizont stages of the           P falciparum asexual          intraerythrocytic life cycle as a first step toward          comprehensively profiling all lifecycle stages of this          parasite The trophozoite and schizont represent two          distinct developmental stages within the hour          plasmodial erythrocytic life cycle These stages vary          greatly in morphology biochemical properties and          transcriptional activity reviewed in    The          midtrophozoite stage  hours postinvasion          contains a highly transcriptionally active nucleus with          abundant euchromatin In addition trophozoites are          characterized by massive hemoglobin ingestion intake of          nutrients from the surrounding medium increasing          concentration of cytoplasmic ribosomes and rapid          formation of organelles In contrast the midschizonts          at  hours postinvasion are characterized by DNA          replication  copies and compaction into newly          formed nuclei In addition maturation of merozoite cells          begins at the schizont stage and is characterized by the          appearance of merozoite organelles such as the rhoptry          and dense granules The several trophozoite and          schizontspecific genes identified previously provide an          excellent source of positive controls for the experiments          described below          For microarray hybridization total RNA was prepared          from synchronized           in vitro P falciparum cultures          representing the trophozoite stage and the schizont stage          see Materials and methods Six independent          hybridizations were carried out in three the          trophozoitederived cDNA was labeled with Cy and the          schizontderived cDNA with Cy In the other three          hybridizations the fluorophore assignment was reversed          Of the genes assayed  features displayed a          differential expression greater than twofold Figure            showed higher relative transcript abundance in          trophozoites than in schizonts whereas  had greater          relative transcript abundance in schizonts Linear          regression ratios were calculated for each possible pair          of microarray hybridizations using the filtered dataset          The correlation between hybridizations with the same          CyCy assignment was           r     while correlation          of hybridizations with the opposite CyCy order was           r                              Northern blot hybridizations          To confirm the microarray results we examined six          genes by northern blot analysis In the microarray          hybridization the expression levels of two of the          selected genes were unchanged  fold while four          additional genes showed a differential expression between          the trophozoite and schizont stage  fold An          equal mass of total RNA from both the trophozoite and          schizont stages was hybridized with PCRgenerated DNA          probes corresponding to the selected genes Subsequently          each northern blot was stripped and rehybridized with a          probe specific for the  kD antigen p          fructosebisphosphate aldolase PfALDO PlasmoDB v ID          PF Oligo ID M   as a loading          control While the relative amount of PfALDO transcript          differs by more than twofold between trophozoite and          schizont stages when equal masses of total RNA are          blotted we found that the relative amount of PfALDO to          be essentially equivalent when equal masses of polyA          RNA were used for the northern blot Figure a The          discrepancy between northern blots with total RNA and          polyA mRNA are probably due to changes in the relative          amounts of mRNA and ribosomal RNA during the          intraerythrocytic life cycle The polyA northern blot          measurements agree well with the replicate array          hybridizations in which PfALDO was consistently less          than fold differentially expressed Figure b To          make northern blot measurements comparable to the          normalized expression array ratios the ratio between the          two stages was measured using a phosphoimager and divided          by the ratio obtained for the PfALDO control in each          case The normalized ratios of the radiolabel signal were          highly consistent with the averaged ratios from the six          microarray hybridizations Figure b                          Biological significance of the geneexpression          results                      Trophozoite genes            The predominant group of features with elevated            expression in the trophozoite stage comprised genes            encoding various components of the eukaryotic            translation machinery This group contained  and             proteins of the S and S ribosomal subunits RPS and            RPL respectively In addition nine orthologs of            aminoacyltRNA synthetases and  initiation and seven            elongation translation factors were detected among            trophozoitespecific genes Several previously            identified plasmodial genes were present in this group            including AsptRNA synthetase two plasmodial            elongation factors PfEFA and PfEF and one            ribosomereleasing factor PfRF    Consistent            with our findings PfEFA has been previously shown to            have peak expression during the trophozoite stage              Two additional gene groups whose functions are            linked to the process of protein synthesis were present            among the trophozoite genes five DEADbox RNA            helicases including a close homolog of             P cynomolgi RNA helicases              and  molecular chaperonelike molecules            including two             P falciparum heatshock proteins            such as PfHSP GenBank accession number M and            PfHSP accession number L and a homolog of a            DnaJdomaincontaining protein family DNJSIS            homolog   These data agree with previous studies            that found a group of DEADbox RNA helicases to be            overexpressed during the trophozoite stage in             P cynomolgi   Along with            the genes for the translation machinery a number of            genes involved in various steps of RNA synthesis and            processing were located among the trophozoite genes            including  ORFs belonging to various RNA polymerase            complexes and  splicing factors Figure  Two            previously identified plasmodial RNA polymerase            components were found in this group including the            largest subunit of             P falciparum RNA polymerase II            PfRNApolIIA M and a homolog RNApolK  kD              The expression characteristics revealed are also            consistent with several previous studies that suggested            that the plasmodial transcription and translation            machinery is active through the late ring and early            trophozoite stage before decaying during the late            schizont stage               Another functional group of genes that encode            enzymes of cellular biosynthetic pathways was            distinguished within the trophozoite category This            gene set includes  enzymes of carbohydrate            metabolism  ORFs likely to be involved in nucleotide            metabolism and  ORFs involved in the biosynthetic            pathways of several amino acids Several            wellcharacterized plasmodial genes were identified in            this metabolic collection including             P falciparum lactate            dehydrogenase PfLDH  enolase U            triosephosphate isomerase PfTPI L            glucosephosphate isomerase PfGPI J            hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase            PfHGPRT X and dihydropteroate synthetase            PfDHPS U In addition a group of             proteolytic enzymes potentially involved in hemoglobin            degradation was detected among the trophozoite genes            these include a cysteine protease falcipain            AF a metalloprotease falcilysine AF            and a member of an aspartic protease family            plasmepsin L Falcipain and plasmepsin            have been the targets of recent drug discovery research                          Overall the emergent gene clusters suggest that the            trophozoite stage a central phase of plasmodial            intraerythrocytic development is characterized by the            activation of general cellular growth functions such as            transcription translation and hemoglobin degradation            and biosynthesis of basic metabolites                                Schizont genes            A large number of ORFs found in the            schizontexpressed category correspond to genes            previously associated with the various steps by which            newly released merozoites invade new host cells The            initial step of this process adhesion of the merozoite            to the surface of an erythrocyte is facilitated by            several classes of proteins exposed on the surface of            the parasite Eighteen ORFs identical or homologous to            proteins associated with the merozoite surface were            present among the schizontenriched genes This group            included four merozoite surface proteins MSP MSP            M MSP MSP AF and MSP AY            Additional members of this group include two ORFs            containing Duffylike binding domains            erythrocytebinding antigen EBA  L a            putative erythrocytebinding protein EBL AF            and proteins known to be delivered to the surface from            apical organelles including apical membrane antigen            AMA U and finally two rhoptryassociated            proteins RAP U and RAP            Initial attachment of the merozoite is followed by            reorientation of the parasite cell with its apical part            toward the erythrocyte membrane followed by            invagination of the membrane Previous studies            suggested that both steps are facilitated by the action            of actomyosin which requires ATP hydrolysis              Consistent with these findings we found five proteins            previously associated with this process             pfactinI M             pfmyoA AF and merozoite            cap protein U and two subtilisinlike            proteases PfSUB and PfSUB AJ differentially            enriched in schizonts Interestingly one additional            homolog of PfSUB was identified among the schizont            genes Moreover the expression levels of a set of            plasmodial protein kinases were previously found to be            augmented during the late stages of the malarial            erythrocytic life cycle   Our findings confirm and            extend this report  unique ORFs sharing a high to            medium level of homology with protein kinases and            phosphorylases had elevated mRNA levels during the            schizont stage Figure  Two previously identified            representatives were present in this set a            cAMPdependent protein kinase PfPKAc AF and a            plasmodial serinethreonine protein phosphatase PfPPJ            AF            A second functional group of genes with increased            expression in schizonts encodes proteins that are            thought to function on the periphery of a newly            infected erythrocyte at the early stages of asexual            development Representatives include the genes for            ringinfected erythrocyte surface antigen RESA            X and several close RESA homologs CLAG            AF the related gene             CLAG  and two members of the            serinerepeat rich protein SERA family   In            addition to these wellcharacterized surface proteins            the schizontenriched set of transcripts contained a            number of ORFs identical or homologous to proteins            recognized by antibodies present in plasmodium immune            sera obtained either from model organisms   or from            acute andor convalescent patients   In summary            the schizont stage of plasmodial development featured            genes predominantly occupied with the process of            merozoite function as well as the advance synthesis of            transcripts for proteins that facilitate parasite            establishment within the newly infected            erythrocyte            Taken together these results suggest that the            parasite cell in the trophozoite stage is dedicated to            cell growth and the predominant function of the            midlate schizont stage is maturation of the next            generation of merozoites Of particular interest is the            large number of ORFs within both categories  in            trophozoite and  in schizonts with no putative            functions assigned These ORFs have little to no            homology to any other known genes and may possibly            represent highly specialized functions not likely to be            shared outside this family of parasites                                      Conclusions        In this study we present a         P falciparum ORFspecific microarray        utilizing  mer oligonucleotides as individual microarray        elements This approach helped to overcome potential        problems originating from low PCR amplification and allowed        us to select probes with a high specificity thereby        minimizing potential crosshybridization Moreover the        oligonucleotideselection algorithm allowed a balanced GC        content around  across the entire microarray set        which is significantly higher than the plasmodial genome        average which is  with  in coding regions                 Application of the ArrayOligoSelector is not restricted        to the         P falciparum genome but is broadly        useful for the automated selection of hybridization probes        for a range of species The flexibility of the selection        parameters controlling stringency of uniqueness        selfbinding complexity userdefined filters and GC        content allows the selection of oligonucleotides        appropriate for any genome        Evaluation of results from derivative control        oligonucleotides showed that long oligonucleotides could        tolerate  mismatches however alteration of the target        sequence by more then  eliminated most of the        hybridization signal Therefore small sequencing errors        and natural variation among isolates are not likely to        impact on sensitivity These performance characteristics        imply that the array design for this effort can accommodate        the study of essentially any         P falciparum strain with a high        degree of specificity        At present the         P falciparum microarray used in this        study consists of approximately  genespecific        elements corresponding to the majority of the total coding        content predicted for the         P falciparum genome As new sequence        and improved gene predictions arise additional elements        will be added to this evolving platform Moreover the        present oligonucleotide representation could be further        extended for investigation of several unusual         P falciparum genetic and        transcriptional phenomena including antisense mRNA        transcription   and alternative splicing andor        transcriptional initiation    This may be achieved        by designing exonspecific array features as well as        antisense oligonucleotides The oligonucleotide collection        could also be expanded by sequences corresponding to        intergenic genomic regions Inclusion of such elements was        found to be extremely useful for identifying        proteinbinding DNA regions by        chromatinimmunoprecipitation as well as genes not detected        by automated geneprediction algorithms          Within both the trophozoite and schizont categories        large numbers of genes belong to functionally related        processes These include genes encoding ribosomal subunits        multiple factors for transcription and translation enzymes        of biosynthetic and catabolic pathways or merozoite        adherence and invasion machinery These results are        consistent with predictions that a large number of        plasmodial genes undergo strict stagespecific        transcriptional regulation and that such coregulation        is shared among functionally related genes           Naturally a fineresolution global geneexpression        profile including the different steps of the plasmodial        life cycle for multiple divergent strains will be necessary        to characterize fully the intraerythrocytic life of the        parasite At present our laboratory is analyzing a global        geneexpression profile of the hour erythrocytic life        cycle with hour resolution for three strains of         P falciparum         In a number of model organisms highresolution        geneexpression maps have served as extremely powerful        tools for discovery and characterization of novel genes as        well as exploration of multiple cellular functions           The geneexpression maps typically comprise        genomewide expression profiles at a number of different        stages of cellular development profiles of multiple        strains and genetic variants and global expression        responses to number of growth perturbations and        growthinhibitory drugs Following a similar approach in         P falciparum is most likely to        provide substantial information about the many ORFs that        lack functional annotation Further understanding of        cellular physiology of this parasite including basic        metabolic functions and the intricate interactions between        the parasite cell and human host immune system will be a        key step in uncovering new targets for antimalarial drug        discoveries and vaccine development                    Materials and methods                  Microarray fabrication          The bp

         Giemsa stains show a nearly pure trophozoite population          with less than  schizonts For the schizont stage          collection we estimate the amount of ring contamination          to be around  The cells were harvested in prewarmed          PBS at C and spun at            g for  min Cell pellets were          rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at          C
