                                 Weatherbox Part II            Chatterbox slightly mangled in last weeks Weatherbox item the meaning of the hottestever weather data availablefrom NOAA Chatterbox wanting to get people to quit whining about theheat wave used the data to point out that its been a lot hotter which ithas The data itself including the hottestever temperature recordedofficially degrees Farenheit in El Azizia Libya on Sept  andthe hottestever temperature recorded officially in the US degrees inDeath Valley Calif on July   were correct But Chatterbox his mindclearly addled by the heat its much cooler now misinterpreted therankings below hottestever of both worldwide temperatures and UStemperatures Chatterbox thanks the many readers who wrote in to inform him ofhis error            The NOAA data show the hottest days ever recorded on various continents indeclining order Therefore its rash to conclude as Chatterbox did that thesecondhottest temperature in known human history was the  degreesrecorded in Death Valleycited by NOAA as the hottestever temperature inNorth America and as a temperature hotter than any other recorded by NOAA forany continent that isnt Africa More likely the secondhottest day inknown human history probably occurred somewhere in Africa where somebodyprobably measured a temperature of  degrees Farenheit But this wouldnot be included on the NOAA chart because Africas record is the degrees figure for El Azizia Libya in  Chatterboxs rankingsfor the US were similarly skewed since NOAAs chart listed alltime highs for individual states hence thesecondhottest day in the United States was probably not June  when it hit  degrees in Lake Havasu City Ariz and  degreesFahrenheit in Laughlin Nev Rather the secondhottest day probablyoccurred in the same location as the hottest day ie Death ValleyCalif which is really really hot Indeed a guy named Dinesh Desaiclaims to have recorded a temperature of degrees while walking across Death Valley in July  Chatterboxsrankings for third hottest fourth hottest etc are of course similarlybotched            A reader emailed Chatterbox some intriguing evidence that the temperaturemay have lately spiked past El Azizia Libyas  world record of degrees Farenheitthough not of course anywhere near these shores SgtScott Comiskey of the US Army who since April has been stationed in Kuwaitclaims that it hit  degrees one day out on the live fire range Ifought in the Gulf War writes Comiskey and I can tell you this is the worstheat I have ever felt Members of his task force were given Tshirts that say in order to commemorate the event This is not an officially sanctionedfigure but Chatterbox trusts the US Army to handle a thermometer            None of these qualifications negates Chatterboxs message that it can get alot hotter than it was last week in much of the US Certainly Chatterbox meansno disrespect to the mostly elderly people who died in the recent US heatwave But Chatterbox finds himself wondering why this heat wave whichstretched across the Midwest the South and the East killed so many people inChicago  a city in a relatively northern latitude that is reputed to beWindy and situated on a very big lake By now its cooled down to  degreesat Chicagos Midway Airport according to the Chicago Tribunes weather Web pageClick here for links to the Tribunes coverage of the heatwave According to the Tribune  Chicago had about  heat deaths per people a higher rate of these fatalities than Southern cities such asAtlanta and Miami which tend to be hotter            One reason apparently is that Chicago doesnt have enough air conditionersfor lowincome people Quoth the Tribune                                              Air conditioning is not standard equipment in lowincome housing heresaid Steve Forman a professor of earth and environmental sciences at theUniversity of Illinois at Chicago  Only four of the  Chicago HousingAuthority buildings for senior citizens have air conditioning in every roomaccording to CHA spokeswoman Karen Bates CHA director Phil Jackson and MayorRichard M Daley have made it a goal to increase the number of units thatprovide residents with air conditioning said Daleys press secretaryJacquelyn Heard                                       Interestingly the citys deaths and power outages came despite a citywideemergency plan that was implemented after an even worse heat wave in  anddespite the fact that forecasts accurately predicted recordscrapingtemperatures this again according to the Tribune  However Cook Countys heatwave deathtoll people since July  out of about  nationwideisnt as bad as in The Tribune attributes this to the emergency plan whichhad police ferrying about  people without air conditioning or fans tocooling centers            Still Chatterbox doesnt remember hearing before a few years ago aboutChicagos unusual number of heatrelated deaths Chatterbox phoned EricKlinenberg a PhD candidate in sociology at Berkeley whos writing a bookabout the  Chicago heat wave to dig deeper Klinenberg says the phenomenonis partly related to the recent decline of Chicagos industrial base Associologist William Julius Wilson points out in When Work Disappears  this decline has led to a lot ofblack migration out of Chicago But when that happens Klinenberg says a lotof old folks stay put and are therefore cut off from family support networksMuch the same is happening with white workers Klinenberg says As it happensthe heatrelated deaths are concentrated among the white and blackpopulationsand largely bypassing the citys sizable Latino population Thatsmainly because Latinos in Chicago are in a different migration cycle Theirnumbers in the city have been increasing  Theyre newer arrivals andtheyre continuing to come in In other words the young Latino folks aresituated near the old Latino folks and can help them escape the heat To readKlinenbergs article Autopsie
