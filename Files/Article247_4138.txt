                                 Planet Better            The Washington Post leads with the Clinton administrationsannouncement that it plans to play a role in the numerous city lawsuits againstthe gun industry Federal officials says the Post  will begin pressinggun makers to make concessions to settle the various city lawsuits and if thecompanies dont HUD will bring a class action suit of its own against them onbehalf of the nations public housing authorities The story is fronted at theNew York Times and Los AngelesTimes  The LAT leads with the first official bureaucraticreaction to the almost certain loss of the Mars Polar Lander NASAs vow tocompletely reassess its interplanetary exploration program a story everybodyelse fronts but the NYT  USA Today goes with a story everybody else stuffsthe decision by a federal judge to block a web news services attempt to postthe annual financial disclosure forms submitted by all federal judges Paperversions of the forms are already available to the general public TheNYT leads with a local story The claim of public school investigatorsthat dozens of New York City teachers and two principals supplied answers tostudents for the standardized tests that determine how city schools are rankedand also whether or not students are promoted The papers top nonlocal storywhich nobody else fronts is Israeli PM Ehud Baraks call for a moratorium onfurther Jewish settlement of the West Bank an apparent reversal of the policyIsrael had been following since Barak came into power last summer            The WP lead observes that the new federal gun strategy could realize through thecourts gun control measures that have failed in Congress Measures likecontrolling sales at gun shows limiting the volume of gun purchases at any onetime and cutting off dealers whose sold guns are disproportionately involvedin crimes The NYT story adds a White Housesupplied stat that fleshesout the public housing angle Typically more than  percent of the murders occurring annually in the nations  largest housing projects arecommitted with a handgun The papers point out that the federal governmentsmove is patterned after its lawsuit against the cigarette manufacturers Butthe LAT notes an important difference the tobacco companies have manytimes the size and staying power of the gun companies            The LAT NASA story goes high with the agencys administrator sayingClearly something is wrong and we have to understand it The coverage makesit clear that understanding might require postponement or even scrapping ofalreadyscheduled space missions A main object of NASAs reassessment saysthe LAT  will be the faster better cheaper mandate the unmannedmissions have been operating under including the entire  million Marstwomission package that failed this year The LAT lead breaks abaffling silence that has marked the papers NASA coverage in recent days itfinally identifies the Mars programs prime contractorLockheed Martinalthough not until the th paragraph In this the papers hand was somewhatforced since its now apparent that the companys performance will be a focusof the NASA relook The Wall Street Journal story also mentions Lockheed but theNYT story doesnt nor does USAT s nor does the WP sfrontpager although an inside Post NASA effort does            The central issue of the federal bench financial data casewhetherdissemination via the Web poses some sort of extra danger not posed bypaperis also raised in a frontpage WSJ feature about a recentlydiscovered scam in which someone applied for and got and used credit cards inthe names of the top US military officers including more than  generals andadmirals This was possible because the officers service numbers which arejust their Social Security numbers were made available to Congress as part ofthe promotion process and have since appeared on a Web site maintained toprotest the use of the SSN as a national ID But the story points out nobodycan prove that the brass SSNs werent gotten directly from theCongressional Record  None of the brass are on the hook for the moneycadged but the story points out a more serious angle Since service numbers arenow just SSNs if a soldier is captured as things stand now he is required toprovide his SSN to his captors which they could use to find out all about hisfamily finances and personal background The Pentagon is therefore says theJournal  seriously considering going back to its old practice of issuingseparate service numbers unrelated to SSNs            An inside WP story reports that the tense situation between Cuba andthe US over custody of that sixyearold boy was compounded when Cubademanded that the US return the crew of a fishing boat it says was hijackedout of Cuba Monday and is now in Coast Guard custody                           About Face On Nov  Todays Papers wrote that Bill Bradleyjoined the National Guard during the Vietnam War In fact he joined the AirForce Reserve TP regrets the error and has fixed it in the online text            The WSJ reports that Discover American Express and MasterCard cannow be used to pay income tax bills But not Visa The paper doesnt explainwhy Youd think the company would want its piece of whats sure to be a recordvolume of tax payments no
