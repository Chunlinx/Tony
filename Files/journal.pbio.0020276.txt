                            Organisms of vastly differing morphologies ecologies and behaviorssuch as fruit flies        and humansare now known to share a multitude of molecular cellular and developmental        processes Not only is there extensive similarity in the sequences of fly and human genes        but in addition almost all of the proteins and major signal transduction pathways that        control cell division and differentiation in mammals are also found in the fruitfly         Drosophila melanogaster Rubin et al         httpflybasebioindianaedu Components in these pathways perform the same biochemical        functions and act in the same order in both fruitfly and mammalian cells        Evolutionary conservation is of considerable practical and theoretical importance to        biologists First it provides a valuable source of data for the reconstruction of        phylogeny Salemi and Vandamme  Evolutionary connections between organisms that were        once hidden by morphology have now been exposed in genomic analyses Second the        conservation of evolutionary processes or traits is a prime area of investigation in        theoretical evolutionary biology Gould  What can and cannot be changed        evolutionarily In a constantly evolving world how can any biological system or trait        survive unchanged Van Valen  Finally conservation provides fundamental insights        into how complex biological systems such as immunity are assembled maintained and        altered in evolution                    Elements of Immunity        Innate immunity refers to the variety of physical cellular and molecular features        that provide the first lines of defense against infections The relatively quick innate        immune responses operate along with slower but more targeted adaptive immune responses that        generate antigenspecific mechanisms that eventually lead to the destruction and        elimination of the pathogen        In mammals the skin and the epithelial lining of the mucosal tissues act as the primary        nonspecific barriers impeding infectious agents from entering the body The mucous        membrane barrier traps microorganisms and the cilia present on the epithelial cells assist        in sweeping the microbes towards the external openings of the respiratory and        gastrointestinal tracts If infectious agents gain entry into the body internal innate        immune responses become activated and rapidly eliminate the infection Internal innate        immune agents and responses include amongst others low pH of the stomach and vagina        proteolytic enzymes and bile in the small intestine and phagocytosis        Phagocytosis is a fundamental innate immune mechanism carried out by a number of        different cell types including macrophages Specific macrophage subpopulations are        associated with different tissues alveolar macrophages in the lung microglial cells in        the central nervous system etc Their main function is to consume microorganisms other        foreign substances and old dying cells        Innate immunity is present from birth and the information for innate immune responses        is inherited Cells in the mammalian innate immune system eg macrophages detect        microbial nonself by recognizing pathogenassociated molecular patterns PAMPs Janeway         PAMPs are products of microbial metabolism that are conserved over evolution        distributed in a wide variety of pathogens and not found in host cells Lipopolysaccharide        is an example of a PAMP and is found in bacteria viruses and fungi Receptors called        pattern recognition receptors are present on surfaces of host cells and recognize PAMPs        When activated pattern recognition receptors induce intracellular signaling via the        transcription factor NFB resulting in the activation of genes involved in host        defense        Adaptive immunity is characterized by greater specificity than innate immunity as the        adaptive immune response can not only distinguish foreign cells from self but can also        distinguish one foreign antigen from another Another hallmark of adaptive immunity is        memory which enables the body to remember specific adaptive responses in response to        specific antigens Immunological memory allows the body to make a greater and more rapid        second response when the body is reinfected by the same pathogen Immunological memory        underlies both immunization and resistance to reinfection conferring a tremendous        evolutionary advantage to vertebrates The adaptive immune response has nearly infinite        flexibility the T and B lymphocytes of the acquired immune system can rearrange the        elements of their immunoglobulin and Tcell receptor genes to create billions of clones        with distinct antigen receptors In organisms where both innate and acquired immune systems        are present there is a clear interdependence between the two systems For a fully        functional immune system these components must act in synergy                    Innate Immunity in Drosophila        Because it lacks an adaptive immune response         Drosophila melanogaster serves as a wonderful model for studying        aspects of the innate immune system that might otherwise be obscured by the actions of the        adaptive immune response Insects defend themselves against parasites and pathogens by        invoking a multitude of innate immune responses Figure  for more details see recent        reviews by Hoffmann and Reichhart  Hultmark  Brennan and Anderson         Meister  and Theopold et al  Like humans         Drosophila protects itself against microbes and parasites via        epithelial barriers for example epithelial cells of the trachea gut genital tract and        Malpighian tubules produce antimicrobial peptides local response        Once within the body cavity microbes may be consumed by the phagocytic blood cells        called plasmatocytes Figure  Larger pathogens such as eggs of parasitic wasps are        inactivated by encapsulation an immune response carried out by specialized cells called        lamellocytes Figure  Lamellocytes differentiate in response to macroscopic pathogens        and their precursors are thought to reside in the larval lymph gland The transcription        factors GATA FriendofGATA and Runx family proteins and signal transduction pathways        TollNFB SerrateNotch and JAKSTAT that are required for specification and        proliferation of blood cells during normal hematopoiesis as well as during the        hematopoietic proliferation that accompanies immune challenge are conserved Evans et al         Meister  In this issue of         PLoS Biology  Crozatier et al  identify the transcription factor        Collier as being critical for the differentiation of lamellocytes in         Drosophila  The mammalian ortholog of Collier Early Bcell        Factor is involved in Bcell differentiation in mice        In addition to triggering cellular immune responses invading pathogens also activate        humoral reactions Microbes induce the rapid secretion of antimicrobial peptides from the        cells of the fat body into the larval or adult body cavity systemic response Figure  A        microbial infection initiates a zymogen cascade that plays a crucial role in the activation        of the antimicrobial genes in the fat body Infection or wounding also triggers a        proteincleaving cascade that results in the production of toxic intermediates and melanin        around microbes or wound sites This proteolytic cascade is similar to the vertebrate        clotting cascade         Drosophila hemolymph also coagulates and participates in host        defense and wound healing Figure  Theopold et al  Given the evolutionary success        of insects this combination of defense mechanisms has proven to be extremely effective        allowing insects to thrive in septic environments                    NFB Activation The Toll and Imd Pathways of Drosophila        The         Drosophila genome encodes several members of the multifunctional        Toll family of receptors Beutler and Rehli  Mutations in the         Drosophila Toll gene as well as in other components in the        pathway make the fly susceptible to fungal or grampositive bacterial infections However        Toll does not act as a pattern recognition receptor in the fly instead its activation        depends on the presence of the processed active form of the growthfactorlike        polypeptide Sptzle Processing of Sptzle depends on a serpincontrolled proteolytic        cascade Figure         While components of the         Drosophila Toll pathway were identified in earlier genetic        screens for developmental mutants those in the Imd pathway have been the focus of more        recent studies mainly in the context of         Drosophila immunity Hoffmann and Reichhart  Hultmark         The effector NFB transcription factor of the Imd pathway is Relish which upon        immune activation is cleaved by the Dredd caspase Figure  Using a combination of the        RNA interference approach of silencing gene function and a highthroughput cell culture        assay Foley and OFarrell  report the identification of two new conserved members of        this Imd pathway Sickie is a novel protein required for Relish activation and Defense        repressor  is a novel inhibitor of the Dredd caspase        The impressive progress in our understanding of innate immunity in         Drosophila is now guiding scientists to explore the immune        system of other insects such as the mosquito         Anopheles gambiae  that spreads human malaria Immune responses        in this mosquito are linked to the elimination of the malarial parasites Osta et al         A comparison of the immunityrelated genes in         Anopheles and         Drosophila reveals the presence of the Toll signaling pathway in        the mosquito genome even though there are some differences in genes encoding pathogen        recognition and signal transduction molecules Christophides et al  A detailed and        comparative view of the genetic mechanisms underlying their host defense will contribute to        the identification of new targets for insecticide development and provide opportunities        for controlling the transmission of pathogens                    Concluding Remarks        The homologs of many genes involved in innate immune responses in flies and humans have        also been found in mice sharks nematodes and plants eg Pujol et al  Nurnberger        and Brunner  In species studied to date host defense appears to be mediated by        homologous proteins Taken together these findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms        of host defense may be hardwired in the genome much as DNA replication and cell division        are Protein motifs domains and signaling elements have for millions of years not only        retained their ancestral biochemical features but have also continued to participate in        similar physiological responses It is crucial that our evolving knowledge of genomic        recycling be used to enhance our understanding of the evolution of humans not only in the        context of descendants of ancient apes but in the larger context of our fundamental        unity and shared genetic history with all other species This simple but fundamental idea        has yet to be adopted by the majority of our students and teachers Unless we do more to        overcome resistance to the idea that humans share deep evolutionary connections with all        animal life students will become increasingly isolated from an understanding of and        participation in the genomics and bioinformatics revolution that is transforming the        biological and biomedical sciences
