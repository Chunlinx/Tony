                                 Gore the Ox                           Gore theOx                        It used to be of coursethat liberals were all for tough laws against sexual harassment andconservatives complained that such laws create a sexual reign of terrorLikewise liberals were great enthusiasts for the appointment of independentcounsels or special prosecutors while conservatives condemned theseinvestigations as witch hunts or in ladida mode as the criminalizationof political differences Now those roles are usually reversed            Let us be charitable andassume that these conversions are a sincere response to the scandalssurrounding President Clinton Conservatives unimpressed by Watergate orIranContra didnt previously realize just how corrupt and disgusting apresident could be And liberals until one of their own got caught up in themdidnt appreciate how onerous and unfair these laws are Certainly my friendand former New                Republic colleague Jeffrey Rosen writes in totalgood faith Jeffbrilliantly fulfilling the ancient journalistic dictum Sellevery piece three timeshas argued in the New                Republic  theNew York Times  and this week in Time magazine that Clintons troubles are due tocatastrophic defects in the sexualharassment and specialprosecutor laws withhelp from Clintons own misbehavior he always is careful to add            This isan extremely tempting argument for any Clinton supporter Reversing youropinion on two moderately important points of law is far less painful thanreversing your opinion on the firstand possibly the lastideologicallycompatible president of your lifetime But will it wash Unfortunately I dontthink so            Problem  The Monica Lewinsky business happened to becomepublic due to the interplay between sexual harassment the Paula Jones lawsuitand the special prosecutor but there are many other ways it might have doneso Ironypumping narratives noting that if not for this or that everythingwould be differenta favorite journalists deviceare like saying that if notfor a particular bus you wouldnt be at work today Other buses come along IfClinton was as reckless as many now assume with Lewinsky and others its amiracle he got away with it this long Changing the sexualharrassment andspecialprosecutor laws wont begin to guarantee that information like thiswont become public No matter how you define the problemClintons possiblemisbehavior false accusations of misbehavior or accurate public revelation ofbehavior that ought to stay privatethis solution doesnt solve it            Problem  is sexual harrassment Rosen arguesthat even if Paula Jones is telling the truthand even if the statute oflimitations on sexual harrassment hadnt expired leading her to sue on a moreexotic theorythe Clinton behavior she describes does not amount to sexualharrassment under the law But he notes the law allows the case to proceedanyway and overgenerous discovery rules allowed Jones lawyers to find outabout Monica Lewinsky drag her into the case and force Clinton to commitperjury by denying the affair            I deferto the experts on whether the scenario Jones describes if it happenedconstitutes illegal sexual harrassment But if it doesnt thesexualharrassment laws need to be strengthened not weakened The governor ofa state orders state troopers to summon a lowly state employee to a hotel roomwhere he exposes his member to her and says Kiss it Sexualharrassment lawmay be dangerously broad and vague as Rosen says but if this is notconsidered sexual harrassment it surely ought to beeven if there is no quidpro quo and even if he backs off and zips up when she declines Is it really anabusive invasion of privacy for the law to insist that a governor not dothat            Problem  is the independent counsel or special prosecutoror independent prosecutor or special counsel  The basic logic of thisinstitution is An administration should not be trusted to investigate itselfNothing in our experience since the office was institutionalized two decadesagoeither abuses by individual special prosecutors of which there have beensome or fair and honest Justice Department investigations of administrationofficials of which there also have been some undermines this basic logic Anindependent prosecutor is the only realistic way criminal behavior by those inpower can be credibly investigated andequally importantthe only way falselyaccused officials can be credibly vindicated            There aresundry complaints about the independent counsel as that institution hasevolved One is that the very appointment of a special prosecutor is apolitically traumatic affair and implies guilt Another is that independentcounsels once appointed turn into Ahabs Their charter unlike normalprosecutors is to pursue a particular person rather than a particular crimeTheir every incentive is to prosecute since failure to prosecute suggests thatthe whole enterprise was needless Their pursuit is not hampered by many of thebudget and policy restraints that cool the zeal of normal prosecutors Thesearguments could be found on the Wall                Street                Journaleditorial page almost any random day in the late s although not during thelate s            Some of these complaints are valid But thesolution is not to give up on special prosecutors The solution is to make theindependent prosecutor a permanent office rather than appointing a new oneevery time a scandal or alleged scandal comes along Unless the politicalculture changes drastically there will always be one or more independentprosecutors investigating the administration of the day andor pastadministrations anyway Referring some matter to a permanent independentprosecutors office would be far less fraught than appointing a new independentprosecutor and would carry less of a stigma A permanent independentprosecutors office could be held more easily to reasonable financial andprocedural guidelines A permanent independent prosecutors office would notneed to feel that its reputation depended on prosecuting and convictingeveryone it investigated            Therewould still be an Ahab syndrome In fact a permanent independent prosecutorsoffice would institutionalize the current de facto reality that specialprosecutors hold high government officials to a fussier standard of lawabidingthan what the average citizen faces Thats OK Those who enforce the law onthe rest of us ought to be more lawabiding than the average If the speedlimit is  mph offduty highway cops should drive at  even if  or  isclose enough for the rest of us If White House aides have to keep glancingover their shoulders to see if a Ken Starr is chasing them with a harpoon thatis no bad thing It might even be a nice tradition for the permanentindependent prosecutors office always to be run by someone from the opposingparty            We all have learned recently for example that evenoutright lying under oath in a deposition for a civil case is the kind of thingthat an ordinary citizen apparently does not often get prosecuted for thoughits not clear why notespecially when the liar is the defendant in the caseEven under a reformed independent prosecutor law a president would be more atrisk of prosecutionor at least of public exposure and humiliationfor thistransgression than the ordinary citizen Is that such a terrible thing            Some day there will be aRepublican president again and the Wall                Street                Journalwill rediscover all its objections to independent prosecutors Democratsmeanwhile will be glad the law is still around And who knows Sexualharrassment isnt unknown among Republicans either                           Michael Kinsley
