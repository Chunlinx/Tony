                well how do you feel about trial by jury   i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh   in what way   in that it seems to me theyre swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence thats presented i have uh very little regard for the law       thats presently practiced   i mean do you do you feel theyre theyre swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits   i was thinking primarily criminal cases   umhum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry   yes umhum thats a concern of mine uh i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing   umhum the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be uh i like the idea of juries of your peers um in that   umhum   you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the decision making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that   yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers   umhum   uh   id agree that thats thats definitely a problem   uh too often i think theyre not and uh when you you when you are   umhum   selecting a jury and youre doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have   umhum   you know thats a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh theyre not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased   umhum   uh now i happen to know several judges and theres one that id feel uncomfortable but has  doing sentencing without the jury         id feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either   umhum   you know the the plaintiff or the defendant the the full benefit of the law   umhum   and i guess thats what i am concerned with   yeah i i guess i i definitely agree with you but sentencing the well what i dont like about uh sentencing juries doing the sentencing in that   umhum   i think it becomes a lot less the the the the same crime gets unequal sentences   this is very true   i uh i i think there is more of an ability of you know you know selecting selecting selecting a jury two two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea  the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent   umhum umhum   but i think i think that thered that thered be a large variation in in trying to gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that that measure stick across the board   yeah and you do see such uneven uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean   umhum umhum   where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for something   umhum   uh   of course a lot of thats also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer   isnt that the truth   umhum   there are times when is it uh       oh goodness my minds gone blank it uh Othello you know where he says kill all the lawyers  every now and then one is tempted to feel that way   umhum yeah i agree   but i its taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of   umhum   you know amateur as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice   umhum oh yeah i i agree with it yeah they and theyll admit to you that they cannot dont have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their client client innocent or guilty its more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury   umhum   through argument that the   and theyre very effective too uh even ive been involved  slightly slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off   umhum umhum umhum   uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge so i dont know   yeah uh yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also thats thats new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
