               well so you you dont know too much about the Dallas Mavericks this this   no what where they at this year uh they win in their division     no they are uh only just a slightly a bit better than uh the other expansion teams theyre theyre theyre a team in disarray right now   uhhuh uhhuh do you do you have a season pass you go watch them or   actually i used to and i gave it up this year because i thought well Roy Tarpley wasnt going to make it and sure enough about a week after i decided not to buy my ticket he went down with his uh his drug problems   uhhuh huh   and uh boy the team just is going into a tailspin since then   yeah thats too bad im i guess id be most familiar with uh the Jazz   yeah   uh and ive never watched them but uh interestingly enough i i i got to meet Carl Malone   youre kidding   huhuh uh well it  i live about forty five miles from Jackpot Nevada   howd you manage that umhum   and uh its a town its a town where they uh have uh uh casinos and so forth and i guess thats one of his pastimes i caught him down there and he was playing the slot machines and uh yeah you know would you know it somebody like him he hit a five thousand dollar jackpot and then he turned around hit hit another two thousand dollar jackpot       and they came and took his picture and you know got the uh the IRS forms and stuff and he sat there and put all the money back into the machine lost every penny of it didnt bother him a bit   sound sounds like a real game huh   just yeah just doing it for enjoyment   well he must he must be a pretty big guy   it was incredible when he stood up he just towered he was a good foot above anybody in there   gee   and uh everybody everybody was uh kind of excited to see him and hes he oddly enough he was uh very friendly and cordial and stopped to sign a few things and   well its its its nice to see those those you know those kind of guys when they get paid all those big bucks to uh you know to be halfway friendly   so it was it was neat yeah umhum   but i know what you mean about talking about being big i mean thats when i was in high school i got i went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game im from Ohio and a friend of mine runs or used to run the clock down on the floor so hed let me get down on the floor at half time and i stood by these guys they all walked out and and gee whiz theyre just monsters   umhum   uhhuh   seven foot doesnt sound that tall but boy when you stand next to one  it it is real tall   yep yeah i hear you so   so if you you dont you dont get down to uh basketball games very often then   i dont no weve got a small of course this isnt professional basketball but uh the CSI Golden Eagles   umhum   i dont know if youve heard of them theyre theyre number theyre the number one junior college in the state in the nation excuse me   wow   and uh so theyre here and theyre kind of fun to go watch but uh uh thats thats the the most closest i get to in fact ive only seen one professional basketball game uh   so you didnt watch the all star game uh yesterday   i kind of watched it on television parts of it i didnt i didnt see the whole thing   yeah i i got out the weather was so nice here that i got out and didnt didnt see any of it   uhhuh uh yeah well well what do you think about Magic Johnson should he play or should he   well thats uh you you talking about the Olympics now   yeah i guess the summer Olympics is uh what they   yeah the summer Olympics is his next thing well i really you know its its his choice to play but theres a lot of other people you know the other teams choice not not to play against him i think hes gonna find a lot of people just say well heck im not going to worry you know im not gonna mess with that   yeah uhhuh yeah well i dont i think they that theyd feel that way too interestingly enough theyve kept a seat a seat open uh and he may even play in the in the tournament games for uh LA   are you serious   im serious i heard that the other day on a sports   how can how can they do that if he doesnt played the whole season   i i dont know i dont know i guess the rosters one man you know theres a hole there still   oh unless they yeah unless theyre just carrying a one odd guy instead of carrying the ten or eleven that they carry just carry one less   yeah right thats what theyve done   well i you know i didnt watch the game but a a friend of mine was telling me that he you know he played a lot but he he played then hed sit down then hed play and hed sit down and it wasnt like he was out there for twenty or thirty minutes at a at a go   and theres yeah no he wasnt and the the the part i saw is he he made the last shot of the game off balance three pointer and       i guess so   yeah once once uh he starts losing that weight and cant keep it on you know hell have to slow down and not not do that kind of stuff that thats got to be awful tough awful tough on his body   uhhuh yeah uhhuh well whens your Mavericks gonna do something   oh gee whiz  the the they are   they need more people they need a coach what do they need   they need players and and they need a front office that that can judge players weve traded away so many good players in the past five years and got nothing for them   players   and drafted so many bad players and you know they havent turned out   hm   its uh its very frustrating we had we had one year where we had two first round picks and we picked uh a guy by the name of Bill Wittington uh whos a seven foot center a white guy and Uvay Blob another seven foot white center and they are both okay but i think both of them are playing in the Italy now   hm   and they you know they they traded away Mark Aguirre and got nothing for him i mean he had to go but they they   umhum
