                    Background        Questions regarding the prevalence and severity of        healthcare worker reactions to natural rubber latex NRL        due to occupational exposure to NRL gloves have generated a        considerable body of research To date most studies have        concentrated on data collected using clinical        methodologies such as in vitro assays testing for the        prevalence of IgE antibodies or direct exposure tests        including skin prick and skin patch tests The results of        these efforts have produced varying and inconsistent        results estimating the rate of healthcare worker        sensitivity between  to            These        methods do not adequately address reactions actually        experienced on the job by healthcare workers because        sensitization does not equate to reactivity     As        sensitization data does not provide any information        regarding reactivity these data do not provide information        regarding the type or severity of reactions nor the        associated costs        One method that has recently been used to examine        reactions to NRL gloves in healthcare settings has been the        analysis of workers compensation data Unlike the varied        results of sensitization findings results from workers        compensation research have been more consistent across        studies The number of claims per  healthcare workers        in the states previously examined have ranged from a low of         in Minnesota to a high of  in Washington State        with average annual costs ranging from a low of  in        North Dakota to a high of  in Washington State per        covered healthcare worker              While these results are compelling further research is        needed to verify the generalizability of results across        states given the variability of workers compensation        systems which are administered on the state level The        current study extends this past research by investigating        claims from the state of Oregon over a year period This        makes this study the longest period over which NRL workers        compensation claims have been examined Additionally        Oregons workers compensation system adopted a specific        category for NRL glove reactions beginning in  making        this the first state analyzed with a code specifying        reactions to NRL                    Methods        Accepted healthcare worker workers compensation claim        data were provided by the Oregon Department of Consumer and        Business Information and Management Division for the period        of  Records were kept for all claims that were        disabling or potentially disabling ie those which have        either potential or actual lost work time involved        although records were available for some claims that did        not actually result in disability Because the claim data        for  was incomplete due to insufficient claim        maturation and consequently had missing data fields it        was excluded from the analysis in this report Oregon began        specific coding for NRL glove workers compensation claims        in June  and retroactively recoded some  claims as        NRL related after the coding change so the estimation        method for earlier years was supplemented with a specific        code for NRL reactions in these later years Data on costs        for potential NRL allergy claims for  and  were        provided by the Oregon Department of Business Information        and Management Division from the ongoing data files and        thus may not represent finalized costs for those two        years        The data set included information on claimant        occupation claimant demographics age and gender nature        of reported injury body part reported affected time off        taken by claimants and cost of claims It should be noted        that the claims provided by the state are confined to those        which resulted in either some form of medical payment        andor where there was lost time from work as a result of        the reported condition All dollar amounts coded in these        extracts are amounts paid out and do not include scheduled        but unpaid amounts All denied claims were excluded from        analysis Data on the Oregon healthcare worker population        was collected from the Oregon Labor Market Information        Systems Archival Current Employment Statistics        website        As Oregon did not specifically code for NRL reactions        due to glove use for most of this time period it was        necessary to estimate these conditions The first method        for identifying relevant claims was to identify claims        whose source was potentially allergic reactions due to        glove use The relevant source codes in the Oregon database        were unspecified items of clothing belts gloves        neckties and scarves and the aforementioned specific code        for NRL reactions The former two methods for identifying        source of injury information may capture claims unrelated        to NRL glove use and thus may overestimate the number of        NRL glove claims As all three might have captured claims        attributed to gloves but not due to NRL reactions the        nature of the condition associated with the claim was        examined as well Associated claim code numbers for these        conditions are listed in the Appendix see Additional File         Appendix        NRL glove reactions have been classified by medical        researchers into three basic categories             Irritant contact dermatitis which is not an allergic        reaction results in dry swollen andor irritated skin        This is the most common type of condition The two        remaining reaction types are allergic in nature Those        allergic reactions related to chemicals used in glove        processing are classified as Type IV and may result in        eczema open lesions and swelling Allergic reactions that        result from IgE mediated antibody response to specific NRL        allergens are classified as Type I and may result in        angioedema asthma rhinitis urticaria hives and        rarely anaphylaxis The nature of injury codes from the        Oregon workers compensation database was investigated for        any claim potentially attributable to NRL glove reaction        When the nature of injury was described as toxic effects        nonviral conjunctivitis any respiratory condition not        definitively attributable to infections or genetic        conditions and any disorders of the skin not definitively        attributable to infections the claims were included as        potentially resulting from NRL glove use Thus claims were        excluded only when the nature of injury was clearly not        related to NRL glove reaction such as infections        parasitic diseases sprains dislocations or carpal tunnel        syndrome The nature of injury codes used in the estimates        or that were used to specifically exclude claims are listed        in the Appendix        Examination of the probability of filing a claim was        tested through the use of logistic regression treating        each year as a sample and using the total healthcare worker        population in a given year as a weighting variable To test        whether there was an increase in expected claim costs over        time the natural logarithm of costs was regressed on year        of claim filing gender age and a series of dichotomous        variables for occupation To test whether there was an        increase in expected claim duration over time the natural        logarithm of time off work was regressed on year of claim        filing gender age and a series of dichotomous variables        for occupation Due to the small number of cases and the        possibility for collinearity in the predictor set subset        regressions were also run first with only age and year        entered then only gender and year entered then only the        set of occupational dummies and year entered The        logarithmic transformation was necessary to normalize the        distribution of the dependent variables both of which were        right skewed This transformation resulted in the        elimination of a small number data points for which the        dependent variables equaled zero Logistic regression using        the subsets was used to predict the zero values for these        dependent variables and none of the regressions were        significant All models were estimated using Stata         software                    Results        For the entire  period there were  total        estimated NRL glove claims reported These claims        demonstrated an average frequency of  per year from an        average healthcare worker population of  and        represented an overall average claim rate of  percent        or  claims per  Oregon healthcare workers over        the year period examined Additionally during this        time the average overall claim rate for all occupational        conditions experienced by healthcare workers during this        time was  annually of which the estimated NRL claim        rate constituted  percent of those claims Table        presents the breakdown of number of claims per year over        this time period as contrasted against number of healthcare        workers and number of workers compensation claims        To test if changes in claim rates were indicative of a        trend weighted logistic regression for grouped data was        employed to determine if there was a change in the logodds        ratio for claim filing over time with year of claim as a        predictor and the size of the healthcare worker population        as a weighting variable The odds ratio for year was          CI   p   indicating a        statistically significant increase in claims over time        These results were checked for robustness using negative        binomial models to predict whether the number of claims        were changing over time as opposed to the probability of        filing a claim and similar results were obtained with        respect to significance and estimated incidence rate        ratios However because of fluctuations in claim rates        across years ranging from zero in  to  in         relying on this estimate to predict future claim rates is        questionable        The highest proportion of estimated NRL glove claims          were filed by employees who worked in general        medical and surgical hospitals Workers in skilled nursing        care facilities filed the next highest number of claims          followed by employees in the offices and clinics of        dentists with   claims and employees in the        offices and clinics of doctors with   claims        Workers in nursingpersonal care facilities and in        intermediate nursing care facilities each filed          claims while workers employed in the offices and clinics        of health practitioners specialty hospitals        nonpsychiatric medical laboratories and allied health        services each filed   claim        With respect to occupation nurses filed  claims         followed by nursing aides and orderlies who filed         claims  dental assistants who filed  claims         clinical laboratory technicians who filed  claims         and maidshousemen who filed  claims  There        were  claims  for each of the occupations of        miscellaneous food preparers and laundry workers and         claim each  filed by therapists general office        clerks private household cleaners cooks and personal        service occupations Two claims were filed with no        occupation listed        The ages of claimants were widely distributed with         claims  made by healthcare workers between of         years of age  claims  by workers  years of        age  claims  by workers  years of age         claims  by workers  years of age and  claims         by employees  years of age        Of all claimants the majority   cited a form of        dermatitis as the primary nature of their condition Of        these dermatitis cases  reported unspecified dermatitis         reported contact dermatitis  reported allergic        dermatitis  reported unclassified dermatitis and         reported irritant dermatitis Of the remaining  claimants           reported disorders of the skin          reported urticaria   reported a nonspecified        allergic reaction   reported extrinsic asthma and        there was  claim each  specifying other unclassified        skin disorders allergic rhinitis poisoning and toxic        effects and illdefined symptoms These data are        summarized in Figure         The most common body part reported affected was the        hands  followed by multiple body parts         body system  multiple upper extremities         bronchus  internal chest  hands and fingers         hands and arms  and face  While         cases of skinrelated disorders were estimated to be        attributable to NRL glove use over the year period        there were  other claims by healthcare workers of skin        disorders filed that were attributed to sources other than        NRL gloves To this extent NRL glove use only contributed        to  of all healthcare worker claims citing skin        disorder as nature of condition experienced Only  cases        of asthma were reported from the use of gloves during the        year period representing an average of  cases of        asthma per  healthcare workers employed in Oregon per        year There were  claims of asthma from nonNRL related        sources reported during this time and thus potentially NRL        related asthma claims represented  of the total        healthcare worker asthma claims These data are summarized        in Figure         The mean number of days of lost work time for NRL glove        claims was  although the distribution of time off for        NRL glove claims was extremely right skewed as shown by        the median number of  days off Of all claimants          took no time off   took off between one        day and one week   took off between eight days and        two weeks   took off between  days and three        weeks and   took off between twentytwo days and        one month Of those who took over a month off work          took off between thirtyone days and two months          took off between  and  months   took off        between  months and  year and   took off more        than one year but less than two years There was  fatality        reported during this period which is not included in the        time off statistics In addition there were  other        claims in which time off information was not provided        For the entire period of  the total costs        associated with all estimated NRL glove claims was         The mean claim cost was  with the        median claim cost equaling  and the standard        deviation of the claim costs was  The summary of        claim costs over time is provided in Table         In total the weighted average cost per healthcare        worker employed in the state of Oregon amounted to         annually Using only the years with finalized costs         the weighted average cost per healthcare        worker was  annually Because the NRL cost data was        updated for  and  but the data of total healthcare        worker claim costs were not total claim costs were        compared to NRL glove claim costs limited to the period of         through  During this time the total claim cost        for all nonNRL related healthcare worker claim costs in        the state amounted to  while NRL costs        amounted to  and NRL costs thus represented         of all healthcare employee workers compensation costs        accrued in the state for the year period        To determine if the severity of claims was predictable        based on when a claim was filed or by characteristics of        the claimants multivariate regressions were estimated        Claim costs and time off work as proxies for condition        severity were the dependent variables and year of claim        filing gender age and occupation were the predictors        These predictors were not related to claim costs overall        model p   or time off work overall model p                 To examine how the claims from NRL glove use compared to        other commonly used items in Oregon healthcare settings        the claims were contrasted against claims arising from        other sources of claims in the  period It was        found that the number of NRL claims  were slightly        higher than for those made arising from the use of office        and business machinery  but less than those from        tanks vats and bins  cleaning tools  tables and        worktables  pots pans and trays  bags sacks        and totes  boxes crates and cartons  and        carts dollies and handtrucks                     Discussion        The results of the Oregon analysis extend the findings        from previous NRL workers compensation studies conducted        in other states with different workers compensation        systems Overall there was an average of  claims        annually per  healthcare workers employed in the        state which is similar to previous annual NRL glove claim        prevalence rates of between  and  claims per         workers While there was some statistical evidence of an        increasing claim rate over time the variation between        years and small number of claims in any given year with        the highest number being  in  casts doubt on whether        this increase holds any predictive value This increase in        workers compensation claims in more recent years is        consistent with data from Minnesota but is inconsistent        with results from North Dakota Washington and Rhode        Island Possible explanations for the slight increase in        claims over time include the greater number of healthcare        workers regularly using gloves dissemination of        information on NRL allergy among healthcare workers and        increased diagnosis of NRL reactions by physicians                   The annual cost per employed healthcare worker of         over the  years examined in Oregon was also similar to        previous NRL workers compensation findings which ranged        from  to  The costs associated with NRL glove        claims were generally low and although high costs were        associated with several claims the mean cost per claim was         averaged to just  per healthcare worker per        year and in total constituted only  of all healthcare        worker claim costs for the period of         Multivariate regression with controls for gender age and        occupation did not show an increasing trend in cost per        claim or time off work per claim The evidence thus does        not support a hypothesis of increased reaction severity as        indexed by claim costs and time off over the twelve years        examined        Consistent with past NRL workers compensation studies        most claimants reported experiencing some form of skin        condition while only  cases of asthma were reported over        the year period While some researchers have        hypothesized that aerosolized NRL allergens bound to glove        powder may result in extensive allergic reactions        primarily manifested as asthmatic response in healthcare        environments other studies examining empirical data have        found little evidence of this effect       The        current study which specifically addresses reactivity        rather than sensitization extends the previous findings        showing a low correspondence between NRL glove use and        asthmatic reactions Indeed potential NRLrelated asthma        claims represented only  of all healthcare worker        respiratory claims and averaged less than  case per         healthcare workers per year in the state of Oregon        Workers compensation analyses in four other states have        shown similarly low rates of NRLrelated respiratory        claims        Oregon is the only state to date where workers        compensation data has recorded a fatality due to NRL        reaction Consistent with previous studies in Minnesota and        Washington State there were a small number of serious        reactions The majority of claims were relatively minor in        nature with  of claimants reporting no time off from        work and  taking less than a month off work The NRL        glove claims were also compared to different sources of        healthcare employee workers compensation claims and not        found to be a greater source of occupational injury than        other products and items frequently used in healthcare        facilities        Workers compensation analyses have several inherent        limitations First it is possible that some individuals        who experienced a reaction to NRL did not file workers        compensation claims so these claim prevalence rates should        not be construed as direct estimates of reaction prevalence        rates Given that many claimants had relatively low dollar        amounts for claims this may not be a substantial        limitation as it appears that even in cases where minor        costs were incurred claims were reported Additionally it        is possible that the claim rate may overstate the number of        true NRL reactions because symptoms commonly reported as        NRL related are also potentially the result of other        causes This is suggested by studies showing a low        correspondence between selfreported diagnosis of NRL        reactions and positive RAST or skin prick tests for NRL        sensitization       Because Oregon primarily        records claims with lost work time it is also possible        that individuals who may have experienced minor reactions        were not included This may explain the discrepancy found        between Oregon and Washington State which does collect        data on claims involving no lost work time An alternative        explanation for the discrepancy is the fact that Oregon has        more specific coding for potential NRL reactions        Secondly it should be noted that this paper deals        exclusively with medical and indemnity costs associated        with claims and does not reflect costs related to        retraining and other accommodations for NRLreactive        employees It is also possible that individuals who        experienced a reaction may have switched from the        healthcare occupation the healthy worker effect        However there is no reason to believe that these        individuals would not avail themselves of workers        compensation for lost work time before switching so this        healthy worker effect should not substantially affect the        claim prevalence rates reported in this study The cost of        turnover and replacement of these workers however would        not be captured in the data                    Conclusions        This study examined Oregon healthcare industry workers        compensation data over a year period to determine the        prevalence and costs associated with NRL glove claims This        is the longest period of time over which workers        compensation data related to NRL reactions have been        analyzed The results were similar to those obtained in        other analyses of workers compensation data from other        states As in these other states there were generally few        claims related to NRL reactions and with few exceptions        most claims were not severe in nature However there were        a small number of more serious claims including one        reported fatality The results showed that the vast        majority of cases were dermal in nature and little        evidence was found to suggest pervasive respiratory or        ocular reactions related to NRL Future research should        continue to examine workers compensation data in assessing        NRL allergy because of the ability to determine number and        types of reactions compare reaction outcomes across        demographic categories and eventually develop risk        predictive models of NRL allergy with respect to actual        reactivity From these results potential costbenefit        analyses of NRL glove use can be developed to aid in policy        development and implementation                    Competing interests        This study was funded by Allegiance Healthcare
