Texas or is that just like a stereotype because its the south   um i think its pretty popular  i mean it is probably like a huge stereotype but i think its pretty popular too what kind of music do you like   is it oh um well i used to not really like country that much but i think but what my dad really likes it   uhhuh   and i used to listen to that and the older i got the more it you know i i can listen to it but um i prefer um  um hm groups like i like um Firehouse   uhhuh   and Slaughter  and um Scorpions um the Scorpions   uhhuh so you like more hard rock yeah   yeah yeah but i also like the top forty too and i really like the oldies station like um fifties music   uhhuh really   yeah and and um The Doors are pretty good too i can listen to them and The Who i i really like all kinds i   uhhuh thats how i am too do you like any rap music   um no thats about the only kind i dont get into is like rap and like classical and um   yeah i dont either   jazz is all right but um like the blues and stuff like that i i like to dance and if its like a upbeat you know good song then then ill listen to it and if im out you know dancing then makes it better to listen to   uhhuh so you like mostly like uh do you like hard rock the best   yeah um theres this station called The Blaze from Chicago and thats my favorite  because they yeah they play um all different kinds of um harder rock   really uhhuh well im from Dallas and uh   umhum oh ive been there hm umhum   have you they have hard rock stations there i dont even think they have a hard rock station in Lubbock i pretty sure they dont if they if they do ive never come across it   oh really no umhum   but they only have i mean they dont have really its really small and uh  they dont have that really many radio you know like top forty stations even   oh really uh oh yeah oh thats neat uhhuh me too  yeah   yeah its more like a college town so yeah because im in college   cool so um i mean i  dont think gah they had a i dont think they do have a hard rock station here   hm   see you dont here very often and you  never have like bands come you never have them like come up to were up here you know     oh really we get a lot like at the bars because um we have a lot of like bands that form by themselves like from Milwaukee and Chicago trying to get started you know to the big top and yeah   oh really see thats great you would never see that here no i dont think you would   oh really uhhuh i think a lot of music has to do with like you know the type of people you hang around with and especially your environment like you know the settings like the bigger cities you get more variety i think you know   yeah see yeah see i think most people listen to country up here being its so far like in the panhandle of Texas and stuff   oh yeah uh ive gotten to like um a couple of songs from Garth Brooks   do you i know hes great i like him a lot   yeah i i just um heard of him this year my boyfriend um he uh likes some types of country music and he was listening to that and it   uhhuh see i only know very few too even i mean i only know like Garth Brooks and like George Straight and a few of the top the really good guys i like Garth Brooks i really like him hes really good   umhum yeah yeah i ive liked most the songs i heard so that was good   uhhuh you have to kind of get used to it though because i didnt like country western really for a while and even when i came up here i didnt listen to it until like last year then i started listening to it a lot and then then you like it a lot   yeah same here oh yeah uh i just started um listening to it too because my boyfriend but yeah after i heard it a while at first i didnt like it and then i heard it and then im like oh this isnt so bad you know its its you know upbeat and you know i got into it and i saw on TV one time um they were playing Garth Brooks and they were um showing how to country dance to it and it looked so fun because like i say i like to dance and it was just really neat   oh really uhhuh oh yeah you would like two stepping then   yeah it it looked fun im like oh i wanna learn now   i know i wanted to i wanna learn to because we can do it
