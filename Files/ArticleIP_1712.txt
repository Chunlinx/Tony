                                             The worlds press is stillfar from agreeing on a name for it Monicagate seems to be quite popularhaving been used in countries as far apart as India the Asian Age and France Libration But the Parisevening newspaper FranceSoir calls it Sexgate and the Italiannewspapers have generally plumped for the even more ludicrous SexygateZippergate was taken up by the Irish Sunday Independent  The seriousGerman newspapers which tend to avoid catch lines anyway are calling itnothing at all while the British ones have so far sensibly resisted gates ofany kind using straightforward catch lines like The White House Scandal orThe Clinton Scandal But the British Sunday tabloids excelled themselves bymanaging to demean even a sleazy sex scandal with revolting frontpageheadlines of which perhaps the worst was in the Sunday People IllGive You My Baby Gravy            Monday was a day on whichthe European pundits who hadnt yet managed to get their hands on the storyrushed to have their belated say many of them posing as Old Worldsophisticates bewildered by the simpleminded puritanism of the United StatesIn La Repubblica ofRome its main female columnist Natalia Aspesi wrote Seen from Italy the drama which is imprisoningClinton and his loyal wife which is endangering not only his presidency buteven the economy and politics of the United States if not of the entireplanet appears an amusing absurd and incomprehensible triviality Ourpresidents and prime ministers have never had such problems partly becausethey are almost always Christian Democrats or at any rate very Catholic atleast in words and partly because they are almost always ugly and old andshadowed by energetic wives who do not permit them any distractions or theyare widowers pledged to chastity But if they did commit such indiscretionsshe added they would be much more popular            InLa Stampa of TurinItaly Gabriele Romagnoli wrote that even Houdini couldnt have got himself outof Clintons mess because America could not have tolerated the commonplacenature of his offence A society based on hypocrisy can forgive the sins whichdont belong to it those which it dreams of committing but not those which itcommits every day he explained            In the conservative Daily Telegraph of London Barbara Amiel the Canadiancolumnist who is married to the newspapers Canadian proprietor Conrad Blackwrote in an oped article headlined Stop this madness that Clinton was avictim of political correctness It has come to this the natural desire of ayoung woman for an aggressive handsome and powerful middleaged man and thereciprocal pleasure that such a man has in the flattering attention of a prettyyoung girlthese totally mutual and consensual instincts that are built intothe human psyche whether one likes it or nothave created a tempest in theUnited States that could lead to a constitutional crisis Indeed this naturallibidinous reaction could well have a major impact on the lives ofPalestinians Israelis and Iraqis not to mention the world economy            Aftersaying that the one great contribution that Clinton could make would be toexpose the sexual political correctness that distorts our law and our livesAmiel concluded One wonders what Mrs Clinton is really feeling through allthis as she manages Bills defence team My own view is that like LorenaBobbitt she is sharpening the knife to remove the one major impediment thatstands between her and her shadow presidency            The presidents member featured as a subject in numeroustasteless cartoons One on the front page of Corriere dellaSera of Milan showed Bill lying disconsolately in a double bed besideHillary who is saying So its the dollar thats dropped then The liberalGuardian of Londonhad a cartoon on its editorial page showing Monica Lewinsky dragging Clinton byhis penis off his presidential pedestal into a throng of hystericalknifewaving enemies Beside it the papers editorialtitled Tellthe truth Hillarysaid the first lady needs to tell Americans why sheis still standing by her manwhy the peace and prosperity of the s are anachievement for which he deserves credit She persuaded her nation why BillClinton was fit to be president once before She needs to do so again And shecannot afford to fail            In Israel the daily Haaretz reported fromWashington Sunday that the Clinton sex scandal might trigger a wave ofantiSemitism in the United States It quoted an official of theAntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith as saying that the fact that the fate ofthe administration hung on the word of a yearold Jewish woman had alreadyproduced accusations of a Jewish conspiracy against the American people onInternet sites operated by radical rightwing and white supremacistorganizations Another Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot  commented Weused to think in all good faith that the fate of the peace process was in thehands of a Jew born in Prague calling herself Madeleine Albright Apparentlyits in the hands of another Jew Monica Lewinsky born in Beverly Hills            Monday Haaretzpublished an oped article by Danny Rubinstein saying In the Arab world andamong the Palestinians many people believe that because Monica Lewinsky isJewish the Washington sex scandal is nothing but another stunt by the IsraeliMossad intended to distract the attention of the American public and ofPresident Bill Clinton away from the peace process In East Jerusalem onSaturday you could hear perfectly serious people saying the timing of the newscandal could not possibly be a coincidence According to that version theIsraelis were alarmed by the possibility the president might take aproPalestinian stance and quickly cooked up the new sex scandal            The daily El Pas of Madrid devoted a wholecolumn to the unpromising scandal of Domingogatea story from its Washington correspondent about howMonicas mother Marcia Lewis had included in the
