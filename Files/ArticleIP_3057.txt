                                 The Theory of Everything            In his Dictionary  Samuel Johnson derided the idea that a dictionary canembalm his language and secure it from corruption and decay that it is in hispower to change sublunary nature and clear the world at once from follyvanity and affectation Few people today know what he meant by the lovelyword sublunary  Literally it means beneath the moon and Johnson wasalluding to an ancient widespread belief that there was an unbreachabledivision between the cosmos thought to be pristine lawful and unchangingand our grubby chaotic Earth below The division was already obsolete byJohnsons time Newton had shown that a single set of laws pulled the appletoward the ground and kept the moon in its orbit around Earth            EOWilson has chosen another lovely but littleknown word consilience  asthe title and theme of his new book Literally jumping together consiliencemeans the linking of facts and theory across disciplines into a single coherentsystem of explanation That sounds innocuous but it has a radical implicationthat the divisions between nature and society matter and mind biology andculture and the sciences and the humanities arts and social sciences are asobsolete as the division between the sublunary and supralunary spheres            For centuries the progress of science has been a story ofincreasing consilience The collapse of the wall between the terrestrial andcelestial was followed by a collapse of the once equally firm and now equallyforgotten wall between the past when divine cataclysms were supposed to haveshaped the earth and the present with its seemingly permanent mountains andoceans Less than a century after Johnson the geologist Sir Charles Lyellshowed that todays Earth could have been sculpted by everyday erosionearthquakes and volcanoes acting in the past over immense spans of time Theliving and nonliving too no longer occupy different realms Two centuriesbefore Lyell physician William Harvey showed the human body to be a machinethat uses hydraulics and other mechanical principles Lyells contemporary theGerman chemist Friedrich Whler showed with his synthesis of urea that thestuff of life is not a magical gel but ordinary compounds following the laws ofchemistry Charles Darwin showed how the astonishing diversity of life and itsubiquitous signs of design could arise from the physical process of the naturalselection of replicators Gregor Mendel and then James D Watson and FrancisCrick showed how replication itself could be understood in physical terms            ForWilson the final chasm that separates biology from the humanities will bebridged by an understanding of human nature that comes from neurosciencepsychology and evolutionary biology Human thoughts and feelings are patternsof activity of the brain whose design is a product of natural selection Thebrain was engineered as a dynamic neural computer that calculated thestrategies of survival and reproduction needed by our evolutionary ancestorsAs humans discovered things about their world and each other and shared thesediscoveries and as they instituted conventions and rules to coordinate theirdesires the phenomenon called culture arose            Culture and society then are not autonomousforces but products of minds interacting with one another and culture evolvedalong with the brain Sociology and anthropology are the study of the productsof the human tendency to form clans partnerships and coalitions Economicsideally would be based on real human preferences and decisionmaking strategiesrather than the idealized rational agent assumed by economists todayLiterature comes from peoples obsession with universal lifeanddeath themessuch as kinship danger and rivalry Art depends on an innate eye for optimalhabitats and forms and on the biases of our visual systems Morality comesfrom the sense of empathy and the internalized standards that allow people tolive harmoniously in groups            Sciencestudents often experience the exhilarating realization that the laws of thewhole world fit together Wilson refers to that blessed state as the IonianEnchantment after the  th century BC founder of the physicalsciences Thales of Ionia Like many scientists Wilson had an IonianEnchantment as a student but Consilience comes from a secondenchantment he experienced in the s when he was already an esteemedentomologist Click to see how he uses entomologythe ultimate multiculturalcurriculumto open his readers eyes to the dependence of human culture onhuman nature Evolutionary biologists had recently worked out the implicationsof Darwins theory for the social lives of organisms Former paradoxes ofanimal behavior such as cooperation sexuality aggression pacifism andcommunication were being increasingly understood in terms of the naturalselection of genes Wilson wrote a famous book in  called SociobiologyThe New Synthesis  and he later extended it with bits of psychology andmathematical modeling to yield a theory he called geneculturecoevolution            Not everyone was enchanted Angry critics charged that ifthe mind had an innate structure different people or classes sexes andraces could have different innate structures justifying discrimination Theysaid that if obnoxious behaviors such as aggression and clannishness wereinnate that would make them natural and hence good or even if bad theywould be in the genes and hence unchangeable subverting hopes for socialreform They said that if behavior were caused mainly by the genes individualscould not be held responsible for their actions Some of these scholarsexpressed their disagreement by dousing Wilson with a pitcher of water at ascientific convention yelling for his dismissal over bullhorns urging peopleto bring noisemakers to his lectures and publishing righteous manifestoes andsarcastic booklength denunciations            In factmany of the accusationsfor example that he was really trying to justify malephilanderingwere simply preposterous and others could be countered easilyInnate similarities do not imply innate differences Genetically influencedbehavior is not necessarily good and not necessarily unchangeable Explanationsof bad behavior that appeal to genes do not absolve a person any more than doexplanations that appeal to upbringing            Life has been kinder to Wilson since then Hewon two Pulitzers for On Human Nature   and The Ants  His articulate advocacy of biodiversity and his graceful autobiography Naturalist   changed his image in the popular press from bad guyto good guy His insights on sociobiology minus the inflammatory connotationshave become widely accepted in new fields such as behavioral ecology andevolutionary psychology            The tidehas turned so much that one might wonder whether Wilson needs to make such afuss about the unity of knowledge I can confirm he does for I have tried toconvey the same Ionian Enchantment in my recent book How the Mind Works Anyonewho thinks that consilience is banal or obvious is invited to read my debates with thesociologist Alan Wolfe in                   Slate                and with the biologist StevenRose in Edge Or click to read my summary of Wolfes and Rosespositions            Even readers who share Wilsons worldview will find much toprovoke them I felt Wilson was sometimes too complacent in seeing humanfoibles such as irrational spiritual beliefs as evolutionarily adaptive Iwas not persuaded that moral statements can be reduced to psychology as if thedisapproval of murder were just another human taste like the preference forsweet over bitter foods Even a diehard Ionian might think that our moralsense evolved to grasp a logic of morality that is outside our minds in thesame sense that our number sense evolved to grasp mathematical truths that areoutside our minds I was unconvinced that a case for preserving speciesdiversity can rest on our innate love of a speciesrich savannalike ancestralenvironment I fear that if it meant avoiding widespread economicdislocations most people would be happy to consummate their desire to communewith plants and animals with a visit to a golf course stocked with a few pandasand eagles For this reason the concluding chapter which urges urgentintervention to stop environmental degradation felt out of placethough it isthe most thoughtful and persuasive such argument I have seen                           Consilience is in anycase an excellent book Wilson provides superb overviews of Westernintellectual history and of the current state of understanding in many academicdisciplines Though he forcefully presses his case toward a conclusion manywill find radical the tone is calm and respectful and the writing style gentleand inviting                           If youmissed the links within this review click  to how EO Wilson uses hisknowledge of
