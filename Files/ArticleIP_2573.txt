                                 Monica and Me            I can imagine you sayingWhats Monica to him or he to Monica But in fact we are quite close            For onething I am her neighbor I live in the East building of the Watergate complexand she lives in the South building It is said that she lives with hermother nextdoor to Sen Bob Dole From the deck of my apartment I can lookacross the plaza less than a hundred yards at the Dole apartment So Isuppose I can look at Monicas apartment            Doles presence is manifest A picture of him getting ahaircut is on the wall of the Watergate barbershop Sometimes when in theswimming pool I have seen the senator on his terrace and exchanged a word withhim Two years ago before the presidential election campaign I met him comingout of the drugstore and used the occasion to advise him that cutting taxes wasnot a winning issue He did not take my advice and now he is known chiefly asMonica Lewinskys neighbor            I dontthink I have ever seen Monica There are always several young girls many ofthem students at nearby George Washington University buying food at theWatergate Safeway Monica the overage Lolita may have been one of thembutof course I would not have singled her out for attention before the publicityIn fact I dont think I could pick her out in a group of girls evennowunless she were embracing President Clinton Him I would recognize            When I come out of my apartment I usually see agroup of photographers waiting near the entrance to Watergate South hoping toget a glimpse of her There used to be  or  Now there are four or fiveSome days there are none As I write this on Palm Sunday there are nonePerhaps she has gone to California for Passover Maybe now that the PaulaJones case has been thrown out the paparazzi will leave her alone andshe will feel free to go to Safeway            The photographers bringfolding chairs They seem in no hurry On rainy days they sit under umbrellasand wrap their cameras in plastic I saw one photographer whom I knew slightlyand asked if he had sighted her He had been there for three days and had notIn fact I have never seen her on television coming out of the Watergate but Imay just have missed it            I wonderif the work of these photographers is in the GDP Of course it wouldnt beThey are an input The output will be a shot on television of Monica and thevalue of that will be in the GDP Someone evidently thinks this valuewill exceed the cost of keeping the photographers on guard And who will paythat cost Why you and I TV watchers will pay via the soft drinks and carsand toothpaste we buy            But residential proximity is not my only connection toMonica I am a member of the Cosmos Club a rather conservativesome would saystuffyclub in an old mansion on Massachusetts Avenue The membership is alsopretty old although not as old as the mansion William Ginsburg Monicaslawyer stays there when he is in Washington He is not a member of the Cosmosbut does belong to a club in Los Angeles with which the Cosmos has reciprocalarrangements He has met with Monica at the Cosmos and once had an interviewwith Barbara Walters there Naturally this brought the press crowding aroundthe entrance In fact one pressed so close his foot was run over by Monicaslimousine There was no serious damage however reporters are a hardy lotTheres probably a Pulitzer in it for him One reporter tried to get into theclub by tapping a connection with a friend who is a member but he was refusedadmission on the reasonable grounds that he wasnt wearing a necktie            Therehasnt been so much excitement around the club since a vote was taken  yearsago to allow women to become members One member who had voted no on thatoccasion was heard to say See you admit women and the next thing you knowyou have people like Monica Lewinsky and Barbara Walters hanging around Buton the whole the members took the excitement with good humor and were amusedby the irony of the difference in culture between the Cosmos Club and the OvalOffice            Igave a lecture on the American economy in TelAviv Israel last month I did not mention Monica in my lecture but the firstquestion I was asked was how President Clinton could do his job with all thedistractions caused by the Monica Lewinsky affair I gave my stock answer Inthe first place we dont know the truth in the second place the presidencyis not a person but a team Presumably some members of the team such as thesecretary of the treasury and the secretary of state were not that distractedI had my own experience during the Nixon administration of carrying ondespite swirling scandal            Later I thought the subjectrequired more analysis One had to separate the relationship whatever it wasbetween Monica et al and the president before it hit the headlines from whathappened afterward I remember that some people complained President Eisenhowerwas distracted from the business of his office because he was out playing golfso much But we were told and I think most people accepted the explanationthat golf relaxed Ike from the stresses of his job and enabled him to performbetter A similar explanation was offered but privately to some in the presswho were aware of President Kennedys sexual conduct Perhaps Clintonsrelationships can be justified in the same way That would assume of coursethat the president did not feel any psychological stress from realizing he wasbehaving in what many people regard as an immoral way That apparently was noproblem for Kennedy About Clinton we dont know            After the allegedrelationship became public property the situation was different Certainlythere was much distraction at that point What we have to ask however iswhether that was a bad thing Would it be better for the president and thefirst lady too for that matter to be able to give their undivided attentionto getting America across that bridge into the next millennium than it is tohave them distracted by the Monica affair Im not sure
