                                 Dick Armey            You better not try tostand in my way as Im walkin out the door Take this job and shove itI aintworkin here no moreJohnny Paycheck            Whatpolitician enjoyed the Fourth of July holiday more than Dick Armey While hiscolleagues were out hustling for campaign dollars and marching in stickyhotparades the Houses majority leader was casting for bass on an Army Corps ofEngineers lake just northwest of Dallas humming a Hank Williams tune            At least thats what weve come to expect given thepersona Armey has cultivated a plainspeaking countrymusicloving guy whowould to quote the bumper sticker rather be fishing than putting up withWashingtons political BS This Iaintmuchatspeechifyin  image hasserved Armey well in his surprising rise through the ranks of the HouseRepublican leadership setting him apart from other politicians and making himseem personable But it has cost him respect            Is Armeyjust one step away from the speakership Or is he the only thing keeping thedebilitated Newt Gingrich in power The moderates in the GOP caucus such asthey are find Armey too conservative and outspoken to serve as speaker whilethe hardliners say hes too ineffective a spokesman to replace GingrichHaving already paid too high a political price for Gingrichs failingsRepublican incumbents dont want another headache leading the party            Hence GOP insiders are taking Armey down a fewpegs Arianna Huffington bicoastal proprietress of the Republican politicalsalon took a break from her endless campaign against Gingrich to attack hisheir apparent in one of her recent opeds Calling Armey Newt Gingrichs bestinsurance policy she accused him of duplicity in defending Gingrich whensimply everyone knows dahling that the GOP needs new leadership It is hightime Huffington wrote for some young Turks to recognize that there aremoments when appeasement is more destructive than warand to strike            Armey hasbeen dismissed beforebeginning with his first run for Congress in  Ageeky economics professor with a Midwestern accent challenging an entrenchedTexas Democrat Armey was given no chance of winning Soon after capturing whatwould become a safe seat he fathered one of the unlikeliest pieces oflegislation to emerge from Congress a bill creating an apolitical process forclosing obsolete military bases In  he surprised fellow Republicans bychallenging GOP Conference Chairman Jerry Lewis RCalif a party insider andknown conciliator and took his job from him In  asked whether he wouldrun for the minority whip post in the  th Congress Armey toldeveryone including an incredulous Dick Gephardt in a limousine ride back fromthe White House that he expected to be the next majority leader He may havebeen grinning but he wasnt joking            But Armeys refusal to play the Washington gameto dinewith media stars or golf with lobbyistsmakes him an outsider And he pays forthis lack of political refinement as the political oddsmakers portray him as aboorish ideologue and rhetorical bumbler prone to such Armey Axioms as Youcant put your finger on a problem when youve got it to the wind            DamagingArmey further is his contemptuous relationship with the press He rarely givesdirect answers to unfriendly questions although hes always good for a fewbizarre Dan Rather Texasisms Instead of giving artful nonanswers to toughquestionsa prerequisite talent for politiciansArmey usually lets fly asmartaleck comment that gets him in trouble Soon after becoming majorityleader he referred to Rep Barney Frank DMass as Barney Fag But after ashaky first few months in charge Armey settled in as the Houses relativelyeffective chief operating officer            In recent weeks a series of Republicanlegislative misplays has increased skepticism about whether Armey can bespeaker Most of the fault lies with Gingrich The speaker has been consideredpolitically dead for so long that most folks talk about him as a quaint memoryBut as Huffington noted Armey has not acquitted himself well with his effortto keep up appearances            Still suppose Armey werepassed over for the job Consider the rest of the Republican leadership            Majority Whip Tom DeLayanother Texan is Armeys oppositethe Republican Jim Wright RankandfileRepublicans fear DeLay and respect his political abilities but they dont likehim or trust him as much as they do Armey            John Boehner a slick butlikable Ohioan who chairs the House Republican Conference is as adept atplaying the Washington game as is DeLaybefriending reporters making googooeyes at lobbyists passing around campaign contributions on the House flooretc But hes more comfortable behind the scenes pencil him in as the nextwhip            BillPaxon a Gingrich minion at the National Republican Congressional Committeethe partys fundraising and spending apparatus that helped win the House forthe GOP in  is enthusiastic and smart but doesnt seem tough enough to bespeaker The classic sidekick even to his wife Susan Molinari Paxon isbeing talked about as the next majority leader Call him Armeys goodcopcounterpart            Which leaves us with Armey Knowing that hes close togetting the job hes started to cultivate a more conciliatory image But asofter Dick Armey is a tall order and its resulted in more verbal gaffes andmore unseemly backpedaling On a recent Meet the Press  the New Dickagonized over the question of human rights in China but then reached theconclusion that free trade is a basic human right and voted as usual for MFNstatus            What toexpect from Speaker Armey He doesnt waffle Throughout his political careerhe has focused on freemarket economic principles unrestricted trade lowtaxes less government regulation Unlike Sen Phil Gramm RTexas anotherformer economics professor Armey has avoided budget hypocrisy by eschewing thepork barrelsome of the military bases he closed were in his state He took onfarm subsidies He was proflat tax before flat tax was cool And his advocacyof the flat tax isnt just some Gingrichian intellectual dalliance aGephardtian populist pose or even a Forbesian attempt to pocket a few millionmore bucks a year            Holding fast to ones beliefs has never been adesirable trait in congressional leaders Yet it would be unwise to count Armeyout Even Republican loyalists would agree that anybody is better thanGingrich whose imagesoftening efforts consist of photo ops with furryanimals Armey prefers his wildlife flailing at the end of a baited hook Thosewho worry about how the ruffian image will play should Armey become speaker canrest easy As both angler and politician one Armey admirer told me
