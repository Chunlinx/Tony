                                 Piano Forte            The tell us a lot about thisrecording First a superbly voiced Eflat major chord with every instrumentaudible the winds biting through the string sound the timpani crisp yetviscerally forceful Then the soloist begins his famous heroic surge up thekeyboard Except that he doesnt sound heroic he sounds tinkly His fingerwork is impeccable his phrasing elegant his stance as swaggering as one couldwish but the sound of his instrumenta fortepiano an earlier less powerfulversion of our modernday pianois irreconcilably at odds with hisintentions            Theoriginal instrument movement is several decades old and has moved so farbeyond mere novelty that in some repertoires it might even be considered thenew orthodoxy Bach performance in the style of those old GrandTeutonsconductors like Furtwngler Klemperer and von Karajanhas fallenout of fashion and favor and massed Victorian armies raising the rafters asthey belt out The                Messiah now seem quaintly anachronistic            In music of the  th century though the use oforiginal instruments is still controversial Do they reveal the composersintentions or merely demonstrate the practical limitations against which hestruggled Keyboard music poses the question in its starkest terms Was the th century concert grand developed in response to the music beingcomposed by Beethoven and his contemporaries in order to realize its potentialmore fully or was the Romantic style of keyboard writing itself a response tothe sound of these new instruments            Thesearent idle questions When Beethoven was sent a Broadwood grand as a gift fromits British manufacturer in  he maneuvered to avoid paying import dutiesincidentally he was delightedwith both the gift and the instrument Itsnot unreasonable to assume that he considered it a superior medium for theperformance of his music even music composed before he received the gift            Robert Levin the fortepiano soloist on thisrecording and a respected musical scholar assumes otherwise As he makes hisway through the cycle of Beethoven concertos he plans to use differentinstruments for the different pieces determining the compass of eachinstrument he employs by the range of notes each piece demands He believes ashe put it in a conversation with me recently that no matter the size of theroom Beethoven always insists on banging his head on the ceiling and stubbinghis toe on the floor This is elegantly put and close to inarguable IfBeethoven had a fiveandahalf octave instrument at his disposal the music hewrote for it probably would demand the highest and the lowest notes of thatfiveandahalf octave span But does it necessarily follow that the instrumentavailable to him on any given occasion produced the ideal sound he heard in hishead            Thisquestion is more pointed for the Emperor  concerto than it might be forits predecessors Although not the first grandly heroic pianoconcertoMozarts K  arguably merits that descriptiontheEmperor  proclaimed its grandeur in an especially aggressive way andin so doing became the model for concertos of the Romantic era The dramainherent in concerto performancevaliant soloist vying with and defying themass of the orchestra with his eloquence and virtuosityis the very essence ofthe Emperor  One would think it requires an instrument that canchallenge the orchestra in volume and power To play the piece on a fortepianoseems almost perverse            That said it must also be said that no other performancecould have offered a better opportunity to decide whether Levin is rightGardiners conducting is so good his Beethoven Symphony cycle is to my earsthe one to own and his Mozart and Handel performances are exemplary Levinsplaying is so dexterous intelligent and ardent and the recording is sotechnically splendid there are felicities of scoring such as a solo celloline in the first movement Id never noticed before that whatever itspeculiarities this release at least qualifies as best of breed            And how does it fare In thelyrical sections it works superbly most of the second movement say and thebeautiful B minorC flat major section of the first movements second subjectprojected with supple delicacy by Levin In the filigree figures accompanyingtransitional passages in the first movement or the dialogue with the Frenchhorns near the end of the same movement its close to a revelation This Ifound myself thinking must be the precise blend Beethoven intended            But in theheroic passages that define the work it doesnt succeed for me at all Thecadenza that opens the concerto sounds wan and unassertive its even moreextravagant recapitulation tries harder while achieving less The greatfouragainstthree contrarymotion chromatic scales one of the most thrillingvirtuoso passages in the literature are bland in spite of Levins awesomeexecution And in the battle of block chords toward the end of the developmentsection the piano comes off as strident rather than imperial as it attempts torival the orchestra            This performance contains one other oddityworth noting Levin accompanies the orchestra continuostyle during the tuttisectionspassages when the soloist is normally silent This is a controversialpractice even in Mozart concertos and unheard of in  th centuryworks In his liner notes and more elaborately in our conversation Levinclaims the manuscript score makes Beethovens intentions unambiguous on thispoint His argument is persuasive but the conclusion is socounterintuitivewhy should the soloist meekly accompany the orchestra when heisnt defying itthat I remain unconvinced His contributions in thesepassages are largely unobtrusiveand in a medium without a visual componentnot especially bothersomebut the choice nevertheless seems eccentric            The other piece on therecording the Fantasy for Pianoforte Chorus and Orchestra                in CMinor Op  a hastily written occasional composition with amusingpremonitions of Symphony No   is not one of Beethovens more inspiredcreations But the performance is splendid Levin and Gardiner are powerfuladvocates for a work whose position in the repertory has historically beentenuous            Its impossible to arrive atany general conclusions about what sorts of instruments are right forBeethovens keyboard music Its true that different pieces benefit fromdifferent treatment the Op  sonatas for example dont need a sound sourceidentical to the Hammerklavier  And the coming originalinstrumentperformances of the remaining concertos from Levin and Gardiner promise to berevelatory Butand Levin is likely to find this praise more infuriating thanany criticismhad he chosen to play his Emperor  on a Steinway or aBosendorfer he might have given us one of the greatest recordings of the pieceever put on disc
