              Fixings                        So we emailed StevenBrill did they ask your question In                   Slate                last week thefounder and editor in chief of Brills Content proposed a killer questionfor the House Judiciary Committee to ask Kenneth Starr The question whichactually was a long series of questions boiled down to Will you waive anyprivileges you have so we can get to the bottom of whether your office has beenillegally leaking to reporters Brill replied that several Democrats had askedthe question but Starr had refused to answer on the grounds that a federaljudge had ordered the investigation of these leaks to be kept confidentialBrill noted that this order for confidentiality had been requested by Starrhimself            Brillsquestion could have been a lot simpler It could have been something likeHave you or anyone in your office leaked information from grand jury testimonyto the pressbefore or after the testimony was given As any newspaper readerknows the correct answer to this question is obviously yes But Starr couldntsay yes because hes said variations on no for months and would be conceding apublic lie Is this beginning to sound familiar            Brill didnt do it the easy way for two goodreasons First he is admirably opposed to perjury traps and therefore hedidnt want to be seen as proposing a tooth for a tooth And in fact he did notpropose one His question involved stripping away Starrs protections againstthe truth not forcing him to repeat the lie under solemn oath Second Brillas a media philosopher is understandably queasy about using the law to outjournalists confidential sources He has an explanation of why its OK in thiscase but his queasiness moderates his delight at putting the screws on Starrthe way Starr put them on Clinton            But letus rise above highmindedness for a moment The symmetry between Starrs caseagainst Clinton and the case against Starr himself is so striking that it wouldseem heavyhanded in the plot of an opera The general arc of selfdestructionis the same Like Clinton Starr did something wrong but not fatally wrongThen he issued a mixture of lies and weasels about it making it virtuallyimpossible for him to give an honest answer if asked a straightforwardquestion That gave his enemies a way to trap him into an undeniably seriouscrime perjury under oath in an investigation of alleged high crimes by thepresident of the United States In both cases the investigation itself wouldproduce the crime            Many details are also eerily similar            Starrs leaks pretty clearlyviolated the federal rules of criminal procedure just as Clintons lies in thePaula Jones deposition pretty clearly violated the perjury laws But neitherthe rules nor the laws are usually enforced in circumstances like theseProsecutors leak all the time            As Brill points out in theDecember issue of his magazine Starrs weasels laughably echo ClintonsClinton has said oral sex doesnt count Starr has said that leaking grand jurytestimony before its actually delivered doesnt count            Both men skillfully maketheir weasels do double duty keeping them kosher on a technicality andmisleading the public about the actual facts Is Clinton saying he didntcommit perjury because of the peculiar definition of sex in the Paula Jonessuit or is he saying he actually didnt have sex Is Starr saying he didntviolate the criminal procedure rules because he doesnt believe they apply topretestimony leaks or is he saying he actually didnt leak The answer is yesto all four Starr has been especially squirmy about this He has made hispretestimonyleaksdontapply argument in sealed court papers and also haspublicly denied believing anything so foolish Brill points out            Like Clinton Starr has usednonexistent or selfimposed secrecy requirements to avoid answering troublesomequestions Clinton invoked grand jury secrecy though you are always free toreveal your own testimony Starr as noted asked for the leak investigation tobe put under seal then publicly regretted his inability to discuss a matterunder seal            Starr is not persuaded by theWhite Houses various novel theories of privilege exemption from testifyingfor Secret Service agents family pets and so on In fact the very raising ofthese privileges in courtand dropping them when the judge says nois one ofthe counts in Starrs thisisnotanindictment of the president Yet Starrtoo has run a few novel and selfinterested public interest theories up theflagpole such as his claim that his leaking if it exists which it doesntis covered by a rule that allows prosecutors to reassure the public about theintegrity of an investigation His investigations integrity he notes hasbeen challenged This is a delightful example of what lawyers call a bootstrapargument If anyone points out that youve broken the rules thats achallenge to your integrity which requires reassuring the public which meansyou have no longer broken the rules Anyway as Clintons lawyer David Kendallpointed out at the hearing this rule is about official statements notanonymous leaks            Finallydespite all the evasive techniques Clinton and Starr have both told the liesthey struggled to avoid No one thinks even oral sex as practiced outside thelaboratory actually escapes the Paula Jones suits stringent definition ofwhich organs must come into contact with which body parts As for Starr asKendall pointed out at the hearing the independent counsel put out a pressrelease the day Flytrap broke declaring Because of confidentialityrequirements we are unable to comment on any aspect of our work At thehearing Starr told Kendall he disagreed with his own press release            In his massive reply to Brills massivePressgate article Starr wrote that Brill was mistaken to assume that itwas the practice of Starr or his office to release to media the contents ofstatements made by witnesses outside the grand jury He wrote Let me repeatcategorically the OIC Office of Independent Counsel does not release grandjury material directly or indirectly on the record or off the record Isuppose the words practice and grand jury testimony leave Starr a tiny bitof wiggle room It would be a joy to watch him perform that particularwiggle            Letters to Brill of courseare not under oath At the impeachment hearing last Friday Barney FrankDMass tried to spring the perjury trap but Starr thwarted him by repeatingthat he didnt do any illegal leaking he didnt add by my definition andthat he couldnt discuss the matter because it was under seal he didnt addat my request            But all is not lostKendall the presidents lawyer not even intending a perjury trap asked Starrwhether anybody had been fired for leaking and Starr said No because Idont believe anyone has leaked grand jury information Thats awfully closeOnce again words such as believe and grand jury information give Starrsome possible defenses But invoking such defenses publicly would destroy hisreputation He could invoke them if called before a grand jury and hope thatword didnt leak out but tragicallyand mysteriouslyit has a way of doingso            Starr inshort fell into a perjury trap that no one had even set Should we snap itshut or release him            The best case that can be made for letting PresidentClinton off the hook for Flytrapbesides the fact that everyone is sick todeath of it which strictly speaking is not a legal argumentis that he wascaught in a perjury trap Consensual sex between adults is no crime lyingabout an ancillary matter in a civil suit deposition is a crime that wouldnever normally be prosecuted Oh yes it would  Oh no it wouldnt yadda yadda yadda and so Clintons one legally indefensible act was lyingto Starrs grand jury After four years of investigation in other wordsStarrs only good card is a crime he carefully arranged for Clinton to commitjust three months ago And you dont crucify a guy for that            Or thats the argument Goodenough Maybe not Clinton still lied under oath to a grand jury Perjury is aserious offense Those who make and enforce the law have a special obligationnot to flout it Its not about sex its about  you know So where doesthat leave Kenneth Starr                           Michael Kinsley
