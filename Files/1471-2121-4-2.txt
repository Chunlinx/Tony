                    Background        The T lymphocyte actin cytoskeleton is clearly important        in the regulation of cell activity at a variety of        different levels An intact actin cytoskeleton is required        for sustained signals leading to T cell activation            T helper and cytolytic effector cells reorient their        intracellular components for vectorial secretion of        cytokines    or cytolytic components    via        cytoskeletal dependent mechanisms Recent reports suggest        an active role played by the T cell cytoskeleton in        maintaining spatially defined molecular clusters found        within the immunological synapse  a highly structured        molecular array defined by contact regions between T cells        and antigen presenting cells        and reviewed in            or NK cells and target cells     Although the        actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in all these        processes perhaps its greatest role is in regulating T        lymphocyte motility and morphology        The first physical step in directional motility is the        extension of cellular processes termed pseudopods            Pseudopodia are flattened fan shape cellular protrusions        enriched in signaling molecules and cytoskeletal elements        including filamentous actin which is preferentially        nucleated at the leading edge of a migrating cell            A key candidate for regulation of the T lymphocyte actin        cytoskeleton is the GTPbinding protein Rho This small        member of the Ras GTPase superfamily has been implicated in        fibroblast models of integrin dependent actin stress fiber        formation focal contact assembly     and gene        induction via the serum response element     Studies        of Rho function have been facilitated by the use of        specific toxins such as         Clostridium botulinum toxin C which        catalyses the ADPribosylation and inactivation of Rho              The function of this GTPase and related family        members such as Rac and Cdc has been extensively studied        in the fibroblast model In this system it has been shown        that Rho function is necessary for the production of actin        stress fibers     However in cells that are        considered highly motile and circulate through various        compartments of the body such as T lymphocytes actin        stress fibers have yet to be identified By comparison to        adherent cells such as fibroblasts less work has been done        within the formed elements of the blood in particular        studies addressing the role played by Rho in the        maintenance of T lymphocyte cytoarchitecture        The involvement of Rho GTPases in regulating integrin        dependent events such as leukocyte homotypic aggregation        and in chemokine upregulation of integrinmediated adhesion        has recently been identified      ADPribosylation        of Rho in neutrophils by treatment with C not only        inhibits cellular locomotion but augments chemoattractant        induced actin polymerization      Moreover        inactivation of Rho in monocytic cells leads to accelerated        formation of filopodia and it has been proposed that Rho        is a negative regulator of actin polymerization within this        cell type     Active Rho is also required for normal        morphology motility and cytolytic activity of IL        activated NK cells      We and others have        demonstrated the importance of Rho in T lymphocyte        activation      Given the role played by Rho in the        regulation of actin microfilaments in other cell types and        the indispensability of a functional actin cytoskeleton in        lymphocyte motility and activation it is of importance to        study Rhos role in the regulation of T lymphocyte integrin        function and maintenance of cytoskeletal organization                    Results                  Electroporation of C induces complete          ADPribosylation of Rho in HPBALL          Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of          RhoA  kDa in the human T cell lines HPBALL and CEM          Figure A The bacterial toxin C from           Clostridium botulinum ribosylates          asparagine  of the small GTPase Rho               resulting in its inactivation C  gml was          electroporated into the T cell line HPBALL as described          in the Materials and Methods After thorough washing the          cells were incubated for  hour at C to allow           in vivo ribosylation then          sonicated and lysates subjected to further C          ribosylation by the addition of  Ci  PNAD and  g          of C in ribosylation buffer By this method any further          ADP ribosylation of Rho can be identified           in vitro after           in vivo ribosylation thus serving          as a measure of the efficiency of the electroporation          procedure for introducing C exoenzyme into HPBALL cells              As figure Bdemonstrates electroporation of C          transferase Figure B lane  prior to cell disruption          prevented further ribosylation of Rho proteins in the          cell lysates The technique of electroporation of C was          very efficient as even longer autoradiographic exposures          of the gel did not demonstrate incorporation of           PNAD data not shown Thus electroporation of the          exoenzyme C fully ribosylates Rho           in vivo  to the extent that no          further           in vitro ribosylation of Rho can be          detected after cell lysis                          Alteration of HPBALL morphology by C          exoenzyme          Inactivation of Rho did not affect the constitutively          high adhesion of HPBALL cells to the extracellular          matrix protein fibronectin Fn Figure  When HPBALL          cells are plated onto  integrin substrate such as          fibronectin vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM          or even antibodies to  integrins they respond by          extending pseudopodia and displaying a highly flattened          spread morphology figure  panels   and  and ref              However electroporation of C appeared to          alter HPBALL morphology resulting in the extension of          very fine branched fingerlike cellular processes when          cells were plated on the  integrin substrates Fn          figure  panel  VCAM figure  panel  or a mAb          specific for  integrins figure  panel  This also          occurred for another T cell line HSB data not shown          and in activated primary T lymphocytes Table           Untreated HPBALL mock electroporated

for integrin dependent signals in both the normal          spreading morphology of HBPALL and the C induced          morphological changes in this cell type                          RhoA immunolocalization in normal and C treated          HPBALL cells spreading on fibronectin          Immunolocalization of the GTPase RhoA was performed to          determine if inactivation by C exoenzyme caused spatial          redistribution of RhoA in HPBALL As figure          demonstrates untreated HPBALL cells display a diffuse          staining pattern of RhoA with small punctate          microclusters throughout the normal pseudopodial          extensions figure  left panels arrows Staining with          secondary antibody alone was negative data not shown          Inactivation of Rho by electroporation of C exoenzyme          did not seem to cause a large overall redistribution of          RhoA in spread HPBALL However RhoA appeared to be in          relatively larger clusters distributed along the aberrant          pseudopodial structures with no diffuse staining observed          figure  right panels arrows                          Altered pseudopodia are rich in filamentous          actin          The Rho family of GTPases is largely responsible for          maintenance of cell shape in a variety of cell types and          this involves regulation of the actin cytoskeleton To          localize filamentous actin within HPBALL cells adherent          to VCAM were fixed and stained with TRITCphalloidin          Control electroporated cells display rather diffuse          filamentous actin staining in elongated pseudopodial          processes that flatten and spread out on their termini          and there are multiple filopodia extending from these          processes and from the cell body figure A arrows          Cells that had been treated with C exoenzyme however all          contain highly enriched filamentous actin within the          extended pseudopods This is true on the substrates FN          and anti integrin mAb data not shown In the C          electroporated cells small filopodia extending from the          cell body are absent and multiple branched pseudopodial          structures are largely enriched in filamentous actin          Figure B arrows Of interest electroporation of C          in conjunction with FITClabeled monomers of actin did          not demonstrate incorporation of FITCactin in the          altered pseudopods at early time points data not shown          suggesting that the filamentous actin in the altered          pseudopods initially results from rearrangement of          preformed actin filaments                          Time lapse microscopy of C treated cells          In fibroblast models inactivation of Rho causes          retraction of preformed pseudopods with a resultant          deposition of parallel tracks of thin dendritic processes              a phenotype ultimately resembling that seen in          C treated HPBALL The phenotype induced by C mediated          ribosylation of Rho in HPBALL could result from either          aberrant retraction of recently formed pseudopods or          altered pseudopodial extension These possibilities were          explored using video timelapse microscopy Figure          demonstrates HPBALL spreading on VCAM over a period          of  hour where images from the first  minutes were          obtained from recorded videotape followed by a  minute          time point Untreated cells and mock electroporated cells          demonstrate normal HPBALL cell spreading figure  see          arrows They extend thick pseudopodia with fanned          termini and their cell bodies are flattened and oval in          shape The C induced phenotype forms at the onset of          cell spreading figure  see arrows The fingerlike          extensions initially form from a rounded cell body and          elongate throughout the duration of the assay The          stellate projections are clearly delineated even at their          termini and the cell bodies do not demonstrate a          flattened oval or spindle phenotype Thus the C          induced stellate phenotype is not primarily due to          aberrant pseudopodial retraction but an altered          pseudopodial extension Also of note was the effect of C          on the dynamic maintenance of pseudopodia Under normal          or control electroporation conditions some of the VCAM          adherent cells would retract pseudopodia then form new          extensions in different directions This activity was          clearly inhibited in the C treated cells Once the          aberrant fingerlike projections were formed no          pseudopodial retraction was noted during this time          period and the cells became completely immobile          Quantification of the original movies indicate that only            of the Ctreated cells were motile whereas            of mockelectroporated cells displayed          motility See additional fileCmovand          filemockmovfor the original movies          Additional File           C transfection on VCAM C exoenzyme transfected into

the GTPase Rho in HPBALL cells does        not result in a decrease in constitutively high adhesion to        the extracellular matrix component fibronectin However        inactivation of Rho protein does result in the aberrant        extension of fingerlike branched dendritic projections in        HBPALL cells when plated on the substrates VCAM        fibronectin and mAb specific for  integrins Altered        pseudopodial extension required  integrin signaling as        C treated cells plated on the nonspecific cell attachment        factor polyLlysine did not extend dendritic like        processes Electroporation of polyclonal antibodies        specific for RhoA mimicked the C induced phenotype data        not shown The C induced extensions were rich in        filamentous actin and C treated HPBALL cell bodies        apparently lacked filopodial actin microspikes present in        normal spreading cells Immunolocalization studies of RhoA        in C treated HBPALL cells spreading on fibronectin showed        no gross differences in RhoA distribution however clusters        of RhoA were more delineated along the fingerlike        dendritic processes of the C treated cells Thus        functional Rho is required for the proper extension and        retraction of pseudopods in T lymphocytes on  integrin        substrates        A large body of work has described the morphological        functions regulated by small GTPases of the Rho subfamily        Members of this family include RhoA RhoB RhoC which are        isoforms Cdc GK RhoG Rac Rac and TC        reviewed in     In fibroblast models these GTPases        have been proposed to act in a concerted hierarchy to        coordinately regulate distinct morphological features        Filopodia formation of short filamentous actin microspikes        gives way to membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation        culminating in the organized production of actin stress        fibers This has lead to the hypothesis that small GTP        binding proteins act sequentially in the GTPase cascade        CdcRacRho     Facilitating the study of Rho in        regulation of cell activity has been the use of C        exoenzyme a toxin from         Clostridium botulinum that        ADPribosylates     and inactivates Rho proteins        Although ribosylation of other Rho family proteins such as        Rac can occur with C     this seemed to be very weak            In our work C electroporated into the T cell        line HPBALL caused complete ADPribosylation of Rho        proteins  kDa Although Rac and Cdc were identified        in western blots of whole cell lysates prepared from the T        cell lines HPBALL CEM HSB data not shown and PB human        T lymphocytes data not shown there was no detection of        ribosylation in the lower molecular weight Rac and Cdc        related GTPases in HPBALL cells indicating the        specificity of C        Previous reports have demonstrated that ADPribosylation        of Blymphoid cell lines by C treatment inhibits phorbol        ester induced cellular homotypic aggregation     Also        phorbol ester and chemoattractant IL and fMLP induced        preB lymphoblastoid adhesion to VCAM and neutrophil        adhesion to fibrinogen was abrogated in a dosedependent        manner by C exoenzyme     This may indicate that in        cells of hematopoietic lineages the induction of an        increased adhesive state may be susceptible to regulation        by Rho proteins However we have recently demonstrated        that induced adhesion of primary T lymphocytes to        fibronectin is unaffected by Rho inactivation     and        data presented here suggests that constitutively high        adhesion of HPBALL cells to  integrin substrate is        unaffected by C treatment Others have demonstrated that        inactivation of Rho in monocytes promotes cellular adhesion        to  integrin substrates     Static cell adhesion        studies rely on a number of factors including integrin        affinity regulation integrin avidityclustering and shear        resistant cell shape changes Factors affecting adhesion        can do so by regulating any number of these parameters        Thus the effects due to Rho inactivation on cell adhesion        may not only influence one or more of these parameters but        also be cell type specific even amongst the cells of the        hematopoeitic lineage        The phenotype induced by ADPribosylation of Rho in T        lymphocytes appeared different than that induced in        fibroblast models where microinjection of C results in        fibroblast retraction of pseudopodia with the cell body        rounding up eventually to become nonadherent            Video timelapse microscopy demonstrated the elongation of        aberrant pseudopods in HPBALL cells plated on the         substrate VCAM rather than an altered retraction of        already formed pseudopods These results suggest an altered        pseudopodial extension although a defect in contractibility        could be involved as a secondary mechanism for formation of        aberrant processes This phenotype also coincided with the        complete loss of cellular motility in HPBALL even though        adhesion to substrate was not noticeably altered It is        also important to note that normal and C induced aberrant        HPBALL spreading on Fn or VCAM is dependent on signals        generated through  integrins as both morphologies could        be seen when untreated or C treated HPBALL were plated on        the  specific mAb B When these same cells are plated        on the nonspecific cell attachment factor polyLlysine        cells remain round and no spreading occurs The elongated        dendriticlike processes in C treated HPBALL cells were        Factin rich This phenotype caused by inactivation of Rho        is the first to be described in T lymphocytes however Rho        regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is not novel among        cells of the hematopoietic lineage ADPribosylation of Rho        proteins in chemoattractant stimulated neutrophils            and in both monocytic lines and fresh blood monocytes            results in actin filament polymerization Although        this once again highlights differences between the affects        of C in fibroblasts and leukocytes there may be        commonalties amongst cells that do not form distinct actin        stress fibers such as leukocytes and neuronal cells        ADPribosylation of Rho proteins by C exoenzyme prevents        neurite retraction in the specialized growth cone of        developing neurons and in fact promotes neurite outgrowth        in the same fashion as microinjection of purified dominant        negative RhoA TN     In these instances neuronal        NE cell outgrowth induced by inactivation of RhoA was        mimicked by microinjection of Rac or CdcGST fusion        proteins and could be abolished by coinjection of dominant        negative Cdc TNor Rac TN     From these        results the authors concluded that inactivation of RhoA by        C exoenzyme treatment resulted in the activation of Rac        and Cdc GTPases suggesting the mutually exclusive        function of RhoA and RacCdc Cdc has been implicated        in the formation of small actinrich filopodia            which are similar to those seen on spread HPBALL cells        figure  around the periphery of the cell body and        extended pseudopods After C electroporation HPBALL were        allowed to spread on VCAM for  hour and        TRITCphalloidin staining demonstrated the complete absence        of fine filopodial structures Given the morphologic        similarity between neurite outgrowth of NE cells and        the aberrant pseudopodial extension of HPBALL when RhoA is        inhibited with C exoenzyme it will be interesting to        determine if other GTPases such as Rac or Cdc are        activated to promote this phenotype after C treatment of        HPBALL cells The thick actin rich stellate projections        emanating from the cell body of C electroporated HPBALL        may be the result of condensation of filopodia where Cdc        may be induced into a highly active state Actin filament        elongation would continue and RhoA dependent retraction of        filamentous actin would be abrogated This could occur by        the release of limited effector molecules shared between        the two GTPases possibilities that are currently under        investigation        The immunolocalization of RhoA in normal and C treated        cells did not appear drastically different in that RhoA was        apparent in both normal and aberrant pseudopodial        extensions The notable exception was that clusters of RhoA        appeared less diffuse in the altered pseudopods of C        treated cells figure  Although ADPribosylation of Rho        does not significantly alter the subcellular distribution        of RhoA Rho activity is inhibited This is thought to        prevent activation of downstream Rho targets required for        normal integrin dependent morphological changes A number        of potential downstream Rho effector molecules have been        identified recently These include p RhoAbinding kinase         and  p ROK and       p Rhoassociated        coiledcoil containing protein kinase RhopROCK            p Rho kinase     p protein kinase N p PKN             and PKCrelated kinase PRK     These        kinases specifically bind to the GTP bound form of Rho        except for PRK which can bind both Rho and Rac GTPases        Interestingly inhibition of RhopROCK has recently been        shown to give similar lymphocyte morphology as inhibition        of Rho with C     Another interesting candidate may        be p PKN as recent studies have established that PKN        phosphorylates cytoskeletal intermediate filaments           and is directly linked to the cytoskeletal network through        associations with actinin     Also PKN may be        involved in relating cytoplasmic signals to the nucleus        for in response to stress nuclear translocation of PKN        occurs     This is particularly important in light of        previous work demonstrating that inactivation of Rho in        peripheral blood T lymphocytes inhibits costimulatory        signals upregulating IL production     Future        experiments will focus on determining the relationship of        Rho GTPases and the regulation of T cell morphology                                 Conclusions        Inactivation of Rho results in an active elongation of        actin rich fingerlike dendritic processes dependent on         integrin signaling Thus Rho activity is required for T        lymphocyte spreading morphologies and is required for T        lymphocyte motility In static cell adhesion assays        however Rho activity is not required to maintain        constitutively high levels of adhesion to fibronectin        Further study of Rho and its related GTPases and        downstream effector molecules will be important in        elucidating mechanisms regulating the lymphocyte        cytoskeleton and thus T cell function                    Materials and Methods
