        are you a football fan i guess you are in Florida arent you     oh yeah yeah im a football fan im actually from Michigan and uh my favorite uh college football team is the University of Michigan     oh uhhuh   and uh my favorite pro team uh even though im down here still loyal to Detroit Lions even though they they lose most of the time im still a die hard uh Detroit Lions fan uh     uh they did well last year didnt they   yeah they did pretty well i was real happy with them last year uh the Miami Dolphins when im down here when whenever they dont they dont play Detroit very often but when they do i root for uh Detroit but uh when Miamis playing anybody else i usually root for Miami now that im down here     yeah thats you that was my favorite since i was about ten years old i think the Miami Dolphins   oh really you like Jim or uh yeah you like Marino Dan Marino   yeah i do yeah i do he hes a good quarterback i followed him more when they had Larry Csonka and stuff Griese and this was quite a while ago   yeah thats the old thats the seventies Dolphins right   yeah im not that old im only twenty seven but  i just remember them playing a lot we just moved down from Seattle and we use to go see the Seahawks all the time   Seattle Seahawks thats right   they would do well for a few games and then they they havent made it in the playoffs for a long time   well did you go to school in Washington State or anything like that or   um i worked up there for Boeing for two years   okay so the Huskies are pretty good right   oh yeah thats right yeah they were really good up there we moved right before they took uh well yeah right we watched them down here for the Rose Bowl   they always beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl  the University of Michigan always make it to the Rose Bowl but then some uh Pac team always beats them     yeah they were they had a good team i was pretty impressed with them   yeah   they had well we followed BYU here thats who my team was and thats uh Washington came in second that year that   ah you youre near Salt Lake then   um   you know where Brigham Young is   no well theyre im about an hour and a half from the campus i never went there i just like their passing their offense thats why i like watching them but thats about how far it goes   oh do do you work at Morten Syco   um i work at Morten   okay i interviewed out there one time yeah   oh you did i work in the airbags   oh okay   im a process engineer there   oh okay   Syco is the there are two separate companies now   oh okay i didnt know that   and so Syco is the rocket booster and we do the airbags   that i i interviewed with them back in eighty six   oh       huh still going to college end   yeah thats right when i graduated yeah   what do you uhhuh well do you go see these football games very much i mean actually in person   not i went to one football game down here in Florida i watched Miami Dolphins   oh that mustve been fun   well  actually terrible they built that Joe Robbie Stadium there in uh in Miami and its not a covered dome and when it when it does rain down here in south Florida it just it just comes down in buckets     uhhuh   and that particular Sunday it poured like it had never poured before and that place was like a giant funnel         all the water goes down to the bottom of the field and the field just started filling up with water and in my seats up there theyve got little drains but they dont they dont drain fast enough so we have water up to our knees     oh youre kidding   and you know warm rains tropical rains are okay but after a while you get the shivers you get cold   uhhuh   and it was just terrible interrupted the whole game and we went to the rest room for a while and uh there was guys emptying out the trash cans emptying out the plastic bags and cutting holes in them and putting them over their heads and stuff     oh wow   but the but the that that game they played the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami was beating them at first then they finally wound up losing at the end of the game so it was kind of a bomber game   uhhuh     so my my football experience down here in Florida has been very bad when i was in Michigan i loved to go watch U of M play uh i played high school football you know so i you know thats thats why i kept up with the sport but in Michigan its a lot different because you can go there and its cool weather you know down here its hot weather its hard to get into football   yeah it is that fall weather is really nice to watch a football game in   that really get you in the mood that late autumn sun and its nice and cool you can bring in some peppermint Schnapps with you in the game  you know what i mean   uhhuh no it it is true i love that fall weather to watching a football game you cant beat that   yep you get the apple cider and stuff on the way home and   well how how many does that stadium hold at Michigan   over a hundred thousand usually they have a hundred and three thousand normally i mean a hundred and three thousand because its all bleacher type seats and it just squish everybody together but it it   oh wow uhhuh hundred thousand   yeah but when youre there it doesnt seem that bad because everybodys all all real nice and everything and uh like i say you just take a little hip flask of peppermint Schnapps or or something like that and everything goes real good   uhhuh   boy that should be fun   yeah you have like tailgate parties theres like a golf course right near there and everybody uh has big tailgate parties you know thats get like a big bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and eat that before the game and drink beers and stuff like that and you go on out and watch the game its really neat then after the game Ann Arbor is such a nice town uh its a big uh its a football town in the fall i mean its just an all college town all around its real fun   uhhuh   uhhuh did you go to school there   i dont go to school at University of Michigan i went to uh Western Michigan University   oh did what did you graduate in or did you graduate   uh i graduated at Lawrence Institute of Technology in Southfield in Southfield Michigan uh i went to uh Western for two years and Lawrence Tech for three years   oh okay   well where did you go to school at   um up here at Weaver State i dont know if youve heard of that   no where
