                 okay   um where are you from Connie   im from Dennison   from Dennison well we live in Plano   Plano great what are they doing anything down there for recycling   yes as a matter of fact they really are in uh February i think it was the city started the first phase of a three part first two phases of a three part phase in for uh uh city wide you know collection type thing   uhhuh   and the way theyre doing this is they said no more trash bags is that how you set out your trash   yeah   yeah thats the way we always had too no more trash bags and they assigned everybody well i think its ninety five gallons big bucket   well thats neat   and uh and you can put everything you know they all look the same theyre great big green things they run on rollers theyre not hard at all even my you know eight and ten year old can do it take them out to the street we used to have twice a week collection and now they have once a week collection for that     uhhuh   and you dont have to use the garbage bags anymore you just uh   do you separate your trash   not yet but   well i think they should do that   thats the third part the second part is we now have a uh paper type biodegradable real big bag for all the lawn clippings and anything and theyve always been encouraging us to not bag our   uhhuh i thought about that last last this last couple weeks ago when we bagged up our leaves it was sixteen or eighteen bags of leaves   uhhuh uhhuh oh gosh   and yeah and it takes forever for that plastic to dissolve   well we have a garden and so we have always you know well rake the leaves and then we mow them so theyre little chibbles you know   uhhuh and you use it as mulch   uhhuh and use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard so you know weve done that for along time and we try not to bag our grass clippings unless its just so long we have to but then we put it back on the garden so ive never worried about that but um they are doing that now where you cannot put out grass stuff you see when you put out your regular trash   ah they wont let you good   huhuh now the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May but something and i dont remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf um trickle down fouled that up and so now were not going to do that until end of June but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic   right paper   uh paper can go now we bundle that on top of our  and set it out beside our green   okay   thing full a newspaper but but the other kinds of paper will go and like i say did i say glass glass plastic other papers tin aluminum and theres something else   oh i cant think of anything milk cartons and soda bottles   yeah like that too that all comes under plastic and glass i cant think what the other thing is anyway we wont even have to sort it at least thats what they say but the guy will come by and sort it there at the curb   well thats good thats neat oh thats going to be a lot of hard work though   well   for them   yes but it will be more profitable in the long run from what i understand because   well i know everybodys throwing away millions of dollars worth of plastic and stuff everyday just to be buried   they have already they sell all this stuff and see we have recycling centers here in the town that are setup by the city and that are you know emptied but you know like it will say on there uh green glass only or aluminum only   uhhuh   and then somebody comes along and mixes it up doesnt do it right its better for them to hire somebody and pay somebody to do it right because if you even put in just say you had this huge container of white glass and three or four brown or green glass bottles got in there and got shattered theres no way you can pick all that out   yeah uhhuh   you see what im saying so it you know its useless   yes   that well its not useless it just cant be sold as clear glass anymore back to the recycle places they say well uh you know look you already youve got and they have percentages you know   theyre not doing much down here though yeah uhhuh   that what they will accept   the only they think ive heard of them doing down here in Dennison is WalMart lets you put there you know uh milk cartons and   uhhuh   two liter bottles those clear plastic bottles thats about it   uhhuh well all of our um grocery stores are going to um they have each of one i shop at i go to a Skaggs and Albertsons and a Kroger and they will let you bring in   uhhuh   your own little paper bags or plastic bags theyll let you recycle them or you can bring them in and actually use them again   little carryon bags   okay well theyre doing that but every time i get paper bags at a grocery store i bring home bugs   do you um i   yeah and i cant do it   dont know that ive ever had that problem i just try to reuse mine a lot at home too and   okay   but used to you know if i had a torn sack when i got home i just trashed it you know and anymore i dont do that ill put it in with the paper recycling you know the newspaper or something   uhhuh yeah well they ought to do that around down here   um that always seems to help the uh um a lot of times if i know im just even if i know ive got a big family so you know i rarely come home with you know just a sack or two   uhhuh   but i have two canvas sacks that are big that are especially for taking to the grocery store that kind of thing and ill always take those and use them and um   uhhuh right ive seen those real environmentally conscious arent you   yeah yeah i always have been i always have been and uh i kind of got out of the habit of it you know for a few years when my children were     small   well when they   did you use diapers   what   disposable diapers   i didnt with my first three but i did with my last two     goodness youve got five kids   and yeah i have five and uh well the actually now i think about it i think it was number three that i used them a lot with and then number four came along and i used them some with him most of the time i think i used them with number four   well ive got a three month old i used disposables on her for about a month and a half just to keep her from breaking out so bad   uhhuh and then she had reaction to the   oh she had reactions to cloth diapers it was from staying wet more often   uhhuh yeah yeah oh theyve just improved the   and yeah well shes doing better they have are they biodegradable or more biodegradable i heard theyre the worst things   disposables so much oh yeah they really fill up   because they stay forever   but they work so good  i mean thats one thing that we moms just think oh gosh   yeah they do i dont mind using cloth diapers i really dont its not all that much more work   i uh pardon   its not all that much more work for disposable i mean for cloth   well i always had you know several in diapers at the same time so that may have been you know why they looked so nice to me but   yeah well cloth i mean disposables do look better they look theyre not quite as bulky   uhhuh   she looks like a little mushroom       but i used disposables with my first little boy   well you know that well i think its just you know that you i think have to have in your mind an attitude of trading off you just say to yourself well this is not worth it to me to do such and so   uhhuh   but i want to make up for it because i want to be real conscientious in this and that you know what im saying you   right well im   you know all of us can to something and you know what works for one family may not work for another family and   well i know to with disposable diapers though if you use cloth diapers your polluting with more soap and using more water and all that   yeah thats true and youre using more electricity youre using it uh   right   more where as when you buy the others they used it more at the factory  so you know you wonder you know youre not using it but somebody used it to create that item you know   yeah youre right yeah youre right  i didnt even think about that   so but you know you know then you you figured on down the line it did give people jobs i use cloth diapers for a lot of stuff just besides you know if my kids have got a cold you know i put them in bed with cloth diapers  you know   with a cloth diaper   to use instead of a hanky or or tissue you you know they can could just flat go through three dollars worth of tissue you in a morning you know   oh yeah shes just right and uhhuh and they are the best dusters   i know it  and they make wonderful dusters   oh well   no question about it well i just you know im really glad to see us a world coming back to this and   yeah its really coming to a head its been building up for a few years i remember this going on when i was a teenager   sure sure   for about the last ten years   how long have you been married   five years   uhhuh uhhuh   and ive got two children   uhhuh so you know when you say youre a teenager you know i uh ive been married seventeen years and have always been you know like i say always been conscious this way but   um i havent not until this year its really starting to   so its all brand new to you then to think of these things   right yeah well theyve really started you know i wish they would do that um with uh the buckets here instead of the trash bags here the city sends us trash bags     uhhuh yeah thats what we had the program before too well theres a lot of information if you ever get to Dallas   uhhuh   you come in very often   no i dont   well if you ever get to come here you must put on your list of place to go  is a place called
