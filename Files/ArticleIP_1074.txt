                                 Mossad            Last month Israels vauntedintelligence agency Mossad botched an assassination attempt on a Hamas leaderin Amman Jordan Soon after agents had injected a poison into their targetthey were captured by Jordanian police Jordan demanded that the agents handover the antidote which they did Bemused reporters wondered how thelegendarily effective agency had been foiled so easily What is Mossad Doesits track record live up to its reputation            TheInstitute for Intelligence and Special Tasks a k a Mossad Hebrew forinstitute is the Israeli equivalent of the CIA It engages in foreignespionage and covert action  Another agency Shin Bet is in chargeof domestic intelligencegathering and security Only rarely does the Israeligovernment publicly acknowledge Mossad The agency is accountable only to theprime minister and has little civilian oversight even the size of its budgetremains a secret            Mossad was founded in  when newly independentIsrael reorganized its national defense It assumed control over the network ofagents in Europe and the Middle East that had organized illegal Jewishimmigration to Palestine Mossad stationed its agents in Israels Europeanembassies where they cultivated volunteersJews working in foreigngovernments who fed them information Other newly recruited agents wereassigned to infiltrate Arab governments The most famous example In the sMossad agent Eli Cohen befriended Syrian President Amin alHafez and was nearlynamed Syrias defense minister            Mossadestablished its international credibility with two important finds  Itobtained a copy of Khruschevs  Party Congress speech about Stalinistatrocities much sought after by American and British spies And Mossaduncovered a  plot by rightwing French army officers to assassinatePresident Charles de Gaulle The agency traded information about the plot withFrance for nuclearweapons technology            Mossads covert missions have been moresuccessful than its intelligence gathering In  agents kidnapped Nazi warcriminal Adolf Eichmann from Buenos Aires Argentina spiriting him awayto Israel And in  Mossad planned the famous raid on Entebbe Ugandarescuing passengers on an Air France jet hijacked by Palestinian terroristsOnly one passenger and one Israeli commandoPrime Minister BenjaminNetanyahus brother Yonathandied during the raid            Mossad has been largelyunable to procure intelligence that would prevent Arab terrorist attacks suchas the  Munich Olympics massacre by the Palestinian group Black SeptemberInstead Mossad has attempted to deter terrorism by assassinating terroristsUnlike the CIA which tries to keep its covert actions secret Israel has meantfor its assassinations to be highly visible  After Munich for exampleit killed Black Septembers most important operatives forcing the group out ofoperation by the end of the s In  Mossad assassinated the Engineera notorious Hamas bomb designer by wiring his cell phone with explosives            Mossadhas tried to incite conflict within Arab countries to mixed effectEgypt foiled a  plot to discredit Egyptian ultranationalists byplanting bombs in Cairo buildings Egyptians hanged the two Mossad agentsbehind the campaign More successful was Mossads arming and training ofKurdish rebels in Iraq Between  and  Israeliaffiliated units killedmore than  Iraqi soldiers            The failed Egypt plot and the bungled Amman mission are notMossads only embarrassments  In  the agency was widely chided forassassinating an innocent man they mistakenly believed to be a Black Septemberoperative It did kill its mansix years later Also in  Mossad wascriticized for failing to predict the surprise Arab attack that began the YomKippur War It was similarly criticized for not foreseeing the intifada thePalestinian uprising that began in  These breakdowns are attributed toMossads failure to penetrate Arab governments Israel has no diplomaticrelations with most Arab nations making it difficult for its agents to gatherforeign intelligence            Mossad hasweakened significantly in recent years After Yasser Arafats returnfrom exile in  it has spent more resources tracking potential terroristswithin the West Bank and Gaza a responsibility of Shin Bet rather than MossadInteragency competition has eroded Mossads morale            Mossad has also been handicapped by USmistrust  In  the FBI caught Jonathan Pollard a JewishAmericannavalintelligence officer shipping sensitive satellite photos to Lakamanowdefunct arm of Israeli intelligence largely devoted to stealing nuclearsecrets Following the Pollard affair rumors circulated that Israel hadpenetrated other agencies The flow of information between the CIA and Mossadis said to have slowed since            Andrevelations about the agencys Cold War malfeasance have damaged its prestigeRecent bestselling memoirs by former agents tell of colleagues who randrugs and freelanced as mercenaries  Mossad also brokered secretdubiously legal private arms sales to Central American regimes and SouthAfricas white government The Israeli press which historically has respectedthe agencys request not to probe its workings splashed these stories acrossthe front pages Perhaps even more demoralizing has been a controversial TVmelodrama called Mossad  which according to the agency depicts agentsas buffoonish playboys            Mossad which employs about  people now hasdifficulty competing with privatesector recruiters  Its early agentswere welleducated Europeanborn cosmopolitans who ran the agency like anexclusive club But most current agents are career military men and theconventional wisdom is that theyre less intelligent and creative than theirpredecessors            The Amman fiasco could costboth Israel and Mossad In exchange for Jordans return of the captured Mossadassassins Israel released Hamas spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yessin who had been imprisoned in Israel since  Some worry he will become a majorpolitical force in the West Bank and Gaza Strip endangering peacenegotiations Others worry that Mossads botched mission will occasion a newhighprofile panel that will dig up more dirt about the agency
