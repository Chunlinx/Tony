                                 Republicans in Denial            Back in the days when theDemocrats were the perpetual losers of presidential elections they developed aformidable ability to psyche themselves into believing that the fault layelsewhere When Jimmy Carter went down in  it was economic forces beyondhis control and rotten luck in Iran In  and  it was a serendipitouslyhealthy economy that favored Republicans Democrats always complained of acharismatically challenged nominee or Reagans magic dust or Lee Atwatersslimeball tactics As manifested by voters continuing refusal to giveRepublicans control of Congress they reasoned the people obviously liked whatDemocrats stood for The people just had a funny way of expressing it For somedogmatic Democrats it seemed any explanation would do except the obviousonethat the party wasnt speaking for a majority of voters at the nationallevel            As with so much else inpolitics the traditional roles are now reversed Today it is the Republicanswho are on a quest to rationalize political failure A few go so far as toargue that the GOP is winning even as it appears to be losing Grover Norquistwho is the president of an antitax organization and an adviser to NewtGingrich compares the  election to the Battle of the Bulge in whichGermany inflicted losses on the Allies but weakened itself to a point where itcould soon be defeated The DemocratNazi analogy is an added bonus            Denialis according to psychoclich one of the stages of dealing with death Butwhat of the stations of denial Conservatives are now ignoring reality with thehelp of four principal excuses                            It was all Doles fault                        CharlesKrauthammer makes this case in the postelection issue of the WeeklyStandard  No Excuses No Alibis declares the editorsselfcongratulatory headline as if pinning the entire blame on one scapegoatdeserves a medal for intellectual valor The reason for the Republican defeatis to be found not in the economy not in the opponent not in the stars butin the candidates Krauthammer writes The most important fact about the presidential campaign for Republicans is that but for Dole and Kemp it waswinnable Dole according to Krauthammer failed to make Clintonadministration corruption seem like a valid issue and missed his chance toexploit affirmative action

Dolehad to deal with a damaging but untouchable GOP abortion plank and guilt byassociation with the Gingrich Congress                            It was due to circumstances beyond ourcontrol                        Republicanssuddenly sound like a bunch of Marxist economic determinists Tuesdayspresidential election was won back in January when the economy which seemedheaded for zero or even negative growth suddenly turned around writes JamesK Glassman the conservative Washington Post columnist Economy isdestiny Others make an even broader structural argument It was Clintonsgood fortune to run for reelection in a generally satisfied country writeRamesh Ponnuru Rich Lowry and Kate OBeirne in the National Review  Inthe words of Fred Barnes offering an alternative explanation to Krauthammersin the Standard  In a period of peace and prosperitysuch as nowanincumbent president is all but certain to be reelected Its that simple            Thatsimple Peace and prosperity As recently as four years ago pundits wereexplaining George Bushs defeat after winning the Gulf and arguably the ColdWardelivering not just peace but victoryby likening it to Churchillsdefeat by British voters after World War II Peace gave people the security totry someone new As for prosperity Republicans certainly didnt attributetheir victories of  and  to a fortuitously good economy In thoseancient days they thought the president deserved some credit for the state ofthe economy They also insisted that larger ideological tides were at work                            If you squint it looks like wewon                        In one ofseveral exculpatory postelection editorials the Wall Street Journalnotes that votes were much more evenly split among married women than amongdivorced widowed or unmarried ones Seen in this context what was seen asan issue of male vs female actually emerges as the nuclear family vssomething else the Journal editors write The editorial goes on tonote that between onethird and onehalf of all divorced women spend some timeon welfare As for the famous gender gap it appears to be merely part of thebasic political tensions that now exist between defenders of the countryspostWar system of government guarantees and Republicans who argue for anupdating of the ways we ensure personal and financial security            The theorygets a bit murky here If the basic political tensions in America today arebetween probiggovernment and antibiggovernment factions and theprobiggovernment faction just won how are the Journal s editorialsympathizers supposed to find comfort in that analysis If women aredisproportionately pro big government for whatever reason how does thatdisqualify the biggovernment philosophy or explain away its apparent triumphAre the Journal editors trying to say that Dole would have won theelection if not for people who areor might goon welfare Or perhaps thatDole is actually the president of married America In any case the responseis so what Its true If you dont count the people who voted for Clintonmost people voted for Dole Back on Planet Earth Clinton won by a biggermargin than he did last time around and with the help of a gender gap thatRepublicans have no idea how to close                            We actually did win                        In aninterview with the electronic magazine Intellectual Capital  GroverNorquist said President Clinton ran as a false conservative but he ran as aconservative the Republicans ran as conservative and they both won Thismatches the argument of that publications sponsor Pete du Pont who adds inhis column As the election smoke clears we can now see the politicallandscape clearly What stretches out behind us is twenty years of anincreasingly conservative America In the opinion of the editors of theStandard  Republican retention of congressional control is a tribute tothe inexorable tidal pattern of partisan realignment            Thepremise here is that the only authentic Democrat is a McGovern Democrat If theDemocrats win while claiming to stand for anything to the right of the platform it counts as a victory for Republicans This is silly Clinton ran ona platform that while certainly less liberal than those of his recentpredecessors is best characterized as reform liberal not conservative Hispolitics owe far more to Roosevelt Truman and Kennedy than they do toGoldwater or Reagan If his move toward the center means that the inexorableRepublican tide continues to rise then by the same token it counts as aDemocratic victory that Republicans retained control of the House only bydisavowing their  vintage radicalism If Clinton has been GingrichedGingrich has been Foleyated            And even by their own theory how do these Republicansexplain the voters preference for an ersatz Republican over the genuinearticle Wherever you place Bill Clinton on the ideological spectrum hisdefeat of Bob Dole cannot rationally be interpreted as a victory forconservatism            Of course the above reasonsall contributed to Clintons victory Dole was a lousy candidate Clinton abrilliant one Peace and prosperity which were only partly the presidentsdoing handed him an enormous advantage Clinton shifted to the center fortactical as well as philosophical reasons But Dole also lost because of deepRepublican problems Voters rejected and will probably continue to rejectgiving total power to a party that remains a hostage to the Christian right onabortion and that threatens to scale back government in a radical way            Conservatives can startfacing up to these problems Or they can keep blaming it all on bum luck andkeep on losing
