                              Speaking of the Unmentionables            In the nineteenth century the Age of Euphemism the word unmentionables designated only onespecific referentmens trousers  Not only was thementioning of a mans or womans leg taboo butthe garment covering it was also forbidden to bespoken of in polite conversation  In modern dialoguewhich in no sense approaches the gentility ofthe perfumed puritanicals the denotation of unmentionableshas broadened to include body organscurses and biological functions  How clever it isthough that metaphor the great facilitating factor inthe changing of word meanings has carefully camouflagedthe unmentionables of the current day            Consider the following vignette apparentlyvoid of any hint of an unmentionable            Mrs Eleanor Sutherland the vivacious wife ofthe petroleum magnate H R Sutherland is hostinga midsummer patio brunch with her friend of many asocial season Grace Walthum wife of Sam Walthumconsidered by many to be the richest man in thestate in honor of Sandra Chapman the young Illinoisdebutante and intended wife of Tom Weed Republicancandidate for governor            Girls the treat for this morning is avocado fingersandwiches  Fanny made them for the first timelast week and H R thought they were simplysumptuous  Only today she made them with Germanpumpernickel  I do hope you like them            Oh Eleanor you must pencil this off for me onone of your personalized recipe cards  These arepurely delicious  Dont you agree Sandra            Indeed I do  I might serve them as horsdoeuvres for Toms political science seminar at theuniversity next week            You two are testimony enough for Fannys culinarypowers although I do detest her slicing thebread so thick  After finishing off the sandwicheswell savor some vanilla mousse            Thats a lovely centerpiece of bachelors buttonsand cowslips Eleanor  Wherever did you findsuch exquisite flowers            Yes and the cubicle you have them arrangedin is just gorgeous            Oh Frank the gardener grew them on thefront lawn  Hes hoping to have mistletoe by Christmasand if the spring orchids dont fizzle Sandracan use them in her nuptial ceremony  By the waySandra where will you and Tom honeymoon            Were going to spend two weeks in the GrandTetons  Then were off to the ocean where Tom sayshes going to swim stark nude  Would you believeit            At this moment there is a disturbing noisenearby            Jeepers creepers Eleanor what is that whirringcommotion            Why Grace look across the lawn to the orchardIts a feisty covey of flatulent partridges takingflight  Arent they beautiful girls            Toms greyhound would certainly think theywere a beautiful sight            My how the time has slipped away  We mustbe going Sandra            Of course we must and Mrs Sutherland Ihave so enjoyed being a part of such a stimulatingconversation            Girls it was my deepest pleasure  Please docome again            Actually in the preceding dialogue three ladiesfrom the highest level of society can be cited forinnocently mentioning the unmentionables in no lessthan twentyplus instances to wit                           Avocado was borrowed from Spanish and wasoriginally spelled aguacate   The words origin is Nahuatlahuacatl  a word meaning testicle because ofthe similarity of the shape of the fruit                           Pumpernickel was borrowed directly from Germana compound of pumpern to fart and Nickel thedevil  The allusion could be to a hand slapping theloaf thereby producing a deep hollow fartlikesound  On the other hand pun intended the rootsense might be implying the bread is so hard to digestit would make the devil fart                           Pencil as well as penicillin  was borrowed fromLatin pnicillus paintbrush a diminutive of peniculusbrush which is also a diminutive of penis  whichin Latin also meant tail  Figuratively a brush is apenis is a tail                           Seminar came through German from Latinsminrium plant nursery  The words ultimate originis Latin semen seed  Since the testicles are producersof semen they are often referred to in slangas seed                            Testimony and detest are both based on Latintestis witness testicle  In the final analysis a mancan only witness to his virility by his testicles  Theroot sense of testimony  then is a laying of the testeson the evidence table and of detest is to hate to theextent of losing ones testicles                           Vanilla  extracted from the seedpods of a tropicalplant was borrowed from Spanish vainilla  whichdenoted the flower the pod or the flavoring  Spanishhad formed vainilla from vaina sheath a word ithad borrowed from Latin vgina sheath for asword Later vagina was borrowed into Englishand assigned its present meaning from the similarityof the functions            Bachelors buttons a term that denotes a plantwith sphericalshaped flowers was created as a metaphorof the male testes            Cowslip is not cows lip  It is from Old Englishcslyppe cow manure literally cow slip  Theflower is aptly named since it grows well in profuselymanured pastures            Cubicle is from Latin cubre to bend over inpreparation for sexual activity  The word nowdesignates a space so small a person might be requiredto bend over to enter it            In its root sense mistletoe is the birdshitplant  The word is cognate with Old High Germanmist manure shit dung  The seed of the plant wasdispensed in the dung of birds            Orchid is from the Greek orchis testicle  Theflower was so called by Pliny the Elder because thedouble root resembled two hairy testicles            Fizzle is probably from Middle English fisten tofart  In  the word is recorded with the meaningto fart noiselessly            The Grand Tetons is a mountain range in WyomingThey were coarsely named from their rootsense big tits from French teton tit because oftheir shape            Stark nude is euphemistic for stark naked  Theterm was originally start naked Middle English stertfrom Old English steart tail ass and is preserved inredstart bird with red tail feathers            Jeepers creepers is nothing other than a euphemisticcoverup for the curse Jesus Christ  The termwas actually used as early as             Feisty like fizzle began as Middle English fystenfisten to fart At one time fysting curre referredto a stinking dog and feist named a small dogof mixed breed            Covey like cubicle is from Latin cubre to bendover for sexual purposes The word came throughMiddle French cover to incubate            Flatulent having stomach gas came throughFrench from Latin flatus a farting            Partridge came through Old French and Latinperdcem from Greek prdx partridge which isrelated to prdesthai to fart  The partridge is afarting bird because of the noise made by its beingflushed            Finally the first element of greyhound probablymeans bitch  Old Icelandic greyhundr is bitchhound            Most will agree that euphemism is an acceptablemeans of avoiding the unmentionables unutterablesinexplicables ineffables inexpressibles andwhatever else they have been called  While it is thefunction of metaphor to conceal the unmentionablesit is likewise the pleasurable business of etymologyto expose them                              Every minute was more exciting than the nextFrom an oncamera interview with Linda Evans commentingon Night of  Stars party in New York topromote

whats that She pointed to a patch ofequally depressing but bushier shrubbery            Bracken I said serenely            I had I now believe been reading an Englishnovel or perhaps a Sherlock Holmes

came to my lips just as easily as to the lips ofJoseph Goebbels  Then to my horror without waitingfor another childish question I pointed to acrawling caterpillar and said glibly Look  Theresa Squirm            I had embarked on a life of deceit involving thenames of natures own flora and fauna  Perhaps Ihad an unconscious recollection of seeing long agoJames Thurbers delightful drawings of such

withsome awe in his voice            Visitors from the North always demanded a visitto the nearby tourist attraction a lush tropical paradisepopulated by trained parrots and alligators andcolorful

politicallycorrect language reminded me of a television interviewon a network morning program the day afterDances With Wolves won several Academyawards  Live from the Pine Ridge reservation inSouth Dakota the Anglo interviewer was verycareful to refer to Native Americans  The intervieweesconsistently referred to themselves as Indians                              Crosstalk            Searching for some refreshment in an unfamiliartown I came across a luncheonette with thissign in the window HOT COFFEE  I stared at thesign for a moment  Something about the quotationmarks made the coffee suspect the way a real estateagent will call a closet a room  Since I didnt feellike drinking a tepid beverage I walked until I got toa diner that served me an acceptable cup of javaThere on the menu was listed FRESH EGGS  Thepurpose was obviously to highlight to emphasizebut I would argue that these places are only hurtingtheir business  Scarequotes as they are sometimescalled call into question the very words they assert            These are examples in which the wording undercutsitself yet without any apparent sarcasmThere are those who argue that it is simply a case oflanguage calling attention to itself as Steven Shortnoted in a letter to VERBATIM fifteen years agoOther readers such as Jon Mills and Pat Solotaireshowed outright suspicion of entrees like Roastbeef with gravy  and a liquid soap boasting Contains No Phosphates   The basic meaningdoes not shift but somehow its implications turnagainst it  The effect is generally unintentional liketwo people talking at crosspurposesso I decidedto call this phenomenon crosstalk            Soon after that I discovered another kind ofcrosstalk which has the insidious effect of undercuttingnot itself but all related instances  I was inthe supermarket buying dessert  We use only thefinest ingredients read the label on one ice creambrand  This seems like a simple statement what thelinguistic philosopher J L Austin termed a constativeutterance a base level of communication withno metaphor or secondary meanings attached  Butconsider the implications of the label most other icecream makers cut costs by using mediocre contentsThe wording thus has an extended or connotativeaspect to it becoming what Austin called a performativeutterance  In fact many manufacturers use thiskind of wording as a polite way of discrediting theirrivals  The impact of this seemingly nonassertivelanguage is such that the Federal Drug Administrationhas recently banned the No Cholesterol labelon foods that never had cholesterol anyway  Theunfair inference is that somehow the manufacturerhas reduced the cholesterol or that other brandsstill contain a lot of it  The increasingly commonclaims All Natural and Fresh have a similar effectand are also coming under federal scrutiny  Butthe investigation should really go beyond the supermarketwhen a jewelry store that does earpiercingadvertises We sterilize all our instruments is itnot hinting something unsavory about other establishments            What accounts for the pernicious effects ofcrosstalk  Crosstalk seems to be a cousin of ironygiving a result opposite to what is seemingly intendedThe difficulty arises in trying to say whatkind of irony crosstalk resembles  Irony of statementor sarcasm seems close exclaiming What asurprise  over a drearily foregone conclusion forexample  But consider when a little child tells hisfather Were going to surprise you with a birthdayparty tomorrow afternoon There is no irony ofstatement intended here yet the sentence neatlydefeats its purpose  A clue may be offered by dramaticirony in which the audience knows what thespeaker is unaware of  Does the crosstalk in thebirthdaysurprise announcement derive from the selectaudience who knows that the speaker is sabotaginghis meaning  Situational irony need not involvelanguage at all just an action that achieves theopposite effect of the intention  Maybe this is wherethe bulk of crosstalk belongs though it needs anaudience to apprehend it correctly which makes italso linked to dramatic irony            The truth is that crosstalk may at times resembleall three ironies depending on the intent audienceand effect  And since only irony of statementis deliberate the effects of crosstalk range from accidentalto purposeful  Praeteritio  that sly rhetoricaldevice of mentioning what one is passing overbelongs to this category of crosstalk That goeswithout saying covers up the obvious need to say itand I will pass over the topic of my opponentsadultery should be recognizable as the ploy it isBut then there are instances where the degree ofdislocation is unclear  Does the common capper to abrief business conversation Lets do lunch sometimesignify an upcoming meal or a polite brushoff            Let me illustrate the intricacies involved I recentlyreceived a card from an academic journal acknowledgingan essay I had submitted  They wereholding it for further consideration  The last sentenceread We assume of course that you havenot submitted this essay elsewhere  Is this sarcasmAlmost certainly not  Yet once again the implicationsrun counter to the wording and tone  Theurbane assume and of course finesse the real meaningof the sentence ie We are worried that youmay have indeed submitted this essay elsewhereThe message is all the more urgent because its merepresence hints that wouldbe contributors often dosubmit the same essay to more than one journal simultaneously            The most perplexing species of crosstalk remainsthe unintentional reversal  In a recent advertisementfor the luxuriously quiet Lincoln Town CarJack Nicklaus is trying to make a putt but cannotbecause of the noise of the spectators  Through themiracle of television all of them are crowded insidethe car with the windows shut resulting in utter silenceNicklaus takes a swing the ball rolls to the lipof the cup where it stops  Suddenly someone insidethe car sneezes and the ball slips into the hole  It isa funny moment but what does it imply  That thenew car is not really quiet  That quiet is not alwayssuch a good idea anyway  And do not both ideasrun counter to the advertising pitch            We may mean what we say but do we always saywhat we mean  A friend of mine once tried to sell hisold car by parking it in his yard with a sticker thatread FOR SALE   He couldnt understand whyno one showed any interest until a passerby told himany car that cheap had to be a lemon  He promptlychanged the price to  and sold it the next dayThis story shows that interpretation is all importantas in cheap meaning inexpensive to some people andshoddy to others  To return to Austins distinctionbetween constative and performative utterancesAustin eventually concluded correctly that there areno purely constative utterances  The simplest sentencesuch as I am a woman can have secondarymeanings in certain contexts for example I wish Iwere a man or Thank God Im not a man In thebroadest sense then any language is potentiallycrosstalk given a suitable situation just as any utterancemay become ironic  Meaning is not as stable aswe might like it to be            At times the simplest wording can cross up thereader  Last week I was stopped at a traffic lightwith a sign underneath that read RIGHT ON REDAFTER STOP Since I live where right turns at a redlight are permitted first I did not think much aboutit  The sign just seemed superfluous  But then itoccurred to me why was the notice there at all  Istared at the sign for a moment and I realized thatthe words in a way implied their opposite that is aright turn at a red light is not allowed in this districtexcepthere  In the end I spent so much timepondering the implications of the wording that Imissed two traffic light changes and cars started tohonk behind me            Here is a real cautionary tale  For years a signalong Route  in New Jersey near the GeorgeWashington Bridge flashed a BEST ROUTE arrow toindicate the road with the least traffic  Savvy motoristssoon realized that everyone took the route indicatedand clogged the roadwayso the bestroute was probably the worst one  This raised atroubling question if enough people were alive tothe real significance of the sign and so left the bestroute alone would not the sign become trustworthyagain  In that case people would once againtake the best route which would once again callthe sign into question  and the situation wouldrapidly escalate into a paradox            Where does this leave us  To postulate that alllanguage is twofaced runs counter to everyday realitywhere people seem perfectly capable of talkingto others without any slippage in meaning  Yet toexamine even the simplest utterance is to enter alabyrinth of possibility  In literary criticism deconstructionand readerresponse models try to dealwith this problem deconstructionists pointing outthe inherent instability of all language readerresponsecritics insisting that all meaning resides in theaudiences interpretation  There are also moderateswho believe with some common sense that theseideas are true up to a point  Perhaps a better way toput the situation is that language is potentially unstableand that the audience is responsible for a largepart of the determinable meaning            Or maybe not  Crosstalk after all depends onsome idea of the real meaning to achieve its contradictoryeffect it is just that sometimes the meaninggets lost or misconstrued  Some years ago in ourfaculty lounge one of my hazier colleagues got up toget another cup of coffee  Would you like somehe asked the woman sitting next to us            No thanks the woman waved aside his offerI dont drink coffee            Really he said  What do you do with it            At the time everyone thought he was kiddingLooking back on it I am not so sure                                             Notice

Johnson in the Medical World            A frequent ploy in reviewing scholarly books isfor the reviewer to chide the writer for not havingwritten the book he would like to have read  What apleasure it is to report that John Wiltshire of Melbournesaccount of Samuel Johnson and the medicalaspects of his life is just the sort of exposition andanalysis that this reviewer once considered writingand that Wiltshire has done it better and on abroader canvas            Wiltshire starts with a review of Johnsons ownmedical history juvenile scrofula poor vision in oneeye the famous tics and gesticulations

purposesof selfmedication  Johnsons doctorsBathurstLawrence Brocklesby Heberden and othersarenot neglected            In further chapters Wiltshire sets forth considerableuseful information about medicine in thcentury England its theories its mode of practiceJudicious use of primary sources and an aptitude fora telling vignette combine to make these chaptersuseful and intelligible to a reader unfamiliar with theperiod  Wiltshire makes full use of Johnsons ownwriting especially the essays in The Rambler andThe Idler  to analyze Johnsons frequent almost habitualuse of medical ideas as metaphors            A wellshaped chapter deals with the astronomerin Rasselas as an example of the man of learningwhose actions are severely limited by a psychiatricproblem  Unique in the annals of Johnsoniana is afull treatment of Dr Robert Levet an unlicensedpractitioner who was a valued member of Johnsonspeculiar household and Wiltshires close reading ofJohnsons elegy on Levet is welcome and commendableThe monograph concludes with a chapter ontherapeutic friendship dealing chiefly with Johnsonsattempts to steer Boswell into a more sensibleway of life and behavior  These were only transientlyeffective because Boswell was less than candidto his mentor about his compulsive drinking andwhoring            Some minor cavils Occasional paragraphs aredevoted to the exposition and dismissal of variouspseudopsychoanalytic theories about Johnsons personalitya waste of time and space because no Johnsonscholar relies upon them  Also the exposition ofmedical ideas about melancholia relies chiefly on thecontribution of William Battie the two ScotsmenWilliam Cullen and Robert Whytt deserve equalbilling for their contributions toward midth centuryideas on melancholia  But on balance Wiltshiresbook is sound and sensible a distinguishedcontribution not only to Johnsonia but to the widerfield of eighteenthcentury studies            William B Ober            Tenafly New

the abilityto sustain a prolonged period of concentrationdiffering considerably among individuals even ifone assumes that the subject under discussion is ofsome interest to the listener the insertion

conceivablyserve a function as with everything else overdoingthem can create a longwinded boring experience            It is not easy to distinguish between clichs andwhat linguists call

she can know that the expressionwas not already a clich at the time of its appearancein print  In the case of have a good day which riles many people I submit that it is a revivalfor its equivalent

expressedin a book by a liberal economist  Can a holisticapproach to arthritis ignore important aspectsof the disease  Should your teenagers interest in amovement with a charismatic leader alarm you            In everyday speech the vocabulary of social scienceand philosophy can be misleading  Just asbadly worn coins convey little information to the numismatisttheir onceclear markings having fadedwith countless transactions so some words conveylittle information because their meanings have beenobscured by repeated and varied usage  Charisma isa good example  Writers use the word when it doesnot apply and do not use it in those rare instanceswhen it does  Charismas unfortunate fate is the subjectof this essay            Today it seems that charismatic figures are everywhereMovie stars athletes politiciansanyonewho catches the public eyemay enjoy the designerlabel  It is applied not only to individuals butalso for example to Richard Pryors humor Gershwinsmusic and Lassie  Are the Ninja Turtles nextCharisma now means little more than dazzle  saysAllan Bloom and he is correct  But what did theword once mean  And what difficulties do its currentusage pose            Two tributaries brought charisma into the Englishlanguage one theological one sociological  Theword comes from the Greek more precisely theGreek of the New Testament  Theologically the OxfordEnglish Dictionary tells us it is a free gift orfavor specifically vouchsafed by God a grace a talentIn the Bible it appears only in the Letters ofPaul and occupies a particularly important place inI Corinthians  There Paul discusses a number ofspiritual gifts or charismata  including the gifts ofmiracles healing and speaking in tongues divinelyinspired but unintelligible speech  During theChurchs early years these gifts must have capturedthe attention and imagination of many for Paulwrites to remind Christians that all charismata havea common divine source and that none is as importantas love            Writers using charisma or charismatic in this orrelated theological senses are not likely to errThose using the term in its sociological sense howeveroften go astray  This second meaning of theterm entered English through translations of theworks of the eminent German sociologist Max WeberWriting in the early twentieth century Weberused the term in his sociology of religion and sociologyof authorityThe term charisma will be applied to a certainquality of an individual personality by virtue ofwhich he is considered extraordinary and treatedas endowed with supernatural superhuman or atleast specifically exceptional powers or qualitiesThese are such as are not accessible to the ordinaryperson but are regarded as of divine originor as exemplary and on the basis of them the individualconcerned is treated as a leader                        Charisma Weber argued provided the basis for anintensely personal form of authority dramaticallydifferent from authority based both on the impersonalrule of law the modern type and on the sanctityof tradition the oldest type  Historically rarecharismatic figures like Jesus or Mohammedfounded new faiths or like Napoleon won the unswervingallegiance of soldiers and citizens throughmilitary victory            Todays commentators make two errors whenthey use charismatic   First they apply the term toinappropriate figures  Even though the words sociologicalmeaning has changed  charisma is thecapacity to inspire devotion and enthusiasm accordingto the latest OED  someone like Henry Kissingercannot merit the label  Calling such publicfigures charismatic devalues the word and strips it ofmeaning meaninglessness certainly triumphs whenwriters see charisma in humor or music            But users of the word make a second more seriouserror when they apply the term to virtuous figuresonly as occurs often  An article in the February Good Housekeeping Charisma Who Has ItHow They Got It  How You Can Get It Too mentionsmore than fifteen charismatic figures from EleanorRoosevelt to Lena Horne all admirable individualsSimilarly Ronald Riggio begins a recentbook on charisma by enumerating eleven charismaticpersons all praiseworthy  After one hundredand twentyfive pages we finally discover some demonsAs a corrective I suggest that someone begina discussion of charisma like thisWould you like to develop your charisma  Wouldyou like to sway others  Would you like thepower to drive nine hundred people to collectivesuicide like Jim Jones  Inspire others to murderlike Charles Manson  Or why not really go forit and annihilate millions of innocents  Hitlerdid it you can too                        Hitler Charles Manson Jim Jonesthey representcharismas other side one our commentators invariablyignore  When was the last time you heard arepulsive figure described as charismatic  In rareinstances an individual not universally admired likeJesse Jackson earns the label but heinous figuresare never charismatic  Weber it is worth notinghad stressed the neutrality of the termOur sociological analysis will treat demagoguesand madmen on the same level as it does thecharisma of men who are the greatest heroesprophets and saviors according to conventionaljudgments                        Weber wanted to compare aspects of charismatic authoritywith aspects of his other two types of authorityHe did not distinguish between villainous charismaticfigures and virtuous ones because suchdistinctions he felt would muddy sociological comparisonsWeber obviously knew the term could applyto both  Modern commentators however willnot attribute charisma to those they do not likeConsider the Ayatollah Khomeini  No political figurein the last two decades was more charismaticthan he  His authority derived from intensely personalqualities he ruled without the institutionalsupports we associate with national leadership heinspired his followers and revolutionized his countryBut to many commentators Khomeini was a fanatic Charismatic is thus used as selectively as neurotic Neurotics are those whose behavior we findodd  If we like them however we speak of theiridiosyncracies             When we do not apply the term charismatic tofigures like Khomeini we trivialize them and wetrivialize their followers  We label Iranian fundamentalistsirrational or unstable because they are inspiredby someone we do not like  But charisma isall about irrationality and we have little reason tobelieve that the followers of Khomeini were less rationalthan the followers of say Jesus  In fact asindicated above the irrationality of the more spectacularcharismata drew concerned comment fromSaint Paul in I Corinthians  The rich etymology ofcharisma teaches us that great villains and great heroescan have strangely similar effects on their followersCharisma should thus be used evenhandedlyas well as selectively  Like other words from the lexiconof social science and philosophy  holistic elitistliberal dialectic  it confuses rather than illuminatesif used indiscriminately  The seasons hottest passwordsmust not triumph over clear communication                              Unraveling

dialects as well as Spanish French andBritish sources            It was in the s that serious scholarship onAmerican place names characterized unlike mostearlier work by thoroughness objectivity and linguistictraining began to be published on a regularbasis  Among the scholarly pioneers was George RStewart whose considered reflections are collectedin standard works entitled Names on the Land revised  and  and American PlaceNames  Prof Allen Walker Read whose distinguishedcareer now spans seven decades contributedsolid yet always thoroughly enjoyable papersand in addition has given us the handy phraseplacename cover to describe how place namesindeed blanket the country with richness color andtexture  Other notables in this necessarily brief catalogueof American toponymists include Henry Gannettworking around the turn of the century whocompiled several state gazetteers and a still influentialstudy on the origin of US place names H LMencken with several seminal chapters in his AmericanLanguage  and Kelsie Harder whose IllustratedDictionary of Place Names United Statesand Canada  remains the most reliable resourcefor placename origins  A full record of workin this field can be found in bibliographies compiledsince  under the names Sealock Seely andPowell the latest edition being Bibliography ofPlaceName Literature United States and CanadaThird Edition   supplemented periodically inthe pages of Names  the quarterly journal of theAmerican Name Society            Toponymy is remarkable not only for the hundredsof talented contributors who have expandedthe scholarship in recent decades but also becauseit is not a formal academic discipline at least not inthe United States  There are no departments of toponymyor even of onomastics that I know of and nodegrees are awarded in these fields  Whether this isalso true of other countries I cannot say  I have readthat toponymy gazetteers and placename surveysreceive more formal attention in the UK and EuropeAmerican toponymy is carried on by peopleof all academic disciplines and from many walks oflife  With academias standard rewards of promotionand tenure not as readily accruing in this work thestudy of American place names is by and large inthe hands of true lovers of the subject amateurs inthe etymological sense and dilettantes  What theysay and write I have found to be characteristicallystimulating and rewarding not plagued by the turgiditythat so often seems to be the norm in scholarlypapers            Place names became an official concern of theUS government in   Confusion had reignedover mining claims land surveys assignment ofpostoffice names and exploration reports and thiscreated havoc and needless expense in bureaucracyparticularly in the government mapping agenciessuch as the US Geological Survey USGS theArmy Corps of Engineers and various otherbranches of the departments of Agriculture Commerceand Interior  In a move that from a lexicographicstandpoint is decidedly unAmerican thegovernment set up an official board to rule on andstandardize the use of place names both domesticand foreign  The United States Board on GeographicNames was established by an executive orderof President Benjamin Harrison in September and has been active ever since publishing itsdecisions and issuing official gazetteers  This may bethe only example in which an aspect of the linguisticpractice of Americans has been regulated by governmentfiat            On the other hand it is largely because of thisunusual intrusion of government that American toponymyhas flourished as a field of study  The USBoard on Geographic Names has compiled andmaintains a massive national database the GeographicNames Information System GNIS  Thiscomputer file lists more than one million placenames of all kinds plus hundreds of thousands ofvariant forms cities and towns lakes and riversmountains and valleys even facilities such asschools parks and cemeteries  The names themselvesalong with precise locational data and identificationby type have been painstakingly keyboardedinto machinereadable form from the mostdetailed USGS topographic maps the socalled minuteseries  Drawn to a scale of  eachminute map sheet or quadrangle covers an areaof  miles northtosouth by about  miles easttowestthe easttowest distance varies depending onlocation since meridians of longitude radiate outfrom the poles and are farther apart nearer the equatorAt this scale more than  map sheets arerequired to completely cover the  contiguousstates  Since it was intended to establish a standardthe GNIS is very regular in format and is compiledand maintained according to carefully prepared proceduresThis daunting task is overseen by theUSGS specifically the Branch of Domestic Namesnow under the direction of Roger Payne  Less comprehensivegovernment files are also maintained bythe Bureau of the Census listing about  populatedplaces and by the National Institute of Standardsand Technology formerly the Bureau of Standardsa compilation complete with numericalcoding of some  populated places localesand neighborhoods of all sizes            The work is by no means at an end  Expertsincluding Mr Payne have estimated that there aremore than  current place names in theUS Consider this figure in light of the fact that thelargest English dictionarynow out of printhad or so entries including many obsoleteforms  The highest estimates of the size of the Englishlexicon number far less than the number of placenames in the US alone  Were it possible to recordand identify all of the current place names the PlaceName Survey of the United States under the directionof the American Name Society is attemptingjust this still remaining would be hundreds of thousandsof now inactive names which are of no lessimportance to historians genealogists and the likeFull coverage would also require accuratepronunciations for each name with sensitivity to localpreferences eg MADrid New York for Madrid BERlin Connecticut for Berlin  and PEERSouth Dakota for Pierre   It is perhaps understandablethat those who undertake the creation of a completerecord of American toponymy have chosen todeal with the estimated  named streetsand highways across the land as a separate project            Taken in this context the recent publication ofthe Omni Gazetteer of the United States of America despite its  entries may properly be seenas only a first step albeit an ambitious one  The editorsof the book identified and acquired several governmentdatabases of place names including ofcourse the GNIS mentioned above  Owing to themarvels of computer technology coupled with theforesight of the government programmers who setup the

States thatis as comprehensive as possible  It is published bothas bound books and on CDROM  Prior to its publicationsuch placename information was only availablein disparate sources and often only on magnetictape or in the form of computer printouts            Having had the opportunity to sift through somany American place names in a relatively shortspan those of us who edited the Omni Gazetteerwere particularly struck by the great diversity inAmerican naming practices and what it suggestsabout the various eras and cultures that were a partof the settlement of the country  In New Englandfor example towns are the primary division of governmentbelow the state level  Most of the land areain the six New England states is within town boundariesand is primarily administered by the town governmentsNew Englanders even if they do not livein an urban area can almost always tell you thename of the town that they live in  As the name NewEngland might suggest many of these town nameswere transplanted from the British Isles  BristolCambridge Chester Durham Essex Hartford LincolnLitchfield Manchester Marlborough MilfordOxford Salisbury Winchester Windsor andWoodstock are town names that occur in three ormore New England states  Apart from these namesof Indian origin Kennebunkport Naugatuck Scituatehonorifics Amherst Franklin and biblicalnames Canaan Rehoboth Hebron account formuch of the rest  As one looks elsewhere in theUS the preponderance of British borrowings diminishesand the purely American inventions increasein proportion as do Indian Spanish andFrenchbased names  The welldocumented Indianinfluence is widespread  Spanish names are particularlycommon in the areas of longlasting Spanish colonialinfluence especially California and the SouthwestFrench names of course are common in theUpper Midwest where French explorers and missionariesand Frenchspeaking trappers left theirmark in states bordering Quebec and in Louisiana            The differing forms of administrative divisionsin the states is also revealed in naming practices  Forexample county government significant in most ofthe US is relatively unimportant in New EnglandIn fact Connecticut and Rhode Island have abolishedcounty government altogether and in thosestates the former county boundaries merely furnisha convenient way in which people can refer to a regionalgroup of towns  But as one travels west andsouth in the US counties are politically vital andtowns in the New England sense at least almostnonexistent  New Englandstyle towns are foundto some extent in New York New Jersey Pennsylvaniaand Wisconsin  In many rural areas west of theMississippi where counties can be as big as NewEngland states and cities are few and far betweenpeople do not associate closely with a city townvillage or any other such entity below the countylevel  Mail of course comes to a post office thathandles rural route delivery but those who receivesuch mail may not live in the place with the postoffice and hence do not immediately associate withit  When asked where they live such folks are morelikely to say their county then give a referencepoint and directions Our place is ten miles northof Baxter off Highway  then left two miles onRoute   So despite more than  populatedplace names recorded in the Omni Gazetteer  thereare still many areas of the country where the placenamecover is thin  Local informants we hope willallow us to correct and expand on the entries compiledso far            Most of the examples above have been populatedplaces as these names tend to be more familiarto a broader audience  So we have not examined thebulk of the placename cover which is in the form ofnames for natural features  But perhaps VERBATIMreaders can more readily allow the author the convenienceof such specialization when they considerthe issue from the viewpoint of a toponymist  Asthose who work in the field all too soon come torealize most of the names have yet to be recordedmuch less described the greater burden lies aheadWith time and additional resources we might beginto see the fight at the end of the tunnel perhaps inten to fifteen years  All the while of course just aswith all aspects of language new names are cominginto being others passing out of use each reflectinga bit of history or culture  Taken together Americanplace names are a unique primary

Infact I checked in another dozen English dictionariesand they all state that savvy comes from Spanishsabe   These dictionaries are simply wrong on thispoint as they are I might add on many other etymologiesNo less an authority than Professor RobertA Hall Jr of Cornell University one of theworlds leading figures in Romance linguistics andhistorical linguistics the author of dozens of

 on LeslieDunklings review of A Dictionary of SurnamesXVII   I would like to add one remark notonly is the list of the authors personal acknowledgmentsfar longer than their bibliography of printedsources consulted as Gold notes but even if a certainwork appears in the bibliography that does notnecessarily mean they relied on it            Here is an example from my own field Jewishfamily names the bibliography lists Benzion CKaganoffs A Dictionary of Jewish Names and TheirHistory  but the few times this work is cited in ADictionary of Surnames  a disclaimer follows immediatelyto the effect that no support could be found forKaganoffs explanation at the name Gordon for instance            It is not surprising that no credence was attachedto Kaganoff  A review of his book in Onoma   pp  begins a disappointmentwhich can be recommended neither for thespecialist nor for the novice  The number oferrors in citation and analysis is staggeringKaganoff is ignorant of most of the relevant literatureFurther severe criticism appeared in JewishLanguage Review   pp  and  pp                               It is not my normal practice to respond to unfavorablereviews of my books since obviously a revieweris entitled to his or her own views attitudesand prejudices when assessing a work  One takesthe rough with the smooth like most things in lifeBut when a reviewer misrepresents what one haswritten I feel a counter is called for            The review of my Bloomsbury Dictionary ofDedications XVII made no mention of the factthat the quoted dedications are glossed or explicatedTo ignore this fact is to treat the book as if itwere a dictionary of headwords with no accompanyingdefinitions or etymologies  The reviewer quotesfive dedications misquoting one and merely saysthey seem to him neither funny nor clever  Theyare actually not meant to be either  But the wholepoint of the apparently trivial dedication by MaryStorr I dedicate this book to my friends is thatthe names of  individual friends follow makingthe dedication something of a record  And whenRoger McGough dedicates his poems for childrento those who gaze out of windows when theyshould be paying attention he is punning on thetitle of the book which is In the Glassroom notClassroom  as misquoted ironically in view of thereviewers own article in the same issue on Accuracyin Quotations            It also seems odd to me that the reviewer shouldnot be curious about the meaning of the strangename in the dedication To my dear friend HommyBegIt is when one discovers that the dedicateewas a Manxman and that the words are Manx forLittle Tommy that one feels the nice sense of satisfactionthat a detective must feel when he has at lastunraveled a long baffling clue  But this gloss on thededication is omitted in the review leaving thereader no wiser than before            Incidentally the reviewer of A Dictionary ofFirst Names  by Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges iswrong to state that they choose to ignore Hugo They dont it is included as a variant of Hugh                               Permit me a few observations on Don Webbsaddendum XVII  to Harry Cohens Jingo LingoXVI             The formers statement that the Frenchwords for junkie are toxoman and morphinman  neitherof which merits official use leaves me puzzledIve never seen or even heard the words toxomanor morphinman  though I wouldnt swear that noFrenchman anywhere has ever used them  Thereare indeed many words invented from pseudoEnglishwith the suffix  man eg barman bartenderrecordman recordholder and dozens of othersbut I dont believe that Mr Webbs two examplesare among them  On the other hand the commonterms morphinomane and toxicomane note spellingsnot only merit official use but have been inthe language for quite some time ca  and respectively as have numerous other nounsegmgalomane cocanomane hronomane thromaneetcending in the similarly pronouncedbut very different Greekrooted suffix  mane    BelleEpoque specialists will recall the celebrated nightclubperformercumanatomicalwonder LePtomane much admired for his ability mirabilerectu to fart  pter  in nearperfect tune unto everysharp and flatulence and with great brio andwhose rendition of La Marseillaise is said to havebeen particularly memorable  For that matter theword junkie itself was even adopted into the Frenchin slang of the eighties le franais branch along with the less common addict  more often reservedfor figurative use  An addict du foot  for exampleis a soccer junkie            While on matters Gallic I would point out inregard to Don Sharps article in the same issueXVII  that though not as addicted to the practiceas American English French is also given to creatingwords from letter abbreviations  Note for examplesuch slang forms as bd from BD bandedessine sophisticated comic strip elp from LP ie longplaying record and jit from JT journaltlvis television news broadcast  Along the samelines though somewhat more involved is the wordpcu toilet paper from PQ  itself a punnish abbreviationof papier cul  which has also come to mean apompous piece of writing with the correspondingverb pcufier                               Jack Orbaum EPISTOLAE XVII  wants tomake readers aware of what he calls a mistranslationin the Bible  He directs readers attention tothe King James version of Isaiah  Behold a virginshall conceive and bear a son  He alsocites the New Testament passage in Matthew which speaks of Jesus as the fulfillment ofthis passage from Isaiah Behold a virgin shall bewith child  He then cites modern translationsof Isaiah which read young woman instead ofvirgin He calls these corrections of the originalmistranslation            Mr Orbaum is correct regarding the translationof the Hebrew word in Isaiah the word  almahmeans young woman and also correct that the Hebrewword betulah means virgin  However in severalrespects he has either misinterpreted the dataor has not taken into account the relationship betweenOld and New Testaments in regard to ancienttranslations              The word  almah which appears in Isaiah can be translated young woman or maiden orwoman of marriageable age  It is a general termand can refer to any young woman  While it is not aspecific indicator of virginity it is not used to meanthat the woman is no longer a virgin  In factRebekah the woman sought as a wife for the son ofAbraham is referred to as  almah in Genesis Rebekahs virginity was never in question and shewas referred to as  almah  not betulah   ThereforeMr Orbaum is incorrect when he says that the Hebrewbetulah would have been used in the originalhad the young woman been a virgin  The word almah allows the possibility that the woman was avirgin              That there is a relationship between Isaiah and Matthew  is correct  The gospel cites the passagefrom Isaiah a virgin shall be with childand considers it to be fulfilled in Jesus  But is thepassage in Matthew a mistranslation Why doesthis gospel use the term virgin  Matthews gospelwas certainly not influenced by an original mistranslationfrom the King James Bible            There is more than one question here Did thegospel of Matthew misquote the Bible  Which Biblewas this gospel using as a source            The New Testament community used a Greektranslation of the Bible not the original HebrewWhen the gospel writers read Isaiah  in theGreek they read parthenos  the Greek translation of almah   This term had a narrower range of meaningthan  almah  and more specifically meant virginbut it was within the range of equivalence for theHebrew term  almah   The gospel writer did not misquotethe Bible in this matter  The gospel writerread the Greek translation and related this passageas well as many others to Jesus              The Greek translators of the Hebrew Biblesome  years or more before the composition ofthe New Testament were not misquoting the Hebrewthey were doing the difficult work of translationfrom one language into another  As all of uswho love words know translators are not mechanicswho simply replace a word in one language by anotherword identical in meaning  Translators are interpretersThey look for the word or phrase whichwill best bring to the audience of their time the textbeing translated            Translators of the King James Bible had thesame task as did the Greek translators centuries beforeto make this ancient text accessible to the readersof their day  What texts did the King Jamestranslators use  They had Greek and Hebrew textsof the Bible and they used these in their work  Thetranslators of the King James Bible were translatingthe Bible for a Christian audience for them the Bibleconsisted of the Old Testament and the New TestamentWhen they read the Hebrew and Greektexts of Isaiah  and the Greek text of Matthew they had to decide which terms from the commonlanguage would best express what was in the ancientmanuscripts  The adoption of the term virgin wasnot a mistranslation it was a judgment of the translatorsbased on the texts which they had before themand the audience for which the translation was intended            Bible translators today as a general rule preferto translate from the original languagesfor the OldTestament or Hebrew Bible Hebrew and Aramaicfor the New Testament Greek  However when thereading is unclear or ambiguous difficult or corruptthe translator will turn to other translations or versionsto see how ancient translators rendered passagesin question  Bible translators today must alsotake into account their audience as they translateThe New English Bible is addressed to an Englishaudience the New American Bible an American audienceThe New Revised Standard Version has aspart of its translation agenda the elimination of languagewhich has been made sexist by the limitationsof English            We must be cautious in our assessments of translationsto be aware of the subtleties of translationbefore we too quickly attach the label mistranslationThat Christians and Jews have different interpretationsof a number of passages in the Bible isapparent  The availability of many excellent translationstoday affords readers a chance to see how avariety of firstrate translators read and interpret ancienttexts  Different interpretations by excellentscholars are far different from mistranslations  Themodern translations of Isaiah which are cited aboveare legitimate translations the King James translationis also a legitimate translation of Isaiah  not amistranslation                              It appears that I am becoming the champion ofmistranslations  Some time ago I came to the defenseof St Jerome and his mistranslation whichgave Moses horns  Now I feel compelled to respondto Jack Orbaums interesting letter EPISTOLAE XVII about the mistranslation of the Hebrew word almah in Isaiah  which Mr Orbaum says oughtnot be translated virgin but young woman            As readers of VERBATIM well know it is simplisticto assume that there is but one correct translationof any given word  Almah is no exception  It almostsurely does mean young woman but it can alsomean a girl maiden bride youthful spouse awoman of marriageable age or the age of pubertyaccording to GeseniusRobinson my trusty Hebrew and English Lexicon  It is not difficult toinfer virginity from some of these usages at least inBiblical times when virginity prior to marriage wasexpected of a woman  My old lexicon also pointsout as does Jack Orbaum that the customary wordfor virgin is bethulah not almah             That brings us to the Septuagint the Greektranslation of the Hebrew Old Testament said tohave been made by  Palestinian Jews during thethird century BC at the command of Ptolemy Philadelphusthis version of the Bible was used inMediterranean lands during the time of Christ andthe early Church  William Rose Bent TheReaders Encyclopedia nd ed  The Septuaginttranslates almah in Isaiah  as parthenosThayers GreekEnglish Lexicon of the New Testamentsays of parthenos a virgin fr Hom downSept chiefly for bethulah several times for naarahtwice for almah   So we see that the Greekword chiefly chosen by the Septuagint scholars tomean parthenos is the word bethulah  which MrOrbaum stresses is the Hebrew word for virgin But the Jewish scholars of the Septuagint also chosethe word parthenos to translate almah in Isaiah where one might have expected a less specificword  It becomes very muddy  GeseniusRobinsonby the way translates bethulah as a virgin pure andunspotted a virgin just married and a youngspouse see Joel  where bethulah is translatedby the Septuagint as nymphe a betrothed woman abride a recently married woman young wifeThayer  The Jerusalem Bible in a footnote to theword maiden as almah is translated by them inIsaiah  saysThe Greek version reads the virgin beingmore explicit than the Hebr which uses almahmeaning either a young girl or a young recentlymarried woman                        A more recent commentary on Isaiah  maybe helpful here or may simply muddy the watersfurther  Carl Stuhlmueller CP in Psalm  andthe Prophecy of Isaiah Evolving into a PropheticMessianic Role in The Psalms and Other Studies onthe Old Testament  writes we return to Isa  and especially the Septuagintrendition of alma  As is well known thisGreek text renders the word with the technicalword for virgin parthenos not with what onewould expect neanisyoung maid the Greekword which is deliberately put in place here inthe ancient Greek versions of Aquila Symmachusand Theodotion  We suggest that the Septuagintsees the maid as Jerusalem the virgin spouse ofthe Lord  The text of Isaiah therefore resoundswith extraordinary richness the mysterious marvelousfertile ways of new life accomplishedsolely by the Lord through Israels faith                        Innumerable chapters and verses might be citedwithout a definitive answer and without convincingany one side of the debate that almah unquestionablymeans or does not mean virgin in Isaiah It may be worth noting here that Martin Luther usedthe word Jungfrau to translate almah  bethulah  andparthenos   Jungfrau  although referring almost exclusivelyto virgin in presentday German has theliteral root sense of young woman or young wifeThe English word virgin itself comes from the Latinvirgo  which can mean virgin maiden or youngwoman and which reflects the same ambiguity asthe other languages            Translation cannot be an exact science and sowe may never know precisely what the author ofIsaiah  or the author of Matthew f meantIsaiahs authors and there were most likely morethan one were poets  Matthews authors had an axto grind and sought to prove a point by using arabbinicalstyle prooftext argument  In either casewe must not expect these writers to use words as weshould like them to have done  Some translators arepoets or teachers too and we must not expect themnecessarily to respond to words in our fashion eitherI would make a plea that we all be a bit morecareful in our use of the term mistranslation            It remains unclear to me on whom Mr Orbaumwould pin the blame for what he calls the originalmistranslation  He seems to suggest that somehowwe should fault the group of translators who producedthe King James Version of the Bible but aswe have seen the confusion lies not so much with agroup of sixteenth century English scholars as withthe very nature of the art of translation  The ChristianChurch nevertheless chose to latch on to theconcept of the Virgin Birth long before the sixteenthcentury  cf  Tertullian who lived c  AD inany case and we do not know whether the use ofIsaiah  was to justify an already extant beliefwith a text or whether it was to take an alreadyaccepted text and graft its meaning as was then understoodupon the events of the Annunciation toMary            Ultimately it seems ones reading here comesmost likely from religious orientation rather thanfrom correctness of translation  We agree to disagreeand meanwhile enjoy the richness of languagesand the art of playing among them

itwrong when they write about Boston or CambridgePerhaps they dont speak the same language                           Verba scripta manent  so goes the Latin tag andthe printed word carries weight even when it is inaccurateEven the graffiti in Pompeii carry weightand are subject to scholarly exegesis though theywere written in haste and there was no leisure torepent  If there is a moral to these anecdotes it isthat writers cannot be too careful  One recalls theadvice given by the aged Martin Joseph Routh President of Magdalen College Oxfordto an undergraduate Always verify your referencessir Check and double check  That is whythey put erasers on pencils                              There Just Isnt a Word for It            When the devil gets the upper hand in meI like to tease my Spanish and SpanishAmericanfriends about some of the words their languagelacks  I tell them that when a specific wordfor a thing or a function is lacking in a language itmust indicate that the thing or the function itself is aconcept that is either unknown or is considered unimportant                           Schedule  for example  Spanish doesnt have aword for it  You can say timetable horario  and youcan proyectar something or programar it  But thatis as near as you can come to a oneword translationof the meaning  And I have noticed that it is no easierto find one word in Spanish that means schedulethan it is to explain to a Spanish speaker the range ofmeaning in schedule in addition to that of timetable             Speaking of meaning  you cant say Do youmean that in Spanish  You can say Are youspeaking seriously which isnt quite the samething  When you want to ask What does that wordmean  you can ask What does that word signifyor What does that word wish to say  and thus takecare of that meaning of meaning adequately  But ifyou want to pin a Spanish speaker down with theequivalent of this useful term in English you aregoing to have to be content to ask him if he is beingserious even if he happens to be dying with laughterover what he has said            Are these things clues to the Hispanic characterand culture  I do not know but they do providematerial for some glorious arguments  There is noword for argument in Spanish either in that sense ofthe word  Argumento is a reasoning or the plot of astory or play  If you had to find one word in Spanishfor our special meaning you would have to chooseamong the Spanish equivalents of discussion debate or quarrel  none of which quite hits the mark            Spanish has only one word for hope esperarbut esperar also means  wait  and  expect  and if thecontext is not clear the Spanish speaker will notknow whether you are waiting for a bus or expectingone or simply hoping that one will come alongeventually            There is no exact word for drop in Spanish  Forthis term you need to use the word for fall  eitherwith the auxiliary let lo dej caer I let it fall or inthe reflexive se me cay it fell itself to me   Eitherway who can blame you  In one case you did itpurposely and in the other the object did it to you            To speak of earning something you must use aword that also means winning   The only word forchairman is presidente   Chairmen do preside ofcourse but to the English speaker steeped in a traditionof civic committees and PTA the functions of achairman go beyond simply presiding  To a Spanishspeaker apparently the head of a committee presidesand that is it            Spanish had no word for leader  and so eventuallythey borrowed ours and can now often be heardto speak of a lder   On the other hand we do nothave a word for caudillo   The nearest we can comeis probably boss or strong man  but these words donot encompass the full Spanish meaning            Which brings us to the subject of words Spanishdoes have that English lacks  Lidiar  for example iswhat a man does with a bull in a bullring and to himthe process is not in the remotest sense a fight   It is alid  and if you do not understand that word you willnot understand him            It may surprise anyone whose minds eye seesthe typical Hispanic as a man in a funny hat sleepingin the shade of a saguaro cactus to learn that Spanishcan express with one word the concept of gettingup early in the morning  The verb is madrugar madrugo I get up early in the morning madrugasyou get up early in the morning madruga hegets up early in the morning            We have borrowed simptico  but I somehow donot get the same pleasant glow from the word in anEnglish context that it arouses in Spanish speech            Street demonstrations in Latin America resoundwith simple cries we simply cannot duplicate in EnglishViva la patria  Hurrah for the fatherlandMueran los demcratacristianos  Kill the ChristianDemocrats Solidaridad  Poles would understandthat but not we English speakers            In contrast to the rather standoffish attitude ofthe English language Spanish is on familiar termswith the deity and things holy or revered  Why notname your son Jesus  Or John of God  You canname him Joseph Mary or Paul Mary  and nobodywill think the less of him  And why not call yourdaughter Conception  or Sorrows Dolores  Or whynot search the calendar of saints and holy days fornames for the newborn  I have even heard of countryboys named Circuncisin  but I have never metone            We are hard put to bring into normal Englishthe diminutive endings that tend to adorn Spanishdiscourse with such interesting furbelows caballitomujercita amiguito autito   There is no hesitancyabout using even a double diminutive as in chiquititoChico would be little chiquito would be tinyor perhaps teenyweeny and chiquitito could onlybe teensyweensy I suppose            In his Growth and Structure of the English LanguageOtto Jespersen noted how few diminutivesEnglish has and how little it uses them  He thoughtthat the use of diminutives produces the impressionthat the speakers are innocent childish genialbeings with no great business capacities or seriousnessin life  Jespersen may have overstated thecase but there is no doubt that whereas no Hispanicmale would hesitate to call a little pig a chanchito few American men would care to be heard callingone a piglet             Nor at the other end of the scale can we matchthe Spanish superlative suffix  simo  eg grandsimoaltsimo bellsimo rendered in English as the biggestthe highest the most beautiful although foran exact equivalency one would use the other superlativeform in Spanish ms grande ms alto msbello   Nothing I have ever heard in English canmatch the breadth of lighthearted insult expressed bya Spanish wit some years ago who used the suffix withreference to the notoriously pampered wellconnectedwellheeled wellplaced brotherinlaw cuado  of Francisco Franco  He called the generalissimosbrotherinlaw el cuadsimo             When your language can do that who careswhether it can

to a minorword pattern in English called reduplication meaninga partial or complete duplication of a given wordMany languages use this doubling pattern some extensivelyHawaiian having only fourteen letters inits alphabet resorts to doubling frequently  Some examplesare lahi thin frail lahilahi weak coffeeetc and wiki hurry wikiwiki hurry up            Reduplication uses two devices that help makelanguage powerful and memorablerhyme andrhythm  Also the usage level of English doubles isusually informal or colloquial and when placed in acontext of standard English a double can make asentence sparkle            Among the several types of doubles in English arather large group ends both parts with the diminutivesuffix  y or  ie   The group seems also to containtwo similar subgroups that produce opposite effectsthose that diminish size and express endearmentor amusement and those that diminish statureor worth and express disapproval or contemptAmong the first group are many childrens

wishywashy  and the double citedabove willynilly   The power gained through rhymeand rhythm seems to be directed by the diminutivesuffix toward favorable or unfavorable meanings            During the Watergate scandal President Nixonhad to face an even more powerful combination onethat incorporated his own nickname in a double thatended with the negative diminutive  y   Whoevercoined the term trickydicky must have sensed thatthe combination would hit hard            Perhaps the two Bush administration officials ortheir writers were aware of objections to the positionsattributed to them and
