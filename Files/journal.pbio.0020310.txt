                            The language of conservation is changing protecting biodiversity is no longer just        about ethics and aesthetics the latest buzzwords are commodities and consumers        Traditionally conservation initiatives have talked up the benefits they will bring to the        global communitysaving species habitats ecosystems and ultimately the planet But        conservation also has its costs and these are usually borne by local people prevented from        exploiting the resources around them in other ways It is unfair to expect a localised        minority to pick up costs that ultimately benefit a dispersed majority argue conservation        biologists There has to be more money made available by concerned individuals        nongovernmental organisations national governments and international bodies and there        need to be better ways to spend this money if conservation is to be effective they say        Biodiversity is a commodity that can be bought and sold We are consumers and must pay                    Costs and Benefits        Kenya boasts one of the worlds most spectacular networks of national parks and reserves        covering around  km         of the country Figure  But devoting such a vast area to        conservation has its drawbacks It has been estimated that were this land developed it        would be worth around  million to the Kenyan people every year Similarly two national        parks in Madagascar are estimated to have reduced the annual income of local villagers by        around  Of course protected areas do bring some benefits to neighbouring communities        most notably through tourism But in many cases the rewards are not great they are rarely        distributed evenly among individuals and do not necessarily outweigh the costs        The costs of conservation fall disproportionately on local people whereas the benefits        are dispersed says Andrew Balmford a conservation biologist at the University of        Cambridge in the United Kingdom National and global communities stand to benefit from        conservation of tropical biodiversity but they must pay if they want to realise that        benefit he says Conservation expenditure in the developed world is only about a third of        what is needed for effective protection of  of the earths terrestrial habitats an area        just large enough to preserve a representative sample of species habitats and ecosystems        in the medium to long term Balmford et al  The developed world must make up this        funding shortfall argues Balmford Whats more there need to be smarter ways to spend the        money thats available he says                    Conservation by Distraction        In recent years many funding bodies have taken an indirect approach to conservation        investing in projects that encourage people to take up alternative practices that are        compatible with conservation rather than investing in conservation itself Perhaps the best        example of this conservation by distraction is ploughing money into communitybased        ecotourism projects Such initiatives aim to bring the benefits of tourism to local people        thereby encouraging them to preserve the biodiversity they have        Its an attractive idea In the mid s the United States Agency for International        Development was investing more than  billion a year in  conservation projects with an        ecotourism component Similarly between  and  the World Bank funded         development projects that supported protected areas in Africa  of which placed an        emphasis on ecotourism        However an absence of quantitative data and analysis has made it hard to judge whether        these projects actually achieve their dual purpose of preserving biodiversity and        simultaneously reducing rural poverty Much of the information about communitybased        ecotourism is anecdotal and subjective says Agnes Kiss of the Environment and Social        Development Unit at the World Bank The real contribution of these initiatives to        biodiversity conservation is debatable she says Many communitybased ecotourism projects        cited as success stories actually involve little change in existing local land and        resourceuse practices provide only modest supplement to local livelihoods and remain        dependent on external support for long periods if not indefinitely Kiss         For example communities involved in the Infierno Community Ecotourism Project in Peru        have received nearly  from their share in a tourist lodge and wages for providing        services to visitors This may have increased the income for a minority that are lodge        employees but only one family whose adult members were all employed by the lodge could        afford to live solely on tourism In the community as a whole the average annual income        from tourism was only  compared with nearly  earned elsewhere Most of the        community was still heavily dependent on other activities and most of those activities are        somewhat disruptive of conservation goals says Kiss        Johan du Toit of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria in South        Africa is also critical of this kind of indirect approach to conservation At the heart of        the argument for communitybased ecotourism is the idea of the ecologically noble savage        he saysthe notion that those living closest to nature will know whats best for it Its        a wonderful idea but it just doesnt work Nowhere in the history of evolution has        sustainability ever been naturally selected for says du Toit The AK automatic assault        rifle has replaced the bow and arrowEvery individual in a rural community thats out        hunting will shoot what he sees when he sees it because if he doesnt somebody else        will        Nowhere is this problem more evident than in the ecotourist paradise of the Galpagos        Islands Figure  where a small minority of fishermen is coming into conflict with        conservation aims with increasing regularity Box  Things are going down very quickly        says one Galpagos guide The iceberg is starting to tip over and we are going to lose        everything If it still pays locals to exploit the environment rather than take part in        one of the worlds most buoyant ecotourism industries it is clear that ecotourism alone        cannot solve the worlds conservation problems Many think that direct payment could be a        useful tool Direct payment very boldly speaking is paying people in rural areas not to        bugger up their environment says du Toit Its just like if we want exclusive artworks        to be looked after in the Louvre Gallery in Paris Somebodys got to pay for it he says        You cant expect the Parisians who live in that arrondissement to cover the costs                    You Get What You Pay forYou Should Pay for What You Want to Get        For people living in developing countries where most of the worlds biodiversity        exists the shortterm rewards of exploiting these natural resources are significant        Replacing indirect conservation measures such as communitybased ecotourism with payments        directly into the pockets of local people could turn out to be a much more effective way to        stem this exploitation argues Paul Ferraro an economist at Georgia State University in        Atlanta Ferraro and Kiss  It could also bring far greater development benefits than        indirect financial support he says Box  An additional spinoff is that direct payments        force conservation biologists to quantify and hence clarify their objectives says John        Hough principal technical advisor on biodiversity for the United Nations Development        Programme We know what we dont want he says but were not very good at saying what        we do want        A hypothetical model simulating how Madagascar should distribute an annual conservation        budget of  million reveals that direct payments would have protected some  of original        forest compared with only  protected through a system of indirect incentives Whats        more the annual income of rural residents would have been twice that generated through        indirect investment Conrad and Ferraro         For Ferraro the logic of direct payment is simple He draws an analogy with a car        journey from A to B There are two routes that will bring you to B one circuitous and the        other direct If you only have a single tank of fuel opting for the direct route improves        the likelihood you will arrive at your destination An indirect approach to conservation is        like taking the circuitous route he says and the chances are that you will run out of        fuel But if its that simple why are governments nongovernmental organisations private        bodies and international organisations not jumping at the chance to experiment with this        approach                    Paying in Perpetuity        There are those that have reservations about direct payments The distinction between        indirect and direct interventions is artificial says Thomas Lovejoy president of the        Heinz Center a nonprofit institution dedicated to improving the scientific and economic        foundation for environmental policy In some cases direct payment is the only way        conservation can happen he says In others the indirect is important to reinforce a        situation where there already is conservation In yet others both are needed        Sjaak Swart of the Section of Science and Society at Groningen University in The        Netherlands argues that if conservation is to succeed it must be rooted in the hearts and        minds of those involved Direct payments create a vision of nature dominated by calculable        monetary concerns he says This approach can only work in the short term he argues and        indirect tools like debate and education are needed to involve communities in the long        term You need the commitment of the local people to save the biodiversity of our world        he says        Marine biologist Steve Trott agrees He is project coordinator for the Local Ocean        Trust a charitybased conservation organisation operating in the Watamu and Malindi Marine        Parks and Reserve in Kenya httpwwwwatamuturtlescom and is using direct payments to        help reduce the slaughter of turtles by local fishermen The Watamu Turtle Watch Program is        currently paying fishermen just over  a turtle to release the animals from their nets        rather than kill them Before the scheme started in  only around  turtles were being        released from nets each year By  more than  a year were making it back into the        sea Elsewhere along the Kenyan coast where fishermen do not get these payments turtles        continue to be killed says Trott However the financial incentives are only part of a        grander program of education and support to sensitise people to the conservation message        he says Eventually the plan is to stop payments altogether Payment will be reduced as        education and awareness is increased to the point where its phased out he says        Reducing or stopping the payment could work says Ferraro but it is more likely that        the turtles will begin to suffer once more If I had to wager Id bet people would go        back to their old patterns eventually This means that direct payments require an ongoing        financial commitment and many people dont like this idea he says                    To the Test        The idea of direct payments needs empirical testing before it can be embraced with        confidence admits Ferraro Funding bodies should demand experimental and control data to        allow the success of an intervention to be gauged Conservation biologists must therefore        be trained in the skills needed to collect and evaluate these data Without adequate data        and controls youre only going to be left with guesses and vague anecdotes about the        effects of a program intervention he says Decision makers should begin to design        controlled experiments from which they can make inferences about the effectiveness of these        different interventions he suggests        There are other drawbacks of direct payments One concern is that they might just shift        the pressure from one site to another that was not previously being exploited Furthermore        in developing countries land tenure is often ambiguous which can make investment an        unattractive prospect for funding agenciesthey want to be sure they know where their money        is going But notes Ferraro such objections also apply to indirect interventions I        dont necessarily believe that conservation payments will be successful he says Its        more I believe that of all the ideas out there for protecting biodiversity this is the        least bad        All this talk of cost benefit and efficiency is creeping into conservation speak For        some these cold and calculating terms are an odd way to describe the worlds wonderfully        unpredictable wildlife But increasingly there are calls for conservation biology to cast        aside its sentimental demons biodiversity is a commodity that can be bought and sold        conservation is business
