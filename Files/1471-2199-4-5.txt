                    Background        Doublestrand ds breakage of chromosomal DNA is        obviously a serious threat to cells because various        activities of the chromosome  gene expression replication        and partition  depend on its integrity However recent        experiments suggest that such chromosomal ds breakage may        occur relatively frequently during normal growth in        several organisms  in bacteria      yeast    and        chicken cells            In         Escherichia coli  spontaneous        breakage and degradation of the chromosome associated with        a replication fork were predicted from early genetic        analysis and were detected under various conditions of        altered replication for review see     DNA ds breaks        play a key role in homologous recombination From a DNA ds        break RecBCD enzyme starts degrading DNA for review see            When it encounters a specific sequence called Chi        it promotes its pairing with a homologous DNA Even in the        absence of RecBCD enzyme         sbcA mutation confers other        recombination pathway called RecET pathway The         recE gene product of the Rac prophage        converts dsDNA ends into  protruding singlestranded form        and the         recT gene product promotes        recombination by annealing them with a homologous DNA in        its vicinity for review see      This recombination        may result in one progeny DNA nonconservative        recombination or two progeny DNAs conservative        doublestrand break repair     In a         recBC sbcBC background a ds end        stimulates homologous recombination that results in only        one progeny DNA nonconservative recombination            Analysis of the stimulation of recombination by replication        for review see     and analysis of altered        chromosomal replication for review see     led to        the proposal that a chromosomal ds break formed during        replication fork arrest triggers homologous recombination        which would reconstitute a replication fork for review        see            Game and his colleagues have developed a sensitive means        of detecting chromosomal ds breakage using a circular        chromosome     Under most conditions of pulsedfield        gel electrophoresis a circular yeast chromosome and        circular bacterial chromosomes will not enter the gel very        likely because they are trapped by the branches of the        network of agarose       One doublestrand break        transforms this circular form into a linear form which can        now move slowly in the gel     We used this procedure        to detect doublestrand breakage of a circular bacterial        chromosome occurring spontaneously or after loss of a        restrictionmodification gene complex      We found        increased chromosome breakage in         recBC null and         recC mutants of         E coli under both conditions            Michel and her colleagues used pulsedfield gel        electrophoresis to detect degraded chromosomal DNAs arising        spontaneously in         recBC mutants and arising during        replication fork arrest     RuvABC proteins which        catalyze migration and cleavage of Holliday junctions are        responsible for the occurrence of the degraded DNAs        following replication fork arrests            In this work we employed the pulsedfield gel        electrophoresis procedure to measure large noncircular        forms of the chromosome obtained from various        recombinationdefective mutants in         rec          recBC sbcA  and         recBC sbcBC genetic backgrounds                    Results                  Effect of growth medium on the accumulation of          large chromosomal fragments          Large linear chromosomal fragments were measured by          pulsedfield gel electrophoresis In our analysis          growing           E coli cells are harvested          embedded in an agarose plug and lysed           in situ  The chromosomes in a plug          are electrophoresed in varying electric fields An          example of such a gel is shown in Figure  The DNA is          partitioned in three places in the gel  the well the          area just below the well marked by a bar to the right of          the gel and the lower area Intact circular chromosomes          stay in the well     likely because they are trapped          in the branches of agarose resin     Large linear          forms generated by a ds break in this circle would escape          from agarose trap and form broad bands beneath the well          marked by the bar This area corresponds to unbranched          linear forms DNA of more than  kb when compared with          yeast chromosome markers When the DNAs become smaller by          degradation they will migrate further These          interpretations are based on a previous work with a yeast          circular chromosome and on our analysis of           E coli chromosomal breakage after          loss of restrictionmodification genes       In          this work we focus on the second DNA species  the huge          linear forms in the area just below the well Figure           marked by the bar          In the experiment shown in Figure  a           rec strain in AB background          grown in minimal medium M Figure  lane  gave rise          to some of these huge linear DNAs in this area There was          less of this DNA species when the cells were grown in a          rich medium LB Figure  lanes  In an isogenic           recB recC strain the amount          was larger than in           rec           We do not know why the medium makes such a difference          It could reflect properties of the spontaneous DNA          damages the replication fork the number of replication          forks the number of chromosomes the organization and          structure of the chromosomes the repair machinery or          the availability of homologous chromosomes for repair          All of these features will influence the chromosome          stability not only in           rec  but also in mutants This          mediumdependence is in the opposite direction to what is          simply expected from generation of a doublestranded          chromosomal end by collapse of a replication fork with          another replication fork moving in the same direction              because replication initiation should be more          frequent in a rich medium than in a poor medium Whatever          the reason we chose to use the rich medium in which the           rec strain produce less linear          forms because the background is clear and may allow          sensitive detection of their increase in a survey of          various recombinationdefective mutants                          recand ruvmutations          The accumulation of huge linear DNAs was also seen in          other           recBC null mutants in this AB          genetic background            recB            recC and           recC Figure A and in another          V genetic background            recC Figure B as observed          earlier      A           recD mutant showed no accumulation          The other nonnull           recBCD alleles examined            recC recC recC recC          recC recB  and           recB  did not accumulate the          huge linears Figure B We do not know why the same          mutant allele           recC  shows more accumulation in          V background than in AB background in a          reproducible manner Figures Aand B          The other mutants tested            recA recF recG recJ recN recO          recQ recR ruvAB  and           ruvC  did not accumulate huge          linear DNAs The           recF mutation partially suppressed          the effect of the           recC mutation in accumulating the          huge linear chromosomes Figure B                          recBC sbcAbackground          In the           recBC sbcA strain an           sbcA mutation on the Rac prophage          expresses           recET genes which promotes          homologous recombination at a ds end     The          accumulation of the huge linears was seen with           recA recE recT recJ recQ recF          recO and           recR strains Figure C Mutations          in genes involved in processing Holliday structures            recG ruvAB and           ruvC  did not lead to their          accumulation The accumulation by           recJ mutation was suppressed by a           recQ mutation Figure C lanes           and                           recBC sbcBCbackground          In the           recBC sbcBC strain RecBCD enzyme          is inactive and RecFOR and RecQJ proteins promote          recombination together with RecA     In the           recBC sbcBC background           recA recF recJ recQ and           recR mutants accumulated these huge          linears to varying extents Figure D However again          the           ruvC mutation did not lead to          accumulation                          Control experiments          These assays were carried out more than twice for each          strain and the extent of accumulation of the linear          forms was reproducible The DNA in the area just below          the origin was also measured by densitometry to confirm          the above results data not shown          When the chromosomal DNA in the agar plug was digested          with a restriction enzyme            Xba I before the pulsedfield gel          electrophoresis all the strains examined produced          comparable amounts of DNA Figure  This amount is much          larger than the large linear forms This indicates that          the total amount of undegraded DNA associated with the          cells is comparable for all the strains                            Discussion        We found that large noncircular forms of the        chromosome accumulate in varying amounts in various        recombinationdefective mutants of         Escherichia coli         Our operational definition of the noncircular forms is        their presence in an area just below the well in our        pulsedfield gel as marked by a bar in Figure  The        molecular species in this area may not be limited to a        simple linear form of varying lengths If a chromosome        carries multiple replication forks as usual at C in rich        media more than one doublestrand break may be necessary        to form a noncircular branched species which should be        able to move through the gel Finding out macroscopic forms        of these giant molecules would be a technical challenge        see     for example We do not know why DNAs make        two broad bands in this area Figure  th lane for        example either Depending on the electrophoresis        condition one narrow band a pair of two bands or one very        broad band was observed data not shown        Abundance of these huge noncircular forms is expected        to be affected by several factors which might work        potentially in opposite directions such as i breakage        in the cell ii degradation in the cell iii repair in        the cell iv breakage and degradation out of the cell        Each term is in turn affected by other factors such as        chromosome organization number of the replication forks        speed of the replication forks abundance of specific        proteins and so forth Therefore our finding of        accumulation of more of the nonlinear forms in a rich        medium than in a poor medium Figure  does not        immediately allow us to conclude that starving conditions        induce a chromosomal doublestrand breakage        Spontaneous DNA damages repair and degradation are        expected to be the key processes in interpreting our data        Spontaneous DNA damages may interfere with replication fork        progression and produce chromosomal doublestranded breaks        This would lead to extensive exonucleolytic degradation        Complete repair at some of these steps would reconstitute a        circular chromosome which will stay in the well On the        other hand further degradation of the huge noncircular        forms would result in shorter or no fragments which will        run faster in the gel The presence of huge linear forms        therefore probably indicates both the absence of complete        repair and the absence of further degradation The absence        of the large linears could either mean the presence of        complete repair or the presence of extensive degradation        activity Our control experiments demonstrated that        restriction digestion of chromosome DNAs before the        electrophoresis results in release of comparable amounts of        DNA from the wells in all the strains examined Figure         This result at least excludes the possibility that the        absence of the large noncircular chromosomes in some        strains Figure  reflects the absence of DNAs in the        wells during the process or by extensive and general        nuclease action Of course we cannot exclude the        possibility that the broken chromosomes specifically have        suffered extensive degradation        In spite of these potential complexity and essential        ambiguity our measurements provided a unique clue to the        action of recombinationassociated enzymes in the        chromosome metabolism Indeed some of our observations in        the mutants can be readily related to the established        properties of the affected enzyme        Accumulation of the huge linear DNAs in the         recBC null mutants can be interpreted        from the known properties of RecBCD enzyme in a        straightforward way These null mutant enzymes cannot        degrade DNA from a ds break nor can they repair DNA by        recombination     We assume that they cannot repair the        broken chromosomes to form intact circular chromosomes and        that they cannot degrade them into smaller pieces The         recD mutant does not show nuclease        activity but is recombinationproficient and able to repair        the broken DNA molecules     This explains why it does        not accumulate the huge linear forms The other nonnull         recBCD mutants          recC recC recC recC        recC recB  and         recB  are all nuclease positive             They would be expected to degrade the huge        linears They retain some to nearly complete recombination        proficiency      which may contribute to repair of        the large linears into circles The other        recombinationdefective mutants in otherwise         rec background did not accumulate        the huge linears probably because the DNA was degraded by        active RecBCD enzyme or was not produced        Partial suppression of the accumulation of the huge        linears in a         recBC null allele by a         recF mutation Figure B leads to        several possible explanations For example RecFmediated        homologous recombination may transform a circular        chromosome possibly with a spontaneous damage into some        type of noncircular forms This is expected because        RecFmediated recombination is nonconservative in the        sense that it generates only one progeny DNA molecule from        two parental DNA molecules     Alternatively RecF        function may somehow help generation of broken chromosomes        or maintenance of break to load RecA            In the         recBC sbcA and the         recBC sbcBC backgrounds the absence        of RecBCD nuclease may prevent faster degradation of the        large noncircular DNAs However we see only little        accumulation of the broken forms One might expect that the        accumulation of the huge linears may correlate with the        capacity for recombination repair that reconstitutes a        circular form Indeed the effects of         recA recJ and several other         rec mutations on accumulation of the        huge linear chromosomes in these two         recBC backgrounds Figures Cand D        were similar to their negative effects on conjugational        recombination    with interesting exceptions see next        paragraph This accords with the concept that a huge        linear fragments of the chromosome is involved in        recombination following conjugation However any of the        recombination mutants that lead to accumulation of linear        DNA could affect the probability of breaks occurring in the        first place        The mutations in Hollidaystructureprocessing enzymes         RecG RuvAB and RuvC  did not result in accumulation of        the huge linears even in the         recBC minus background The complex        intermediate forms accumulating in these mutants may be        trapped in the agarose gel see      An alternative        interpretation could be that these enzymes may be involved        in generation of doublestrand breaks as hypothesized by        Seigneur         et al            The accumulation by the         recJ mutation in the         recBC sbcA background is suppressed        by a         recQ mutation Figure C Kusano et        al    found that both sensitivity to DNA damaging        agents and decreased association of crossingover with        doublestrand break repair in a         recBC sbcA recJ strain are suppressed        by mutant         recQ alleles Such suppressing        relationship was interpreted to suggest that RecQ acts        prior to or concurrently with RecJ Pulsedfield gel        electrophoresis analysis of chromosomes after ultraviolet        irradiation has revealed extensive chromosome degradation        dependent on         uvrA incision enzyme     A        report    showed that RecQ and RecJ proteins process        nascent DNA at replication forks blocked by ultraviolet        irradiation prior to the resumption of DNA synthesis see        also            The accumulation of the noncircular broken chromosomes        correlated with the growth rate or DNA damage response in        most of the         recBC minus background     The         recB or         recC null mutation showed low        viability even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage             A simple interpretation of these data is that RecA        RecFOR and RecQJ functions and RecET functions for the         sbcA background repair chromosome        breakage andor prevent generation of the breakage The        major contradiction observed here is the phenotype in         ruv mutants The         ruv mutants in all the background did        not show any accumulation of the broken chromosome This        may suggest that the possible role of Ruv protein is making        a break into dsDNA                        Conclusions        Our sensitive measurements of the large noncircular        forms of the chromosome  which should be able to detect        one ds break out of  million bp  provided unique sets of        data that would help in further elucidating the mechanisms        of chromosome doublestrand break repair A simplest        interpretation of our data is that RecBCD enzyme is        involved in repair and degradation of broken chromosomes        and that RecA RecFOR RecQJ and RecET functions are        involved in prevention andor repair of the breakage        Interaction was observed between a         recC mutation and a         recF mutation and between a         recQ mutation and a         recJ mutation         ruvABC mutants and a         recG mutant did not accumulate broken        chromosomes Further molecular analysis would bring about        interpretation of the present data in detailed molecular        terms                    Methods                  Bacteria
