been seeing someoneexclusively for more than a year Its exclusive on her part but everybodyknows he is cheating on her That is not the only problem He belittles her inpublic and is quite a cheapskate I have gently tried to tell her she is toogood for this lout but she will have none of it                                       I feelhelpless and I worry for her I am the older sister if you hadnt guessed Isthere anything to be done                                       Banging My HeadAgainst a Wall in Portland                        DearBang            Prudie is reminded of thedelicious Dorothy Parker remark She has put all her eggs in one bastard            How sad for you to be abystander while your sister is having a romantic neardeath experience Alasthe kind of bystander you are is helpless because people in theserelationships have blinders on and defenses in place Prudie too abhors thesetranscendentally horny louses but outside observers dont get a vote            Yoursister alas does not regard Lover Boy as a problem Yet But have hope Theday will come when your sib will see things clearly for herself and her lovingsister will be there to help her pick up the pieces Since you have gone onrecord about what you think of this boulevardier  say no more It wouldbe the vocal equivalent of throwing good money after bad            Prudiesympathetically                                             DearPrudence                                                      My company has salesteams and my problem has to do with my traveling partner We are in the air alot and in hotels and restaurants I am mortified much of the time becauseElaine is always dropping things into her purse On airplanes she helpsherself to the little liquor bottles she doesnt drink and those plastic saltand pepper things In restaurants she cleans out the bread basket and transferseverything to her purse                                       I knowwhen she is seen doing this people think we are a pair of nuts and assumeshes doing it for both of us and I also worry that this is stealing Can youhelp me come to terms with this situation Thank you                                       No Sticky FingersFrom Chicago                        Dear NoStick            Prudie is sympathetic to yourtraveling partner because well Prudie herself is partial to those littlebrown sugar packets in restaurant sugar bowls While never having had theinclination to transfer an entire bread basket to her handbag Prudie has onoccasion taken a particularly good tasting piece of bread for laterprovidedthere is a paper napkin for wrapping If one was to filch a cloth napkin thatwould be stealing            Your friends appropriationof food put on the table you should know is not dishonest The two of youhave essentially paid for everything served to you Granted most twosomeswould not polish off the entire contents of a bread basket but it isthe diners The same is true for the airplane offerings            If it willhelp you feel better about things encourage Elaine to ask the server for atakehome container for whatever she wishes to transport out of the diningroom Prudie finds most restaurants more than happy to oblige If howeveryour associate thinks she is engaging in petty larceny and gets her jolliesfrom purloined rolls indulge her knowing that it is a harmless habit            Prudie portably                           DearPrudence                                       Im a happygoluckyyearold retiree who alas gets incredibly annoyed whenstrangerstypically on the phonecall me by my first name Im a liberalDemocrat and am not oldfashioned but such pseudo friendliness turns meoff                                       It also makes dealingwith business people difficult Example Just the other day I called a salesmanregarding refinancing the house and left my name and number When he calledback he said Hi John this is Mr Blank                                       I told him Id prefer tobe called Mr Jones He got annoyed and told me he has closeknit relationshipswith his clients He then continued to call me John throughout his explanationof what refinancing involved                                       Whenhe finished I told him again I did not wish to be called John He becameflustered said goodbye and hung up Ive not heard from him since I ask youam I out of step with the world Is it OK for young secretaries to assume wereon a firstname basis Quite frankly I consider such an approach an invasionof my privacy I also consider it a putdown What sayest thou                                       Wondering in TucsonAriz                        DearMr Won            Prudie is in your campPeople who presume to use a first name in a business call seem thoughtlessThey register on the Prudometer right next to those who invite you to Have anice day            Using the first name ofsomeone who is unknown to you is presumptuous disrespectful and improperYour Mr Blank who tried to make a case yet for why it was OK to call youJohn sounds like a horses patootie That he didnt follow up on the financialtransaction is no loss Surely you will find someone with equal skills who willcall you Mr            Prudie on occasion hasasked service people on the other end of the line who launch into a firstnameaddress Do we know each other This is usually sufficient for them to swinginto a Mrs mode Only a clod would persist            What isbehind this pseudo familiarityequality Prudie thinks is Californiacasualness and a touchyfeely cultural shift that have replaced formality andcivility Rest assured that you are not out of stepor if you are that Prudieis right there with you            Prudie respectfully                           DearPrudence                                       I have moved back to myhometown and renewed acquaintances with old highschool girlfriends As timegoes on we are becoming closer and spending more time together The problem isthis Most of them smoke and I do not When we go out to dinner we always sitin the smoking section When I visit their homes they smoke constantly Whenthey come to my home they are forever going out to the balcony to smoke Iknow that breathing this smoke is harmful to me Normally I avoid smoke yet Ipretend it doesnt bother me with these friends                                       Thequestion is should I consider my own health and the fact that when I am withthem I am inhaling probably a pack of cigarettes Should I stop seeing them Idont really want this but what else to do Yes I could ask them not tosmoke but since there are five of them who do smoke it seems like themajority rules                                       LG St PetersburgFla                        Dear L            Your old highschoolgirlfriends are causing you to regress to  high school You are feeling thatyouve got to go along with everybody else to fit in Prudie is mindful ofthe fact that a gemtlich bunch of girlfriends is wonderful but thiscrowd is hazardous to your health the deleterious effects of secondhand smokehaving been accepted by most people            It isinteresting that this clique is composed entirely of smokers There is a slimpossibility that your chums out of affection for you will not smoke in yourpresence and would give up the smoking section in restaurants Failing thatbear in mind that the concept of majority rule applies to elections andcommunity decisions not health risks Prudie is reminded of a Russianexpression Once your head is cut off there is no use crying about your hairIf you become illor worsea group of girlfriends will be meaningless Pleaseput your lungs before your social life otherwise Prudie will worry            Prudiedeepbreathingly
