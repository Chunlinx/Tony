                                 Is America Too Democratic               Europeans love to condescend to Americans but not until historian C VannWoodward put all the ways they do so into a book The Old Worlds NewWorld  which came out in was it possible to see how inventive theyvebeen about it over the past four centuries First they worried about ourenvironmentour animals were dwarfish and our plants lacked nutrients Thenthey fretted about our intellectual life Would we ever produce great poetsThen they waxed romantic about our charming freedom from social hierarchy Thenthey turned against it since the French Revolution had proved that socialequality could never work And on it goes a list of nosewrinkling quibblesyou can still hear today Were mercenary selfcentered impolite and worstof all too bourgeois to understand the geniuses of our age such as JerryLewis and Mickey Rourke            The latest outburst of Continental condescension comes sad to say from anAmerican albeit one who spends a great deal of time in Paris Writing lastSunday in the New York Times Magazine  New York University politicsprofessor Mark Lilla claims to have discovered why the Sixties still incitedebate in America under the guise of the culture wars whereas such mattershave long since been resolved in Europe Americans naively make a religion outof democracy They just dont understand that politics is politics and cultureculture and so when they have a political revolution theyre forced to applyits principles to every aspect of our lives Hence feminism or rather inLillas kind words the joyless militancy of American feministsmulticulturalism gay rights and all the other movements which subjectpersonal relations to the exacting scrutiny of pure democraticprinciples            Undergirding Lillas hesitations about the spread of democracy into variouscorners of life are of course two Europeansthe two he credits with firstdescrying the worrisome existential character of the American democraticfaith the Frenchman Alexis De Toqueville and the Englishwoman FrancesTrollope But Woodward reveals the latter to have been possibly the biggestsnob ever to chronicle American life She was revolted by that coarsefamiliarity untampered by any show of respect which is assumed by thegrossest and the lowest in their intercourse with the highest and mostrefined And De Tocqueville who is worth listening to concluded histravels in America with an endorsement that dismissed all criticisms madeearlier To quote Woodward Granting that the wishes of democracy arecapricious its instruments rude its laws imperfect granting as well anappalling list of shortcomings that he abhorredminds so petty so insipidso crowded with paltry interestsTocqueville still regarded democracy not asthe best but as the only means of preserving freedom                           Or Do We Just Hate Intellectuals                        Cultureboxs friend Nicholas Lemann writes            The first time I saw Saving Private Ryan  it was hard to react in anyway more nuanced than just being nearly flattened by its overwhelming powerThe second time though I detected one false and creepy note That is thedemonization of Upham the translator in Captain John Millers stick in thefinal extended battle scene Over and over we are reminded of Uphamscowardice Upham in giant trembly sweaty closeup cringes in fear Upham failsto come to the aid of his buddies Upham has a series of clear shots at Germansoldiers who dont see him and cant bring himself to pull the trigger WhenUpham finally does kill its too late to do any good and in clear violationof the Geneva Conventions I saw the movie at a multiplex in the Bronx and myappreciation of this point was sharpened by the audiences yelling faggotevery time Uphams face filled the screen Youre clearly meant to hold Uphampersonally responsible for the death of three of his comrades at armsincluding as I read the narrative logic Captain Miller the hero            The creepy part is Upham is a sensitive artistic type who announces earlyin the movie that he wants to depict the bonds that form among soldiers incombatall of which also applies to the auteur of Saving Private Ryan Steven Spielberg Spielberg isnt the first fictionalizer of war to establishhis macho bona fides by humiliating a spunoff pusillanimous version ofhimself Remember Keefer the writercharacter in The Caine Mutiny  whospends most of his time proclaiming the superiority of moral principle topersonal loyalty just like Upham and then gets humiliatingly told off in theend The move here is to react to the automatic suspicion of anyone artsy in amilitary setting by signing on to it rather than challenging it See I agreewith you They are all pansies Im a regular guy too The Uphamcharacter is a particularly lurid examplehis body type skinny and hismovements mincing are completely different from those of the other soldiersand seem somehow to be linked to his being more educated Could hiscartoonishness be an indication of how defensive Spielberg who like nearly alluppermiddleclass Americans of his generation didnt serve in Vietnam feelsregarding the military and its virtues
