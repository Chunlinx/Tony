                    Background        With the rising trend towards consumerism in health        patients are increasingly encouraged to become involved in        making decisions about their health Marketing campaigns        for prescription drugs are now being directed towards        patients with advertisements appearing in the popular        press suggesting that patients discuss medications and        treatment options with their doctors A recent study        examining the effect of drug advertisements on consumer        behavior found that  of study participants asked for a        prescription and  asked a physician for information        about a drug after seeing a drug advertisement     In        order for patients to be effective participants in the        decision making process they need information on the        effects of treatment on their health risks that they can        use to make health care decisions The challenge to        clinicians is how to present risk information to patients        that they can use in a format that they prefer        Several studies have examined how presentation             wording    and framing     affect physicians        interpretations of numeric data as well as their        willingness to initiate treatment     However few        studies have examined the effect on patients of framing        risk data with different metrics such as relative or        absolute risk and the number needed to treat NNT        Relative risk describes the ratio of the risk of disease in        one group compared to that in another and does not take        into consideration a persons baseline risk Absolute risk        describes the difference between the risks of disease in        two populations and varies according to baseline risk A        derivative of absolute risk is the NNT with a specific        therapy to prevent one adverse outcome the inverse of the        difference in absolute risk Framing the benefits of        treatment in relative rather than absolute terms may        emphasize the shortterm benefits of a treatment             Conversely framing the risks of treatment in relative        rather than absolute terms may emphasize its risks            Comparing relative and absolute risk reduction and NNT as        methods to inform patients about preventive therapies Hux        et al illustrated that the metric used to present data can        affect a patients perception of a therapys effectiveness                   In addition to consideration of which metric is used to        describe risks the time horizon over which risks or        benefits occur may affect risk interpretation Typically        risks framed in relative terms are not explicit about the        time frame involved and may be erroneously interpreted as        accruing immediately On the other hand risks framed in        absolute terms or as the NNT tend to report a specific time        frame and hence may be interpreted as being delayed in        onset In addition to issues related to comprehension        patients may prefer to have risks presented over specific        time periods        While most framing studies focused on a treatments        effect on a single outcome over a single time horizon        patients often need to decide on treatments that affect        multiple outcomes both beneficial and harmful For        example the decision of whether or not to use hormone        replacement therapy HRT after menopause involves weighing        the benefits of treatment immediate symptom relief           decreased future risk of hip fracture    and possible        decreased risk of coronary heart disease             against its risks increased future risk of breast cancer            Framing effects appear to be smaller when both the        beneficial and harmful effects of a treatment are included           but little information is available to guide        clinicians about how to explain complex risk information to        their patients        Most studies exploring risk communication and        decisionmaking have focused on the use of different        metrics However data can be described using a variety of        different graphical formats as well Survival curves are        commonly used in the scientific literature and can also be        used to help patients understand risk information when        deciding between two treatments     Figures using         faces or ovals to represent populations with and without a        condition displayed in a random    or consolidated           fashion have gained increasing popularity in the lay        press as have simple bar charts        The choice of graphical formats may affect patient        performance on cognitive tests        accuracy        of comprehension and speed of processing probabilistic        information Vertical bars horizontal bars numbers and         consolidated ovals performed better than either pie        charts or  random ovals when testing simplified        cognitive tasks eg identifying the larger of two        quantities     The type of visual graphic used to        present information can also introduce bias in risk        perception with risk perceived to be less when using a bar        graph versus a stick figure            Numerous criteria have been used to evaluate graphical        formats including clarity helpfulness     accuracy        and efficiency    though these criteria may not        necessarily be those of greatest importance to patients        themselves Although it is unclear which criteria should be        used to evaluate formats to use with patients patient        preferences may be an important consideration Formats        preferred by patients may reflect higher perceived        relevance familiarity usefulness usability and        meaningfulness and hence may be more successful in        engaging their attention The aim of this study is to        determine patient preferences for the presentation of        complex benefitrisk information describing the impact of        treatment on multiple clinical outcomes over multiple time        horizons including preferences for graphic formattime        horizons multiple outcomes comparisons and metrics The        specific example tested was deciding on HRT among a        population of periand postmenopausal women                    Methods                  Graphic format          We identified the following graphic formats as being          the most commonly used in the scientific and popular          press and therefore the most recognizable to patients          bar graphs line graphs thermometer graphs           representative faces displayed in a consolidated fashion          and survival curves Figures   The survival curve          was atypical in that its yaxis presented a patients          chance of not developing a disease instead of the more          standard chance of survival This modification was made          to keep the data presented consistent with data presented          in the other graphical formats since survival was not          presented in the other graphs the chance of not          developing a disease is the closest equivalent to          survival which is the chance of not dying Pie charts          were not included because this format did not readily          lend itself to describing risks over time Participants          were sequentially presented with all graphic formats and          each was briefly explained Participants were asked to          rate how much they liked each graph on a likert scale of           to  with  corresponding to not at all and           corresponding to extremely and then to rank order the          graphs according to preference                          Time horizons          Participants were also asked to rank order their          preferences for risk estimates over year year or          lifetime horizons presented using bar graphs predicting          a womans risk for developing heart disease hip fracture          and breast cancer                          Multiple Outcomes          Participants preferences for risk displays about          multiple clinical outcomes were elicited by asking          participants to choose between  sets of  graphs In Set          A each of three diseases was displayed separately over           time horizons Figure  In Set B the same three          diseases were displayed together over one time horizon          this was repeated for the other two time horizons Figure           Note that the exact same data were presented in each          set differing only in format                          Metrics          Preferences for absolute vs relative risk estimates          were obtained by asking participants to choose between          risk estimates for heart disease framed in either          absolute or relative terms both graphically and          textually Finally participants evaluated the concept of          NNT presented with two written explanations The first          explanation referred to as  in x was worded If           women just like you took lifelong HRT it would prevent          one of the  from having heart disease If  women took          lifelong HRT it would prevent one of the  from having a          hip fracture If  women took lifelong HRT it would          cause one of the  to develop breast cancer There is no          way of knowing in advance who these women might be The          alternative explanation referred to as x out of           was worded If  women just like you were to take          lifelong HRT treatment would prevent  of them from          developing heart disease and  of them from developing a          hip fracture However treatment would cause  of them to          develop breast cancer There is no way of knowing in          advance who these women might be          We assessed differences in patients preferences          between the two graphs with the highest mean rating using          a Wilcoxon signedrank test Descriptive statistics were          performed on subgroups stratified according to race          Caucasian vs nonCaucasian annual household income           vs and education  years          college vs   years college Statistical comparisons          within subgroups were not performed due to the small          sample size                            Results        Study participants included a diverse group of  peri        and postmenopausal women Table  Half of our sample        identified themselves as nonCaucasian All participants        had at least some high school education most  had an        annual household income of less than         The mean preference rating for the bar graph exceeded        those of the four other graphs in this set Table  Most        respondents  ranked the bar graph as being their first        or second most preferred graph with more than half of all        respondents  selecting the bar graph as their first        choice Figure  The bar graph was consistently rated        highest when the sample population was stratified according        to race income and educational status Subgroup analyses        are shown in Table  recognizing that these analyses are        limited considering the small sample size        Most respondents preferred receiving risk estimates over        multiple time horizons vs at one time point When asked to        prioritize a majority preferred receiving lifetime risk        estimates instead of  or year time horizons Table        a There was no clear preference for the type of        presentation comparing risks for multiple disease outcomes        over different time horizons Table b Respondents        preferred risk estimates framed in absolute rather than        relative terms for both graphical and textual displays        Table c this finding was consistent across racial        income and educational subgroups Participants        consistently stated that they wanted graphical and textual        explanations of absolute risks provided together In        describing NNT respondents preferred the written        explanation which rescaled data from in x to x out of         Table d                    Discussion                  Limitations          The present study included a small selfselected          population of women who were more likely to be interested          in healthrelated activities Our sample size was small          because focus groups and on interviews were          originally conducted to discuss HRT and decisionmaking          issues When convergence was reached on these broader          topics we ceased recruitment and analyzed data from          these respondents While these results may not be          generalizable to all women our sample included a diverse          group of women with respect to race income and          educational background Recognizing that focus group          discussions might lead to group think we control for          this by asking participants to privately write down their          personal preferences before they were discussed          A formal analysis of patient comprehension for each          presentation format was beyond the scope of the present          study however data on this topic has been previously          reported     While responses from focus group          participants reflected how well they felt they could          understand the information in various formats no formal          testing of comprehension was performed Analyzing          comprehension of each format at this stage was not          feasible considering the additional time burden it would          have imposed on our study participants focus group          sessions lasted a full  hours Presentation formats          that are not understandable may be misinterpreted          formats that are unappealing may be ignored Therefore          future studies might test both comprehension and patient          preferences simultaneously to develop future risk          communication tools          The graphical presentations utilized were hypothetical          in that they did not present each individuals personal          risk estimates but those of a theoretical woman It is          unlikely that patients preferences for risk estimate          presentations would have been different had they been          shown their own risk estimates Not all possible graph          types were presented to study participants although we          attempted to include the most common graph types from the          scientific and popular press Although we did not          systematically study the reasons for participants stated          preferences participants were asked openended questions          to understand these preferences Finally since          scientific literature traditionally presents year          survival data it might be difficult to compare our data          based on year year and lifetime horizons to that          in the current literature                            Conclusions        Patients preferred health risks to be framed in absolute        terms using bar graphs and calculated over their expected        lifetime There was no clear preference for presenting a        treatments effect on multiple outcomes The NNT is not an        easily understood concept for patients but if used to        discuss multiple outcomes it should be rescaled to x out        of  The results of these analyses should help        physicians present riskbenefit information to patients in        a clear and useful manner
