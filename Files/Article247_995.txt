                                  Them were the Good Old Days                        Andrew            Well Im glad you think me your equal in slyness But do I read youcorrectly to say that you long for the mores of the year  before theprogressive income tax turned us redblooded Americans into collectivist miceat the mercy of the Big State You really ARE reactionary I keep forgettingthat            The state was pretty big in  Andrew For instance it outlawedinformation about birth control and many other forms of free speech itenforced Jim Crow laws in the South it denied women the right to vote andbarred them from many occupations and activities It used its police power onbehalf of mining and industrial interests to break strikes beat updemonstrators and deport immigrants with the wrong ideas What conservativesusually mean when they talk about Big Government is government that puts somekind of limit on the power of business to do whatever it wants For all youropposition to the Big State for instance dont you oppose legal abortionEven though effectively criminalizing abortion would mean an immense expansionof police power            What really amazes me in your posts is your reluctance to admit that the UShas or ever had any problems or injustices or wrongs that the left addressedand the right did not You treat the lefts record on everything from race toworker safety for example as a publicrelations triumph But it was realAnd of course I dont accept the lefts responsibility for US wars in Koreaand Vietnam either As for taxesI would gladly give half my income to livein a country without desperate poverty and homelessness with good schools andhealth care and child care for all who need it with real environmentalprotection and good public services and in which people who work for a livingearn enough to live decently as in this country too many fulltime workers donot If that meant I had less disposable income it would be worth it            Equally unrepentantKatha
