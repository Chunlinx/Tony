nonetheless My husbandsbusiness requires us to entertain at home quite a bit His company which paysthe bills uses a particular caterer with whom I do not get along The woman incharge seems to resent my suggestions though I am always polite and it hascome back to me that she is badmouthing me whenever she can With Christmasand New Years coming up we will be seeing more of her than ever I do notneed this aggravation Prudie and fear she is harming my reputation Anysolutions                                       Hostess With the Cateress From Hell                        Dear Host            Oh how sharper than a servants tooth Alaspeople helping in the house are always in a position to carry tales outsideBut to be pragmatic here are your options  Discontinue making anysuggestions And to close down the catering lady make it a point to tell herthat you have decided to defer to her professional experience  Ask theappropriate person in your husbands company if you might have the leeway ofchoosing your own caterer If the answer is No see Solution             Good luck and justremember this Using caterers may have a few attendant problems but it beatscooking            Prudie

   DearPrudie                                                      I just noticed thatyou used the word empathetic Please see the attached letter previously sentto                      Slate                   but not published as to whyempathetic should not be used Despite my letter I see that                     Slate                   has let that word slip throughagain

unpublished letter for the edification of thosePrudie people and                   Slate                editors who might beinterested                                                                  Slate                   contributes to the continuing degradation ofthe language It seems that only psychologists know that the word isempathically not empathetically as used in David Edelsteins review ofUnmade Beds  While you will find empathetic in some dictionariesthat is only because so many people have misused it thinking if it issympathysympathetic it must be empathyempathetic Not so               Haveyou noticed that almost no one uses reticent correctly anymore And now years after I predicted it I notice that some dictionaries offer reluctantas a meaning for reticent And of course disinterested has come to meanuninterested Where will it all end                        Oh probably with Havea nice day            Prudie                                             DearPrudence                                                      This is a heartachefor me though it is actually my daughters problem She is married to awomanizing louse who takes no particular pains to cover his tracks They havebeen married for  years and the trouble was apparent soon after theymarried My daughter is torn about whether to cut the creep loose or to hopeagainst hope that he will change There are children You are experienced andI am assuming you have a thoughtout opinion on this type of situation Thankyou                                       Heartsick                        Dear Heart            Prudie agrees with the late and witty Mo Udall whosaid in another context That condition can be cured only with embalmingfluid Prudie also thinks guys like this are lucky if theyre notBobbittized            It is likely that you and your daughter havediscussed this but the next time it comes up you might point out that tomcathabits are not likely to change and further that children are not benefitedby having tense and angry parents Additionally through some kind of familyosmosis children pick up that a parent is a philanderer and this in turngives an unspoken OK to such behavior The decision must be hers            As a mother herselfPrudie hopes you can disengage on a gut level from your daughters difficultsituation and that you can achieve some peace of mind knowing that adults getto make their own decisions about their lives Be a shoulder for your daughterand lets hope she decides the best course for herself and the children            Prudie maternally
