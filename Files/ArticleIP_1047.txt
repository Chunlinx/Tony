                                 NATO Expansion            ByKarenna Gore            NATO is on the verge ofoffering membership to three former members of the Soviet bloc PolandHungary and the Czech Republic half of what used to be Czechoslovakia Theoffer will probably come at a summit in Madrid in July But it iscontroversial So is the whole purpose of NATO now that the Cold War isover            TheNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded in  Itspurpose  in the words of its first secretarygeneral Lord Ismay wasto keep the Americans in the Russians out and the Germans down In otherwords Western European nations devastated by World War II wanted the UnitedStates to help defend them against Soviet aggression and wanted Germanmilitarism to be merged into joint security arrangements            The key to NATO is Article  of theNorth Atlantic Treaty The Parties agree that an armed attack against one ormore of them in Europe or North America will be considered an attack againstthem all In exchange for the security blanket of US nuclear andconventional forces member nations have recognized US leadership inboth policy and operations The treaty specifies that the commander in chiefof NATO forces must be an American            TheClinton administration favors expanding NATO but has been criticizedfor insufficient enthusiasm During the last presidential campaign exSenBob Dole said Clinton was dragging his feet Henry Kissinger hassaid that ambivalence has produced an inconsistency between theadministrations statements of its objectives and the leisurely way it pursuesthem Others in the United States pushing for NATO expansion include a vocalEastern and Central European diaspora symbolized now by Czechborn Secretaryof State Madeleine Albright columnist William Safire and Sens RichardLugar Barbara Mikulski and Joe Lieberman            The main arguments for expansion  fromthe US point of view are  This is an opportunity to consolidate the ColdWar victory by locking in the allegiance of newly democratic nations andensuring their stability  This is an insurance policy against a potentiallyresurgent Russia and  This guarantees a continuing leadership role for theUnited States in Europe even as Europe creates and strengthens its owninstitutions of unity Since  NATO has remade itself as a peacekeeping andcrisismanagement organizationin Bosnia for exampleand supporters ofexpansion believe this is a valuable role that expanded membership wouldenhance            Butothers say the Clinton administration is barreling toward expansion inreckless disregard of the attendant risks and drawbacks  The oppositionis diverse and mounting It includes an extreme rightwing Republican likePatrick Buchanan  a moderate Democrat like former Sen Sam Nunn and theeditorial page of the                   New York Times                Planning the future ofEurope with blueprints from the cold war is a mistake says theTimes                            Antiexpansion arguments break down intotwo main categories One emphasizes that NATO is not a feelgoodorganizationit is a military commitment Is the United States really preparedto go to war to defend the Czech Republic With Russia in shambles andcommunism no longer a threat what threat to US interests justifies such acommitment At present levels of military spending can the United Statescredibly make such a promise And what would it cost to make the promisecredible Rash treaty commitments to the feudprone nations of central Europeled to World War Icould it happen again Putting a tripwire for war onPolands border is how Buchanan put it in a Feb  column Why cant Europenow prosperous defend itself            Theother category of arguments against NATO expansion concerns the impact onRussia  the object of bitter opposition George F Kennan  father ofthe Cold War policy of containment of which NATO was an expression declaredin the Times Feb  that expanding NATO would be the most fateful errorof American policy in the entire postcoldwar era It would inflame thenationalistic antiWestern and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinionharm the development of Russian democracy restore the atmosphere of thecold war and impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to ourliking            Alesser third category of arguments againstNATO expansion concerns its effect on Eastern European countries that are notadmitted to the club Critics say expansion could be another Yalta the meeting at which Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin agreed on spheres ofinfluence in postwar Europeimposing a line between East and West andleaving nonmembers subject to Russian bullying            Eastern and CentralEuropean nations which historically have been invasion highways see NATOmembership as the answer to their greatest fears internal instability andRussian resurgence They also see it as easing their way toward economicintegration with Western Europe What they have been offered so far is a sortof junior membership called Partnership for Peace  PFP provides formilitary cooperation but no defense guarantee It has been mocked as ameaningless gesture to stave off eager applicants and assuage the Russians Butothers praise it as a minorleague farm team for potential NATO members andcelebrate its civilizing influence some PFP members have settled longstandingborder disputes            To allay Russian concernsNATO has offered not to deploy nuclear forces in Eastern Europe Its centraloffer is a charter with Russia that assures the Russians a voice in alliancepolicy without any of the rights of membership But Russian Prime MinisterVictor Chernomyrdin warned Feb  that unless NATO backs off ultranationalistswill threaten the government and tanks will be rolling out in Moscow
