                    Background                Agrobacterium vitis strains are        causative agents of crown gall an economically important        disease              A vitis F is an effective        biological control agent against many         A vitis tumorigenic strains            Strain F produces an antibiotic toxic to many         A vitis strains         in vitro However two lines of        evidence suggest that this antibiotic plays a minor role in        disease suppression Strains that are susceptible to the        antibiotic         in vitro such as         A vitis strain CG are able to        infect the plant in the presence of F     and Tn        mutants of F lacking F antibiotic production appear        to be unaffected in crown gall biological control            Biological control by F is grapespecific as F is        not effective on nongrapevine host plants such as         Nicotiana glauca Furthermore F        is not effective against all         A vitis strains     Thus        enhancing the F biological control phenotype and        extending the host range of the efficacy of F beyond        grape would be beneficial for disease control in field        applications                Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K        is the most studied crown gall biological control strain        and is commercially utilized for crown gall disease control        worldwide Strain K biological control is primarily due        to production of two plasmidencoded antibiotics agrocins         and  encoded by genes on pAgK and pAgK        respectively     Agrocin  an adenosine analog            is effective against tumorigenic strains carrying        nopalineagrocinopine tumorinducing plasmids and requires        the         acc system in the target strain for        activity     Agrocin  a disubstituted cytidine        analog is effective against and specific for a broad        range of         A rhizogenes strains     Curing        of either agrocinencoding plasmid results in reduction of        biological control activity     Thus K demonstrates        the efficacy of antibiosis for crown gall biological        control However the commercial application of the K        biological control system is limited where         Agrobacterium strains of certain        crops are not inhibited by K As a result alternative        biological control systems for crown gall disease are        needed        Trifolitoxin TFX is a peptide antibiotic produced by         Rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii        T Antibiotic production and resistance functions are        encoded by the sevengene         tfx operon and the unlinked         tfuA gene      TFX is derived        from posttranslational cleavage and modification of the         tfxA gene product TFX effectively        inhibits growth of members of the proteobacteria        including strains of         Brucella Ochrobactrum Rhodobacter        Rhodospeudomonas Rhizobium and the etiological agent        of crown gall disease         Agrobacterium     TFX is highly        specific for this group as demonstrated by a lack of        observable effect on the majority of the bacterial        population in the bean rhizosphere     This suggests        that TFX could be used to control crown gall diseases of        various plants with limited effects on nontarget bacteria        outside of that very specific group of TFXsensitive        proteobacteria TFX is rapidly degraded in nonsterile        soil but is readily extractable from sterile soil        inoculated with a TFXproducing strain suggesting that TFX        is sensitive to         in situ proteolysis     Despite        this rapid turnover TFX production confers enhanced        nodulation efficiency upon TFXproducing         Rhizobium strains under field        conditions            Degradation of antimicrobial peptides such as cecropin B        and attacin E also has been observed in plant apoplastic        fluids       This is likely due to apoplastic        proteinases      Expression of antimicrobial peptides        in plants has had mixed results for enhancing disease        resistance For example cecropin expression in transgenic        tobacco did not confer resistance to         P syringae pv         tabaci     likely due to low        apoplastic peptide concentrations due to proteolysis            Therefore prior to this work it was not clear whether a        peptide antibiotic could play a role in the inhibition of        galling by tumorigenic         Agrobacterium in planta                 Agrobacterium rhizogenes is capable        of producing TFX by addition of the stable plasmid        pTTFXK which contains the         tfx operon but not         tfuA       This suggests        that TFX production by crown gall biological control        strains of         Agrobacterium such as         A rhizogenes K and         A vitis F may be enhanced by TFX        production These strains would be excellent delivery        vehicles for TFX to the infection court        Here we present experiments demonstrating the        TFXsensitivity of a range of         A vitis strains and the effect of        the TFX production and resistance phenotypes on the        expression of biological control of crown gall using the        model plant         Nicotiana glauca Strain F was        chosen as the recipient of the TFX genes in this work        because it is an avirulent strain that expresses a        biological control phenotype on only one host As a result        F is an ideal strain in which to test the ability of the        TFX system to confer biological control of crown gall        disease and to broaden the hostrange efficacy of a known        biological control strain                    Results                  In vitroTFX antibiosis against A vitis                    Agrobacterium vitis strains Table           were tested for sensitivity to trifolitoxin As          expected based on previous results     the tested           Agrobacterium vitis strains were          sensitive to TFXproducing strains However the level of          susceptibility was lower than predicted based upon          previous TFX sensitivity measurements with CG and CG              No zones of           A vitis growth inhibition were          observed around           R leguminosarum T colonies and          only relatively small zones were observed around           R etli CEpTTFXK which          produces more TFX than T Furthermore one           A vitis strain F was          TFXresistant          Because           A vitis F produces an          antibiotic to which most of the tumorigenic strains are          sensitive     the effect of TFX on           A vitis was assessed against          TFXproducing and nonproducing           Rhizobium strains None of the          tested strains were sensitive to           R leguminosarum T which          produces relatively low amounts of TFX All of the           A vitis strains except for F          were sensitive to           R etli CEpTTFXK as evidenced          by zones of growth inhibition around the CEpTTFXK          colonies           A vitis growth was not inhibited          by a nonTFX metabolite or nutrient competition by          CEpTTFXK as evidenced by the lack of a zone around          the nearisogenic           tfxA mutant CEpTTXK colony          Fig  Wild type F produces a zone of inhibition          versus the other agrobacteria used in this work This          occurred because of the antibiotic production previously          observed by F These zones of inhibition were much          larger when pTTFXK was added to F and unchanged with          the addition of pTTXK                          Evidence for TFX production by A vitisstrain          FpTTFXK          Strain FpTTFXK inhibited TFXsensitive           R leguminosarum bv trifolii          ANU but had no effect on ANU following addition of          the TFX resistance genes provided by pTTXK Fig           Plasmids pTTFXK and pTTXK confer resistance to TFX          tetracycline and kanamycin with pTTFXK also providing          TFX production to a host strain     Since strains          F and FpTTXK produced no zones of inhibition          against ANU or ANUpTTXK data not shown          FpTTFXK is producing TFX In addition this shows          that the agrocinlike molecule produced by F does not          inhibit ANU                          In plantabiological control of crown gall conferred          by TFX production          As expected F did not inhibit galling by          tumorigenic           A vitis strains on           N glauca However a  ratio of                    A vitis FpTTFXKpathogen          caused a statistically significant reduction in mean gall          size relative to the TFX nonproducing controls on           N glauca stems for all three          tested tumorigenic strains Figs and  High          concentrations of FpTTFXK also reduced gall          incidence for CG and CG but not for CG Table           A  ratio of FpTTFXKCG also resulted in a          significant reduction in gall size and in gall incidence          compared to controls A  ratio of FpTTFXKCG          or F pTTFXK CG did not affect either incidence          of galls or reduce gall size Similarly an excess a           ratio of any of the virulent strains to          FpTTFXK resulted in a high incidence of disease and          large gall size                            Discussion        As all strains of         A vitis tested were sensitive to TFX        both in this work and in a previous study            experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness        of a TFXproducing avirulent strain of         A vitis in the prevention of crown        gall caused a three strains of         A vitis Although         A vitis F is an effective        crowngall biological control agent against most        tumorigenic         A vitis strains when coinoculated        with a tumorigenic strain it is not an effective against        all strains of         A vitis         Where         A vitis F is effective as a        biological control agent its control is only effective        when numbers of F are equal to or greater than the        number of cells of the virulent strain     Strains that        are resistant to F biological control are known For        example strain CG is not controlled when coinoculated        with F            Two principle benefits of TFX production by F are        demonstrated here Biological control is extended to a new        host         N glauca Furthermore biological        control is extended to a strain that F fails to control        CG These effects are due to TFX production as        demonstrated by the lack of efficacy of F against CG        CG and CG and by the lack of efficacy of the        nearisogenic TFXnonproducing FpTTXK against CG        TFX confers biological control when the TFXproducing        strain is present in excess of the tumorigenic strain        Thus FpTTFXK effectively inhibited gall incidence by        two of the three tested tumorigenic strains when        coinoculated in approximately fold excess        FpTTFXK inhibited gall size by more than  with        third tumorigenic strain tested At  or  inoculum        ratios of FpTTFXKpathogen biological control was        reduced or lost High ratios of biological control        pathogen strain should be easily achieved in field        situations by dipping the roots of planting stock in        suspensions of the biological control strain or by        directly applying the bacterial suspension to the planting        bed Furthermore TFX is inhibitory towards all tested        species of         Agrobacterium     These results        suggest that TFX production would enhance crown gall        biological control for other biological control strains        such as         A rhizogenes K and on other host        plants especially where a mixed inoculum of different        tumorigenic         Agrobacterium species occurs        K biological control is thought to be primarily due to        production of two plasmidencoded antibiotics each of        which accounts for a portion of the observed disease        control     This naturally occurring example suggests        that pyramiding biological control mechanisms within one        strain can enhance disease control Strain F also        produces an         A vitis specific antibiotic         in vitro but this antibiotic is not        involved in disease control     Thus the addition of        TFX to F is a successful example of pyramiding unrelated        disease control mechanisms and clearly demonstrates that        individual antibiotics can be effectively developed as a        mechanism of disease control        Although plasmidborne traits are frequently unstable        pTTFXK contains the RK plasmidpartitioning locus that        confers a high degree of stability both         in vitro and under field conditions            Stable TFX expression would be beneficial under        field conditions when the biological control agent is        inoculated on seeds or on roots dipped in a bacterial        suspension prior to planting        Trifolitoxin production enhances rhizosphere        competitiveness of         Rhizobium etli CE pTTFXK in        sterile soil and enhances nodulation efficiency in        nonsterile soil when compared to a TFXsensitive strain            Trifolitoxin production also increases bean        nodulation competitiveness of         Rhizobium etli CE in the presence of        indigenous rhizobia under agricultural conditions            Field application of         R etli CE pTTFXK dramatically        reduced the diversity of indigenous proteobacteria in the        bean rhizosphere without affecting unrelated species            Thus TFX production by         A vitis F should enhance the        competitiveness and aid in establishment of this beneficial        strain in the rhizosphere The ability to displace        indigenous tumorigenic         Agrobacterium strains would be        beneficial in those areas already infested with the        pathogen        Compared to other treatments available for pathogenic        agrobacteria the effects of TFX on nontarget species is        very low Copper a broad spectrum bacteriocide is        commonly used as a treatment of bacterial diseases        Although no comprehensive studies have been published on        the taxonomic range of bacteria inhibited by K it is        known that K produces multiple antibiotics and that K        can inhibit strains of         Erwinia and         Pseudomonas that are unaffected by        TFX       TFXproducing strains inhibit only a        very specific group within the proteobacteria in culture        and in the field      These observations suggest        that a Kproducing strain may have a more serious impact        on nontarget organisms than does a TFXproducing strain        However there has been no study of the effects of K on        nontarget soil bacteria by cultureindependent means to        compare the effects of K versus the TFX system in a        natural system                    Conclusions        TFX production effectively enhances crown gall        biological control by         Agrobacterium vitis F The        hostplant range and range of tumorigenic         A vitis strains controlled by F        are both broadened by TFX production In addition virulent        strains of         A vitis not previously controlled by        F are controlled following the addition of the        trifolitoxin production and resistance genes to F The        plasmid used to confer trifolitoxin production and        resistance pTTFXK is stably maintained in the absence of        selection pressure     This plasmid is not        selftransmissible but is mobilizable With the TFX system        the biological control of         Agrobacterium pathogens may be        extended to many crops far beyond what is possible today        with currently available commercial products                    Materials and Methods                  Bacterial and plant growth conditions

Bacteria were grown on BSM agar    media          at C           A vitis FpTTFXK and          FpTTXK were constructed by triparental mating          using standard procedures Transconjugants were selected          on BSM media amended with  gml kanamycin          Trimethoprim  gml was added to counterselect the           E coli DH donor and helper          strains The helper strain was           E coli DHa pRK              Strains containing the plasmids pTTFXK and pTTXK were          grown for routine propagation on BSM amended with           gml kanamycin Prior to use in making inoculum          suspensions for biological control assays these strains          were grown overnight on BSM agar without kanamycin          Plants            Nicotiana glauca  were grown in          the greenhouse with supplemental illumination and          fertilized as needed with a nutrient solution called CNS          containing  mM CaCl            H            O  mM MgSO            H

    TFX antibiosis assays were performed as described          previously     The effect of TFX on various           Agrobacterium vitis strains Table           was assessed using           Rhizobium leguminosarum bv          trifolii strain T and           R etli strain CE pTTFXK as          producing strains           Rhizobium leguminosarum bv          trifolii TTn and           R etli CE pTTXK were used as          TFX nonproducing negative controls                          In plantabiological control of crown gall by          TFXproducing strains                    Agrobacterium vitis strains were          suspended in sterile distilled water prior to the          determination of colony forming units CFU per ml These          suspensions were adjusted to OD             approximately  CFUml          using a Shimadzu UV spectrophotometer and sterile          distilled water and stored until inoculation at C          Actual inoculum viability and cell density were measured          by dilution plating on BSM agar medium on the day that          plants were inoculated     Prior to inoculation          tumorigenic strains were diluted fold with sterile          distilled water to approximately  CFUml Strain F          and its derivatives were left undiluted or diluted          fold for CG and CG experiments or fold for          CG experiments Thus the CFU ratios were          approximately  and  or  avirulenttumorigenic          strain Immediately prior to plant inoculation          tumorigenic strains were mixed  volvol with the          appropriate biological control test strain Positive          controls were diluted  volvol with water Thus all          plant inoculum contained approximately    CFUml of          the tumorigenic strains Plants            Nicotiana glauca  were inoculated          by wounding the stem with a dissecting needle Three or          four inoculations were made per inoculum mixture on each          of two plants Thus each of the two experiments included           to  repetitions per treatment A  l drop of          bacterial suspension was placed on the wound and allowed          to air dry Inoculation sites were wrapped loosely with          Parafilm American National Can for  week          postinoculation Gall diameter perpendicular to the long          axis of the stem was measured  to  weeks          postinoculation using a caliper and all measurements          were included for statistical analysis Results were          analyzed using ANOVA at the    level of          significance
