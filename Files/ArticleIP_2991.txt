                                 Sex Without Apologies            Shes back Naomi Wolf forbetter or worse this decades representative feminist voice has written athird book arguing that women should  well after all this time its stillnot clear what were supposed to do In The Beauty Myth  Wolf arguedthat cosmetics companies plastic surgeons and the appearanceobsessed mediawere cheating women out of feminist gains In Fire With Fire  she arguedthat women were cheating themselves by blaming all their problems on men Buther suggestions for fixing these crises have never gone very deep Her pointthat women should stop letting men set the agenda and start attending to ourown desires sounds reasonable even obvious But its also vague And itdoesnt help that her prose races along like a press release from Utopia            Wolfsnew book like her pet theme of desire is extremely hard to pin down andonce in a while even embarrassing Its a highconcept package a blend ofmemoir Wolf recalls learning about sex as a child growing up in SanFranciscos racy hippie district HaightAshbury and reporting she getschildhood friends to cough up their key moments There are also some scatteredminihistories of female desire among Taoists and among the Zunis of New Mexicowhich are provocative a  th century Zuni ceremony celebrating thesuperiority of the vulva required men to don huge wooden penises but feel asif they were cribbed in a minute visit to the library And she sprinkles inhalf a dozen policy ideas Wolf seems to think that everyone would get alongbetter if we all went away on retreat            So why is this book interesting It does contain someelegantly rendered anecdotes and several small but shrewd insights Butmostly its a window on a problem in current feminism Wolfs fixation ondesire isnt so much an idea as a good intention an attempt to make feminismfeel less like a complaintto give women equal rights not just to a job but toecstasy But desire is a tricky multifaceted thing It can refer to a purelyphysical arousal or to a heartfelt experience of love It can also refer to amore idle juvenile form of daydreamingto the heated but generic longing apop star evokes for instance when he wails I want you            Wolf mixesup all these types of desire but too often her recollections fall under theheady province of idle juvenile Desire No  She lovingly recalls sleepoverparties where she and her friends inspected each others budding chests anddances where she rubbed up against a boys crotch Her own education appears tohave been gradual even Pollyannaishly prudent She and her sweet squareboyfriend dutifully visited the birthcontrol clinic three weeks before thenonearthshaking surrender of her virginity The sky isnt always sunny Wolfgets groped by a menacing stranger and a jealous boyfriend hits her Otherwisetheres little that hasnt already been covered by Judy Blume            For someone writing on desire Wolf curiously has a gooddeal of trouble describing the actual experience of letting loose In thepassage that follows she recalls the summer she was  living on a kibbutzdying to sneak off and make out with a forbidden Irish boy named Devin Its agood example of her smooth graceful proseand also of her shocking tendencyto break life down into abstract terms            If to my trip counselors Iwas a miscegenating rebel and if to Ofras uncle whose censure I stillremembered I was a godforsaken secular Jew and if to Devins mates I was thatlockerroom joke the lubricious JAP and if in the eyes of the Muslim menobserving us while they played sheshhesh in the market cafes I was arepresentative of dissolute America the country of women who are beyondwhoredom then the weight of these clashing systems of control and expectationaround female sexuality was just too much In my mind under the burden of allthose dictates competing to stereotype rather than support me the legitimacyof the notion of such control simply collapsed            To cut tothe chaseshe kissed him But this stuff about clashing systems of controldoesnt sound like the thoughts of a yearold and the reader begins to feeltricked One minute Wolf is supposed to be revealing her most intimateexperiences and the next minute shes writing in a humorless selfregardingacademese Theres a kind of intellectual greed going on here almost a senseof entitlement Wolf seems to think that because her goal is worthymethodologically speaking anything goes            Its important to be clear Im not arguing that Wolf isincoherent because her approach is feminine and therefore soft and gooey Infact if she would just pick an approach any approach it would be a reliefNor am I arguing that she exaggerates the problems girls face as they grow upAs a critic Wolf usually hits the target or at least gets near it            Shesright for example that sex education now is a bad compromise betweenpuritanical shame and a cold clinical detachment Most girls get some sort ofinstruction but dangerous concepts like pleasure and love are scrupulouslyavoided were taught to think of ourselves as scary coils of tubing that arehard to keep clean and which periodically leak Wolf the complainingpropagandist is flaky but not unsound            Its Wolf the thinker whos wobbly She erasesdistinctionsbesides apples and oranges shes mixing peaches pickles andprunes One of her more comical tics is to repeat a concept over and overuncritically until it takes on an almost physical presence like a parody of aPlatonic ideal In The Beauty Myth  Wolf grouped all our expectationsand prejudices surrounding womens chestsize under a single heading TheOfficial Breast I couldnt help imagining a lifesize dancing mascot InPromiscuities  the mantra is The Slut This is Wolfs term for thatgirl in the eighth grade who sprouted breasts early fooled around with toomany boys and got slammed with a bad reputation According to Wolf sheembodies the nascent sexuality that pubescent girls are trained to fear andloathe so we turn her into a scapegoat Its a reasonable if not originalobservation based on a friend of Wolfs who got pregnant and eventuallydropped out of school But Wolf builds it up into a timeless internationalarchetype Soon shes writing A Short History of the Slut Its shortindeed going from Mesopotamia to medieval Burgundy to Nicole Simpson in pages And in the next chapter were asked to take it as an established factthat all women everywhere since the beginning of time have lived in fear ofentering The Sluts Dominion Whats worse Wolf flipflops in her opinion ofThe Slut every few pages On the one hand shes the pitiful victim of ourhypocrisy and our unnecessary shame On the other hand were also supposed toenvy her because she violates the restraints weve imposed on ourselves            In the end what Wolf reallyseems to be saying is that sex is perfectly wholesomeits our uptightness andmoralizing that are corrupt Shes right of course And yet after a whileall this going on about how girls are not allowed to feel desire begins to feellike a kind of nostalgic fantasy As adult women those of us who areheterosexual sometimes have a sense of a lost Eden she writes at one pointAnd later  la Rousseau As my understanding of the kinds of scripts aboutsexuality available to women bore down on me the forest would function the waythat fantasies of wilderness functioned for the urbanized eighteenthcenturyEuropean mind I would find myself making a mental reference to the forest whenI searched for a symbol for female lust This isnt much more than piningalonging for longing I suppose its only fair that girls win equal rights togood old solipsistic Desire No  But the victory feels pretty hollow
