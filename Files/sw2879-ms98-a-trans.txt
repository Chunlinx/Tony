        okay theres theres one  um im at living in Texas where you at     im in Rome New York   in where Rome New York Rome New York okay well Texas let me look at my husband and ask him  does Texas have state capital punishment   Rome New York yeah   yes they do hes reminding me of where i live yeah   yeah i i new New York does not but uh   uhhuh   theyre theyre trying to reinstate it and the governors opposed to it being that uh Democrat that he is uh Mario Cuomo   uhhuh yes   but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it   yeah i um i ethically dont like the idea but or i should say morally i dont like the idea but um social ethics ethics and ethics socially and ethically i think its a good idea   id i would agree with that they almost even more   in certain crimes   i dont know if this is cold and too pragmatically but im really offended by the thought that i have to support uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatever  you know   uhhuh uhhuh right and any demand on the street no i know   right that that uh after theyve gone and done horrible things molested children and kill them and whatever that society has to pay uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them   uhhuh yeah and Texas is having a problem right now and its the the the the the repeatable crime i think thats the the  repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where theyre theyre patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from calling from uh killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know molestations molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and theyre get these people are getting out like three to five years before theyre even suppose to be considered   right   and and now they cant find them and theyre finding bodies in ditches you know i mean you think think why they say its because youre over crowded its over crowded then you think how can every is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten   i i dont know its a hard question you look at the United States we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh or uh   right i know and then and i dont know how Americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in Austin Texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it which basically means without an FBI check any person in this state over twenty one can get a gun     here in New York its a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state   is it thats good say that good i think thats like the state of Virginia yeah thats great   now the the and thats with uh you have to have uh oh a police investigation you have to have references and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference um   uhhuh uhhuh   and i know it there is its very easy to get uh uh you know theres no no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that which arent   uhhuh   the the i i dont consider to be the kind of a a crime uh  weapon you know uh so   right theyre not the cattiness behind right yeah i mean i dont like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if hed been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case   right   and how they just executed well it hasnt been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety   right   and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you did you know this had nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean there should be more cases like that where they flip a switch i have and i might be too cold too but they flip a switch i dont know i mean   yeah i well and and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped and then   so many times   yeah and uh did it again and uh   yeah yeah i mean and thats just maybe because of the little more that they said celebrated that uh hes not the only one you know you you see somebodys mini series and you hear about somebodys crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment   no   but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy exathletes daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive   uhhuh oh God   and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man and and the at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and youre thinking oh thats nice   great   i mean you know im not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a punishment uh definite punishment you know lasting punishment   that sure theres an end to the the situation   right in that particular instance um but i but i dont but i know its not a end all and be all thats the problem i have with it in Texas they think its an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something else gas somebody   right   um that theyre not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime ridden and we just moved here uh weve been here before lived in Minneapolis Saint Paul   uhhuh   uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when youre gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is even suburban no matter where you are and how youre in Rome New York is that and and is that like near Albany or Syracuse   right Rome New York its up state it its uh near Syracuse its about uh well i i actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach i work in Rome um   what what type of area is that is that uh in term   its more rural uh it use to be use to be a uh   uhhuh   uh have a lot of heavy industry but its kind of uh all the industry has gone south and uh now the Air Force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh   uhhuh sure   uh so its   how would how is the situation in there in terms of crime and things that would not too bad   not too bad it you know you the still have the um more drug problems and typical uh small city type problems but i dont know that theres a real   yeah uhhuh   uh no there isnt the harsh  crime and all   not the harsh criminality that you find in yeah now Dallas is a im being very sarcastic its just a great place um on some days uh       its um i dont know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and deed for deed that that does something uh but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over crowded i mean thats thats just not a cop out   uhhuh right   um and i just you know im originally from Pennsylvania which i think is basically like New York these days im not sure if they i dont think they have capital punishment there   think think Pennsylvania Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because im from uh from Pennsylvania also   uhhuh   just uh just outside of Philadelphia   im not trying yeah and im from Pittsburgh so oh well well forgive each other   yeah     um because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i cant i havent lived there in twenty years but um   right the west part of the state is and then the east part of the state is got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so   there you go       i dont know thats a different topic subject altogether but uh   right   i dont know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime i think everyone would you and i think are probably honest and candid because we could do it on in this vehicle um but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say   right   if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out which i think every human does i think theyd say yeah do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know um   sure yeah if your friends or family get uh had that happen to them i think everyone would uh i theyd probably   uhhuh   pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it   yeah i just dont think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just dont uh       oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh just it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and um rape rapist getting their hand just slapped   yeah   you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh intangible intangible intangible things and youre thinking   right   you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldnt want to be a criminal either   right   because you wouldnt know what youre getting um   right   but i dont know methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either i just   well uh i uh yeah i dont know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess its a pretty pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted   uhhuh is it uh how about the injection is that suppose to be   oh yeah an injection yeah that would be even yeah i didnt even think about that   yeah im not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio its more than arent uh that its more that dont have it isnt that correct   i think yeah theres more that dont have it but amazingly its like uh Massachusetts went back and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago   uhhuh   i dont know if theyve used it since then since theyve reinstated it but uh its on the books which   uhhuh yeah and always say do something about im not sure if Texas Minnesota i they didnt they didnt they were against well did they have it they were against it um Texas as i said has it but i havent been back here long enough to to realize whether or not if theyve done it in the last   right
