                                 eBabe            Thisweek softporn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashionmodels on the Internet His site ronsangelscom named after the s babe showCharlies Angels  invites visitors to bid on eggs from beautifulhealthy and intelligent women Like Dr Richard Seed who recently declaredhis intention to clone human beings Harris has attracted the attention of themedia and politicians who are looking into whether he can be stopped Mostpeople agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage What theydont agree on is why Heres what the critics have to say about theauctionand each other                            Egg auctions will produce designer babies Harris cites hisexperience as a horse breeder and asks We bid for everything else in thissocietywhy not eggs Alarmists agreeing that Harris can put you into yourown designer baby by selling eggs predict that his success will steer thefuture of human breeding toward genetic engineering                            Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies Whilefretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds fertility expertssimultaneously debunk that scenario Not only is it ethically ludicrous butthe fact is no kids going to look like the models picture observesethicist George Annas The experts give four reasons First the child of anugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be prettySecond everyone carries recessive genes which are invisible in thisgeneration but may become visible in the next A model with a small nose canpass on genes for a big nose Third even if both parents are attractive achild can combine their features unattractively For example a girl caninherit her mothers weak nose and her fathers strong brow                            Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittestDoomsayers predict that once beautiful eggs are available strictly to peoplewho are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them the rich will transformthemselves into a superrace reminiscent of the Nazis To this Harrisreplies It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society ofonly beautiful people This site simply mirrors our current society in thatbeauty usually goes to the highest bidder But this reply only fuels concernthat gradually society will separate into genetic haves and have nots                            Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittestHarris writes that only men with substantial financial resources are fit togive his models offspring a financially secure and stable life But skepticswonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidderand men who buythese eggs for the sole purpose of spawning goodlooking childrenmay producechildren just as dysfunctional as themselves As Calgary Sun columnistSydney Sharpe put it Any woman  who enters into this mephistophelian pacthas a few screws loose Maybe her kid will too Not to mention the buyers whosign her up                            Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of theunfittest Many models if not most have had cosmetic surgery Amodel who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggsOne of Harris angels has already been caught lying about her age How doesHarris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobsTheres no way to know that You can ask the girl and hope she tells you thetruth he says Annas concludes that since theres no way to know how much oftheir beauty is a product of their genes plastic surgery a makeup artist orexercise only a naive person would buy their eggs on the basis of thephotographs displayed on the site You dont want to see the models hepoints out You want to see pictures of their parents On this theorychildren produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars onone side and fools on the other                            Beauty doesnt convey health Harris casually asserts thatbeauty shows healthiness and longevity On his site he writes  NaturalSelection is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful Skeptics questionthis assumed equivalence noting that traits men find attractive in women thesedaysthinness for exampleare often unhealthy When asked on theToday show how much medical screening he has given his egg donorsHarris answered None                            Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence Harris sayshes not the first person to market good genes Others he notes have soldsperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donors intelligence Harrisdetractors reply that beauty is superficial and conveys a harmfulpreoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content ofcharacter This critique is usually offered by a blowdried TV interviewerwho after thanking Harris for his time urges viewers to stay tuned for themovie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break                            Beauty is less useful than intelligence Harris advertisesbeauty not as an end but as a means to success since people who arephysically desirable get more attention power and favorable treatment Havingchided Harris for exalting social advantage over character critics turnaround and adopt his ruthless logic While conceding that beauty is usefulthey argue that intelligence is a better weapon in todays meritocraticinformation economyand that although Harris claims his models are beautifulhealthy and intelligent he offers no evidence of brains such as IQ or SATscores Londons Independent envisions Bimbo births A fertilityexpert shrugs If people want to spend  for the eggs of a gorgeouswoman who has an IQ of  let them                            The auction exploits desperate buyers Harris preaches purecapitalism saying its unfair to put a limit on a girls ability to makemoney by auctioning her eggs In turn fertility clinic operators accuseHarris of taking advantage of couples trying to conceive and exploitingdesperate people  susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell USAToday laments This is about human need And human greed                            The auction exploits desperate sellers By late MondayHarris had only a handful of bids and only one was verified as legitimate Onthe other hand  women had asked him to put their eggs up for auctionGradually the media concluded that the donors were the true victims USAToday described the models as struggling actresses reported that theywere unaware of the health risks of donating eggs and quoted one as sayingId rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse  Harris soleverified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was better thanprostitution            Harrisconstantly refers to the donors as his girls and describes them likecattleWe have a legitimate bid of  on one of the girls He gets a percent commission on each winning bid though he takes no responsibility forexecuting financial transactions or medical procedures We have no controlover the quality safety or legality of the items advertised the truth oraccuracy of the listings the ability of sellers to sell items or the abilityof buyers to buy items he stipulates His role he explains is simply tofind beautiful girls take beautiful photographs of them and put them up onthe Web To some critics the mystery isnt as Harris suggests how womenthroughout history have exploited their sexual power over men but how pimpslike him have come away with the profit                            The auction exploits voyeurs The Washington Postthinks Harris isnt targeting either buyers or sellers Hes not serious aboutselling eggs says the Post  Hes just using the sex appeal of hismodels and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum uppublicity and attract Internet traffic to his site from which he can selladvertising and subscriptions  a month to view profiles of the modelshawk his forthcoming book  Naked Power  and direct prurient visitors tohis various porn sites A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects thatronsangelscom is really aimed at adolescent boys                            The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases Technologywatchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked byJennycam a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doingother normal activities in her apartment the promised Webcast of a man andwoman losing their virginity together which turned out to be a hoax and ahuman kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month Eversince the Internet it seems to snowball more rapidly this depersonalizationof people and selling of eggs one fertility expert complains to the NewYork Times  USA Today says the egg auction just might force anInternetobsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself Where is theInternet taking us                            The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchasesThe only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet according to thecritics is not getting the eggs you paid for When you have largetransactions of this kind conducted over the Internet there may be fraud acomputer crime expert warns USA Today  Lori Andrews a reproductivetechnology lawyer warns CNN viewers that theres very little that you can doto prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected andthe Internet just adds  a layer that it makes it even more difficult toscrutinize where the eggs are coming from                            Egg buyers will reap unintended consequencesSophisticated skeptics point out that Harris application of Darwins theoriesto human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and humanpsychology To begin with if a child produced by Harris auction fails to turnout as pretty as the buyer expected the buyer may shun the child or the childmay grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents On the Todayshow Harris said of this theory Thats a pretty cynical view of humannature Second if the child turns out pretty but doesnt want to be a beautyqueen her parents may force her in that direction anyway thereby stifling hertrue talents and preventing her from becoming successful Third the childsgood looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind eventuallydestroying her Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples                            Other peoples eggs dont pass on your genes In defenseof his auction Harris quotes author Helen Fishers statement that having sexis the most important act of your life This is how we get our genes to thenext generation But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial wordsour genes The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is muchstronger than the drive to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site Fisherobserves This consideration may not affect single men but it can be adecisive turnoff for couples On this view Harris mistake is not that hefocuses too much on selfishness but that he neglects it He forgets that youdont care about reproducing unless what youre reproducing is yourself                            The power of beauty should be transcended not exploitedHarris preaches that the world rewards beauty because its human nature tofavor those who are pleasant to look at and therefore the way to havesuccessful children is to make sure theyre attractive The most ambitiousresponse is to attack the whole prejudice in favor of beauty The standardsof beauty do vary with the culture And they are social facts not reallygenetics facts says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings Therefore weshould think about whether to accept the existing prejudices and then try toeugenically manipulate them or to transcend those prejudices            Thiscritique challenges two precepts of Harris worldview First while pretendingto accept human nature as a given he violates it by peddling strangers eggsand encouraging the production of children who will probably never know theirmothers Family association loyalty and love are among the best parts ofhuman nature Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among theworst If were going to challenge human nature the critics ask why not startwith the latter rather than the former            Second Harris assumesthat the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinianperfection Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state hewrites What he doesnt seem to understand is that human beings arent quitelike other animals just as the rest of the world isnt exactly like themodeling and softporn industries of Southern California Humans have evolvedto a stage at which our ideas about virtue perfection and success have becomemore than material At least most of us have
