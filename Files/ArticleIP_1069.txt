                                 Major League Baseball            Sportswriters perenniallycomplain that Major League Baseballs greedy owners are corrupting the gameThe owners gripe that players are destroying it from within by demanding toomuch money Recent developments have escalated the doomsaying MLBs topexecutive proposed two weeks ago that the centuryold distinction between theNational League and American League be erased and that the teams in theleagues realign Last week the Atlanta Braves superstar pitcher Greg Madduxaccepted a fiveyear contract worth  million the biggest ever Is MLB indecline or as some claim in the midst of a golden era How are the economicsof baseball changing Are fans tuning out the televised game How is the gameitself changing And is the current crop of players as good as those who playedin the halcyon days of the s s and s            Baseballhasnt reigned as the national pastime  for decades It was displacedlong ago by a combination of other leisure activities including TV computergames and the more telegenic games of basketball and football Althoughattendance was damaged by the strikeshortened seasons of  and attendance is now approaching prestrike levels  Overall attendance isstrong MLB attracted  million fans in  with  teams compared to million fans in the golden year of  when there were only  teams            The perception of declining fan interest causes owners totinker with baseball traditions from time to time mostly in the hopesof attracting more fans In  each league was cleaved into two divisionscreating four ticketselling pennant races instead of just two Divisionwinners were pitted against one another in postseason play with the victorsadvancing to the World Series In  the American League added thedesignated hitter  a player who bats in place of the pitcher but doesnot play in the field The DH increased scoring which pleases fans In each league was further divided into three divisions creating six pennantraces and postseason play was expanded to involve eight clubs as two wildcard teams joined the pennant winners in the playoffs This year MLBinstituted interleague play  scheduling National League and AmericanLeague teams against one another in regularseason contests for the first timeOf course pandering to fans is in the baseball tradition Examples nightgames fireworks displays giveaways ladies nights mascots etc            Soaringattendance for interleague games prompted MLBs top executive Bud Selig topropose the realignment of the two leagues Under his plan baseballssix divisions would be reduced to four divisions in two different leagues Theteams would be grouped geographically with  teams switching leaguesProponents of realignment argue that it exploits natural regional rivalries anddecreases travel time for players Opponents complain that it upends traditionOwners will likely vote on the plan in September One negative ballot will beenough to veto it            MLB hasnt promoted itself as successfully aspro football and pro basketball it collects about half as much from the saleof hats shirts and other paraphernalia as does either the NBA or NFL butbaseball has aggressively expanded into new markets In  MLB had teams With the addition of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay DevilRays next year the count will reach  The game has also gone global withteams aggressively recruiting stars from reliable talent pools south of theborder  Sandy and Roberto Alomar  and more recently in Asia  HideoNomo             Baseballhas always been about money but even more so since the  repeal of thereserve clause  The reserve clause bound players to teams or theteams they were traded to for life Today players can shop their talents tothe highest bidder one year after their contract expires Salaries haveescalated since the repeal of the reserve clause In  the averageplayer made  In  he earned  This year the average playersalary is  million            MLB owners blame their red ink an estimated totalof  million last year on big payrolls  MLBs wealthiest team theworldchampion New York Yankees spent  million on payroll in  TheMontreal Expos spent the least  million But highpriced free agentsalaries dont necessarily correlate to competitiveness Drawing on theirexcellent minorleague affiliates for cheap new talent the Expos finishedsecond in the National League East last year            Even sobigmarket teams like the Orioles Braves and Yankees stay in contention bypurchasing free agents so two years ago MLB assuaged complaints about therichpoor gap with a moderate revenuesharing scheme Wealthy teams likethe Yankees pay a tax on every payroll dollar above  million The tax isdistributed to teams who spend less usually teams in smaller markets likeMilwaukee and Pittsburgh Last year the Yankees paid around  million inrevenue sharing            The NFL and NBA decreased the disparitiesbetween large and smallmarket teams with salary caps that limit playersalaries MLB has no salary cap and attempts to impose one sparked the strike by the players union resulting in the first cancellationof a World Series in  years In  the owners retreated from thesalarycap issue eventually signing a contract that expires in             Like itsfootball cousin baseball depends heavily on television money  But MLBcomplains that its not getting enough The NFLs current fouryear contractfor national TV broadcasts pays it about  billion while MLBs contractover a similar period earns about  billion But the comparison isnt relevantbecause MLB teams also sell nonnational games to local broadcasters and cablechannels pocketing millions more The Yankees have a year millioncable deal Once again its the teams playing in small markets that sufferbecause they cant command an audience big enough to attract big TVcontracts            Because baseball is an entertainment industry mediaconglomerates have purchased teams potentially complicating future TVrightsnegotiations TimeWarner obtained the Atlanta Braves this year when it boughtTurner Broadcasting Inc Walt Disney Co holds an interest in the AnaheimAngels and the Tribune Corp owns the Chicago Cubs And Rupert Murdoch of Fox TV  recently bid an estimated  million for the LosAngeles Dodgers and their stadium Because it is in the interest of themedia moguls to pay as little as possible for broadcast rights some criticsworry that smallmarket teams will get the shaft when the mediamogul ownersuse their insidetheclubhouse influence to drive down the size of nationalTVcontracts            Althoughowners complain about annual losses there is no shortage of bidders willing topay record sums for existing teams or new franchises One reason for the highvalue of MLB teams is the prospect of new publicly financed ballparks Owners in Baltimore Cleveland Chicago Denver and Texas have all reapedmajor profits from these new facilities built at little or no cost to theteams New parks are scheduled for Detroit Seattle and Phoenix The mostlucrative amenity at the new parks are the sky boxes luxury suites rented tocorporations at exorbitant prices Also filling team coffers are fancy foodcourts and merchandise concession areas Team owners have also boosted ticketprices at the new parks charging about  percent more than they did at theold parks            While its true that expansion temporarilydiluted the talent pool the DH artificially increased offense and playershave gained the economic upper hand there is a widespread consensus that thequality of the game itself is as good as or better than ever Improvements in hitting have been matched by craftier pitching by such hurlersas Atlantas Greg Maddux and Baltimores Mike Mussina The rise in the numberof home runs a record of  last year has been paralleled by increasedstrikeouts in every year of this decade The exorbitant salaries have inspiredmodern players to train yearround building strength and stamina with theirnew regimens            Baseball is certainly morecompetitive today than it was in the dynasty decades of the New YorkYankees Many smallmarket teams Oakland Minnesota Pittsburgh MontrealSeattle and expansion teams have cobbled together contenders in the s to dobattle with the dynastic clubs from the big markets Only the Atlanta Braveshave had consistent success in this decade making them the first team sincethe New York Yankees of  to appear in four out of five consecutiveWorld Series Other teams have gone from world champions to cellardwellerswithin five years
