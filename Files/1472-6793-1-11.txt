                    Background        Low intestinal calcium absorption efficiency in humans        is common and contributes to negative calcium balance and        bone loss     Recent epidemiological evidence suggests        that low fractional calcium absorption is a significant        risk factor for future osteoporotic hip fracture            The primary homeostatic mechanism for altering calcium        absorption in response to low dietary calcium intake and        increased calcium requirements during growth is an increase        in plasma dihydroxyvitamin D the active hormonal form        of vitamin D produced in the kidney            dihydroxyvitamin D is a secosteroid that acts on gene        transcription through a nuclear steroid receptor protein        and also may have nongenomic actions mediated by a putative        plasma membrane vitamin D receptor     Changes in        vitamin D status primarily alter the rate of Ca absorption        in the proximal small intestine During transcellular        calcium transport across the absorptive enterocyte calcium        must pass across an apical brush border membrane then        transverse the interior of the cell and exit against an        electrochemical gradient across the basolateral membrane        Changes in the rate of vectorial Ca transport in the        intestine however must be accomplished without a major        disruption in the free intracellular Ca concentration        which is used as an important intracellular signal in the        enterocyte    as in other cells        It has been known for over  years that vitamin D        status influences the level of calbindin D a cytosolic        calciumbinding protein    believed to be the        ratelimiting step in calcium absorption    by acting as        an intracellular calcium ferry or chaperone Calcium        extrusion at the basolateral membrane is an active process        involving a CaATPase that may also be affected by vitamin        D status     However although it has been known for        more than  years that the rate of Ca transport across the        intestinal brush border membrane can be increased by        dihydroxyvitamin D     the identity of the calcium        transport protein involved in Ca influx has not been        ascertained Recently two novel closely related        epithelial calcium channels CaT also known as ECaC and        ECaC also known as CaT have been cloned from rat           and rabbit    respectively and shown to mediate        calcium influx when expressed in         Xenopus oocytes CaT and ECaC are        found in several tissues including dihydroxyvitamin        Dresponsive epithelia in the intestine and kidney These        epithelial calcium channel genes are products of        evolutionary local gene duplication found on chromosome         and represent a new family of Caselective ion channels        involved in active Ca reabsorption     Furthermore        it has been suggested that the control of the number of        active channels at the cell surface is critical for        regulation of active calcium transport and that the        epithelial calcium channel could confer the ratelimiting        step in transcellular calcium transport            Peptide hormones and other cell surfaceacting signal        molecules trigger increases in the concentration of calcium        ions inside the cell by release of calcium from stores        within the cell or activation of Ca ion channels in the        plasma membrane allowing calcium to enter from outside the        cell One of the most common mechanisms that regulate entry        of calcium is by capacitative or storeoperated calcium        entry     The epithelial Carelease activated channel        I         CRAC  is a highly calciumselective        plasma membrane ion channel that is activated on lowering        of either intracellular calcium concentration or        intracellular calcium stores The CaT channel has been        recently expressed in mammalian CHO cells and patch clamp        studies have shown it to have the characteristics of I         CRAC     Nearly ubiquitous        storeoperated calcium entry is essential in a wide variety        of cellular processes including muscle contraction protein        secretion metabolism cell differentiation cell division        and apoptosis            Intestinal calcium absorption is increased after feeding        a low calcium diet or under conditions of increased calcium        needs such as during growth via a parathyroid hormone        PTHvitamin D mediated process     A lowering of        serum calcium levels stimulates the secretion of PTH that        then activates the renal conversion of inactive        hydroxyvitamin D to the active hormonal metabolite        dihydroxyvitamin D At the intestine        dihydroxyvitamin D acting through a nuclear receptor        stimulates transcription of vitamin Dmediated genes        including calbindin D involved in calcium transport        thereby acting as the primary hormonal regulator of active        intestinal calcium transport     It is thus likely that        any putative key molecular player in calcium absorption        such as CaT or ECaC should be a prime target for        hormonal regulation by dihydroxyvitamin D However to        date neither CaT nor ECaC expression has been shown to        be related to serum dihydroxyvitamin D or vitamin D        status             We have developed         a unique human        intestinal cell culture model of vitamin Dmediated        transepithelial Ca transport using Caco cells a colon        adenocarcinoma cell line This cell line spontaneously        differentiates in culture and expresses biochemical and        morphological characteristics of welldifferentiated small        intestinelike enterocytes      We have previously        shown that Caco cells possess a classical nuclear vitamin        D receptor    that directly mediates vitamin        Ddependent gene expression     and exhibits a high        degree of specificity for various vitamin D metabolites and        analogs      Most importantly in response to        shortterm  h dihydroxyvitamin D treatment        Caco cells increase transepithelial calcium transport           and calbindin D         K expression     a cytosolic        calcium binding protein Kinetic analysis of Ca transport        across Caco monolayers grown on permeable filter supports        indicated that dihydroxyvitamin D treatment increased        the V         max of Ca transport     which would        be consistent with a vitamin Ddependent increase in the        number of calcium transporters        In the current paper we have used the Caco cell        culture model to demonstrate that CaT mRNA is        preferentially expressed in the human enterocyte compared        to ECaC and for the first time demonstrate that        dihydroxyvitamin D treatment can cause a rapid and        marked increase in CaT mRNA expression in the enterocyte        These observations suggest a likely important role for this        calcium transporter in vitamin Ddependent calcium        absorption                    Results and Discussion                  CaT is expressed in Caco cells          We initially addressed the question of whether Caco          cells express ECaC or the closely related CaT gene          This is important because it has been suggested that          because of the high degree of sequence similarity           between the CaT and ECaC genes care should be taken in          interpreting data obtained by hybridization PCR or other          methodologies based on nucleotide sequences              First the PCR product derived from the putative ECaC or          CaT gene was purified and sequenced Based on new          sequence information GenBank accession number AF          ECaC and AF CaT     the nucleotides          determined following the sequencing of our PCR product          from Caco cells was an identical match for CaT rather          than ECaC data not shown Second the sequences of the          coding region of the CaT and ECaC genes GenBank          AF and AF indicate that an additional          identification step based on restriction fragment length          polymorphism RFLP analysis could also be used to          confirm the identity of the CaT mRNA in Caco cells As          described in the Method section a  bp PCR product was          generated with a second set of PCR primers that would          specifically encompass a differential           Bgl restriction enzyme cut site          present in CaT but not ECaC Prior to electrophoresis          on a  agarose gel the amplified PCR product was either          left untreated or treated with           Bgl or           BssHII restriction enzymes There          is no predicted           BssHII cut site in our amplified          region of either CaT or ECaC based on the recently          published sequence of these two genes GenBank AF          and AF Thus           BssHII should serve as negative          control for the restriction enzyme digestion step In          contrast the location of the single           BglI cut site in CaT should result          in the generation of two smaller bands   bp and            bp if the amplified PCR product was CaT Since ECaC          does not have a predicted           BglI site in the amplified PCR          product no smaller bands should result if ECaC was          being amplified in the PCR reaction As shown in Figure           we found that there were two smaller bands of the          predicted size and no larger  bp band remaining after           Bgl digestion confirming the          identity of CaT as the product being amplified in Caco          cell In addition           BssHII restriction enzyme digestion          did not result in smaller bands consistent with a likely          specific action of           Bgl digestion of CaT under the          digestion conditions used In addition further attempts          at PCR amplification of Caco cell RNA with other PCR          primers designed to specifically amplify ECaC did not          result in an amplified product under our conditions data          not shown Thus based on this collective information          we conclude that CaT but not ECaC is expressed in          Caco cells It needs to be pointed out however that          since Caco cells are not derived from normal human          intestinal tissue it is possible that ECaC could be          expressed in the human intestine However our          observation in Caco cells is consistent with the recent          report by Barley and colleagues    indicating a high          expression level of CaTECaC in human intestine based          on Northern blotting and similar findings by Peng et al             using quantitative realtime PCR for CaT who          also noted the apparent absence of ECaCCaT in human          intestinal tissue                          CaT mRNA is regulated by dihydroxyvitamin          D          Having established the identity of CaT in Caco          cells we then studied the effect of          dihydroxyvitamin D treatment on CaT mRNA          expression If CaT is an important regulator of          intestinal calcium absorption it is likely that it would          be regulated by dihydroxyvitamin D As shown in          Figure  treatment of cells for  h with  molL          dihydroxyvitamin D caused a fold increase p            ANOVA n  studies in CaT mRNA expression To          our knowledge this is the first demonstration in either          experimental animals or human tissue that intestinal CaT          expression is up regulated by dihydroxyvitamin D          This finding may provide an important molecular key to          understand the mechanism of vitamin Dmediated intestinal          calcium absorption Moreover given the potentially          central role of this epithelial calcium channel as an          important modulator of cellular calcium influx in a          variety of cell types     it will be of interest to          investigate whether the vitamin D effect on CaT          expression extends beyond the enterocyte Vitamin D          status is known to influence a wide range of          physiological systems including cells involved in the          immune system endocrine function prostate skin and          muscle Vitamin D effects on CaT expression and cellular          calcium influx could thereby theoretically modulate          intracellular calcium and cell signaling in a variety of          different tissues providing insight into understanding          the physiological effects of vitamin D throughout the          body Peng and colleagues    have reported that the          steroid hormone androgen influences CaT mRNA expression          in LNCaP prostate cells We have not yet evaluated the          effects of androgens on CaT expression in Caco cells          However we have found S Taparia unpublished studies          that all steroid hormones do not share this effect on          CaT expression because  estradiol  molL for           h had no effect on CaT mRNA expression in Caco cells          In any case the demonstrated effect of          dihydroxyvitamin D on CaT mRNA shown here in Caco          cells is consistent with the idea that the active          metabolite of vitamin D could increase the number of CaT          calcium transporters in the plasma membrane and could          therefore be responsible for the higher rates of calcium          influx seen across the brush border membrane in vitamin          Dreplete animals     thereby playing a key          gatekeeper role in increasing the efficiency of          intestinal calcium absorption and maintaining calcium          homeostasis                          dihydroxyvitamin D causes a rapid and marked          up regulation of CaT expression          In another series of studies we addressed the          temporal and doseresponse effect of          dihydroxyvitamin D on CaT mRNA expression in Caco          cells As shown in Figure  the response of CaT mRNA to          dihydroxyvitamin D is rapid n   studies          Treatment with  molL dihydroxyvitamin D          increased fold CaT mRNA by  h the earliest time          point investigated and clearly elevated CaT expression          by fold at  h with progressively higher expression          up to fold at the later time points          The relationship between the dose of          dihydroxyvitamin D treatment and CaT mRNA response          was investigated in a third set n  studies of          experiments at     and  molL          dihydroxyvitamin D for  h In these studies there          was a significant increase in CaT mRNA levels at the          lowest dose  molL of dihydroxyvitamin D          studied Figure  while a slightly higher level of CaT          mRNA expression was observed at  molL          dihydroxyvitamin D no further effect on CaT mRNA          was seen with another fold increase in          dihydroxyvitamin D concentration          The rapid time course of induction and sensitivity of          CaT mRNA response to dihydroxyvitamin D treatment          supports the idea that CaT could play a role as a          gatekeeper of intestinal calcium absorption We have          previously reported that it takes from  h following          dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of Caco cells to          first appreciate an increase in saturable transcellular          calcium transport     This temporal response is          similar to the  h observed for the achievement of          maximal rates of intestinal calcium absorption in vivo          following dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of vitamin          Ddeficient chickens     Future studies of the time          course of CaT protein expression and localization of          this protein to the brush border will be necessary to          confirm this point but must await the development of a          suitable CaT antibody                          CaT induction precedes the increase in calbindin D          kmRNA expression          It has been argued    that the cytosolic vitamin          Ddependent calcium binding protein calbindin D           K is the likely ratelimiting step in          vitamin Dinduced intestinal calcium absorption However          despite a considerable amount of associative evidence              there has long been some controversy on this issue               because of apparent discrepancies in the          temporal pattern of calbindin Dk induction compared to          calcium absorption following dihydroxyvitamin D          treatment in experimental animals Thus in the current          study to evaluate a possible gatekeeper role for CaT in          vitamin Dmediated calcium transport we compared the time          course of dihydroxyvitamin D induction of calbindin          Dk mRNA and CaT mRNA in Caco cells In Caco cells          the mRNA for both calbindin D and CaT can be detected by          PCR in the absence of vitamin D treatment The          concentration of dihydroxyvitamin D in the basal          cell culture medium is approximately  molL As          illustrated in Figure  the time course of vitamin          Ddependent mRNA induction of the two genes clearly          differs with CaT expression responding much earlier than          calbindin Dk There is no evident induction of calbindin          D mRNA by dihydroxyvitamin D in Caco cells up to           h post treatment In these experiments calbindin D mRNA          was fold greater than control by  h In contrast          CaT mRNA was clearly increased fold by  h post          dihydroxyvitamin D treatment in the same cells          These observations will need to be expanded in the future          to include measurement of the relevant proteins However          such association studies will not completely settle the          question of the relative importance of either of these          vitamin Dinduced genes in the calcium transport response          to dihydroxyvitamin D Those questions will be          likely answered more directly in the future by          individually altering the expression of these calcium          transport genes in transfected cell lines or in          transgenic animal models          Given what is already known about the characteristics          of the epithelial calcium channels and calbindin D it is          a plausible hypothesis that CaT and calbindin D could          work in tandem to maintain high rates of calcium          absorption Studies in human duodenal biopsy specimens          have found a significant correlation between CaT mRNA          and calbindin D mRNA expression     Thus as a          working hypothesis we propose that during times of          dietary calcium stress or during periods of high calcium          demand CaT expression in the enterocyte is increased by          a vitamin Ddependent mechanism This regulatory genomic          response of the enterocyte would result in an increase in          the brush border membrane content of CaT calcium influx          channels that could function as a gatekeeper mechanism to          augment the rate of calcium entry across the apical          membrane     However given that there is a          Cadependent negative feedback mechanism to limit calcium          entry through the channel by maintaining the channel in          the closed position     there must be a way to          remove calcium from the vicinity of the cytosolic face of          the channel to optimize and sustain calcium influx rates          The coordinated vitamin Ddependent induction of the          cytosolic calciumbinding protein calbindin D could serve          this function when the need for transcellular calcium          flux is high by acting directly or indirectly as a          molecular sponge and selectively removing calcium ions          from the CaT channel andor to buffer increases in          intracellular calcium thereby preventing premature          inactivation of this I           CRAC channel     Calbindin D          could also play its traditionally conceived role as a          calcium chaperone protein to facilitate the transfer of          calcium through the cytosol    and perhaps delivery          of Ca to the basolateral ATPdependent calcium pump for          extrusion out of the enterocyte                                Conclusions        These observations are the first to demonstrate        regulation of CaT expression by dihydroxyvitamin D in        the human enterocyte and are consistent with a new model of        intestinal calcium absorption wherein vitamin Dmediated        changes in brush border membrane CaT levels could be the        primary gatekeeper regulating homeostatic modulation of        intestinal calcium absorption efficiency                    Materials and Methods                  Conditions of cell culture          Caco cells HTB  ATCC Rockville MD were          propagated and maintained as

sequence Because of the high nucleotide similarity          of CaT and ECaC  an additional identification          step based on restriction fragment length polymorphism          RFLP analysis was also conducted to confirm the          identity of CaT in Caco cells PCR products were          generated using the following primer set sense primer          TGACATCTGAGCTCTATGAGGGT GenBank AF          nucleotides  and antisense primer          CCCAGGGAGTCCTGGGCCCGGA nucleotides  These          primers yield a  bp PCR product with a specific          restriction site that makes it possible to clearly          distinguish between CaT and ECaC using the restriction          enzymes           Bgl New England Biolabs In this          PCR amplified product there is no predicted           Bgl restriction enzyme site in the          corresponding ECaC sequence In contrast the presence          of this           Bgl cut site in the CaT sequence          will result in two smaller bands   and   bp          after digestion with the endonuclease The endonuclease          digested and undigested PCR samples were electrophoresed          on a  agarose gel and the bands were visualized with          ethidium bromide staining The size of the cut bands was          estimated with standard  pb markers to identify whether          the PCR product amplified from Caco cells was being cut
