    an actual place but rather a lifestyle unique to Los Angeles While        the city of Hollywood might once have had a glamorous reputation for        the past few decades the neighborhood which stretches along the base        of the northern hills emblazoned with the landmark Hollywood sign has        deteriorated like a faded movie star        Hollywood first became the center of the film industry in        the s after Cecil B DeMille set up the towns first movie studio        near Highland and Sunset in a horse barn and filmed The Squaw Man the        first featurelength film in

historic        Roosevelt Hotel in  the city was genuinely the epicenter of        entertainment and celebrity stardom        But today the areas golden history has been tarnished by        abandonment and an ongoing parade of hustlers and lost souls wandering        Hollywood Boulevard In fact the only stars here now are those inlaid        into the mildly interesting Walk of Fame or

the celebrities in their Ferraris and        chauffeured towncars today steer clear of Hollywood the city is        indeed attempting a bonafide comeback There are plans to sink hundreds        of millions of dollars into the community to develop new attractions        shops hotels and restaurants However the curtain has not yet gone        up for the citys encore performance        Tinseltown Triumphs        The Hollywood sign over Beachwood Canyon is perhaps the        most recognized landmark in Los Angeles and a favorite photo        background Originally constructed in  to promote real estate sales        in the neighborhood then called Hollywoodland the foot m        letters were abbreviated in later years and replaced due to age in         Even though you cant get close to the sign it has a security        system surrounding it its still a powerful and beloved symbol        reminding visitors of Los Angeless status as the center of the fast        and glamorous world of movie making        Youll certainly get a kick out of the Hollywood Walk of        Fame even if it does keep your interest for only a few minutes The        walk refers to the legwork youll need to do
