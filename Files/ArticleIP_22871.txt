                                 Disgust in Canada            The NATO bombing campaignagainst Yugoslavia was declared a disaster Wednesday in Torontos Globe and Mail which could not have condemned it more severely It has been an unrelieved disasternot just for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but for the very peoplethe bombing was meant to protect it said The NATO attacks have brought abouta wave of righteous nationalism as Yugoslavs rallied behind the man that manyof them loathed            Safe in their hightechjets and distant command posts NATO forces have so far escaped without asingle casualty the paper said It is the Albaniansand of course the Serbsof Yugoslavia toowho are paying the price for the bombing And what does NATOplan to do about it Why bomb some more of course The Globe and Mailsaid that NATOs motives had been goodit wanted to stop Mr Milosevicprotect the Albanians and save its own reputation in the bargain Too manytimes the West has threatened dire consequences and then done nothing It isright to feel guilty about acting too late in Bosnia and not at all in RwandaBut true atonement requires sacrifice In expiating its guilt over pastfailures the West has instead sacrificed the lives of the helpless civiliansof Kosovo That is unforgivable            In interviews published in various European newspapersWednesday NATO SecretaryGeneral Javier Solana denied that the NATO attackshad increased the violence in Kosovo No no he told Corriere dellaSera of Milan Italy NATOs campaign began specifically to stop theviolence  And we are doing everything we can to stop it Corrierealso carried an interview Wednesday with President Kiro Gilgorov of Macedoniawho took the same line Slobodan Milosevic had been planning the ethniccleansing for months he said Gilgorov called for NATO humanitarian aid forthe Kosovar refugees pouring into his country and said the Russians were theonly people in a position to influence Milosevic The only outcome he ruled outwas a world war The Soviet Union doesnt exist anymore so whom would a worldwar be between he asked If there is a risk it is that the conflict willdestabilize other countries            In the British liberalpress which has been strongly supportive of the bombing campaign the focusshifted Wednesday to humanitarian aid The Guardian of Londonsaid in an editorial that aid was now the priority The same concentrationof effort and the same plethora of assets lavished on the aerial war againstSerbia must now be applied to the task of housing and caring for the refugeesreeling out of Kosovo it said That no preparations of this kind were madeby the governments dealing with Milosevic or by the alliance military staffs asthey laid their plans is worse than a pity It shows how feckless Europe andAmerica have been in their approach to this crisis and should at a later timebe the subject of a serious inquiry            The Independent of London exposed its bleeding heart by fillingits entire front page with a picture of two families of refugees under theheadline This is the reality of the war Two mothers five children sevendays of bombing  refugees And no hope In an editorial theIndependent called attention to the other casualty of the bombsthecooperation on foreign policy and military matters which the West and theRussians have developed since the end of the Cold War It said the West wouldhave to struggle to reintegrate Russia into international institutions and thatthe International Monetary Fund should begin this process by providing Russiawith a generous loan            Among the conservative British newspapers stillregarding the use of ground troops as both desirable and a distinctpossibility the Times of London said in an editorial that Milosevics peaceoffer to Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov had been just a feint tosplit the Alliance and urged the continuation of the war until Miloseviccapitulated But Russian newspapers published Tuesday before the offer wasmade and rejected were enthusiastic about Primakovs attempt at mediationNezavisimayaGazeta said the conflict had given Russia an opportunity to be a keyplayer again on the international stage while Moskovsky Komsomoletssaid that Primakov could not lose out in any event If his mission fails hewill have the full moral right to say I did all I could and if he succeedsthe rewards would be tremendous The paper went on He would not only greatlyincrease his international standing but the achievement of any peace howeverfragile in the Balkans would slow the deterioration of Russias politicalsituation at home            Albanian papershighlighted President Rexhep Meidanis appeal for international help in dealingwith the vast influx of refugees and the establishment of a judicial task forcein Albania to investigate Serb atrocities against the Kosovars The papers werefull of patriotic breastbeating Under the headline We Must Go to Pristinathe Democratic Party daily iRilindja Demokratikei called on Albanians toliberate the Kosovar capital from the wounded beast Milosevic The refugeesmust return to Pristina it added We will go to Pristina There is no otherway            In the Middle East Iraqi writer Abdelamir alRakabi warnedin the PanArab alQuds alArabi that if NATOs airstrikes lead to thecapitulation of Milosevic Iraq should prepare for an allout AngloAmericandrive to topple Saddam Hussein But in the Jordanian daily alRai Saleh Qallab argued that this fear is misplaced and should not be used as anexcuse for Arabs to oppose the NATO action in the Balkans Even if NATO hasreasons for attacking Yugoslavia the fact that one of them is to end theslaughter of Kosovar Muslims is a good enough reason for Arabs to support itThere is no justification whatsoever for constantly invoking the idea that myenemys enemy is my friend Qallab wrote            In Israel WednesdayHaaretz condemnedthe Israeli government for refusing to take sides in the Balkan conflict Itsaid Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon hadmade only vague declarations condemning genocide wherever it may be and thatSharon had refrained from mentioning the Serbs as though both sides weremassacring each other Haaretz said it understood why some Israelisfelt they owed the Serbs a debt of gratitude for their tenacious opposition tothe Nazis during World War II but added A muchpersecuted nation wellversed in pogroms cannot stand on the side watching an institutionalizedprocess of exterminating civilians based on religion and ethnicity The Jewishdebt to the Serbs from the time of the Holocaust does not justify Jewish apathyto the horrors the Serbs are perpetrating on the Albanians                           For
