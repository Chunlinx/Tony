                            All organisms have mechanisms to ensure that dividing cells produce new cells with the        proper number of chromosomes The dividing cell closely monitors that chromosomes are        copied exactly once and then distributed correctly to daughter cells After replication        the chromosomes now comprising two chromatids align at the center of the cell and are        attached to a structure known as the spindle apparatus A key point of attachment is the        centromere a characteristic constriction carried by each chromosome The spindle which is        composed of microtubules pulls the chromatids apart so that two complete sets of        chromosomes are gathered together at each pole of the cell which can then divide Cohesion        between chromosome copies which keeps the chromatids together until just the right time        therefore plays a critical part in this process        Chromosome cohesion is established during S phase when the chromosomes are replicated        and is then dissolved completely in metaphase to allow sister chromatids to come apart The        dissolution of cohesion is highly regulated human cell lines that have defects in the        regulation of cohesion show the hallmarks of cancer cells  Furthermore it has been        suggested that the abnormal karyotypes that result in diseases such as Down syndrome are        the result of the improper dissolution of chromosome cohesion  Finally mutation of a        factor required to load cohesinthe protein complex responsible for chromosome        cohesiononto chromosomes appears to cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome a clinically        heterogeneous developmental disorder that may include facial dysmorphia upperextremity        malformations hirsutism cardiac defects growth and cognitive retardation and        gastrointestinal disorders         Cohesion serves at least three roles in the cell with respect to accurate genome        transmission First cohesion close to the centromere facilitates biorientation of        chromosomes such that each chromosome becomes attached to the two poles of the spindle         Second it prevents the splitting of chromosomes until all bipolar attachments are        made  The function of cohesion at the centromere is presumably to oppose the force of        microtubules which pull the chromosomes to opposite spindle poles this force is not        exerted along the chromosome arms which means that cohesion at centromeres and along arms        is functionally distinct Third cohesion along chromosome arms may be essential for proper        chromosome condensation  although the function of cohesion at chromosome arms is        something of a mystery                    Differences between Arms and Centromeres        Cohesion in eukaryotic cells is mediated by a multisubunit protein complex called        cohesin Cohesin consists of four proteins Smc Smc SccMcd also known as kleisin        and Scc SA The Smc structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins form        intramolecular coiled coils that have been observed in the electron microscope to form a V        shape with sides that are  nm long  The cohesin complex has been proposed to form a        ring structure that encircles sister chromatids  Alternately two rings may snap        sisters together via interactions between the coiled coils of the Smc proteins  All        members of the cohesin complex are essential in budding yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  since mutation results in the        precocious dissociation of sister chromatids Functional orthologs of these proteins exist        in all eukaryotes        There are at least two types of cohesin sites  cohesin associated with the        centromere and the nearby pericentric domain and  cohesin associated with chromosome        arms  In         S cerevisiae  cohesin at centromeric and pericentric domains        is spread over a broad region up to  kb large quantities of the protein complex are        bound and binding is not affected by the natural transcriptional and coding status of the        regions that are occupied By contrast binding sites in arms tend to be much smaller        about  kbat least in         S cerevisiae  where they have been most extensively        characterizedand of lower intensity and are spaced at approximately every  kb see        Figure  Cohesin in arms localizes to regions lacking transcription in yeast         This reinforces the view that there may be functional differences in arm and pericentric        cohesion and perhaps different mechanisms to load cohesin as has been proposed for cohesin        on meiotic chromosomes for         S pombe  A unifying feature of all cohesinbinding sites        in         S cerevisiae is high AT adenine and thymine content                Another important difference between cohesin binding along arms and at centromeres is        that the arm sites do not appear to be dependent on a DNA consensus sequence whereas        binding to pericentric regions requires specific centromere sequence  The         S cerevisiae centromere sequence is composed of three DNA        elements CDEI CDEII and CDEIII Studies of cohesion at the centromere reveal that as        little as  bp a portion of CDEII and the entire CDEIII are required to direct cohesion         Mutations in the protein Ndc have also been shown to affect cohesin        deposition at centromeres Ndc forms part of a structure known as the kinetochore which        forms around the centromere and is responsible for the attachment to the spindle        establishment and maintenance of cohesion at pericentric regions may therefore rely on both        the centromere sequence and kinetochore function  Presumably both arm and        pericentric cohesion are important for chromosome dynamics but the functional differences        between the two are not well understood                    CohesionIts Just a Phase        Cohesion can be divided into four phases that occur during the cell cycle Figure          deposition in G the gap in the cell cycle before S phase  establishment in S        phase  maintenance in G the gap between S and mitosis and  dissolution in        mitosis During G Scc and Scc are responsible for loading cohesin onto unreplicated        doublestranded DNA  Then during S phase several proteins are involved in        establishment of cohesion between replicated chromatids Eco and Chl are required for        establishing cohesion but not for maintenance  The associations between cohesion        and DNA replication have led to a model whereby cohesion is established coincident with the        passage of the replication fork  This requires an alternative replication factor C        RFC complex  and may require the origin recognition complex ORC         Cohesion is maintained during G by the cohesin complex and is eventually dissolved in        mitosis to allow sister chromatids to separate        The dissolution of cohesion is regulated by at least two mechanisms First subunits of        the complex may be phosphorylated which facilitates their removal In         S cerevisiae and human cells phosphorylation of SccMcd by        Polo kinase makes it a better substrate for proteolysis  In this issue of         PLoS Biology  one of two related papers exploring the regulation of        cohesin in vertebrates shows that phosphorylation of Scc SA by Pololike kinase is        apparently sufficient to allow dissociation from chromosome arms which occurs during        prophase  In         Xenopus extracts phosphorylation of cohesin also depends on        Pololike kinase and this phosphorylation reduces the ability of cohesin to bind to        chromatin         The second mechanism that can facilitate the dissolution of cohesin is proteolysis this        may be particularly important at centromeres The SccMcd component of the cohesin        complex is cleaved by a separase Esp whose activity is held in check by a securin Pds        until separation at the metaphasetoanaphase transition  Separase is a cysteine        protease that cleaves SccMcd presumably resulting in the cohesin complex falling apart        and being unable to hold sister chromatids together        SccMcd at pericentric regions is protected from phosphorylation during prophaseand        therefore dissociation from chromosomes is preventedby proteins known as shugoshins         In the second paper on cohesin in this issue of         PLoS Biology  McGuinness et al show that shugoshin specifically        protects Scc SA at the centromere so that centromeric cohesion is preserved until the        chromosomes are ready to separate  Vertebrate shugoshin has been shown to have a        strong microtubulebinding domain  and is found at the kinetochore  Recent        evidence suggests that shugoshin in         S cerevisiae may sense tension between sister chromatids        acting as part of a spindle checkpoint that monitors whether chromosomes are properly        aligned on the mitotic spindle  It is currently unclear why the cell has two        mechanisms to dissociate cohesin from chromosomes although it is interesting to speculate        that this could be related to different functions of cohesin at chromosome arms versus        pericentric domains For instance cohesin in chromosome arms may help to organize or        condense chromosomes whereas cohesin at centromeres may be more directly involved in        chromosome biorientation at the spindle and segregation These functions may be important        during different phases of the cell cycle                    A Link between Chromatin and Cohesin        Several results suggest that transcription and cohesin binding are incompatible In         Drosophila  one of the components that loads cohesin NippedB        or Scc has also been shown to be required for longrange promoterenhancer interactions         One model proposed to explain this result is that cohesin can prevent longrange        promoterenhancer interactions and that removal of cohesin can restore these interactions        and allow transcription to occur  In this model NippedB or Scc can act as both a        loading factor and an unloading factor for cohesin This model further speculates that        rather than Cornelia de Lange syndrome stemming from a cohesin loading defect the failure        to unload cohesin from regions that need to be transcribed leads to transcriptional defects        that cause the syndrome In         S cerevisiae it has been shown that driving transcription        through a centromere via an inducible promoter prevents cohesin from associating and        results in chromosome missegregation and cell death  Cohesin is found at the        boundaries of the HMR locus the right telomere of Chromosome III and the RDN array all        regions of silent chromatin  Cohesin localizes to intergenic regions where        transcription is converging         Since transcription and chromatin configuration are intimately related it is possible        that chromatin may play an important role in the localization of cohesin Indeed the        chromatin remodeling complex RSC remodels the structure of chromatin has been shown to be        important for establishment of cohesin binding  and another study suggests RSC is        particularly important for cohesin association with chromosome arms  The chromatin        remodeling complex ISWI SNFh has been shown to be essential for cohesin to localize to        Alu repeats certain DNA sequences in human cells  The possibility also exists that        cohesin itself may influence transcriptional status and act as a transcriptional boundary         The preferential location of cohesin in heterochromatin in pericentric regions        in         S pombe also supports the idea that chromatin        modificationstructure is a key determinant of cohesin localization  It is        interesting to speculate that chromatin differences and transcriptional differences between        chromosome arms and centric regions will turn out to be related to different mechanisms for        loading and removal of cohesin from these regions        While one of the primary roles for chromosome cohesion in biorientation and mitotic        chromosome segregation is wellestablished the complexities of the regulation of cohesion        are still being discovered Cohesin may be involved in multiple ways in chromosome        dynamics Future studies focusing on the differences between cohesion at chromosome arms        versus pericentric domains and the link between cohesion and transcription will likely        yield very interesting insights into the function of the cohesin complex in the maintenance        of genome integrity
