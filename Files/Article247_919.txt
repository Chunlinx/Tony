                                 Brow Beating            Dear Culturebox            In response to your whole indie scene point To me this is the problemnot the solution There was once in this countrylets say the s forshorthanda thriving Highish Midbrow Culture            This is a culture where Roth and Updike made the bestseller list where BobDylans Blonde on Blonde charted where Francis Ford Coppola made a studiomovie called The Godfather  and where Michael Herr published his VietnamWar Dispatches in Esquire  I think this culture matterednotjust to the artists who created these works but to the lived texture of lifein middleclass America I think this culture mattered to as many middleclassAmericans as it did because these works were produced and dispensed andpromoted by mainstream businesses who knew how to reach them I think thesemainstream businesses produced dispensed and promoted these products notbecause there were hard numbers because some individual in some office at theseplaces believed in the artists and their products            Now we have a vapid Blockbuster Culture and a fringy Indie Culture and afragile Highish Midbrow Culture that ever more depends like the High Cultureworld of museums and opera houses long has on the largesse of angelsthink ofSi Newhouseor closer to home Bill Gates Hold your Bookscan please Illtake the rumpled editor who takes a bet on a Lorrie Moore and sticks with heruntil the breakout bookand maybe buys the time by signing up a decentcookbook                           Gerry Marzorati                                       Dear Gerry                        I dont know I think youre letting nostalgia cloud your vision Then asnow there was infinitely more cheesetopping on the great cultural pizza thanthere was pepperoni even if you lower the browlevel on the pepperoni Whatabout that hit sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies   Beverly Hills is merely a few blocks over and up from that Or that musical wonder HerbAlpert and the Tijuana Brass the pseudomariachi band that graced its albumswith photos of beautiful brownskinned women covered with whipped cream Weretalking cornball kitsch that couldnt even get an audience at a hip coffee bartoday For books bestselling titles like The Greening of Americaand Coffee Tea or Me float to mind                        Conversely I dont think the current music scene is half as bad as you makeit out to be Last time I logged onto the Billboard Top site Lauryn Hills new CD was  You cant tell me her serious fusion ofhip hop and rapor say the razzledazzle poetics of the WuTangClandoesnt speak to some people today the way Blonde on Blonde did to itsgeneration Same with Pulp Fiction  the Godfather of its era Or DonDelillos Underworld  which I personally couldnt stand but which spoketruth to many and lingered on the bestseller list for weeks We                couldgo on all day each jockeying to outbrow the other high and low which wouldbe enormously fun for us but boring Im afraid for our readers                                       On another front I have to insist that better clearer more rigorousnumbers would help books more than theyd hurt them For instance if theNew York Times Bestseller List didnt fiddle with the numbers so muchonlylooking at certain bookstores and going so far as to seed the process bysending out a list of books its interested in tracking as my colleagueElizaTruitt                reported in                Slate                a little whileagocertain regional bestsellers such as Cold Mountain  wouldnt takeso long to come to national attention I know the conventional thinking is thatthe NYT Bestseller List is good for midlist books because it refusesto track crap but if the NYT Bestseller List were based on firm andcomprehensive numbers rather than guesstimates why couldnt the Timesstill refuse to track crap It would just have to be more upfront about howit slices the stats and then it would do much a better job of following theserious books throughout the country not just at selected stores                        Culturebox
