                                 First Class Troublemaker            Everybody leads with Monica Lewinskys meeting yesterday with three of theRepublican congressmen who are making the case against President Clinton in theSenate            The majors all say that the meeting produced no explosive new informationYet there is no agreement about what that dictates Lewinskys lawyers who satin on the interview say this means she shouldnt be called to testify But theRepublican congressmen say the opposite All the papers report that thequestioning of Lewinsky did not include pressing her on any sexual details TheWashington Post says this was by prearrangementInstead the talk homed in on the obstruction of justice evidenceinparticular say all the majors the circumstances surrounding the transfer ofLewinskys presidential gifts to Betty Currie Both the WP and theNew York Timescite one source each the Post identifies himher as a source familiarwith the session and the NYT goes with a Republican counsel at theinterview saying that yesterday Lewinsky said that Curries pickup of thegifts could have occurred later than she previously testified and hence afterthe muchtalkedabout cell call Currie made to her The NYT makes itclear though that two other people familiar with Sundays meeting say thatLewinsky made no significant change in her account And indeed the USA Todaylead says straightaway that Lewinsky told the congressmen that she stands byher previous testimony that no one ever asked her to lie about her affair withPresident Clinton and that she was never offered a job for her silence            The LosAngeles Times  the NYT and the WP report without anyevident irony that the Lewinsky interview took place in the presidential suiteof the Mayflower Hotel and note that the room cost  a night None of thepapers says however who picked up the tab Was this congressionalgravysucking or defense counsel gravysucking Or both            A NYT exclusive based on an interview with a friend of Lewinskysprovides these nuggets  Lewinsky cried herself to sleep Friday night uponlearning that she had to come back to Washington for more questioning  Shesuffered the indignity of

product placementdeal            The press consensus is that despite Lewinskys er reinsertion theprospects for the Republican case managers winning the right to call her oranyone else as witnesses are dubiousindeed the Post says theyregloomy The NYT says the Senate might take a vote on findings of factrelevant to the two impeachment articles and then take a separate vote on thearticles themselves The point of this the paper quotes a Republican senatorexplaining would be to separate the question of what Clinton did from thequestion of whether what he did is impeachable On this latter question theWall Street Journal editorial page weighs in with abit of historical research The paper claims that the most authoritative sourceon the common law known to those who wrote and ratified the Constitutionincludes in its list of high misdemeanors that can be committed by thoseserving the public trust both obstructing the execution of lawful processand willful and corrupt perjury
