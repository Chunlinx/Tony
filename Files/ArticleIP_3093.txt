                                 A Loss for Words            For a recent piece in theNew York Times Magazine  Lois Gould went to see the latest readytowearfashion collectionsnot as a reporter but as a guest She then wrote aboutreporters and runways together as a tout ensemble  accessorized bycamera crews designers clients and others present A novelist and feministGould has the stance of a resolute outsider her mother was a fashion designerand Gould has built her identity on having none of it She approaches theundertaking in the spirit of satirethe serious writers favored mode sincethe Middle Ages for dealing with fashionand since fashion now has noexistence without its spin doctors Gould included them as part of hertarget            Shequoted one of a group of reporters Cant we call it somethingso it soudsnew And another If I can stick to information I wont have to say I hateit She overheard equivocal efforts to call it something so that  I likethe concept usually meant ugly and that when Miyake had baggy prison garbthe word on that was intellectual  or that if it looks like an old pinupof Rita Hayworth in a nightie its a return to femininity And so the newsmedia Gould marveled sardonically manage to explain it all But whilejournalists feel they must sneer at the same old character of the handsomewearable designs clients and buyers greet them with applause            Gould was discovering an unfortunate dilemma in theprofession of fashion journalism Since writers dont feel allowed to comeright out and say they hate ita collection an itemor to praise what isreally praiseworthy but not new enough their writing tends to develop anoblique distorted character Its often clear they hate something if only thehorrid jostle and pressure of covering the shows or maybe its dislike oftheir own contorted rhetoric thats rubbing off on what they say about theclothes It gives the phrases that explain the garments an overthetopquality that only adds absurdity to an art already taking big aesthetic risksThe master of clean Calvin Klein pairs thongs and a strapless dress withsymmetrical slashes in silver lending an Eastern flavor to his minimalistethic Vogue  Since this prose is often all the public gets alongwith a few minimally informative photos the longterm effect is to keepfashion looking much sillier than it actually is            The effectis compounded by the steady pressure on the public consciousness of ad copywhich consistently overpraises fashion goods and so debases their realaesthetic value Of course hysterical praise has always been lavished onfinery by folk in the business It looks terrific its fabulous itsYOUand not just in this century but back through the two previous ones InFanny Burneys Evelina  published in  there is an early scene at aLondon fabric shop                           Ithought I would never have chosen a silk for they produced so many I knew notwhich to fix upon and they recommended them all so strongly that I fancy theythought I only wanted persuasion to buy everything they showed me And indeedthey took so much trouble that I was almost ashamed I could not                        At the accessory shop the country girl is surprised to beserved by men                           And such men sofinical so affected They seemed to understand every part of a womans dressbetter than we do ourselves and they recommended caps and ribands with an airof so much importance that I wished to ask them how long they had left offwearing them                        Nothing the matter withbuying lovely new things its the invasive verbal hype that interferes withpersonal judgment and turns the happy effort into an embarrassing burden            Credit for most good writingabout clothing during the same threecentury period must go to the poets andnovelists Tolstoys rendering of Anna Kareninas magic in her black ball gownor of Princess Betsys dcolletage at the theater stand out as examples alongwith Henry James magnificent glancing allusions to the emotional powergenerated by a rustle a ribbon the drawing on of a pair of gloves            Latelyhowever there is less and less of this in literature Fashion journalists andsensational fictioneers like Danielle Steele have coopted the field and otherwriters are scared off Fashion now seems like a club with a private jargonthat leaves no room for the play of sensitive literary exposition And goodcritical writing about clothing hardly exists at all There is no tradition ofclothes criticism that includes serious analysis or even of costume criticismamong theater ballet and opera critics who do have an august writerlyheritage This fact may be what makes the fashion journalist hate her jobthepainful sense that real work cannot be done in this genre that it would bebetter more honorable to be writing about something else            There are heartening exceptions One is Amy Spindler of theNew York Times  who seems to take clothes seriously without excess orapology deploying a quick imagination and an interest in detail that give herwriting a fine attentive sting A Versace show opened with razorsharpbiascut asymmetrical navy dresses stern except for a frill at the hem and aswatch of black lace that masked eyes There was Kennedy Fraser late ofThe New Yorker  whose witty essays on fashion published in that magazineduring the s have since happily been collected Holly Brubach whosucceeded Fraser at The                New Yorker  kept the standard high duringher time there A big exception is the fashion journalism of France where anoticeable respect for fashion has been a standard common attitude since the th century Fashion is as acceptable in France as any imaginativework and criticism about it has certainly flourished there Denis Diderot hasmuch to say about dress in the theater and Honor de Balzac wrote an incisivetreatise on neckties among his many essays on elegance Stphane Mallarmactually did a bit of fashion reporting in the s some under the name ofMlle Satin One good current French critic is Laurence Benam whosethoughful pieces appear regularly in Le Monde             Butfashion has been without honor in the Englishspeaking world for so long thatwe are afraid to take it seriouslysolemnly yes as we take so many thingsbut not with ordinary seriousness When we are not in raptures or disapprovingin the name of female realities we are likely to wax sociological andpsychological about fashion to weigh it down with quasiscientific meaningoutof some ancient fear perhaps of its obvious debt to Eros            Lois Gould was writing about readytowearfashion which tends to be dealt with all the more hysterically see RobertAltmans film PrtaPorter  for there being huge amounts of money atstake in the success or failure of its collections These clothes are designedfor largescale factory production and the chief customer is a bulk buyerJournalists feel responsible for protecting a serious financial investment eachseason Trying to summon and express good judgment may be next toimpossibleeven good judgment about what will sell            And so westill have the haute couture with its extreme apparitions twice a yearan enterprise frequently announced as dead but repeatedly revived as awellpublicized modern game Haute couture was invented in the s toserve private clients privately The press was only grudgingly allowed into itsbyinvitationonly showings nearly half a century after famous Pariscouturiers first began holding sway over the clothing of the worldselegant women Reporters had to sneak into Ascot and Longchamps or modishrestaurants and theaters or crash chic garden parties to see what was beingworn by whom They could sketch or describe new fashions as accurately as theirspying talents permitted            In the present climate its the reporters andcamerapersons who create the public event The clothes seem aimed only at thenews media made only for models who exist only to be transmuted into mediaprojections verbal and pictorial cooked up to be consumed by a public whonot only wont wear the clothes but will never see them being actually wornThe prose and the images form the entire experience            The couture client is infact still private The show is only partly for the distant world served bythe camera and the commentator the rest is for her and her like seated in thefront row For the private client there are still masterpieces of raredelicacy and breathtaking beauty or exquisitely simple practicality all madepossible by the materials and handworkmanship available to couture houses andconceived by designers modifying their ideas to suit each clients taste andfigure For the media however the designer uses the same resources forexplosions of bizarre novelty or to indulge his wildest fantasiesnot all ofthem benignabout women clothes and the world Money is not the point hereprestige is Writers could find true scope for their interpretive talents ifthey could gain true prestige from meeting the challenge            These elements of eachcouture showexquisite clothes for the superrich unbelievable costumes forthe supermodelstogether make up a vision of hope and glory a kind of poetryabout the possible beauty of possible women Oscar Wilde another great writeron fashion said All art must be useless Couture demands writers who willdo its uselessness justice
