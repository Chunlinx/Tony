                                 Drink Hold or Fold            As the new year turns amidthe journalistic farrago of year end summaries and photo spreads with worldcrises recapped celebrities remourned and cartoons reprinted I always lookforward to the years first issue of the                   Wine Spectator                This issue contains the magazinesupdated Vintage Chart the key to ordering well at a restaurant            I quickly put the chartinto my wallet and toss out last years outofdate one The size of a largebusiness card the Wine Spectator vintage chart unfolds like anaccordion Its six pages of datacrammed grids include lists of the major wineregions of the world and scores on a scale of one to  for each year with anote to drink or hold in other words enjoy it now or bank it and let itappreciate            The Wine Spectator chart is the best of its kindmainly because it is the most comprehensive Even a wine expert who tracksthese things might not remember as he scans a wine list what conditions werelike for French Alsatian wines in  Good The cheat sheet hands out a high DrinkHold  Or whether to order that underpriced Barolo  No ThePiedmont region in  gets a lousy  Taillevent a superb restaurant inParis supplies its own chart for patrons and even includes a line on tinyJura a region on the border between France and Switzerland Even if you dontknow what Juranon is go ahead and order it if the restaurants chart has itin its very best year of the decade Actually be careful because someJuranon is dessert wine            Vintage charts are agreat idea because they isolate the most important variable in the making ofwine the year The best way to find a good underpriced wine is to look for atype of wine you like Bordeaux California cabernet pinot noir in anexcellent year click here for an annotated list of grapes and varietiesEven if you have never heard of the producer the chances are its pretty goodIn general prices follow name brands not years so you will find bargains aswell And if the winemaker is half decent in a great year he will have donewell So a  Bordeaux or Burgundy is likely to be firstrate if made by arespectable even if unknown winemaker Similarly  was a balmy year forCalifornia cabs You simply cant go wrong if you order one or even purchase itin a shop that stocks selectively Note re buying wine in restaurants Yourealso relying on the restaurants screening system There are truly awfulwinemakers who could make plonk even in the best year But few restaurantscarry such wines            Obviously year isnt the only determinant The region thegrape variety and the winemakers skill have an enormous effect on winequality The French tend to talk lyrically about the terroir  thecharacteristics given by particular climate and soil while Americans worshipwinemakers instead turning them into celebrities But by concentrating onnature rather than nurture the French are probably closer to the truth thanthe Americans are At the end of the day wine is an agricultural product Justas the year to year quality of oranges potatoes and tomatoes is determinedprimarily by the weather so it is with grapes            The comparison isntperfect because wine is not simply an agricultural product Grapes must bepressed fermented blended and aged to make wine so its better described asa semiprocessed food productone whose quality is shaped as it sits anddecays in vats barrels and bottles I say semiprocessed because wine is notthe massproduced machinemade processed food that orange juice is so thewinemaker cannot interfere as much with the process Consequently a bad yearwith some exceptions means bad wine whether at Chteau LafiteRothschild orat Gallo Cabernet sauvignon in a bad that is excessively cold year tastesacidic weedy and vegetal Pinot noir simply tastes thin and fruitlessChardonnay is a hardy grape which is why it is so widely produced all over theworld Youre unlikely to get something really off when you order a glass ofChardonnay which explains its ubiquity on wine lists            Of course you can compensate for weatherwithin limitsJust as in a good year you can do well easily in a bad year almost nothing canmake a firstrate product Winemakers who make fine champagne special Napacabernets and singlevineyard burgundies do not make their best winessayStags Leap Cask  or Vintage Bollingerin a bad year At the great Sauternesvineyard Chteau dYquem they make none of their legendary wine if the weatherhas been particularly bada crippling financial decision less and less likelyto be made as the old standards of the owner the Comte de LursSaluces arereplaced by those of management gnomes            What makes a good year is a very complicated mattersince different grapes and regions are best served by different weatherconditions In general the fruit should form in goodsized bunches on the vineripen at a reasonable pace and be plucked when fully ripe The great enemiesof grape growers are extremes and sudden changefluctuating temperaturessudden rainstorms heat waves flash frosts In fact even the banalities Ivejust written are actually the subject of intense controversy Its a complexgrid too complicated for the average imbiber to chart for himself which iswhy you should celebrate every new year with a nice bottle and the WineSpectator cheat sheet
