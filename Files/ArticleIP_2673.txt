                                 ER and the Triple Hex            A couple of months ago whenmy fellow surgical residents and I went around a table divvying up nights onemergency room duty one March date sat conspicuously unpickedFriday the th  Cmon I thought This is ridiculous So when it was my turnagain I put my name down for March  Rest up one resident told me Youllbe in for a long night I laughed and dismissed the thought            Butlooking at my calendar a while later I noticed that the moon would be fullthat Friday night When someone noted that a lunar eclipse would be occurringthen too I felt my skepticism slip a little Perhaps I would be in for amiserable night after all Trained scientists such as myself however do notsuccumb easily to superstition Like any selfrespecting rationalist I askedthe obvious question Isnt there a study on this            It turns out there is one reputable study that has tried toassess whether or not luck actually does go bad on Friday the  th Im not sure which is more surprising that someone actually spent timeresearching this or that I could find only one such study This is after alla world that has studied even how chewing gum distributes saliva around themouth The  study published in the British Medical Journal compared hospital admissions for traffic accidents on a Friday the th with those on a Friday the  th in a communityoutside London Despite a lower highway traffic volume on the  ththan on the  th  admissions for traffic accident victims increased percent on the  th  Friday the  th is unlucky forsome the authors concluded Staying at home is recommended How you escapethe bad luck at home they didnt explain            You reallycant make much of one study of one Friday the  th in one townLots of other factors could have caused that surge of crashes Still Fridaythe  th phobia is widespread Donald Dossey a North Carolinabehavioral scientist has coined a term for it paraskevidekatriaphobiawhich he derived from the Greek for fear of Friday the  th  Heestimates that between  million and  million Americans suffer mild tosevere anxiety or change their activitiesperforming rituals before leavingthe house calling in sick to work or postponing flights or majorpurchasesand that businesses lose  million in revenues because of thesefears            Superstitions about the moon may be taken evenmore seriously For centuries and in disparate civilizations around the worldpeople have suspected that the cycles of the moon have a powerful influenceover us A  poll found that  percent of people still believed the moonalters individual behavior And mental health professionals believed it moreoften than anybody else The centuriesold word lunatic derives from theconnection thought to exist between the full moon and madness            The ideaof lunar human cycles seems more plausible than a Friday the  theffect Scientists once dismissed daily biological cycles as preposterous butthey now widely accept that body temperature alertness memory and mood allfluctuate according to a predictable circadian rhythm Evidence also showsseasonal effects on mood and behavior            Ifound some one hundred studies testing for circalunidiancycles My favorite is a fiveyear study of selfpoisoning at a hospital in NewSouth Wales Australia published in the Medical Journal of Australia From  to  the hospital admitted  patients for overdosing on drugsor poisoning themselves with toxic substances The researchers checked to seewhether peaks in such events occurred not just according to the phase of themoon but also according to ones zodiac sign or numerological readings ascalculated according to the formulas contained in Zolars Encyclopedia ofAncient and Forbidden Knowledge  To no ones surprise selfpoisoningrates were not affected by whether a patient was born a Virgo or a Libra Nordid Zolars Name Number Month Number or Birth Path Number for a personmake any difference However women but not men were about  percentless likely to overdose around the time of a full moon than around a newmoon            Thatselfpoisonings decrease at the full moon actually correlates with the resultsof other studies If any link between psychology and the full moon exists itseems to be protective The authors of a  study of  years of suicides inDordogne France concluded in charmingly ungrammatical English that theFrench dies less in Full Moon and more in New Moon period Studies inCuyahoga County Ohio and Dade County Fla also found a drop in suicides atthe full moon These studies dont quite clinch the full moons happy effecthowever More than  other studies have been done and they have not confirmeda lunar cycle for suicide            As for other forms of craziness the moon seemsto have no effect Researchers have reviewed logs for calls to police stationsconsultations to psychiatrists homicides emergency room visits and othermeasures of our daily burden of madness They found no consistent relationshipone way or another with the moon            Somehow however the moondoes have an effect on human beingsat least on women Menstruation typicallyoccurs on the  day lunar cycle And even the phase of the moon matters In astudy of  women  percent began menstruating during the four days aroundthe new moon whereas no more than  percent did so during any other four dayperiod This puts the peak of ovulation at the full moon Could this providean evolutionary explanation for the romantic associations we have with themoon Ill leave that to Robert Wright                   Slate               s residentDarwinian to sort out How this happens is baffling The lone hypothesis Ivefound proposes that the moon generates tidal forces on the  percent to percent of our bodies that is water But that only raises more questionssuchas how tides are supposed to make women menstruate            The evidence satisfied methat neither the full moon nor the inauspicious date threatened my nightNonetheless I came on duty that evening to find the resident from whom I wastaking over swamped with patients He stayed late to help me catch up Justafter he left a new trauma victim rolled ina yearold who had beenknocked unconscious in a highspeed headon collision The police andparamedics said he had been stalking his girlfriend with gun in hand He fledin his car when cops arrived and led them on a chase that ended in the massivecrash The rest of the night was no better I was as we say slammed Itsfull moon Friday the  th  a nurse explained I was about to saythat studies showed no connection But my pager went off before I could startI had a new patient coming in
