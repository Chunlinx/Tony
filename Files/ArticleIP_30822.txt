                                  Air Sickness            Ready for vengeance everyone            It is I the Great Shopping Avenger reporting toyou from the Great Hall of Consumer Justice a k a the Shopping Avengerspoorly airconditioned attic office            The Shopping Avenger has had a terribly busy monthAquaman never had it so busy and he is pleased to report that demand for hisservices has grown exponentially He is also disconcerted because the sheernumber of emails in response to last months installment means that too manyevil corporations are treating too many loyal consumers without regard for thebasic norms of customer care such as answering the phone and not callingcustomers bad names            Before we turn to this months shameful examples ofcorporate malfeasance a couple of housekeeping notes             Two dozen readers wrote to let the ShoppingAvenger know they were pissed off by his use of the term pissed off in lastmonths column The term is offensive to anyone with any sense of courtesypride in themselves dcor of personality and sense of decency the vengefulreader R wrote            The Shopping Avenger notes that he possesses agreat deal of dcor of personality He also notes that many readers drivento near madness by customerservice representatives use strong language todescribe their plights and the Shopping Avenger is merely reflecting theiranger Though the Shopping Avenger offers this piece of advice When writing toconsumer care specialists or whatever theyre being called today do not usethe honorific asshole by way of greeting And remember The assholes are theones making sevenfigure salaries The people at the other end of the  lineare lackeys and shills and running dogs but they arent assholes             Speaking of lackeysit has now been approximately  days since UHaul spokeswoman Johna Burkepromised to share her companys reservation policy with the Shopping AvengerFor those of you who missed the  the Shopping Avenger attempted to help anaggrieved UHaul customer who made a reservation for a truck only to be toldclose to the time of pickup that no such reservation existed            Though UHaulapparently unimpressed by the supernaturalpower of the Shopping Avengerhas not deigned to provide answers no fewerthan  deputy Avengers emailed over the past month complaining aboutUHauls reservation policy I reserved a UHaul truck for a Saturday morningto be picked up at  one correspondent T reports I hired some help forthe day to help me move When I arrived that morning to pick it up I was toldit was not there yet After much complaining a few phone calls were made andI was told the truck was  miles away            Ts complaint is entirely typical Another memberof the Avenging Brigade B wrote in to say this A UHaul employee inPhoenix last  th of July weekend told me the company had reservations in Phoenix that weekend and  available trucks My truck wasthree days late and I only got it by threatening legal action            The Shopping Avenger willrevisit the UHaul issue each month until satisfactory explanations areprovided That is the least the Shopping Avenger can do for you the pissedoffconsumer            Last month the Shopping Avenger also put out a call forairline and pestcontrol horror stories One wag J wrote in to ask Isthere a difference between pests and airlines Contest alert Best punch lineemailed to the Shopping Avengerwill be rewarded by public mention in this space plus a lifetime supply ofTurtle Wax if the Shopping Avenger can figure out what Turtle Wax is            The complaints poured in As noted previously theShopping Avenger is but one superhero and he issues abject apologies to allthose who did not receive personal responses            Pest control will be dealt with in a futureepisode But about those airlines The interesting thing about the airlinecomplainants is that they dont even want the Shopping Avenger to seekretribution or restitution All they want to do is vent Maybe no one believesthat airlines even care anymore or are capable of responding to complaints            The complaints coveredthe waterfront baggage problems surly flight attendants mysteriouslycanceled flights billing atrocities But the most compelling complaintsconcerned bereavement fares Theres nothing like an airline screwing withsomeone whos going to bury his mother to make the blood boil            Recently my mother passed away and I needed to travelfrom Orlando to Fort Wayne Indiana the next day in order to attend herfuneral our correspondent JD writes In June of last year I had traveledto Orlando from Detroit on Northwest Airlines that should send up a few redflags and was given a  travel voucher because the plane literally did notshow up Being that airline tickets even a bereavement fare purchased at thelast minute can be quite expensive I opted to cash in my voucher            JD says he made the reservation by telephoneholding the seat with his credit card He was told to present his credit cardwith the voucher upon his arrival at the airport where he would be chargedobviously only for the part of the ticket not covered by the  voucher            Then trouble On arriving at the airport Iproceeded to do this and was told by the agent that the tickets were alreadypurchased and I could not use my voucher JD writes I contested this butshe was unwilling to budge and unwilling to get a supervisor telling me thatThats just the way it is             JD says he let it drop vowing to settle thisupon my return from the funeral            After the funeral he contacted Northwest he saysand after much frustrating dialing reached an answering machine I had toleave my particulars on a voice mail because no agents were available to takemy call This worked out poorly since when the agent called me back she gotmy voice mail and left a message with the same number So when I called backof course all I got was the same opportunity to leave my particulars on theirvoice mail system            This is when the customer says Arrrghh            After much goaroundJD called American Express told them his plight and Amex canceled theentire charge            I emailed Northwest spokeswoman Marta Laughlin whoresponded first by questioning JDs motivation The writers remarks aboutthe plane never showing up and raising red flags cause me to question hisstory It just sounds like theres something more personal here            One could argue that a passenger might havepersonal feelings about an airline after said airline messed with his headwhile he was traveling to his mothers funeral            Laughlin followed up though by saying that thedeath of anyone close is a very emotional and trying experience andindividuals frequently behave differently as a result of their pain Shesstill blaming the customer but she continues the Northwest employee at theairport should have taken extra steps to help the writer in his time of need Iwish that was the case and I apologize on behalf of Northwest Airlines            Grudging doubleedgedbut an apology all the same            We will return to the issue of airlines in a futureepisode but the Shopping Avenger would like to relate another tale that caughthis attention this past month The company in question is Sprint PCS and thestory most definitively does not end with an apology            In short strokes the story goes like this Acustomer William Summerhill an associate professor of history at UCLAordered two phones from Sprint PCS He was billed for sixweirdly at threedifferent prices still another charge for one cent was also billed to hiscredit card by Sprint PCS He fought the bill Sprint PCS fought back byphone and fax wasting a good amount of time            Finally his credit cardcompany agreed that he was the victim of false billing and canceled out thecharges for four of the six phones Professor Summerhill continued to bebilled but one thing he did not receive in the mail was a rebate on one of thetwo remaining phones part of a special promotion he signed up for Though hepaid for the two phones he withheld paying his monthly fee until Sprint PCSstraightened out his case and gave him his rebate In response Sprint PCScanceled his service and referred his case to a collection agency which isthreatening his credit rating            When I first contacted Sprint PCS which is a tale initselfthe line operator citing policy refused to disclose the telephonenumber of Sprint PCS headquarters apparently fearing that customers might tryto talk to the executives whose salaries they pay a spokesman Tom Murphytold me the case was terribly complex Actually it isnt Sprint PCS billed acustomer for six phones refused to stop billing him and threatened him whenhe wouldnt pay for service pending a resolution of the problem            Summerhill who is now a happy customer ofATT says he will pay the monthly fees when he receives an apology and therebate money The rebate money is owed to him and so is the apology Heestimates that he has spent  to  hours trying to straighten out the billingproblem which is clearly Sprint PCSs problem            But no apology isforthcoming The Shopping Avenger received an email from Alison Hill anexecutive analyst at Sprint PCS who writes that she works directly for MrAndrew Sukawaty the President and CEO of Sprint PCS Hill concedes thatSprint PCS was at fault for erroneously charging Summerhill for phones he didnot wantshe claims he was charged for two phones he didnt want even thoughhis records show he was billed for fourbut she says the customer is also atfault for not paying his bill for telephone calls made on the phones he diduse            I spoke with Hill directly and told her it seemedreasonable to me that Summerhill would withhold payment until his billingdispute was settled and the rebate issue resolved She said he was wrong Imentioned to her the quaint notion that the customer is always right and shesaid in my opinion the customer is wrong            Obviously the Shopping Avenger juju has not yetworked on Sprint PCS but Summerhill reports that it has worked on thecollection agency I told the agency that I was reporting this matter to theFCC to the California consumer protection people and to the Shopping Avengerat                   Slate                She didnt say anything about the FCC or the consumerprotection people but she did ask me to please not give the name of thecollection agency to                   Slate                           Professor Summerhill haspromised to tell everyone at UCLA and in his Army Reserve unit to boycottSprint PCS Im probusiness I love America I love capitalism but thesepeople are crazy he said They could make this go away but they wont            Sprint PCS could take a cue from Southwest Airlines one ofa handful of companies in America with sterling reputations for customerservice A little while back the Shopping Avenger received a plaintive emailfrom B who reported that he was the only passenger on his flight not toreceive free drink coupons Apparently the flight was late and as a friendlygesture Southwest let the passengers get drunk on its dime But not B Somehowhe was skipped over            The Shopping Avenger let Ed Stewart Southwestsspokesman know of Bs sad story and within hours the Shopping Avengerreceived this reply As Im sure youve heard we here at Southwest Airlinespride ourselves on our Customer Service and would NEVER want it to be said thatwe deprived anyoneparticularly a Customerthe opportunity to have a drinkon us            Stewart says that B will be mailed an apologyplus Southwest peanuts plus a coupon book for free drinksincluding mixeddrinks            I hope that this will satisfy your sense ofjustice he wrote            It does indeed                                             Got a consumerscore you want settled Send email to shoppingavengerslatecom
