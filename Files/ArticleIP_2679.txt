                                 The Dead Baby Mystery            One by one between  and each of the  children Marie Noe bore died One was stillborn One diedat the hospital just after birth And the others expired at home just infantsin their cribs where Noe said she found them blue and either limp or gaspingDoctors including some of the most respected pathologists of the time couldfind no explanation for the eight crib deaths Indeed the medical communitycame to recognize that thousands of seemingly healthy infants inexplicably diedin their beds each year and they coined the name Sudden Infant Death Syndromeor SIDS for these cases            Eightunexplained deaths in one family do not sit easily We expect more fromscience doctors and cops On Aug  Philadelphia District Attorney LynneAbraham seemingly satisfied our expectations when she cited new medicalevidence to allege that Noe now  had smothered the children with a pillowScience Abraham told the Associated Press has been solving old unsolvedcases She charged Noe with eight counts of first degree murder            Abrahams claim puzzled me How did she determine thedeaths were homicide and not SIDS SIDS is not really a disease but rather thename weve given to one of the great medical mysteries of our time Any suddeninfant death that remains unexplained after a complete postmorteminvestigation is defined as SIDS Typically in SIDS cases a previously healthybaby is found dead in bed No cry is heard from the infant prior to its deathThe child may be found with clenched fists or frothy bloodstained fluidissuing from the nose and mouth Although  percent of SIDS deaths occur bysix months of age older infants can die spontaneously and unexpectedly aswell            One earlySIDS theory that babies simply stop breathing has been discredited Twosuggestive findings are that sleeping on soft bedding and sleeping face downboth increase a babys risk of sudden death A successful campaign to getparents to put babies to bed on their backs or sides has been associated with a percent drop in SIDS deaths over four years Perhaps SIDS will turn out tobe a kind of freak accident in which babies unable to turn over are smotheredby their own bedding The findings raise questions about how in the world youcould accurately distinguish suffocation from SIDSespecially in the Noe casesin which the original autopsies showed no marks of force and the corpses areprobably now nothing but bone Forensic pathologists and child abuse experts Icontacted confirmed that there is no distinctive autopsy finding or new testthat could distinguish SIDS from homicide by suffocation            So what was the basis for charging Noe Anofficial close to the case who requested anonymity admitted that there was noevidence that supported the charges of homicide The doctors involved simplyreviewed the old medical evidence Had the previous pathologists missedphysical signs of suffocation No the official said It appears that thecritical factor was the pattern Eight deaths in one family was highlysuspicious and Noe was the only person present when each of the children diedThe district attorney reopened the Noe cases after a March Philadelphiamagazine story about them            In childabuse cases science often can only provide circumstantial evidenceOccasionally we doctors find convincing evidence of abuse cigarette burnsXrays showing multiple fractures of varying age bruises that trace theoutline of a coat hanger a stockinglike burn suggesting a foot plunged intoand held down in hot liquid However most cases do not come with such obvioussigns In deciding whether to sic the department of social services on a casewe have only vague indicators to rely upon For example according toguidelines used at Childrens Hospital in Boston any bruise faciallaceration or long bone fracture in an infant is considered evidence ofpossible abuse In the end doctors look for the parents to tell us much morethan any physical evidence can            Not long ago my yearold daughter was playing unsupervisedin an adjacent room when suddenly she screamed My wife found her lying on theground her right arm bent midway between the elbow and the wrist as if she hadan unnatural extra joint As near as we could figure it seemed she had triedto climb onto our couch our yearold son had pushed her over and her armhad got caught in the slats As she fell the bones of the forearm broke intwo When I took her to the hospital I was grilled by three different peopleasking me over and over again Now exactly how did this happen It was Iknew a suspicious storyan unwitnessed fall resulting in a bad fracture Thedoctors were looking just as I do when I see young trauma victims for anyinconsistencies or changes in the story Its easy for parents to feelselfrighteous when doctors ask questions as if theyre cops but as advancedas medicine has become questions are still our main diagnostic test forabuse            Ultimately I must have allayed any concerns My daughter got a pink cast andI took her home without incident I couldnt help but think however that mysocial status played a role in all this As much as doctors may try to avoidit when we decide whether to involve officials in a case social factorsinevitably play a role For example we know that single parents have almostdouble the risk of being abusive poor families almost  times thelikelihood Onethird of crackusing mothers are found to abuse or neglecttheir children Race by the way is not a factor            In the case of Noe these factors played to heradvantage She was married middleclass respectable But the fact of eightdeaths must mean something right As one coroner involved in the case saidrepeating a maxim that has gained currency among pathologists One SIDS deathis a tragedy Two is a mystery Three is murder            The real answer however isthat science cant tell us what happened beyond reasonable doubt Bucking hiscolleagues Pittsburgh Medical Examiner Cyril Wecht says that multiple SIDSdeaths in one family do not automatically mean murder The numbers certainlymake the Noe deaths suspicious After all experts now believe that losing onebaby to SIDS does not increase the likelihood that a family will lose anotherHowever Wecht points out there have been cases of two and three unexplainedinfant deaths in a family in which homicide was ruled highly unlikely Parentsof SIDS babies have been wrongly accused in the past And most troubling as Isaid before we dont know what SIDS is in the first place We may have lumpedseveral different diseases together in describing the syndrome Perhapsmultiple natural deaths in a family are possible            Although science oftencannot prove even fatal child abuse it is not without its power Confrontedwith the medical proof of homicide Noe admitted to suffocating four of herchildren She apparently couldnt recall what had happened to the others Herlawyer however is questioning the reliability of the confession obtainedduring an allnight interview He says she will plead innocent to thecharges
