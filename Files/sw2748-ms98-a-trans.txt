                yes  so what have you painted recently   all right oh recently let me think actually recently ive just done some you know touch up types of painting although im looking at a few of the ceilings like uh in the family room and uh im wondering if i should take that project on myself and thats a little harder uh yeah you know me well so yeah i do most of the painting myself uh you know uh outdoors no you know outdoors uh gets too high with you know have to hire a professional for that um what about you   well my kitchen ceiling has needed painting for uh four years now  and im  having painted the apartment that i left in Syracuse i i really hesitate to do ceilings because i get more paint on me than on on the the ceiling but       now that they redid the roofs all of our ceilings need it because it popped a lot of nails   uhhuh   so i think this summer im going to take on the kitchen first and then try to do the others because i want to pull up the carpeting and put hardwood all through the house   oh okay   so i think   so that thats a lot of uh yeah youve got your work laid out for you   right i figure by by doing it before i put in the carpeting  you know the carpet is so bad whatever i spill its too bad   right well thats thats a good idea get get the pointing over with and then the carpets going to go anyway   right   right yeah well uh uh im thinking for this summer of uh im contemplating actually uh doing a lot of wallpaper i think in the basement you know what having a problem of the basement being finished but you know with uh its being used as a recreation center  its uh its constantly either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe putting something more durable that i can wipe down and doesnt have to be painted all the time   right   and so im thinking of maybe uh you know if i can find some fairly neutral tasteful wallpapers of maybe just papering and and that has seemed to work pretty well upstairs you know with with kids so its uh you know it doesnt require that every year the house has to be repainted which usually i guess most people must paint about every two years   oh i would hope not because it seems to me that it would get too thick uh and start peeling maybe   oh really yeah i i dont know i always assumed   i think its should i dont know my my impression is its more like four years four years it starts needing it and people usually get around to it at five or six years   yeah well yeah i think thats true i mean some of the areas havent been touched since we moved in six years ago i know exterior paints really if its done well uh two good coats and a primer uh i think uh exterior paint probably should last somewhere around seven to ten years i think   oh exterior that long that would be   uh i i thought so you know i would say no less than definitely no less than five i think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then theres probably something going on with the wood uh   uhhuh   i dont know uh that thats my impression people dont do the outsides as often i know in this neighborhood it seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted and that was the the first time for most people   but thats just trim right   uh yeah trim yeah the aluminum doesnt need to be painted but yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first time and that was five years   yeah right uhhuh   uh course the first original coat was so bad that maybe five years even wouldnt have been necessary if it had been done correctly the first time you know   right   uh interior i dont know i have known people that every about every two years they they redo their paint and i guess a lot of the the drywall in these houses soaks so much of the paint in   oh okay okay   and uh maybe in a older plastered house this wouldnt uh this would be too often but i think i think with the drywall they use now the plaster board really seems to soak in the paint   um   so im not im not sure two years would be too often i dont want to do it that often   i know i was going to say what a mess   no no i dont want to its a thats one of the things i dont enjoy painting that much i guess uh its okay for a while but i find it gets it gets uh boring or tiring pretty quickly  so yeah   right right yeah well very good   yeah yeah   but   so   small world   uh well yeah oh right  thats really   anyway so uh and then youre pleased with your your jobs once youre done   yeah yeah   i mean you dont feel you should have paid somebody to do the same job you did anyway   no no no not at all i i i think that uh what uh the the work that ive done thats one reason i do it uh if if i really felt that it was going to be a sloppy job and i was sorry you afterward the way it looks i wouldnt attempt to take it on but uh there are a few tricks you know that you learn to use and ive found that uh the one sided paper type of tape that peels off is is just excellent i used to i used to try to edge when as id get up toward the ceilings and i found thats really impossible to do but when you use the the one edge paper uh it it really makes a nice neat job You know you let the paint dry for about a half an hour an hour and peel it off and its a perfect clean line and and ive found that it can also be used uh well like ive gone back and ive painted after wallpaper has been put up around crown moldings and things like that and again the tape really comes in handy you just cover up anything you dont want paint to get on and paint and take it off and sometimes you can even reuse the tape it just peels off like those notepads type of thing   but this isnt masking tape   no its not a masking tape its its about uh you can get it in different widths id say the most narrow is about two inches and it gets about as wide as four inches the glue on it is not across the whole thing its only across the top much like the yellow pads that you peel off   oh uhhuh   and it just comes in big rolls and so if youre doing you dont want to get paint on the ceiling for example say you want the ceiling a different color  you roll this tape all along the length of the room you paint right up against it you can even get it on the tape itself and then whenever the paint is dry most interior paints seem like theyre dry within a a half an hour an hour you just peel this tape off and its enough that enough glue or whatever is on it that it it stays while youre painting but it doesnt do any damage to paint or wallpaper thats underneath it   oh great   so its really good uh you know ive put it up along the uh well ive had borders up near the ceiling in the living room ive put the tape along there and then painted the crown molding and it didnt didnt do any damage to the wallpaper   uhhuh oh great   uh so thats you know so i think there are a few little things uh different size brushes good brushes i guess a lot of people make the mistake ive found good brushes make a big difference   do you ever use these pads   uh   i pad the paint on   oh ive had yes ive used those and i like those actually they cover a lot more area   yeah   and theyre not as  you dont get drips as well you can get drips you have to be a little careful but they hold quite a bit of paint so i found youre not constantly dipping like with a brush   right yeah right   and uh it goes on very nice and evenly like sometimes with brushes you can sort of see streaks if you get it too thick and you dont have splatters like with a roller   yeah umhum umhum   so i do i do like those and sometimes i guess if youre good at it you could uh you could use it to inch up towards ceilings and things like that although ive never been  that good at doing that ive found that the tape works best for me   right now even with tape i think i was just thinking of using the pads instead of a brush but for ceilings i did try it and  and uh i got a lot of paint on the kitchen table i was trying to to just patch the the kitchen ceiling there yeah and so i have to learn how to use pads but i have a friend in Syracuse who who paints everything with pads and she does ceilings   oh is that right uhhuh   so im going to have to ask her what the trick is shell probably say hire me to come down and do it   yeah yeah yeah well i dont yeah thats right i dont i dont know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that       you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably arent going to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if youre doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh   right   and i havent tried that but thats an idea because i find that ceilings are really difficult in terms of how you have to be positioned to do them and your arms are up so  its tiring uh     right right thats why i want to do the kitchen first i figure i can stand on the kitchen table   yeah thats true uh so have you been happy with the painting that youve done or do you wish that you you had hired a professional or     no i im happy with it but i just dont do it very often or very much because its so time consuming and because i am tend to be a perfectionist about it   right   and you know what i figure is first i have to scrub the walls   yeah yeah   and i mean if you hire a painter they dont do that just   right what does scrubbing is that just is that to get smudges off so they   no to
