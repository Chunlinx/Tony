                    Introduction        Osteoarthritis OA of the hip is a frequent source of        functional disability and pain in people over the age of         years While the disease is generally assumed to be age        related there is evidence that health risk behaviors that        might be potentially modifiable are involved in its        development    Despite some evidence linking        overweight and hip OA      this finding is        equivocal and has previously been documented mainly in        small studies of relatively young people usually in the        absence of radiographic evidence           The specific objective of this study was to examine        whether excess body weight a health risk that is        potentially amenable to intervention might be associated        with hip OA We hypothesized that because of a history of        sedentarity pain andor a high prevalence of        cardiovascular comorbidities patients diagnosed as having        clinical and radiographic hip OA would tend to be        overweight or obese rather than underweight or of normal        weight We further expected that if weight is implicated in        producing damage at the hip joint the prevalence of high        body mass indices BMIs might be higher in patients with        hip OA than in the general population Finally because        infection or prosthetic loosening after hip replacement        might be weightrelated we sought to explore whether        individuals requiring either prosthetic removal or        reimplantation surgery are overweight or obese                    Methods        The presurgical BMIs of  males and females ranging        in age from  to  years and who had been diagnosed        clinically and radiographically as having moderate to        severe endstage unilateral or bilateral hip OA were        calculated from the appropriate height and weight data        found recorded in their complete medical records The        severity of the patients condition was determined by their        Kellgren grades on radiographs and by the Hospital for        Special Surgery Hip Scoring System which includes an        assessment of pain walking status muscle power and        overall function using a point scale for each        parameter Patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis        systemic lupus erythematosus juvenile rheumatoid        arthritis psoriatic arthritis Lyme disease septic        arthritis and traumatic arthritis were excluded        These data which were available for the majority of        patients undergoing arthroplasty of one or both hip joints        between January  and October   were collected        systematically along with pertinent demographic and        clinical data by checking the hospital admissions at least        three times a week Excluded were patients for whom all        data were not available The single hospital population        sampled was at the Hospital for Special Surgery a        worldrenowned orthopedic hospital treating difficult cases        of OA as well as standard cases of the disease from all        states of North America and all boroughs of New York city        The BMI data were categorized according to the United        States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC        guidelines of    and entered systematically        onto a spreadsheet for purposes of primary analysis        Patients were classified as underweight if their BMI was         kgm  of normal weight if it was  kgm         overweight if it was  kgm and obese if it was          kgm  Additional BMI data required for comparison        purposes were obtained from currently available        populationbased estimates of BMIs in the American adult        population     and from  agematched patients of        both genders without symptomatic hip osteoarthritis who        were hospitalized concurrently        After the data had been coded and categorized according        to gender laterality and surgicalprocedure requirements        the BMI data were stratified and analyzed with respect to        one of eight age groups                years Statistical analyses were        performed using SPSS Version  software                    Results                  Patient characteristics          Of the  subjects studied  were females and           were males with an average age of    years          Ninetythree percent were white and  were either black          Hispanic or of Middle Eastern ancestry Over  had          evidence of a preexisting medical condition and the           cases requiring bilateral hip surgery were younger on          average with a mean age of    years than          those undergoing other procedures            P   The patients age at          symptomatic onset of their disease ranged from  months          to  years Their overall impairment level was          indicative of a cohort with mild or moderate functional          impairments requiring use of a walking aid in  of the          cases There were none that could be classified as having          normal physical function without impairment There were          also none that could be defined as having serious          impairment such as being bedridden or aphasic                          BMI distributions          BMIs indicative of overweight or obesity were recorded          for almost  of all patients in the cases surveyed          while only  were classified as underweight In contrast          to ageadjusted population data for adults aged  of          whom  are considered obese   approximately  of          the patient sample we studied were obese The percentage          of patients classified as overweight was also higher than          the current prevalence of overweight in the adult          population approximately             The patients with hip OA in our study also had higher          BMIs than those of  hospitalized patients with hip          fracture  patients without any symptomatic hip problem          who had an average BMI of   patients without any          symptomatic hip problem who had an average BMI of  or           patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had a mean BMI          of                           Age associations          BMIs indicated that each age group was on average          overweight or obese except for age groups  and           years where BMIs were    and             respectively As shown in Fig  the highest percentage          of overweight or obese patients was found in the age          ranges  and  years the average age at which          hip OA is generally expected to occur in any population          However although individuals in these age groups were          also categorized as being obese more often than older          patients or those  years of age the year age          group contained the highest percentage of obese patients          of all            P   and their average BMI             kgm  was very close to the definition of          obesity                          Gender associations          Males had higher mean BMIs than females in all age          groups except  years Analysis according to weight          categories showed that more males than females were          overweight or obese in all categories except the morbidly          obese BMI  kgm  where there were  more          females than males Among all the patients with hip OA a          smaller percentage of males than of females were          categorized as having normal BMIs or as being          underweight                          Comparative data          Similar BMI values were found for patients undergoing          unilateral and bilateral hip replacement and revision          surgery However the patients with leftsided lesions          tended to be heavier than those with rightsided lesions          As Table shows those who had comorbidities including          cardiac disease hypertension and diabetes were heavier          than those with no comorbid disease history          Twentyseven patients with unilateral infected          prostheses that required prosthetic removal plus an          additional  patients  with unilateral disease who          were undergoing reimplantation surgery because of          uncontrolled infection had higher BMIs than those of the          other hospitalized patients with hip OA            P   One of the removed          prostheses was a replacement following a previous          removal postinfection in  in a yearold white man          with a BMI of  and a history of diabetes and atrial          fibrillation                          Patients with complications          Of the subgroup of patients who required either          removal or reimplantation of a prosthesis males were          rehospitalized at twice the rate of females and as a          group were heavier on average with a mean BMI of             kgm  versus    kgm for the females The          males were also younger mean age    years          than the females requiring the same procedure mean age             years At ages  years an age range not          implicitly associated with the presence of degenerative          disease of the hip  patients had evidence of a prior          comorbid disease history Of these four required          surgical revision and one required reimplantation          surgery          Regression analysis showed that of age side type of          surgical procedure unilateral or bilateral joint          replacement revision debridement relocation or          reimplantation and gender the only significant          predictor of BMI was surgery type            P                              Discussion        Our most important finding was that at least twothirds        of the patients in our sample were overweight at the time        of their surgery This figure is higher than that recorded        among men ages  years in the National Health and        Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES III sample in which         had a BMI of  kgm or higher   The high BMIs        recorded for those in the  year age range mean for        females  kgm and for males  kgm  were very        similar to those deemed by Heliovaara         et al   and Roach         et al   to increase the risk of        developing hip OA        Furthermore the high BMIs which are rough indicators        of fatness were observed to a similar extent with respect        to both unilateral and bilateral cases of hip OA This is        noteworthy because according to the NHANES findings of        Tepper and Hochberg   and a related study by Nevitt         et al   obesity is associated        more strongly with bilateral than with unilateral hip OA          Our findings are also interesting in light of the        casecontrol study by Vingrd   of  men with BMIs        greater than the mean   SD for the general population        that study did show an increased risk of developing severe        hip OA in these individuals than in individuals with a BMI        less than the mean   SD Those slightly obese at  years        of age had a relative risk of  for later surgery of the        hip Although Hartz         et al   found OA of the hips was        significantly associated with obesity only in white females        and nonwhite males  of the our study group comprised        white males a group noted by Kellgren and Lawrence to be        at risk for OA of the hips   Overall the percentage        of patients with hip OA who had BMIs in the overweight or        obese range was higher than those BMIs reported for        American adults in general   In our study almost        twice as many young adults  years of age with hip OA        an age when significant hip OA is relatively uncommon        were obese or overweight relative to national standards            While these population standards are subject to        error and may not be representative of our patients because        of sociodemographic and other factors we observed that        nonosteoarthritic adults of similar ages had lower BMIs on        average than those with OA of the hip in the context of the        same hospital site and study time period        While having hip OA could lead to obesity and while        overweight and hip OA may not be related and hip OA may not        occur in all populations to the same extent    it        is possible that cumulative exposure to excessive body mass        may increase the risk of subsequently developing hip OA           and the worsening of the disease             This could occur through either metabolic or mechanical        mechanisms or both and these mechanisms could prevail to        differing degrees in susceptible males and females        Although with rare exceptions no independent relation has        been found to exist between metabolic correlates of obesity        and the presence of knee OA    the same relation may        not apply to the hip joint   It has also been shown        recently that those who have high BMIs are likely to have        decreased hip joint rotation and lower strength capacity as        a consequence of obesity    and this may        detrimentally affect the loading patterns at the hip joint        by fostering the repetitive application of greater axial        loads than the hip joint can accommodate           Our study design and data analyses do not permit us to        discern what the initiating factor causing the patients        hip OA was or whether having hip OA may lead to pain and a        sedentary lifestyle Moreover we cannot determine whether        a subsequently increased BMI is more important than other        factors in increasing the risk of hip OA However studies        of the effects of body mass on avian degenerative joint        disease which shares common pathologies with human        degenerative disease have clearly shown that OA can be        mediated by body mass   That the majority of patients        who required prosthetic reimplantation had high BMIs may        indicate an association between being overweight and a poor        postsurgical prognosis   This observation is further        supported by the study of Stickles         et al   who observed an        association between BMI and problems climbing stairs  year        after total joint arthroplasty There is also a weak        association between pain in the hip and BMI   and        evidence that body weight and BMI are significant        predictors of the onset of OA of the hip   That        prosthetic removals were warranted for a greater proportion        of males than females in our study even though males        constituted a smaller proportion of the study sample as a        whole          P   may imply the existence        of different pathogenic processes for males and females        The finding that more obese males under the age of         sustained postoperative infections than females suggests        that obese males with hip OA under the age of  years may        be especially vulnerable to postoperative infection and may        therefore have a poor prognosis        Because we did not obtain serial measurements in this        study the high BMIs observed for a large percentage of the        hip arthritis patients cannot be deemed causative of the        disease process Conversely we have no evidence that hip        OA led to the presence of high BMIs in our study sample        Yet the possible influence of high BMIs in mediating        postoperative hip infections and further hip OA disability        cannot be ignored Our data suggest that we should not        exclude the possibility that the proclivity to be inactive        together with high body masses that produce increased joint        loading may have resulted in the premature hospitalization        of the yearolds in this sample Approximately  of        the cases we studied had medical evidence of longstanding        cardiovascular insufficiencies and other comorbidities such        as hypertension        Finally although frame size muscularity fat        distribution and the changes of aging may all be reasons        for persons being classified as having a high BMI as might        the factor of height   the implications of our data        for preventing hip joint disease should not be overlooked        Although the measure of BMI is not an ideal measure and        does not reflect the distribution of obesity at all        adequately it remains the preferred measure of fatness for        epidemiological studies   Our conclusion that body        mass may influence the etiopathogenesis of hip OA is also        supported by the work of others                      Although not without limitations our data provide        additional support for the view that symptomatic unilateral        and bilateral hip OA is associated with an increased BMI        especially between the ages of  and  years Patients        with postprosthesis complications may also have increased        BMIs This suggests that interventions to prevent        overweight early in adulthood may mitigate the magnitude        and prevalence of hip OA and its related disability        Longitudinal analyses of larger samples to confirm the        present findings and to test the above hypothesis are        warranted                    Abbreviations        BMI  body mass index CDC
