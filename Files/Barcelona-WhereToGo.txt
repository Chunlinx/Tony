Where to GoBarcelona is best approached by neighborhood or perhaps theme You can set out to see the Gothic Quarter Montjuc hill or the waterfront or you can create a greatesthits tour of Gaud and his fellow Modernista architects Its tempting to try to sandwich everything into just a couple of days but be sure to leave time in your schedule to get sidetracked in a colorful food market or an alley of antiques shops or to peek in a quiet courtyard Take a breather as Barcelonans do sinking into a chair at a sidewalk table to linger over a drink and snack read a newspaper and peoplewatch In the old town where many streets are too narrow for cars and a slow pace is amply rewarded with the discovery of hidden treasures the best way to travel is on foot Each district of the old quarterBarri Gtic La Ribera Las Ramblasand the Eixample district can be covered as a walking tour For sights farther afield including Montjuc Barceloneta and the waterfront Tibidabo and two of the top Gaud attractions La Sagrada Familia and Parque Gull its best to make use of Barcelonas excellent public transportation networkclean and efficient metro trains subway modern buses funiculars and cable carsas well as plenty of inexpensive taxis see Public Transportation p  A good map is essential but its easy to be fooled by how near things look on paper La RamblaTo call La Rambla a mere street is to do it woeful injustice Barcelonas most famous boulevardenergetic artistic democratic and indulgentis an intoxicating parade of humanity Youll no doubt want to sample it several times during your stay maybe even several times a day in Barcelona It is most crowded just before the lunch hour and in the early evening on weekdays and at dusk on weekends though it is never deserted In the wee wee hours its populated by a sometimes motley mix of earlymorning newspaper sellers streetsweepers and bar hounds stumbling back to their apartments and hotels The broad treeshaded and pedestrianonly promenade stretches nearly  km  mile down a gentle incline from the citys hub Plaa de Catalunya see page  to the waterfront La Rambla takes its name from an Arabic word meaning a sandy dry river bed It was a shallow gully until the th century when Barcelona families began to construct homes nearby As the area became more populated the stream was soon paved over To the north of Las Ramblas left as you walk down it is the old city Ciutat Vella to the south or right is El Raval The five sections of La Rambla change in character as they do in name as you stroll along The short Rambla de Canaletes at the top is where crowds pour in from the Plaa de Catalunya or emerge from the metro and train stations beneath On Sundays and Mondays in season youll find rambunctious knots of fans replaying the games of Bara the popular name for Barcelonas beloved football soccer club Barcelona FC if an important match has just been won look out Elderly denizens relax on metal chairs for which you are supposed to pay and watch the passing parade Here too begin the stalls where you can buy a diverse stock of foreign newspapers and magazines as well as books a reflection of Barcelonas status as Spains center of publishing Youll also see the first of La Ramblas celebrated mimes or human statues portraying Christopher Columbus priests bearded nuns and Roman soldiers among many other guisesNext up is Rambla dels Estudis popularly called Rambla dels Ocells of birds because here the boulevard narrows to become an outdoor aviary where winged creatures of all descriptions are sold When the vendors leave at the end of the day their cagelined stalls are folded and shut like wardrobes with the birds rustling about inside Birds give way to flowers in the Rambla de les Flors officially called the Rambla de Sant Josep People flock here on  April the feast day of Barcelonas patron saint Sant Jordi St George celebrated as Day of the Book A woman traditionally gives her man a book and a man gives a women a roseboth of which are available in abundance along La Rambla Keep an eye peeled on the right side of the road for the delectable modernista pastry shop Escrib Antiga Casa Figueres its fanciful swirls on the outside a match for the delicacies withinFacing the lane of Flowers is the elegant Palau de la Virreina a palace completed in  for the widow of the viceroy of colonial Peru At street level is a branch of the citys Department of Culture where tickets to municipal concerts are sold or offered and information about museums and current exhibitions is available The palace holds a museum with rotating contemporary art exhibits Set back from the street is one of La Ramblas great attractions and a constant in the life of Barcelonans the Mercat de Sant Josep also called La Boquera This thcentury covered market is an overflowing cornucopia of delights for the senses fresh fish meats sausages fruits and vegetables and all kinds of spices neatly braided ropes of garlic sundried tomatoes and peppers preserves and sweetmeats to make a gourmand swoon La Boqueria is also a startlingly vibrant community where shoppers and merchants greet each other by name ribald sallies across the aisles set off gales of laughter and the freshness of the rape an angler fish popular in Catalonia is debated with the passion of a traffic mishap The huge market is laid out under highceilinged ironwork naves like a railway station Restaurants in and near the market are like firstaid stations for those who become faint with hunger at the sight of such bounty The market opens before dawn but closes down by late afternoon The best time to visit is when practiced shoppers do In the morningThe heart of the Ramblas is nearby at the Pla de la Boquera a busy intersection near the Liceu metro station paved with an unmistakable Joan Mir mosaic Here stands one of Europes great opera houses the Gran Teatre del Liceu inaugurated in  The Catalan opera greats Montserrat Caball and Josep Carreras made their reputations singing at this Liceu a monument of the Catalan Renaissance and refuge of the Catalan elite The opera house was gutted by a terrible fire in  the third it has suffered forcing its closing After a stunning restoration project that preserved the soul of the historic theater while adding technological improvements to equip this magnificent opera house for the st century the Liceu reopened in  Directly across the Rambla is the venerable Caf de lOpera a handsome oldworld caf thats always bursting with boisterous patrons Its a good spot for refreshment before you push on down the next stretch the Rambla dels Caputxins This Ramblas demeanor like the incline proceeds downhill after the Liceu but the streetentertainment factor rises in inverse proportion Youll wade your way through jugglers fireeaters tarotcard readers lotteryticket sellers more mimes mendicants and many artists rapidly knocking out portraits caricatures and chalk masterwork reproductions on the pavement On the right side of La Rambla is the old Hotel Oriente which preserves part of the th century cloister of a Franciscan school inside Note the nave painted angels floating over the doorway at Hemingways favorite Barcelona lodging Just beyond the hotel on the carrer Nou de la Rambla  is Palau Gell the mansion Gaud see page  built in  for his principal patron the textile tycoon Count Eusebi Gell This meticulously detailed fortresslike home a study in high Gothic is now open for guided tours Visitors get to see the fabulously tiled rooftop chimneys which were hidden from view for decadesReturning to the Ramblas cross over and follow the short passage that leads into the arcaded Plaa Reial This handsome and spacious square is graced with a fountain palm trees and wroughtiron lampposts designed by the young Gaud Like the Boquera the Hotel Oriente and other Rambla landmarks this square came into being as a result of the destruction of a convent when church properties were expropriated in an anticlerical period in the midth century Not long ago it was the stomping grounds of junkies and petty thieves but it has been since revitalized and is flush with bars cafs and restaurantsThe final promenade leading down to the harbor is the short Rambla de Santa Mnica beginning at the Plaa del Teatre site of the rundown Teatre Principal Though the Centre dArt Santa Mnica puts on fine contemporary art exhibits the area continues to be the beat of prostitutes and cops pickpockets and bagsnatchers The warren of alleys to the right is the oncenotorious Barri Xino or Chinatown With the new openness of the postFranco era it has lost much of its seedy interest but its still not the best place for a midnight stroll Carrer dels Escudellers a busy pedestrian street on the other side of the Rambla is the gateway to a district of cabarets bars flamenco shows and restaurants and the delights of the Gothic Quarter Nearer the port a passage leads to the Museu de Cera Wax Museum a tourist trap with a collection of some three hundred realistic wax effigies The Rambla ends at the broad open space facing the Monument  Colom a statue honoring the discoverer Christopher Columbus Colom in Catalan that can be climbed for good views of the port Poor Columbus is supposed to be indicating the way to the riches of the New World but hes actually pointing at Mallorca or perhaps North Africa Just beyond the statue is Barcelonas newly revitalized waterfrontBarri GticFrom its beginnings more than two thousand years ago Barcelona has grown outwards in rings like concentric ripples on a pond The ancient core is a hill the Romans called Mons Taber where they raised a temple to Augustus Caesar and in the fourth century ad built high walls about a mile around to protect their settlement This is the nucleus of the medieval district called the Barri Gtic While much of it is not technically Gothic it is a remarkable concentration of medieval palaces convents and churchesThe best place to begin a tour of the quarter is the CatedralBarcelonas superb cathedral which is the neighborhoods major site and focal point The cathedral was begun in  on the site of earlier churches going back to Visigothic times The final touchthe rather florid Gothic faadewas not completed until the end of the th century and thus contrasts with the simple octagonal towers The ribs of the cathedrals high vault are joined at carved and painted keystone medallions a typically Catalan feature In the center of the nave is a splendid Gothic choir with lacy spires of carved wood Above these are the heraldic emblems of the European kings and princes invited by Charles V to be members of his exclusive Order of the Golden Fleece Toison dOr The first and only meeting was held in the cathedral in  The seats reserved for Henry VIII of England and Franois I of France are next to the emperors but they didnt bother to comeConnected to the choir is a pulpit with an exceptional wroughtiron stair rail Ahead steps under the altar lead to the alabaster tomb of Santa Eullia one of the citys two patron saints martyred in the fourth century On the wall of the right aisle are the tombs of Count Ramn Berenguer I and his wife Almodis who founded the earlier cathedral on this spot in each was apparently very short Dont miss the Catalan Gothic altarpieces in the chapels behind the altar the nine panels of the Transfiguration painted for the San Benito chapel in the th century by Bernat Martorell are considered his masterpieceThe leafy cloister is a lively refuge with birds fluttering among the orange magnolia and palm trees that entirely fill its center Watch where you walk as the cloister is paved with tombstones badly worn but many still bearing the emblems of the bootmakers tailors and other craft guilds whose wealth helped pay for the cathedral From the cloister pass to the Capella de Santa Llcia a chapel with th and thcentury tombstones on the floor and a monument to a crusader knight in armor on one wall Leaving the chapel by its front entrance turn left at carrer del Bisbe Irurita The corner house at Number  was until recently the official residence of the president of the Generalitat Train your eyes upwards as you walk through the old town to take in the details eg a curious hanging sign a lantern or an unusual sculpture On the right youll find a row of gargoyles leaning from the roof of the Palau de la Generalitat the seat of government for the Autonomous Region of Catalonia and a richly ornamented gateway The lacy overhead bridge is Gothic only in style its actually a  additionJust ahead is the spacious serious Plaa de Sant Jaume the heart of the Barri Gtic A local joke says that the farthest distance in Barcelona is across this square which separates the often antagonistic and conservative Generalitat from the more progressive municipal authorities in the Ajuntament City Hall Architecturally though the two buildings make a harmonious pair both have classical faades that hide their Gothic origins To visit either building youll need luck and planning the Generalitat can only be visited on  April Day of St George and the Ajuntament only with an organized group and by appointment see page The Palau de la Generalitat on the north side of the square closer to the Cathedral is the more interesting of the palaces This institution dates from  when it was made the executive branch reporting to the parliament the Corts of Catalanes The nucleus of the present building is the main patiopure Catalan Gothic with an open staircase leading to a gallery of arches on slender pillars The buildings star feature is the flamboyant Gothic faade of the Capella de Sant Jordi The Sal de Sant Jordi theres no escaping St George here a large vaulted hall in the thcentury front block of the building is lined with modern murals of historical scenes The Ajuntament or Casa de la Ciutat across the plaza has held Barcelonas city hall since  It was here that the Consell de Cent a council of  notable citizens met to deal with civic affairs under the watchful eyes of the king The original entrance can be seen around the left corner of the building on the carrer de la Ciutat Inside the left staircase leads to the upper gallery of the old courtyard and to the Sal de Cent Hall of the One Hundred Its high ceiling resembles the barrelvault of the Sal del Tinell and was built at about the same time in the th century The redandyellow bars of Catalonias flag decorate the walls The hall where the city council now meets adjoins and at the head of the black marble staircase is the Sal de les Crniques Hall of the Chronicles noted for the modern murals in sepia tones by Josep Maria Sert From behind the Ajuntament take the short carrer dHrcules to the Plaa de Sant Just for a quick peek at the church of Sants Just i Pastor and the small charming quiet square it sits on evocative of a bygone Barcelona The church is one of the oldest in the city though often remodeled It is said that any will to which one swears before the churchs altar is recognized as valid by the courts of Barcelona a practice that dates to the tenth centuryHeading back to Plaa de Sant Jaume turn right on carrer de la Llibreteria a small street lined with pastry shops and one of Barcelonas oldest tiniest and coolest coffee shops El Mesn del Caf A couple of blocks down on the left on Plaa del Rei sn is the Museu dHistria de la Ciutat City History Museum The building is a Gothic mansion that was moved stone by stone to this location The chief attraction is in the basement where excavations have uncovered the foundations including sculptures walls a bathing pool and cemeteries filled with the Romans and Visigoths who once inhabited the city On upper floors are maps of the Catalan empire the original plans for the th century expansion of the city that created the Eixample district and other historical documents and artifacts Visitors can also see a minute virtual history multimedia film about BarcinoBarcelonaFrom the museum it is a step to the gorgeously austere Plaa del Rei the courtyard of the Palau Reial Royal Palace which is dominated by the manyarched lookout tower of King Martin and atop the Roman walls the Capella de Santa gata Chapel of St Agatha Both can be visited as part of the Muesu dHistriaThe chapel is notable for the th century altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi by one of Catalonias finest artists Jaume Huguet In the courtyard the structure with the broad staircase is all that is left of the original Royal Palace of Catalonia begun in the tenth century and added to over the years until it took up three sides of the square and extended to the rear During the Inquisition suspected heretics were burned at the stake in this enclosure and here Ferdinand and Isabella received Columbus in  on his return from his first voyage Columbus probably gave his report in the Sal del Tinell This vast barrelvaulted hall was built for royal audiences in  and on occasion the Catalan Corts Parliament met here The palaces central section chapel and hall were reconstructed between  and  Outdoor theater and concerts are held in the square in summer A former wing of the palace which encloses the Plaa del Rei was rebuilt in  to become the Palau del Lloctinent Palace of the Lieutenant residence of the kings representative It now houses the Archives of Aragn The entrance reached by leaving the palace square and turning right on the carrer dels Comtes is an elegant patio with a noble staircase and remarkable carved wooden ceiling Just beyond flanking the cathedral is the Museu Frederic Mars Mars a thcentury sculptor of civic statues was a compulsive collector who bequeathed to Barcelona an unusually idiosyncratic collection of art and well miscellany The lower floors of the museum are stocked with Iberian votive figurines Limoges enamel boxes and religious sculptures from the th to th centuries Youll also find Portuguese carved ox yokes a roomful of iron keys old sewing machines canes windup toysin short an endless catalogue of art and artifacts There is even the suitcase covered with travel stickers which Mars used to cart home his lootRetracing your steps on the narrow street flanking the cathedral circle around to the rear and duck into the narrow carrer del Parads Here just inside the doorway of the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya four columns of the Roman Temple of Augustus are embedded in the wallBehind the Royal Palace off carrer Tapineria is Plaa de Berenguer el Gran which has a wellpreserved section of the original Roman wall The Roman defenses were  meters  feet high and  meters  feet thick and were marked at intervals by towers  meters  feet tall Until  most of this section was covered by a clutter of old houses which were dismantled and relocated to restore the walls and old mansions to viewSince ancient times when two main Roman thoroughfares intersected at the Plaa de Sant Jaume this has been the crossroads of Barcelona Streets radiate in all directions each an invitation to explore the Barri Gtic The carrer del Call leads into the labyrinth of narrow streets that was the Call or Jewish Quarter until the Jews were expelled in  Today the quarter is a bustling corner of antiques shops and dealers of rare books plus bars and restaurants frequented by antiquarians and artists Although many of the streets retain the word Call in their names there are few vestiges left of the ghetto which once was surrounded by a wall Barcelonas Jews though noted as doctors scholars and jewelers and despite their financing of the conquests of the crown were confined to this district and forced to wear longhooded cloaks with a yellow headband Taxation of the community was a special source of royal income This did not however save the Call from being burned and looted as persecution mounted in the th and th centuries Just off the carrer del Call at carrer de Marlet  a medieval inscription in Hebrew marks the site of a hospital founded by one Rabbi Samuel Hassareri may his life never ceaseNearby is the Baixada de Santa Eullia Just off the street is Plaa de Sant Felip Neri a tiny and silent square closed to traffic silent except when the nearby school holds recess here The saints church was pockmarked by Italian bombs during the Civil War though others maintain that firing squads performed executions here The Baixada de Santa Eullia descends to carrer dels Banys Nous named for the longgone new baths of the ghetto erected in the th century This winding street which more or less follows the line of the old Roman wall is the unofficial boundary of the Barri Gtic It is also known as the carrer dels antiquaristhe headquarters of antiques dealers As you walk along keep your eyes peeled for unusual handpainted shop signs the fretwork of Gothic windows and dusty treasures in the antiques shop windows Youll see the old tile signs with a cart symbol high in the walls at some corners the indication of oneway streets Around the corner is a trio of impossibly pretty plazas Plaa de Sant Josep Oriol adjoins Plaa del Pi on which sits Santa Mara del Pi a handsome church with a tall octagonal bell tower and a harmonious faade pierced by a large thcentury rose window Pi means pine tree and there is a small specimen here replacing one that was a landmark in past centuries Buildings in the Plaa del Pi show off the sgrafitto technique of scraping designs in colored plaster imported from Italy in the early s Barcelonas emerging merchant class favored such faades as an inexpensive substitute for the sculpture that was found in aristocratic palaces These two adjoining squares together with the small Placeta del Pi to the rear of the church are the essence of old Barcelona and a great place to while away the hours The bars with tables spread out under leafy trees in each of the squares are magnets for young people and travelers who are entertained by roving musicians On Sundays artists offer their canvases for sale in Plaa de Sant Josep OriolThe street that leads north from Plaa del Pi carrer Petritxol is one of the Barri Gtics most traditional The narrow passageway is lined with art galleries framing shops and traditional granjasgood stops for pastries and hot chocolate Barcelonas oldest and most famous art gallery is here Sala Pars At carrer Portaferrisa a left will take you to La Rambla while a right turn will take you back near the Cathedral and a handful of additional sights on the perimeter of the Barri Gtic You could also return to Plaa de Sant Josep Oriol and take carrer de la Palla At Plaa Nova near the cathedral is the modern Collegi dArquitectes College of Architects Picasso etched the graffitilike drawings of the Three Kings and the children bearing palm branches on the modern faade The busy pedestrian thoroughfare that leads north to Plaa de Catalunya is Avda Portal dAngel one of the citys main shopping streets When there are rebaixas or sales happening wading through the crowds here is no easy task Look for the small street carrer Montsi which leads to Els Quatre Gats The Four Cats a bar and restaurant that became famous when Picasso and a group of young bohemian intellectualsthe painters Ramn Casas and Santiago Rusiol among thembegan hanging out here Picasso had his first public exhibition here in  and the bar one of the first commissions for the modernista architect Puig i Cadafalch preserves its turnofthecentury ambience La RiberaSome of the most beautiful Gothic architecture and most fascinating medieval corners of Barcelona actually lie just outside the Barri Gtic To the east of the Via Laietanaa busy avenue roughly parallel to the Ramblas cut through the old city in  to link the port with the modern centerand below the carrer de la Princesa which intersects it at midpoint is the atmospheric quarter called La Ribera Here youll find both the Museu Picasso and the majestic church of Santa Mara del Mar Carrer Argenteria once the avenue to the sea from the Royal Palace cuts a diagonal swath from Plaa de lAngel to the church Begun in  at the height of Catalonias expansion as a Mediterranean power Santa Mara del Mar is the greatest example of pure Catalan Gothic with unadorned exterior walls a flat roof sober faade flanked by two threetiered octagonal bell towers and a large rose window over the portal The dimensions and extraordinary austerity of the interior are breathtaking Fires set during the rioting of  at the outbreak of the Civil War tragically consumed all the trappings of chapels choir and altar leaving the interior stripped to its essence The result is a capacious lofty hall suffused with soft light from the stainedglass windows Three tall naves are supported by slim octagonal columns set  meters  feet apart and the dimensions of the interior are multiples of this distance achieving a perfect symmetry Behind the simple modern altar the columns branch high overhead into the arched vaulting of the apse The acoustics are excellent best measured by frequent concerts in the church and the voices of choirboys at massThe rear door of the church leads to the Passeig del Born a rusticlooking plaza where jousts were held in the Middle Ages and fairs and festivals take place today Many of the little streets surrounding the church are named for the craftsmen who once had their shops here or their products Sombrerers hatmakers Mirallers mirrormakers Espartera makers of ropesoled shoes and Espasera swordmakers Today the area is better known for the merrymakers who swarm its bars late into the night and spill out onto the streets disgruntled residents hang signs from their windows pleading with the municipal government to impose quiet hours One of Barcelonas grandest medieval streets Carrer Montcada populated by aristocrats from the th to the th centuries is lined with Gothic palaces each with an imposing door or arched gate to an inner court where an ornamental staircase usually led up to reception rooms These mansions were gradually abandoned after the demolition of the adjoining district and construction of the Ciutadella fortress The quarter around Santa Mara del Mar decayed gently without interference leaving it the most authentically medieval part of the cityThe Museu Picasso recently enlarged in grand fashion is housed in the Palau Aguilar a thcentury mansion It and the Palau Castellet nextdoor were acquired by the city to house the collection of paintings drawings and ceramics donated by Picassos lifelong friend and secretary Jaume Sabarts Three more Moncada palaces have been added to the Picasso stable they will hold temporary exhibitions After the museum opened in  Picasso added sketches and paintings from his childhood and youth as well as the famous  variations on the theme of Las Meninas the Velzquez masterpiece in Madrids Prado Museum Barcelonas collection is the largest outside Paris where Picasso lived and became an international superstar after leaving BarcelonaThe earliest works date from Picassos ninth year As a teenagerhe produced large canvases in the moralizing thcentury realist manner such as the First Communion and Science and Charity It appears that as Picassos talent developed he digested the styles of the past and of his contemporaries proved he could equal them then forged energetically ahead into the future Though the museum doesnt possess any of the masters finest works it does have two good examples of his Blue Period  as well as The Harlequin  and the idiosyncratic Las Meninas series which provides a fascinating view of Picassos innovative and deconstructivist approach to his subject Across the street is the Museu Txtil i de la Indumentria Textile and Costume Museum in the former palace of the Marqueses de Lli The collection brings to life the elegance enjoyed by the rich families who occupied the Montcada mansions The costumes on display are of superb silks satins and furs embroidered and stitched to perfection Styles represented reach all the way to the flapper dresses of the sThe Museu BarbierMueller in a thcentury palace at Montcada  houses an interesting collection of preColombian art All of the mansions along

appropriately Baroque Space Between neighborhoods up via Laeitana several blocks from carrer Princesa is one of the citys greatest achievements of modernista architecture Palau de la Msica Catalana on Sant Francesc de Paula  The Palace of Catalan Music by Llus Domnech i Montaner may be the perfect albeit chaotic expression of modernisme It is an explosion of mosaics tiles stained glass enamel sculpture and carvinga wildly audacious outpouring of contours and colors The brick exterior with Moorish arches and columns inlaid with floral tile designs is sober compared to whats inside Even though every square inch is embellished right down to the tiles underfoot somehow the hall isnt overpowering or claustrophobic One of Domnechs main concerns was to let in as much natural light as possible and the hall is indeed light and roomy The structural skeleton is ironan innovation in those dayswhich allows the walls to be of glass Sunlight streaming in during afternoon concerts sets the place on fire On either side of the orchestras stage the rich colors of the room are offset by two wildly sculpted groups of musical masters in white plaster Between these fevered creations of the sculptor Pau Gargallo Picassos friend the silvery pipes of a grand organ stand in orderly contrastOverhead is the Palaus crowning glory a magical stained glass orb Behind the musicians a curved wall is covered with mosaics of muses playing instruments from bagpipes to castanets Their upper bodies are made of porcelain and seem to emerge magically from the walls If this all sounds like the recipe for nausea you simply have to see it to believe it The best way to experience the Palau is to attend a concert The hall was built in  for a musical society called the Orfe Catal but today programs range from top symphony orchestras and soloists to avantgarde poprock outfits Tickets may be purchased at the box office on the c Sant Pere Ms Alt near the top of via Laietana Guided tours in English

planEl Eixample  ModernismeThe Eixample Barcelonas modern district north of Plaa de Catalunya is the citys main shopping and banking area Its where youll want to spend a good portion of your time if youve been waiting for Gaud The neighborhood is flush with spectacular apartment buildings examples of Barcelonas unique earlythcentury modernista architecture and is called the Quadrat dOr Golden Square The principal shopping and strolling avenues are the elegant Passeig de Grcia Barcelonas version of the Champs dElysee and pedestrianonly Rambla de Catalunya an uptown segment of La Rambla In a manageable area between the Gran Va de les Corts Catalanes and Avinguda Diagonal youll find most of the modernista masterpieces Two of Barcelonas signature sights Gauds unfinished cathedral La Sagrada Familia and his fantasyland residential community Parque Gull are on the northern outskirts of the Eixample easily accessible by taxi or metroFor all of Barcelonas exuberant architecture the citys modern district is a model of rationalist urban planning a rigid geometric grid dryly called the Extension The outrageous and conservative one learns coexist here without much fuss Barcelonas expansion came about in a remarkable burst of urban development By the mids Barcelona was bursting at the seams and suffocating inside its ring of medieval walls A municipal competition was held in  to select a plan for a new quarter between the old city and the Collserola hills The job went to a road engineer named Ildefons Cerd whose plan quintupled the citys size in a matter of decades Eixample construction by elite Barcelonans transformed the city into a showcase of extravagant modernista architecture and the swank Passeig de Grcia became the place to be seen Barcelona used the  Universal Exposition as an open house to show the world its new faceThe place to begin a modernista tour is definitely on Passeig de Gracia and its single hallucinatory block popularly known as Manzana de la Discordia Block of Discord between Consell de Cent and Arag In Spanish the word for apple and street block are the same manzanaallowing for a play on words alluding to the apple in Greek

contains documents on Hispanic art furniture by the architect and a splendid collection of glass but is not open to the public except by special permission If you are discreet though you can usually take a peek into the lobby to see the antique elevator and wonderful staircaseGauds highly personal Casa Batll  is next door The curvy contours unexpected combinations of textures and materials bright colors and infinite detail are Gaud hallmarks as are his prevalent religious and nationalist symbolism The Casa Batll is said to pay tribute to the patron saint of Catalonia St George and the dragon he valiantly slayed Gaud himself left no clues as to his intent The undulating bluetile roof indeed looks like a dragons scaly hide while the window balconies could be the skulls and bones of its victims others have suggested that they are Venetian carnival masks St Georges cross and a shaft suggest a spear being thrust into the dragons back Casa Batlls faade is covered with the bits of broken plate and tile a decorative technique called trencadis that Gaud repeatedly employed Gaud did not actually build the entire house he was commissioned to remodel the exterior and interior The house cannot be visited as it is owned by the company that makes Chupachups lollipops but you can hold a private function in Gauds emblematic homefor a significant fee of courseFarther up and across the street at Number  is Casa Mil  Gauds masterwork Known as La Pedrera which means stone quarry an allusion to its limestone surface this stunning apartment house is a UNESCO World Heritage Site The sinuous faade with wonderfully twisted wroughtiron balconies bends around the corner of c Provena The building was given a headtotoe facelift in the mids and it looks better than ever The apartments inside had suffered unspeakable horrors and Gauds beautiful arched attics had been sealed up but today everything has been restored to its original state The attic floor is now a handsomely realized hightech Gaud museum called Espai Gaud Opened to the public in late  was one of the original Gaud apartments all odd shapes handcrafted doorknobs and idiosyncratic details It has been meticulously outfitted with period furniture a great number of the pieces designed by Gaud For many though the highlight continues to be the wavy rooftop with its cluster of swirling Darth Vaderlike chimneys and spectacular views of Barcelona all the way to the sea La Pedrera had one of the worlds first underground parking garages today the space houses an ampitheater where cultural conferences are held The

of cocktails and jazz music on the terraceYoull likely be busy looking up or in chic store windows when you stroll along Passeig de Grcia but be sure to notice the ground as well Gaud himself designed the hexagonal pavement tiles with nature motifs The mosaic benches and iron street lamps with little bats  are by Pere Falqus Additional examples of modernisme by other architects of the period are littered throughout the Eixample and are too numerous to detail here Have a look at Passeig de Grcia to the east especially the carrers Diputaci Consell de Cent Mallorca and Valncia as far as the Mercat de la Concepci market In the old town youll stumble across marvelous modernista store fronts such as the Filatlia Monge stamp shop at Carrer dels Boters  and the Antiga Casa Figueras bakery on

Passeig de Grcia Paseo de Gracia in Spanish is lined with outdoor cafs cinemas galleries bookstores and elegant fashion boutiques A number of the top hotels are on or near this avenue The Plaa de

this square Parallel to Passeig de Grcia is an extension of the old Ramblas the Rambla de Catalunya It is lined with shops tapas bars clothing boutiques and momandpop stores traffic moves slowly down either side but the center is pedestrianonly and is considerably more relaxed than the lower Ramblas On carrer dArag between Passeig de Grcia and Rambla de Catalunya is the Fundaci Antoni Tpies a museum dedicated to the work of Spains foremost living artist the abstract materialist from Catalonia In addition to Tpiess work the Fundaci has interesting rotating international exhibits but at

unmistakable profile protruding from the citys crewcut skyline is visible from afar Yet the eight peculiar cigarshaped towers are merely the shell of a church that was begun in  and is still many years from completion This was Antoni Gauds life work though he didnt really expect to finish it in his lifetime He probably didnt expect to be run over by a tram while working feverishly on it either For many years the church remained much as it was when Gaud died With the assistance of private funds a foundation is now trying to complete the churchnot an easy task since Gaud left few detailed plans behind Yet it is known that he meant for a total of  more spires to be builtGaud who died in  at the age of  is appropriately buried in the churchs crypt During his last years he lived in a room on the construction site obsessed with the project As indisputably original as La Sagrada Familia is it was not Gauds work from the very beginning He took over the more traditionally Gothic plans of an earlier architect and supervised work on the east Portal of the Nativity one tower and part of the apse and nave The westside Portal of the Passion and its towers have been under construction since  with builders using plans by other architects emulating his style The east faade shows best what Gaud intended Everything has significance and a name and no space is left unfilled The three doorways with stonework dripping like stalactites represent Faith Hope and Charity and are loaded with sculptures depicting angel choirs and musicians and Biblical episodes such as the birth and youth of Jesus the Flight into Egypt the Slaughter of the Innocents the Tree of Calvary and much much more The cathedral is intended to incorporate every aspect of creation and faith Twelve towers four at each portal are to represent the Apostles four higher ones the Evangelists a dome over the apse the Virgin and the central spire the Savior Both an elevator and steps give access to a lookout from one of the east towers On the west side is a modern sculptural interpretation much criticized that has galvanized those who believed the temple should have been left as it was unfinished as a tribute to the great Gaud Nevertheless onward it goes when it will be finished nobody knows For now and perhaps the generation to come the great spires are marred by everpresent scaffolding and cranesA short walk diagonally from La Sagrada Familia is the astonishing Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau designed by Domnech i Montaner architect of the Palau de la Msica Catalana and completed by his son The complex of buildingsstill a working hospitalis one of modernismes most underrated and least known achievements Farther north in a working class neighborhood on the rising slope of the hills behind Grcia Parc Gull another wildly ambitious Gaud project is a residential community completely intertwined with nature Although this project too was never completed according to plan it is a marvelous place to visit part park part HanselandGretel fantasyland Gauds patron Eusebi Gell bought  hectares  acres here overlooking the city and the sea intending to create a community of villas He gave Gaud carte blanche to produce something original and for the next  years on and off the architect delighted in letting his imagination run wild A gingerbread gatehouse guards the entrance on the carrer dOlot a tiled lizard fountain gurgles water from its jaw supporting columns mimic tree trunks Ceilings are decorated with broken plates and wildly undulating benches are splashed with dizzying broken ceramics Gauds beloved trencadisBeneath the plaza with the benches is the Sal de les Cent Columnes Hall of the One Hundred Columns There actually are  Doric in style in what was to have been the colonys covered market If you look closely at the ceiling youll see dolls heads bottles glasses and plates stuck in the mosaicsAs a realestate venture the park failed to attract buyers and only two villas were built Gaud lived for a time in one with a goldflecked witchshat tower It contains a small museum of furniture by Gaud and other memorabilia Waterfront  BarcelonetaBarcelona turned its back on the sea in the th century and focused on developing industry The sea wall where families loved to walk and catch the breeze on stifling summer nights was dismantled Access to and even a view of the sea was obstructed by warehouses and railway tracks Expansion proceeded towards the hills and La Barceloneta a neighborhood created in the mids between the port and the beach became the district of modest fishermen and sailors Now all this has changed again and a recreational and increasingly commercial area has been newly created along the waterfrontBegin a tour of the waterfront at the Columbus Monument at the foot of the Ramblas To the right is Les Reials Drassanes begun in  the only medieval shipyard still in existence and now the Museu Martim Maritime Museum The  bays of these yards which could once handle more than  galleys at a time launched ships that extended Catalonias dominion over the Mediterranean from Tunis to Greece Sicily Sardinia and much of the French coast The museum contains models of ships from the earliest galleys to the cargo and passenger vessels that have made Barcelona their home port up to the present day The prize exhibit is the fullsize copy of the Royal Galley La Reial aboard which Don Juan of Austria commanded the fleet that defeated the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto in  Across Passeig de Colom the busy road on the waterfront is a wooden footbridge called the Rambla del Mar Designed as an extension of the Ramblas and popular with Sunday strollers it crosses over to the Moll dEspanya and leads to Maremagnum a shopping center with an Imax cinema and LAqurium de Barcelona One of Europes largest aquariums its main attraction is a spectacular glass tunnel on the sea bed The port is busy with boats from the Royal Yacht Club cruise ships and ferries to Mallorca Overhead aerial cable cars link Montjuc with Barceloneta The newest addition to the port is the World Trade Center an IM Peidesigned complex of offices floating in the harborPrior to the Olympics the harbor area was upgraded transforming the Moll de la Fusta the woodloading quay into a broad promenade Once again Barcelonans can stroll by the sea although almost all the new restaurants that moved in with the refurbishment have gone bellyup their shells have been replaced by weekend discotheques A large and convenient parking garage is located underneathBarcelonetaBarceloneta isnt quite the little Barcelona that its name promises It is separated from the city as much in spirit as by the physical barriers of water and the rail yards No modernista apartment buildings no hallowed Gothic shrines in this shirtsleeve community of people who catch fish cook and serve them eat and drink heartily and yell back and forth at each other across neighborly streets The robust barrio weathered attempts to tame and tether it as part of the  waterfront sterilization scheme but it has mostly survivedA triangle of sandthe area now bordered by the Passeig Nacional the Avinguda dIcria and the beachfront Passeig Martimfirst housed dispossessed families when the Ribera district was demolished to make way for the Ciutadella fortress Today fishermen unload their boats across the Passeig Nacional and the catch soon finds its way to the scores of local bars and restaurantsAt the end of the harborMarina de Port Vell where some huge yachts are mooredturn in a block or two to the beach Once dominated by a row of flimsy wooden restaurants called chiringuitos shacks the area was virtually rebuilt in preparation for the  Olympics Most of the chiringuitos were wiped out a loss many Barcelonans still feel The rundown feel of the apartment blocks is still present but theyre now mixed with a cluster of elegant shops and several smart bars and restaurants An extensive cleanup operation was carried out on the beaches and a landscaped avenue established on the seafront leading to the Olympic port about a mile up the coast What served as the athletes Olympic Village Vila Olmpica was planned as an entirely new planned community it won Harvard University and Prince Charles design awards Initially a ghost town of designer apartments it has blossomed into a vibrant seaside neighborhood for young families and professionals Tourist interest focuses on the Port Olmpic the new port a lively area of restaurants and bars clustered around anchored boats and yachts the stretch of landscaped beaches called Platjas de Barcelona and the shopping centered around the deluxe highrise Hotel Arts which sits imposingly on the beach You can either take a bus or the metro to La Barceloneta from Plaa de Catalunya A sensational ride back is aboard an aerial cable car ride that traverses the length of the port providing excellent views of the waterfront and La Rambla The ride climbs to the cablecar tower Torre de Jaume I  meters  feet above the harbor From there you can descend and walk back to the Columbus monument area or continue the aerial lift to Montjuc at the level of the amusement parkLodged between Port Olmpic and the La Ribera district is Parc de la Ciutadella the citys largest park The expanse contains the city zoo Parc Zoolgic and its rare albino gorilla named Snowflake or Copito de Nieve the Museu dArt Modern Modern Art Museum the seat of the Parlament de Catalunya and the foundations of Ciutadella Citadel Its a lovely park with a lake large old trees and pleasant pathways The large Baroque fountain La Cascada was designed by Josep Fontser who had as his assistant a young architecture student named Antoni Gaud The main attraction of the Museu dArt Modern is its collection of th and early thcentury Catalan works particularly those of the Modernist school There are some notable canvases by Santiago Rusiol and Ramn Casas Other works include those of Modernist artists Mir and NonellIn the area across between La Ribera and Passeig de Colom which fronts the old harbor just south of Barceloneta the most remarkable institution is La Llotja a center of Barcelonas trading activities for more than  years It started out as an open loggia where merchants and ship owners made their deals In the late th century this was enclosed and expanded to three naves of slim columns supporting high round arches Here was installed the office of Consulate of the Sea the foundation of maritime law for all the Mediterranean countries With the addition of a neoClassical faade staircase and upper stories the building served variously as a Chamber of Commerce and School of Fine Arts where Picasso was a student before becoming the Barcelona Stock Exchange Borsa de Barcelona You can visit the exchange from am to pm El RavalThe district between La Rambla and the Ronda de Sant Antoni once the line of the city wall is El Raval a neighborhood being rapidly renovated with many old buildings demolished to create open spaces The best way to venture into the barrio is to start on the Ramblas turning west on carrer del Carme On the site of the Gothic complex of the Hospital de la Santa Creu Hospital of the Holy Cross a hospital and refuge for pilgrims stood for a thousand years Gaud died here in  The present structures were begun in  Look for the frieze of thcentury tiles on the life of St Paul in the entryway of the Institut dEstudis Catalans The hospitals courtyard is restful with benches near orange trees ripe with fruit in summer Exhibitions of art and books are held in the various halls off the cloisterTurn north from here up the carrer del ngels and you will reach the most conspicuous symbol of the transformation underway in this neighborhood Richard Meiers shockingly modern and blindingly white Museu dArt Contemporani de Barcelona known by its initials MACBA Erected as a counterpoint to the rest of the barrio and as the lead dog in the municipal governments plans to upgrade this artists neighborhood the stark museum is worth visiting primarily for architecture buffs It is still working on putting together a serious contemporary collectionNext door on carrer Montalegre is the Centre de Cultura Contempornia de Barcelona a striking modern makeover of an old hospital the Casa de Caritat It displays interesting exhibits that posit Barcelona or the urban experience as their theme One more building on this side of the Ramblas that should not be missed is the small church of Sant Pau del Camp off in a corner of its own at the end of the carrer de Sant Pau which starts at the Pla de la Boquera The simplicity of Sant Paus Romanesque lines is an agreeable change from the extravagance of Barcelonas modernisme and the intricacies of Gothic architecture The church was almost certainly built in the ninth century as evidenced by the tomb of Wilfred II dated  that was found here The small lovely cloister has curious rather Arabstyle arches The church usually remains locked the best time to see the interior is on a Sunday morningMontjucMontjuc was the natural site for the  Olympic Ring Anella Olmpica of athletic facilities For many years its meter foot summit panoramic view of the city and harbor and outstanding complex of museums amusement attractions and sports facilities have made the hill a favorite place to spend an afternoon Montjuc came into its own as the site of Barcelonas  International Exhibition The Plaa dEspanyas ornate fountain was created to grace the entrance to the fairground and is still a good point to begin a visit to Montjuc as it has a metro and bus stop A number of hangartype halls used during the year by commercial exhibitors at fairs line a central pedestrian avenue leading upwards to the vast Palau Nacional the fairs Spanish pavilion This domed palace holds one of the worlds finest collections of medieval art the Museu Nacional dArt de Catalunya Unmatched for Romanesque art and Gothic painting of the Catalan school it has undergone extensive refurbishment over recent years and the section on Romanesque art is now finally reopened From the ninth to the th centuries more than  churches were built in Catalonia in the Romanesque style of thick bare walls with rounded arches for doors windows and cloisters Interiors were decorated with frescoes in the Byzantine tradition primitive sculpture of biblical episodes or rural life on the capitals of columns painted altar front panels carved wooden crosses and Madonnas of great purity Around the start of the th century many of these works of art were removed to Catalan museums from churches that were deteriorating or abandoned thus saving them from further damage or being sold out of the countrySome of Spains very best works of art are in this museum such as the great th century Cristo Pantocrator from the apse of the church of Sant Climent de Tall in the Pyrenees A superb group of unpainted elongated wooden figures representing the descent from the cross is from the church of Santa Mara de Tall There are masterpieces in every room of this most unusual collection The Gothic wing is excellent too Many of the paintings are retablos manypaneled screens with Gothicarched frames that stood behind chapel altars Among the treasures are Llus Dalmaus Virgin of the Councillors with its portraits full of character of the politicos who commissioned the work for the City Hall chapel in  Jaume Ferrer IIs stylishly hatted St Jerome and a very fine retable of St John the Baptist with saints Sebastian and Nicholas Up the hill and across the street is the Museu Arqueolgic Archaeological Museum Among the many interesting exhibits drawn mainly from prehistoric Iberian Greek and Roman sites in Catalonia are reconstructions of tombs and lifelike dioramas Around another curve within walking distance up the hill is the Museu Etnolgic Ethnological Museum This wellpresented collection usually has a special rotating program highlighting the native arts of Latin America and other lands Farther up Montjuc turn left where the Avinguda de lEstadi the Olympic Ring boulevard becomes the Avinguda de Miramar to see the simple and elegant Fundaci Joan Mir The museum was designed in  by the architect Josep Llus Sert to house a large collection of paintings drawings tapestries and sculpture by the Catalan surrealist Mir died in  at the age of  The exhibits follow Mirs artistic development from  onwards Photographs show him always neatly dressed and barbered looking like a Catalan businessman in contrast to the more bohemian Picasso and in contrast too with the surrealist works he created The collection is witty and bright with the bright colors and unique language symbols associated with the artist The Avinguda de Miramar continues past the station of the funicular railway that climbs the hill from the Avinguda del Parallel near the Parallel metro stop The funicular links up here with a cable car that goes to the Parc dAtraccions de Montjuc an amusement park and on to the Castell de Montjuc on the summit Cable cars run daily in summer weekendsonly in winter A short walk from the amusement park is the Plaa de lArmada station for the cable car that crosses the harbor completing an interesting network of transport by cableThe fortress atop Montjuc built in  remained in use by the army and then as a prison until shortly before it was turned over to the city to become a museum in  The Museu Militar Military Museum has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor lead soldiers of different epochs and models of Catalan castles Here in a basement room youll find what may be the only statue of Generalssimo Francisco Franco to be seen in Barcelona today The fort has somber associations for the city Its cannons bombarded the population to put down rebellions in the th and th centuries and it was the site of political executions including that of Llus Companys president of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Civil War who was shot by a firing squad in The Olympic facilities on the northern side of Montjuc are centered on the stadium and Plaa dEuropa The original  stadium now called Estadi Olmpic was enlarged for the  Summer Games The handsome hightech Palau dEsports Sant Jordi was designed by the Japanese architect Arata Izozaki It can seat  under a roof  meters  feet highThe Poble Espanyol Spanish Village on Montjucs northeastern flank is an attraction for which the clich fun for the whole family might have been invented Built in  for the Barcelona Universal Exposition its a composite of architecture representing Spains varied regions including replicas of houses church towers fountains plazas and palaces built of solid brick and stone The entrance through one of the gates of the walled city of vila is the first step into a community of  such reproductions arranged along a network of  streets and alleys and  village squares Its a bit cheeky and full of tourbus crowds but at least gives you a notion of the different regions of Spain That said theres plenty to entertain childrenArchitecture aficionados wont want to miss one last sight on Montjuc the Pabell Mies van der Rohe a pavilion built for the  International Expo by the seminal minimalist The glass stone and steel cube house is a wonder of cool Bauhaus forms tucked in the trees just off Avinguda Marqus de ComillasThe DiagonalThe broad treelined Avinguda Diagonal slices across Cerds grid from the coast to the hills Designed for through traffic it links up with the ring roads around the city and the toll highways beyond The area around the Plaa de les Glries Catalanes a busy roundabout linking main roads into the city is largely industrial but becomes more dignified to the west after crossing the Passeig de Sant Joan Between the Passeig de Grcia and the Plaa de Francesc Maci is one of Barcelonas most elegant districts with fourstar hotels and luxury shops Pricey restaurants and discotheques abound in adjoining streets A couple of miles west along the Diagonal surrounded by a park is the Palau Reial de Pedralbes an estate of the Gell family converted into a royal residence in  in case King Alfonso XIII should drop by It now houses elements of the Museu de les Artes Decoratives Museum of Decorative Arts and a collection of carriages Renaissance and Baroqueperiod paintings from the Colecci Camb formerly in the Palau de la Virreina are now hung here Be sure to go around the park walls to see the dragon gate in wrought iron designed by Gaud for the Gells The districts on the hillside beyond were once separate villages where residents of Barcelona town often spent summers and weekends Theyve been gradually absorbed over the years by Barcelonas expansion but each still preserves its own unique characterGrcia for example has its own town square the Plaa Rius i Taulet and streets named Llibertat and Fraternitat and a Plaa Revoluci reflecting a political past Theres a great nighttime blowout of food and festivity in these streets in the second half of August Sarri retains the feel of a small Catalan town while the atmosphere of Pedralbes is patricianresidential villas with gardens and the citys most expensive real estate The Monestir de Pedralbes in Pedralbes has a superb Gothic church with a charming twostory cloister and part of the excellent ThyssenBornemisza art collection including important works from the medieval to Italian Baroque periods the major part of which is housed in the Thyssen museum in Madrid TibidaboThe first bright clear morning or late afternoon of your visit head for Tibidabo the meter foot peak that overlooks Barcelona The views of the city are breathtaking You can clearly make out the Sagrada Familia and the grid plan of the Eixample Families come here on summer evenings to enjoy the sstyle amusement park and weekends are crowded with joggers and cyclists You can also climb Torre de Collserola by the English architect Sir Norman Foster or visit the church of the Sagrat Corazn A neoGothic work by Enric Sagnier the church is surmounted by a monumental figure of Christ one of the citys landmarksTo reach the summit take the FCG train not the metro to Avda Tibidabo from the Plaa de Catalunya From here a Tramvia Blau blue tram runs daily in the summer Saturdays and Sundays the rest of the year taking you up to the funicular station past stately mansions In five minutes the funicular closed midOctober through February lifts you through pine woods to the top where you have a spectacular panorama of the city the sea coast and on very clear days both Mallorca and the Pyrenees There are several restaurants and bars here including Mirablau with extraordinary views as their selling pointsExcursionsTheres an awful lot to detain you in Barcelona but just beyond the city are several sites eminently worthy of day trips including the holy Catalan shrine Montserrat the relaxed beach andmuseum town of Sitges and the cava wine country in the region of Peneds MontserratThe jagged ridges of Montserrat rise out of the rather featureless Llobregat plain  kilometers  miles northwest of Barcelona in the very heart of Catalonia Although the view from its meter foot summit can encompass both the Pyrenees and Mallorca it is more significant that from afar one can see the unmistakable outline that gives Montserrat its name Serrated Mountain Montserrat is the shrine of Catalan nationhood The first hermitages on the mountain may have been established to escape the Moorish invasion One was enlarged as a Benedictine monastery in the th century A century later it became the repository of La Moreneta the Black Madonna said to be a carving by St Luke later hidden by St Peter Shes a small wooden image of a brownfaced Virgin holding the infant Jesus on her lap and the globe in her right hand Ever since pilgrimsfrom commoners to kingshave climbed the mountain to worship the Catalan patron saint More than a million pilgrims and tourists visit each yearLike Catalan nationalism the monastery has been destroyed only to rise again It was burned to the ground by Napoleons soldiers in  abandoned in  when all convents were sequestered by the state and rebuilt in  During the Spanish Civil War when anticlerical feelings were violent among the Republicans in Barcelona La Moreneta was secretly replaced by a copy the original remained hidden during the Franco years Though Catalan culture was suppressed Montserrats monks continued to say masses in CatalanThe site of the monastery is spectacular tucked into folds of rock high above the plain On the eve of the saints day  April the monks hold an allnight vigil attended by crowds of people La Moreneta looks down from a goldandglass case above and to the right of the altar in the basilica but the faithful can touch or kiss her right hand through an opening At pm and pm except in July the choir boys of the Escolana one of the worlds oldest music schools founded in the th century fill the basilica with their angelic voices The congregation joins in at the end of the service to sing Montserrats hymn the Virolai an expression of faith fused with a nationalist fervorMontserrat is also the goal of outdoor sports pilgrims like cyclists who make the trip from Barcelona and mountain climbers who ascend the spires of rock above the monastery From the monastery there are walks to other hermitages and a funicular to the cave sacred to the legend of the Madonna Statues and plaques line the paths Montserrat is an extremely popular place so there are several bars and restaurants set up to feed the hordes Montserrat can be reached in spectacular fashion by train from Barcelonas Plaa dEspanya On arrival at the Montserrat station about an hour later a cable car continues right up the side of the mountain to the monastery A muchless preferable bus service also operates from Barcelona by Transportes Juli Tel    By car leave Barcelona via the Diagonal and take the highway direction Tarragona exiting at Sortida SitgesIts easy to get to the Costa Daurada beaches from Barcelona The coast south of the city earned its name from its broad golden sands in contrast to the rocky coves of the Costa Brava to the north Sitges a favorite resort of Barcelonans is the best site for a day trip Its a km mile and minute drive less than half an hour by train from the citys EstaciSantsThe coastal drive is a very scenic but narrow and curvy route If you prefer you can bypass this road by taking the toll road which gets you to Sitges in under  minutes Happily the pretty town has escaped the highrises and tawdry atmosphere of many coastal resorts although it does get somewhat overwhelmed by crowds in summer There are two beaches separated by a promontory where gleaming whitewashed houses cluster around the church of Sant Bartomeu La Ribera is almost  kilometers  mile long backed by a promenade lined with cafs and restaurants Besides the beaches Sitges is known for its collection of small appealing museums The Museu Cau Ferrat is installed in the house of the painter Santiago Rusiol  whose collection of works by El Greco Casas Picasso and others is on display along with many of his own works Across the street the Museu Maricel del Mar holds a small collection of medieval sculpture and paintings in a splendid house overlooking the seaThe Museu Romntic displays the furniture and accoutrements of a wealthy th century as well as a large family of antique dolls On the hillsides and lanes are the villas of wealthy Barcelona families while the streets between the beach and railway station are geared for food and frolic In late spring the streets are carpeted with flowers for the procession of Corpus Christi Sitges is home to one of Spains largest gay communities and is a magnet for gay travelers yearround but particularly during carnaval Gay and nudist beaches are just beyond the town beaches Sant Sadurn d Anoia PenedsCava Catalonias sparkling wine comes from Peneds a pretty spot  km  miles from
