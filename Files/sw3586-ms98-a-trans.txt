        im sorry um hobbies let me see i dont know if that took or not ill do it again   thats okay i didnt hear okay okay   okay what are your hobbies i hear you have kids right  thats your full time uh hobby right   you you heard her in the background  thats babies takes a lot of time huh i like uh most sports i like to do that i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing   umhum   oh little bit of embroidery work once in a while what do you like to do   umhum um i try to do some painting although im not very good at it um   well im sure you probably are   i well no not really   you like it thats the main point right   yeah i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think im creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be so i always try     thats right     i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity um im making drapes for my house just because im   oh boy thats hard sewing   yeah well it isnt and it is it is you know actually the sewing isnt the hard part its just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room   measure it and get it uh well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it if you get pleats and all kinds of things   yeah ive been doing that and that yeah that but usually i have to do the pleats by hand so that at least i can do it you know watching TV or whatever but   thats a lot of work oh right right   yeah and ive ive gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through but   that feels really good   yeah so thats not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it   you do it right   i have lets see i have a dog and a lot of fish keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby and   keeping fish well theyre probably easier than keeping dogs though arent they   um yes and no it depends on and how frequently they die and how much that bothers you   oh no how much that bothers you and you probably have to clean out the tank uh   thats you dont do as much as as i thought in fact my problem i had fish as a kid and they always died   oh no   i mean immediately and what im what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean   oh youre kidding because they need to have a little bit of the   because you have right you need to let the bacteria build up and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance   i say   and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and and it would kill all the bacteria and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so   oh no and so youd have to start all over to build that up probably   right thats right so now all i i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i dont try and sterilize things   right right dont go through the whole nine yards and   thats right   they kind of need a little bit of that   thats right   so youve had fish for a long time   well ive had them i guess its been two years now ive had a a tank here and and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank but that never worked well and   what size do you have there   i have fifty five gallons now its a lot easier   oh thats good size have you ever had it to crack or break or leak  i was just playing you fifty five gallons youd hope it would never do that   no  no not yet thats right i really do but you know   what do you have all kinds of different fish or   yeah i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things i dont get into the expensive right right the expensive ones   umhum real exotic huh well theyre probably hardy to harder to take care of and   they are and theyre very expensive and you know when you die its like it when when they die its more like an investment youve lost an investment so   yes i bet it is  do you have problems with them uh your fish eating each other   no not really only if theres baby fish you always have to isolate those   right then you have to how do you isolate them   you get um   a jars something or   well no they have uh breeders its a little plastic thing that sort of floats   okay okay   and you put the mother fish in there and then its got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down the trough and theres a hole in the middle so they fall onto the bottom part of the chamber so the mother cant get to them either   okay oh   and thats you know it it kind of works but its also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one itll fit out the slots   right they will go through the slot   thats right so but you know it works i guess   that works all right they they dont uh want want the mothers to be with the little fishies   yeah oh theyll eat them yeah   they will isnt that odd you wouldnt think that that   yes it and its funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies   youre kidding   and oh no all all the time and um ive and shes supposed to her variety it says they wont eat the babies and ive seen her do it   uhhuh that just makes you sick almost doesnt it   so oh its terrible well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different you know we might right we might decide whats proper and what isnt but you know thats the way it is for them   yeah things are different in the animal kingdom huh yeah thats kind of the way they do it   yeah thats it   survival of the fittest or something   yeah because if the babys strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide   right go hide from them well and then you think well how do they do it out in the real world anyway   so   yeah yeah   when these little fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are   yeah yeah   kind of trying to keep up with that but if youre like me you never have enough time for the hobbies   huh no not really i i try i also i also i play a couple of instruments
