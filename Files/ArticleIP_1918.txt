                                 In Praise of Cheap Labor            For many years a huge Manilagarbage dump known as Smokey Mountain was a favorite media symbol of ThirdWorld poverty Several thousand men women and children lived on thatdumpenduring the stench the flies and the toxic waste in order to make aliving combing the garbage for scrap metal and other recyclables And theylived there voluntarily because the  or so a squatter family could clear ina day was better than the alternatives            The squatters are gone nowforcibly removed by Philippine police last year as a cosmetic move in advanceof a Pacific Rim summit But I found myself thinking about Smokey Mountainrecently after reading my latest batch of hate mail            The occasion was an opedpiece I had written for the New York Times  in which I had pointed outthat while wages and working conditions in the new export industries of theThird World are appalling they are a big improvement over the previous lessvisible rural poverty I guess I should have expected that this comment wouldgenerate letters along the lines of Well if you lose your comfortableposition as an American professor you can always find another jobas long asyou are  years old and willing to work for  cents an hour            Such moral outrage is commonamong the opponents of globalizationof the transfer of technology and capitalfrom highwage to lowwage countries and the resulting growth oflaborintensive Third World exports These critics take it as a given thatanyone with a good word for this process is naive or corrupt and in eithercase a de facto agent of global capital in its oppression of workers here andabroad            Butmatters are not that simple and the moral lines are not that clear In factlet me make a counteraccusation The lofty moral tone of the opponents ofglobalization is possible only because they have chosen not to think theirposition through While fatcat capitalists might benefit from globalizationthe biggest beneficiaries are yes Third World workers            After all global poverty is not something recentlyinvented for the benefit of multinational corporations Lets turn the clockback to the Third World as it was only two decades ago and still is in manycountries In those days although the rapid economic growth of a handful ofsmall Asian nations had started to attract attention developing countries likeIndonesia or Bangladesh were still mainly what they had always been exportersof raw materials importers of manufactures Inefficient manufacturing sectorsserved their domestic markets sheltered behind import quotas but generatedfew jobs Meanwhile population pressure pushed desperate peasants intocultivating ever more marginal land or seeking a livelihood in any waypossiblesuch as homesteading on a mountain of garbage            Given thislack of other opportunities you could hire workers in Jakarta or Manila for apittance But in the mids cheap labor was not enough to allow a developingcountry to compete in world markets for manufactured goods The entrenchedadvantages of advanced nationstheir infrastructure and technical knowhowthe vastly larger size of their markets and their proximity to suppliers of keycomponents their political stability and the subtlebutcrucial socialadaptations that are necessary to operate an efficient economyseemed tooutweigh even a tenfold or twentyfold disparity in wage rates            And then something changed Some combination offactors that we still dont fullyunderstandlower tariff barriers improved telecommunications cheaper airtransportreduced the disadvantages of producing in developing countriesOther things being the same it is still better to produce in the FirstWorldstories of companies that moved production to Mexico or East Asia thenmoved back after experiencing the disadvantages of the Third World environmentare common In a substantial number of industries low wages alloweddeveloping countries to break into world markets And so countries that hadpreviously made a living selling jute or coffee started producing shirts andsneakers instead            Workersin those shirt and sneaker factories are inevitably paid very little andexpected to endure terrible working conditions I say inevitably becausetheir employers are not in business for their or their workers health theypay as little as possible and that minimum is determined by the otheropportunities available to workers And these are still extremely poorcountries where living on a garbage heap is attractive compared with thealternatives            And yet wherever the new export industries have grownthere has been measurable improvement in the lives of ordinary people Partlythis is because a growing industry must offer a somewhat higher wage thanworkers could get elsewhere in order to get them to move More importantlyhowever the growth of manufacturingand of the penumbra of other jobs thatthe new export sector createshas a ripple effect throughout the economy Thepressure on the land becomes less intense so rural wages rise the pool ofunemployed urban dwellers always anxious for work shrinks so factories startto compete with each other for workers and urban wages also begin to riseWhere the process has gone on long enoughsay in South Korea orTaiwanaverage wages start to approach what an American teenager can earn atMcDonalds And eventually people are no longer eager to live on garbage dumpsSmokey Mountain persisted because the Philippines until recently did notshare in the exportled growth of its neighbors Jobs that pay better thanscavenging are still few and far between            Thebenefits of exportled economic growth to the mass of people in the newlyindustrializing economies are not a matter of conjecture A country likeIndonesia is still so poor that progress can be measured in terms of how muchthe average person gets to eat since  per capita intake has risen fromless than  to more than  calories a day A shocking onethird ofyoung children are still malnourishedbut in  the fraction was more thanhalf Similar improvements can be seen throughout the Pacific Rim and even inplaces like Bangladesh These improvements have not taken place becausewellmeaning people in the West have done anything to helpforeign aid neverlarge has lately shrunk to virtually nothing Nor is it the result of thebenign policies of national governments which are as callous and corrupt asever It is the indirect and unintended result of the actions of soullessmultinationals and rapacious local entrepreneurs whose only concern was totake advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor It is not anedifying spectacle but no matter how base the motives of those involved theresult has been to move hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty tosomething still awful but nonetheless significantly better            Why then the outrage of my correspondentsWhy does the image of an Indonesian sewing sneakers for  cents an hour evokeso much more feeling than the image of another Indonesian earning theequivalent of  cents an hour trying to feed his family on a tiny plot oflandor of a Filipino scavenging on a garbage heap            The main answer I think isa sort of fastidiousness Unlike the starving subsistence farmer the women andchildren in the sneaker factory are working at slave wages for ourbenefit and this makes us feel unclean And so there are selfrighteousdemands for international labor standards We should not the opponents ofglobalization insist be willing to buy those sneakers and shirts unless thepeople who make them receive decent wages and work under decent conditions            Thissounds only fairbut is it Lets think through the consequences            First of all even if we could assure the workers in ThirdWorld export industries of higher wages and better working conditions thiswould do nothing for the peasants day laborers scavengers and so on who makeup the bulk of these countries populations At best forcing developingcountries to adhere to our labor standards would create a privileged laboraristocracy leaving the poor majority no better off            And itmight not even do that The advantages of established First World industriesare still formidable The only reason developing countries have been able tocompete with those industries is their ability to offer employers cheap laborDeny them that ability and you might well deny them the prospect of continuingindustrial growth even reverse the growth that has been achieved And sinceexportoriented growth for all its injustice has been a huge boon for theworkers in those nations anything that curtails that growth is very muchagainst their interests A policy of good jobs in principle but no jobs inpractice might assuage our consciences but it is no favor to its allegedbeneficiaries            You may say that the wretched of the earthshould not be forced to serve as hewers of wood drawers of water and sewersof sneakers for the affluent But what is the alternative Should they behelped with foreign aid Maybealthough the historical record of regions likesouthern Italy suggests that such aid has a tendency to promote perpetualdependence Anyway there isnt the slightest prospect of significant aidmaterializing Should their own governments provide more social justice Ofcoursebut they wont or at least not because we tell them to And as long asyou have no realistic alternative to industrialization based on low wages tooppose it means that you are willing to deny desperately poor people the bestchance they have of progress for the sake of what amounts to an aestheticstandardthat is the fact that you dont like the idea of workers being paida pittance to supply rich Westerners with fashion items            In short my correspondentsare not entitled to their selfrighteousness They have not thought the matterthrough And when the hopes of hundreds of millions are at stake thinkingthings through is not just good intellectual practice It is a moral duty
