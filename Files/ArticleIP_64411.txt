                                  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman            When Franjo Tudjman dies as he is expected to anyday his Croatian followers will surely write him an epitaph full of thegrandiosity Tudjman adored so much in life Something like Franjo TudjmanWarrior Dissident Man of Letters Statesman Liberator and Father of theFree Independent and Democratic Nation of Croatia  History will rememberhim more accurately Franjo Tudjman Not Quite as Bad asMilosevic             Tudjmans good fortuneis that he has never been quite as nasty stupid and uncivilized as hisbrotherincrime Slobodan Milosevic Tudjman shares Milosevics eliminationistnationalism and he implemented it with similar brutality using murder warexile and judicial terrorism to empty Croatia of nonCroatians But theuntrammeled brutality of Milosevics Serbs in Kosovo and Bosnia overshadowedthe trammeled brutality of Tudjmans Croats and Milosevics colorful crudenessappeared more wicked than Tudjmans schoolmarm prissiness Milosevic is athug Tudjman is thuggish but he also craves the respect of the world saysYale professor Ivo Banac who studies Croatia            Tudjman is a true believer but he has not always believedthe same thing Born in  he enlisted with Titos Communist partisansduring World War II Joining Tito was the only honorable course for a CroatThe other choice was supporting the Nazis and Croatias homegrown fascistevil the Ustasha which slaughtered Jews and Serbs by the thousands Tudjmanwas a fervent Red and after the war he rose through military and party rankseventually becoming the general in charge of party discipline In  at theheight of his career he quit to immerse himself in Croat history Soon he wasa dissident professor and he served a term in prison in the early s foropposing Titos dictatorship Tudjmans brave stand against communism would beadmirable except that he offered an equally bad ideology in its place ruthlessCroat nationalism Though he had fought the Ustasha he began to excuse theirbehavior arguing that they had killed fewer people than Serbs claimed He alsomade antiSemitic and antiSerb statements and insisted that Croatia was onlyfor Croats The ardent Tudjman contrasts sharply with Milosevic Tudjmanbecame a nationalist before it was fashionable Milosevic stumbled intonationalism in the late s when it was convenient            In the late s Tudjmanused money raised from Croat migrs in the West to build a nationalist partyWhen Yugoslavia began to fragment in  Tudjman offered Croats anorganization and a convenient replacement ideology They embraced him He cameto power in  declared Croatias independence in  was electedpresident in  and was reelected in             Tudjman awakened and fanned Croats sense of aggrievementCroats like everyone else in the Balkans are aggrieved He hearkened backto the  th century the only period when Croatia was independentHe reminded his subjects that Yugoslavias Serb majority treated Croats likesecondclass citizens He blatantly appealed to Croat prejudice emphasizingthat Croats needed to unshackle themselves from the dirty dark Muslims andSerbs to their south and east and join their real home Europe FundamentallyTudjmanism is snobbery He resurrected Ustasha symbols including thechessboard flag and kuna currency            Conventional wisdomabout the Balkan conflicts holds that Milosevic is a pragmatist and Tudjman isan inflexible ideologue But the history of the past decade suggests thereverse It is Tudjman who has been flexible enough to triumph and Milosevicwho has been imprisoned by ideology Tudjman has employed roughly the sametactics as Milosevic but has always pulled back before irrevocably damagingCroatias standing            The two leaders were made for each other For most of thes each used the other to reinforce nationalism at home When Tudjmanrewrote the Croatian Constitution in  to undermine the rights of SerbsMilosevic used this as a pretext to invade Croatia capturing the onequarterof Croatia inhabited by Serbs Tudjman took advantage of Milosevics brutalityto ingratiate himself with the West Before Milosevic invaded Tudjman hadschemed with him to divide Bosnia between them and throw out the Muslims Butafter Milosevic doublecrossed him Tudjman brought Croatia into the Bosnianwar on the side of the Muslims Then in  when he thought he could build aCroat state in Bosnia Tudjman turned on his allies Bosnian Croatmilitiasdirected by Tudjman from Zagrebimprisoned thousands of BosnianMuslims in concentration camps shelled towns murdered civilians and barredhumanitarian relief convoys The Croats laid siege to Mostar penning Muslims inside cut off food and water and launched an artillerybombardment            Once Western pressurebecame too great Tudjman displaying exactly the pragmatism Milosevic lackedstopped the assault and changed sides again Tudjman silenced most outsidecriticism by pushing Bosnian Croats into a federation with Muslims Tudjmanretained enough American support that the United States even allowed retiredUS military officers to train the Croatian military despite an armsembargo            In  Tudjman again showed his talent for limiting hisbrutality just enough to get away with it That summer he invaded the Krajinathe Serb area captured by Milosevic in  The  Serb residents fled toSerbia rather than fight Tudjman punctuated the arguably justified invasionwith a vicious exclamation point He had his troops burn down  percent ofSerbian houses passed laws to confiscate Serb property and allowed gangs ofCroat thugs to murder the few elderly Serbs who remained What he did afterthe invasion was inexcusable says Peter Galbraith then US ambassador toCroatia            Even so Tudjman againrestored himself to the Wests semi good graces by signing the Dayton PeaceAccords and agreeing to let Serbs return to their burned homes But he has notallowed them to return in fact Only a handful of the  Serbs have comeback to the Krajina He has also refused to extradite the Croats indicted forwar crimes to the Hague perhaps fearing they would implicate him            Domestically Tudjman has displayed a similar gift forconceding just enough to seem reasonable Croatia is ostensibly a democracybut it has functioned under Tudjman like a semifascist dictatorship Tudjmanwho is fond of Il Ducetype uniforms rigged the parliamentary elections sothat his nationalist party HDZ could not lose For example he guaranteedBosnian Croats who are wildly nationalistic  seats in the parliamenteventhough they dont live in Croatia Tudjman has suppressed independent mediaand used his control of state television like a club During the lastpresidential campaign according to Galbraith Tudjman received  times asmuch TV time as his opponent Tudjman has putatively supported capitalism buthis idea of free enterprise is to privatize industries and give them to hisfriends The Croatian economy which ought to be thriving from beach tourismand lowwage manufacturing is a mess            This corruption and authoritarianism have irkeddemocracy advocates but it has not been enough to fully discredit Tudjman TheWest dropped its arms embargo Europe albeit reluctantly admitted Croatiainto the Council of Europe Once Tudjman dies a more democratic Croatia islikely to be admitted to the European Union Almost everything Tudjman wishedfor has come true He has built an independent Croatia driven virtually allits Serbs and Muslims into exile and won Croats semiautonomy in Bosnia Heis as one writer put it the efficient ethnic cleanser Milosevicmeanwhile has turned Yugoslavia into a pariah state its economy destroyedits ambitions for Greater Serbia quashed            Even in dying Tudjman is proving his gift forpragmatic villainy Tudjman is reportedly suffering from stomach cancer thathas metastasized According to most reports from Zagreb Tudjman is brain deadand has been for some weeks Croatia analysts surmise that HDZ is keepingTudjman alive as a campaign strategy Parliamentary elections are scheduled forearly January and HDZ is trailing the less nationalistic opposition in thepolls HDZ seems to be trying to time his death for maximal electoral benefithoping to generate a swell of patriotic sympathy that will help the party onelection day Tudjman who built his career on such cold grotesque and highlyeffective sleaziness would surely appreciate the compliment
