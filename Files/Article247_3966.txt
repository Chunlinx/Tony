                                 It Takes Destroying a Village To Save the World                        Greetings Fred greetings to the Book Club community            This book was a huge surprise for me But first lets have a little talkabout the unspoken psychology of book reviewing            It seems to me that there is a basic question about a book thats often thereal question in a reviewers mind but that rarely gets laid out directly in areview Do you hope other people actually read the book We can all think ofbooks that we read as reviewers because we have to and whose achievement andmessage we applaud but that wed never urge our friends to take the time toread themselves Similarly other books may have big logical holes or messageswe find unconvincing but are nonetheless a ton of fun to read            So let me start by saying People should read Michael Linds new book Youand I Fred will no doubt find things we disagree about in the books messageI will try to explain in the next few days why I am unconvinced by the mostfundamental point the book tries to make But I will be satisfied if peopletake from the Book Club one point only which is that they should get hold ofthis book There is much more richness and subtlety to its content and argumentthan we can cover here            I know and respect Michael Lind He is productive versatile and above allutterly fearless He writes with a kamikaze spirit in the admirablesensetaking his argument as far as he can and not seeming to care about whomight be mad at him as a result Many people who write as fearlessly as Linddoes are often tempted to be contrarian just for the hell of it Think ofChristopher Hitchens debunking of  Mother Theresa And I was afraid thatthis would be my main reaction to Linds new book He would start by findingthe event that most people consider to have been a disaster and by sheervirtuosity try to show that actually it was a good idea and a big success            But the tone I feared of being contrarian for its own sake turns up only alittle bit as well discuss later on in sections arguing that more or lesseveryone was wrong in assessments of Vietnam at the time and in Lindsproposal of a new regionalpsychology explanation of why the United States goesto war But the book as a whole is a calm wellresearched carefully reasonedgracefully written development of an argument that I finally disagree with butthat cannot at all be laughed off By the end of our installments here I willhave tried to convince Book Club members that this book has the wrong title Itshould have been called Vietnam The Understandable War  Lind does avery impressive job of showing why people who werent idiots and werent warcriminals made decisions that turned out so badly through the s He doesnot convince me that it was Necessary in the sense that policy makers at thetime had no better options            But thats for later installments Let me wrap up this one and suggest someareas for discussion and disagreement in three ways             What the book basically says The heart of Linds argument is thatthe Cold War was a real war the third world war of the twentieth centuryThe Soviet Union and its pawns and allies really wanted to expand theirideological military and territorial influence and they really were engagedin a winnertakeall contest with the United States and its allies forsupremacy Because of nuclear weapons the United States and the Soviet Unioncould not afford to do what great rival empires would previously have done goto war over the places that really mattered to them in this case Europe andChinaTaiwanJapan Instead they tested each other constantly in proxy warsfor instance and over Taiwan These proxy fights mattered because real fightswere too dangerous            In all of these other cases Lind says the United States understood theimportance of winning or at least contesting the proxy fight mounting anairlift to Berlin arming Taiwan fighting in Korea making clear that it wouldresist any further push on these frontiers If the United States had not doneso he says then its world position would have fundamentally changed withserious consequences for it and the world No one would have believed in itswill to fight There would have been a bandwagon effect against it Vietnamin his view was not an exception to this pattern but a logicalnecessaryas he puts itcontinuation             Whats interesting about his argument Lind means to debunkminimal realism the argument that the United States should do only thosethings in the world that it really has to do because the great evils it mustavoid are overextension and overcommitment As applied to Vietnam this wouldmean staying out of a fight that was likely to go bad But Lind comes up with amemo claiming that in  George Kennan had made the same argumentaboutKorea There was really no way to preserve it from the Communists in the longrun so it would be better to look the other way if the Russians or Chinesetried to take over A period of Russian domination while undesirable ispreferable to continued American involvement in that unhappy area Assumingthat the memo is presented in context it is interesting to say the leastThere are dozens of similar discoveries             Where I think he has not made the sale Lind recognizes that anecessary defense of South Vietnam would have cost many Americanlivesbecause the North Vietnamese the Chinese and the Soviets had so muchat stake in the conflict Because of the casualties Lind says the UnitedStates would eventually have had to leave Vietnam anyway The quiteunderstandable nature of American politics is that support for a war fallswhen casualties rise            Nonetheless Lind says the strategy of maximal realism means it wouldhave been better to have started the defense and continued it until thecasualties became too high for domestic politics to bear than to have takenthe minimal realism course of not starting the fight            This really is the crux of the necessary argument better to have foughtand withdrawn than never to have fought at all This is where I disagree withMichael Lindand with you Fred Im guessing Reading this book helped me seethat I am a minimal realist Heres a place we might start Do you agree withthis characterization of Linds argument And do you agree with him that it wasworth having made the start even if the end was likely to be bad
