                                 Whos the Wimp            European reporting of the NATO war against Yugoslavia reflected mountingconfusion Wednesday over the way ahead The Italian and German newspapersprominently reported their countries firm opposition to the use of groundtroops following a meeting in Italy between the German and Italian heads ofgovernment The FrankfurterAllgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt also reported on their front pages that GermanChancellor Gerhard Schrder did not rule out an Italianproposed bombing pausein the event of a UN Security Council resolution supporting the G peaceconditions LaRepubblica of Rome and Corriere della Sera of Milan both gave frontpage treatmentto new peace feelers from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Each said theSerbs are now ready to accept the G conditions            InLondon the liberal Guardian led on stark differences among the NATO allies onwar strategy It said a rift was opening between the more hawkish governmentsin London and Washington and anxious European allies desperate for domesticpolitical reasons for a diplomatic and political breakthrough But theconsistently hawkish Times of London led on popular protests in southern Serbiaagainst Milosevics prosecution of the war This was clearly intended tostrengthen the case for intensified military action The Times said inan editorial that the growing demoralisation of Serb troops should beammunition reinforcing the case for the immediate use in combat of AmericasApache attack helicopters as part of a more precise and sophisticated militarystrategy to drive Serb forces out of Kosovo Despite President Clintonswidely reported refusal to rule out the use of ground troops the Timescontinued to portray him as a wimp Leadership for the moment lies withLondon it said            In theDaily Telegraph  another hawkish conservative newspaper politicalcommentator Boris Johnson wrote Wednesday on the oped page that all the talkof British Prime Minister Tony Blair as Blair the hawk was a giganticcandyfloss illusion created by his Downing Street spin doctors We are now inthe blame game he wrote and Mr Blair is simply positioning himself Blairhas never publicly spoken out in favor of an invasion of Kosovo but thanks tomedia manipulation he is now in a winwin situation If NATO does prevailand every single Serb soldier is driven from Kosovo and every last refugee isrepatriated then Blairs brows will be crowned with the laurels owed to theman who urged the Alliance on Johnson wrote And if NATO fails Blair willbe able to blame the flaccidity of the Americans and of the Draft Dodger inparticular            According to a report from Washington Wednesday in the Jerusalem Post  the Clintonadministration is quietly euphoric about the election of Labor Party leaderEhud Barak as the new prime minister of Israel There was some euphoria inEurope too The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung splashed the headlineBarak Promises Rapid Progress in the Middle East Peace Process and DieWelt said that his election arouses new hope worldwide for peace InFrance Le Monde sheadline was Israel A Massive Vote for Peace and Le Figaro s said BarakWants To Relaunch the Peace Le Monde  in an editorial titled IsraelThe Good News said there are now grounds for hope But in Britain there wasmore skepticism The Daily Telegraph  for example said in an editorialthat the election was not a referendum on peace It was a personalbareknuckled contest fought and lost on the banalities of local politicsThe Times said there can now be progress toward peace but only if allsides are willing to subordinate rhetoric to realism The Guardian saidthat if Barak cant deliver peace who can If he cant the prospects aregrim            Benjamin Netanyahu got bad press practically everywhere Haaretz said in itseditorial Wednesday that he and the recalcitrant politicalfringes to which he was captive had effectively frozen the Oslo agreements butthat Barak now has a renewed opportunity to make peace with the Palestiniansand to attain a real peace with all our neighbors with Syria at the head TheJerusalem Post s editorial said however that Baraks landslide was notonly a function of his opponents failures but of Netanyahus success Thepaper said Netanyahu came into office as leader of the opposition to the OsloAccords he is leaving having brought the Likud solidly and irreversibly intothe Oslo camp By resolving the peaceandsecurity debate in Oslos favorNetanyahu made himself obsolete and broke the historic deadlock over the peaceprocess            TheArab worlds reaction to Baraks victory was generally suspicious An editorialin the Syrian statecontrolled newspaper Tashrin called the Netanyahuregime a threeyear nightmare and said Barak should make drastic changes inIsraels positions regarding a full withdrawal from occupied Arab lands and ajust and inclusive peace based on UN resolutions The Syria Timesexpressed some optimism but the main thrust of Arab press comment wasnegative A number of Arab columnists argued that while Netanyahu alienated theUnited States with his behavior the peaceloving label that has already beenattached to Barakeven though he has done nothing yet to earn itmight allowhim to pursue much the same policies while retaining Western support            ThePalestinian PanArab daily alQuds alArabi went so far as to suggest that the day mightyet come when Palestinians will look back on the days of Netanyahu withsomething approaching nostalgia The Saudi daily Asharq alAwsat said itfeared that Barak might prove to be an even bigger headache for the Arabs thanNetanyahu for he will pursue much the same hardline policies as hispredecessor but with Western backing Jordanian commentator Fakhri Kawaraccused statecontrolled Arab media of having lulled people into the delusionthat the only obstacle to the peace process was Netanyahu and that if Barakwon the elections he would prove to be the great savior who rids thePalestinian people of their ordeal But he wrote in the Amman dailyalRai that the Arabs have learned from bitter experience that Laborand Likud agree on essentials share the same expansionist and hegemonicagenda and differ only in style The daily alKhaleej of the UnitedArab Emirates also wondered whether anything has really changed in IsraelBarak the pianist has already started playing out of tune it said And ifhe finds anyone among us to sing along with him then we can bid what remainsof peace one thousand goodbyes
