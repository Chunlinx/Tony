                 okay well why dont you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you   do you have any elderly relatives currently in uh in a nursing home now   yes i do   do you i have a grandmother shes a hundred and two   oh my gosh   shell be a hundred and three in August   uhhuh   and we decided not to put her in a nursing home she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her   uhhuh   she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties   right   she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age   right   ive seen them in the shes been there ten years now and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything i think i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home   yeah   and they needed some quality care i would put someone in a nursing home   right my motherinlaw finally they had to make a family decision theres seven children in my husbands family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town and she has Alzheimers it was getting where she was getting things dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate its a small town and   umhum   she happens to room with one of the doctors mothers and then shes got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesnt nobody thought she would adjust but shes adjusted beautifully   oh well thats good oh that is great   but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in Colorado shes been taking care of him i dont know how much longer this can last and at that point because he requires round the clock he cant do anything without her he doesnt know when to take his medicine and its really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for uh my brothers are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one you know where i can go see it i id be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado and   why yeah im sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas   yes and some of them are limited care too where people can do uh like they have apartment styles but that wouldnt work for him i think hes beyond that where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctors are available if they need them and allows   umhum i i i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin   yeah yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is   where   but   and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper   right   it it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care and thats the sad part about it   yeah right yeah i see uh yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in Colorado its interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so thats probably what would happen   umhum i think thats what most people do you just have to give it everything away   yeah its unfortunate   i i i work at a brokerage firm and i have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home   right yeah its frightening and i guess uh i dont know how old you are im forty six you know were the generation moving into this and i dont know how our kids are gonna take care of us   i cant imagine im twenty nine and everybody in my familys always had we dont have any children everybody that has has them later in life so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties   you know yeah yeah   so i mean theyre not  that far away   right yeah i also fill in my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and hes still living at home and i dont know how hes ever going to get on his own the way things are   oh i know   and so its kind of squeezed you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay   it but yeah most people arent   but you see these people in their seventies yeah most arent thats the problem   and thats the bad thing i would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one   thats incredible   and just did everything and it but most people arent like
