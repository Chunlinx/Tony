        okay what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful     have a big family i guess thats a start     well i guess so       have you had any in the last how well how old are you   twenty five so i just got married   okay so you have you have been to some family reunions perhaps   right every four years on one side of my family they plan on having um like my parents grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids   now how long in advance do they uh let them know   well we plan on it its like the third weekend in August so its every four years and so   uhhuh so they all know it   yeah and then you know arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know um food and whose whose staying where because a lot of people from are from down here in Texas and uh a lot of my family is in Indiana thats where im originally from   uhhuh uhhuh yes   so um  we usually meet like at my uncles cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it   well that sounds like fun do they all have the small children too that come   yeah pretty much   so all ages   yeah and uh   you know theres some my age and then there are some a lot younger an about four generations i guess   well my husband has uh on one side has an extended family   uhhuh   and they dont ever plan it like as like you do i think if you can count on it every four years then   uhhuh   people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because theyre rather socially active too   uhhuh yeah   and so it has it seems that by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there if they dont you know theyll say oh were planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and were already locked in but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them   uhhuh   my family uh my parents are the youngest of very large families   oh   therefore they dont have many people left   yeah   and uh the few previous ones ive had uh i havent known many of those people but uh in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family and thats been very nice with uh i have one sister and three brothers   uhhuh   and theyre only three out of five of us who have children   oh   so uh we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other and thats kind of nice because my husbands family reunions are so large   yeah uhhuh   and they dont see each other very often we dont really know many of them   yeah thats kind of bad   it really is theyre fun theyre a lot of fun but uh still uh theyre not done on a regular basis     yeah   and uh you kind of forget what happened  and who they were from the time before   yeah yeah its its fun getting together with immediate family a lot of my cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that so   uh those are the ones that are in Texas   um no the ones in Indiana uhhuh   or you go to Indiana on that uhhuh where in Indiana   Lafayette   Lafayette i dont know where i used to live in Indianapolis   yeah its a little north of Indianapolis about an hour   yeah yeah its very pretty country in there i think its gorgeous   uhhuh so   well i uh when is your next one uh scheduled now   uhhuh well its like the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when i graduated from college so i guess about two more years   yes well and do you think youll have a baby to take back with you           uh maybe i dont know two more years i dont know probably   maybe   i mean you need another milestone you know   yeah i guess thats thats what i mean ive been married now for about nine months so that was another milestone i guess   yes well im sure and have then all of your family probably has not met your husband     um yeah hes from Indiana so they all met yeah   oh is he and and hes living your both living in Sherman   yeah   do you work to TI uhhuh and does he   uhhuh no hes trying to get in med school   uhhuh well we dont either but uh i have a friend who uh is working on this project   so oh really   yes and   are they getting all the data they need   well i dont know uh i i have a hard time getting uh people on the telephone   oh really   uhhuh getting through to anybody sometimes i call off and on all day   huh   but anyway uh i guess were supposed to be talking about family reunions arent we  but i got off that     well weve kind of exhausted everything i guess   yes well um i think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes   oh okay   and uh uh we both look forward to going to our next reunions im sure   oh yeah           but it has been fun talking to you   well you too and maybe ill talk to you again okay byebye   thank you okay good byebye
