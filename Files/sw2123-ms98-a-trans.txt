          so what kind of eating out do you prefer do you like     uh i dont know uh medium priced restaurants usually  not anything too nice because we have a four year old   uhhuh oh really   so i usually like things that cater to children   things that dont cost too much but you get your moneys worth   yeah and are loud so when he gets loud its not too it doesnt bother the other people   uhhuh but dont dont you   lots of fast food too i hate to admit it but   yeah but dont dont you like to get away from it all every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime   oh yeah yeah then we go to someplace nicer quieter   something with uh a cuisine thats a little bit you know more sophisticated like an Italian or French restaurant or something like that   umhum  yeah theres uh Biraporettis is one of our favorites its real nice its Italian   uhhuh   its nice and dark and quiet so it just kind of depends on the occasion   yeah   what do you like to do   well i i personally dont like to go to Italian restaurants because  im Italian and      so thats just like everyday food for you huh   well not really because you know i live i live here in a dorm i i still go to college but   oh   i i kind of dont eat Italian food if unless i go home because my mom cooks Italian food and its like you know the you know she i i think that she cooks the best so theres no reason for me to go out and pay enormous sum for something thats just not as good   hm yeah hers probably would be the best   yeah  but you know i also like the  the fast food places like Taco Bell because you can get a lot of food for cheap prices   oh yeah thirty nine cents or whatever for those little tacos yeah my son likes those yeah   yeah fifty nine cents yeah so you knows yeah its its something that you know we we go there every Sunday  me and my roommate go there every Sunday you know with our hangover         from Saturday and we go to uh Taco Bell and get the tacos you know its something its its cheap you dont have to spend a lot of money   yeah and it tastes pretty much i mean i like the way it it taste good and its fast i like that too   yeah yeah yeah   well i hate to cut this short but i think i better get back to work   oh okay   so thanks for calling bye   yeah bye
