                            The study by Planche et al  provides important new information addressing        intracellular volume depletion in children with severe childhood malaria but does not        address the question of whether intravascular volume depletion hypovolemic shock is        present Using sophisticated methodology to determine total body water and extracellular        water they demonstrate a  deficit in total body water and an  deficit of        intracellular water providing an important indication of the volumes of fluid that may be        required to optimize hydration The data however do not address the degree of filling of        the intravascular compartment nor should they be used to answer the question about the        state of tissue and organ perfusion Indeed we believe that these new data present no        conflict with our previously reported findings Using methods to study critical illness        physiology that are widely employed within pediatric intensive care units for        interpretation of circulatory status we have demonstrated evidence for hypovolemia in         Kenyan children with severe malaria complicated by metabolic acidosis  Our children        were younger had longer capillary refilling times  s lower central venous        pressures mean  cm H         O and higher creatinines  moll all features of compensated        hypovolemic shock Furthermore hypotension systolic BP   mm Hg was present in         of children with severe acidosis base deficit  These findings also indicate        important baseline differences in two cohorts of children studied We agree that        reconsideration of guidelines for acute fluid management is warranted particularly when        current recommendations await an adequate evidence base Nevertheless conflicting opinions        on the question of volume status in children with severe malaria can be satisfactorily        resolved only through prospective randomized trials that include both fluid resuscitation        and control groups While the design and conduct of such trials will involve considerable        challenges optimal fluid management will never be resolved on the basis of theoretical        consideration alone
