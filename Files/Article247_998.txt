                                 If Not Affirmative Action What                        Dear Andrew            The other day you referred to affirmative action as reverse racialdiscrimination which in my view characterizes it most inaccurately Thenyesterday you joshed about the Catholic allmale priesthood as the ultimateaffirmative action program as if men of all people had been the victim ofdiscrimination for which the monopoly on ordination was a recompense Ratherthan rant and rave Im saving that for my column due this morning Id liketo know what your plan is for remedying racial discrimination in this countryIn particular Im thinking of the story out at Berkeley where affirmativeaction has been banned and where only around  blacks out of plusadmittees have been offered a place in next years class a huge drop theHispanic number was also small In an interesting letter to the Washington Post earlier this week Rene Redwood notedthat  of the rejected African American and Latino applicantshad gradepoint averages of  and SAT scores of more than  How can that beBecause a student can get a higher grade point average if he or she isfortunate enough to go to a high school that offers a full range of advancedplacement courses which poor urban school districts are less likely to do            We are not talking about differences of ability here We are talking aboutstudents having had unequal opportunities to demonstrate that ability Askingthat disparate opportunity be taken into account is not a preference            Redwood argues that affirmative action is one tool for breaking the chainof unfairness How do you propose to break that chain If a good student cantget extra points because their school doesnt offer extra courses why is itdiscrimination to take that into account            CheersKatha
