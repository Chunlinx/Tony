        all right well well go ahead and start with you and your opinion     well um in and i think what it is in this country is that we have this uh despite all the complaints we have about government we essentially have a great deal of faith that despite uh any election things really arent going to change  dramatically   uhhuh   based on any given election and there really no one gets all excited over politics um over the the i mean you think of some countries where theyve changed uh um you know itll have a a coup or some ridiculous form of government there may change uh every few years like for an example would be the governments South American governments   right   but here its its very stable and i  theres   yeah   nothing really to get all that excited over but maybe people should get a little excited and   yeah   and make some changes   yeah i think i think that has a lot to do with it like you said you know unless theres something really controversial no one ever votes   right right yeah people will vote presidential elections   just umhum   um you know a local election that may have some great import but uh       you know over all people dont have a whole lot to to worry about when it comes to politics   yeah i think i think that has a lot to do with it that and theyre just lazy kind of   yeah theyre that   i for instance i havent voted since i was eighteen just like im twenty two now and i dont live at i live out of the state that im registered to vote in and its just and like you said unless theres something really important i just dont take the time   yeah well that thats just it im im twenty four and im in the military   uhhuh   and uh im a um registered to vote in Pennsylvania and i only voted once it was in uh well the last presidential election   uhhuh right   you know and that was just because you know its  its too much of a hassle to get the absentee ballot   exactly   or even to to drive back there which is what i did that time i actually went and visited my folks and voted the same time but uh   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   um in my position i  well in addition to that and the local political scene i dont know enough about it anymore to even feel that my vote means anything   right and for me im just afraid   because i dont know the the candidates um   right exactly im afraid id vote for somebody who i didnt even you know agree with   right yeah   just because i wanna vote or whatever   right right but i i think um thats all things that that its all my own laziness though   yeah oh i agree thats probably same thing   because  first of all i should take the time to find out about the candidates i probably should talk to my mom and dad and who do live there and get the feeling for what uh for what they are you know have been doing and uh or for what what they feel the candidates are doing and uh um maybe do a little looking into it myself its not like any of this is any big secret   uhhuh     but its just a question of taking the time and its theyre   yeah   higher priorities right   right you know i think its really interesting too like with this the latest election in Louisiana where there was the guy who had been part of the Ku Klux Klan how much yeah how much interest that brought and how many people   right David Duke yeah yeah that was interesting there was quite a few people in this area that had contributed to his campaign   uhhuh   and im in upstate New York and this is kind of a redneck area what the local newspapers um printed they somehow got a list of all of Dukes contributors     oh really   and they printed a list in the newspaper of everybody that gave money to that campaign   oh my   you wanna talk about getting getting even with them you know that was i thought that was beautiful  thats justice     right yeah  well i think its interesting how it takes something like that though   whats that   i think its interesting how it takes something like that to get people on edge about ah politics   yeah yeah oh yeah yeah you know people you think about having somebody uh somebody like that in power and the you know and that shocks them all but then um flip side of that is the same people go around um harboring their own racist racist practices and race race you know you ask those same people um how they treat   uhhuh   people and all that and you probably would not get a very favorable answer out of them   right yeah i agree   but the idea the merit the thought of somebody who publicly was a member of the Ku Klux Klan is pretty repulsive being in a position of power like that   yeah right   so   well is there anything you think we can do to make it better or to uh   what we can do to make it better right that thats hard because um i thought in the last or not not this last years election but the one a year ago that they were gonna that there was gonna be some serious turn around of the incumbents and all that the people are finally fed up   uhhuh
