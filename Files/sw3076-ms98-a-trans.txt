                well well Pat have did you vote in the last election   most assuredly   oh you did   yes maam ive voted in every major election since i turned twenty one   oh thats great well why do you think people dont   dont always vote for somebody i sometimes vote against somebody   that makes sense too     i think that a lot of it is uh i know that my late husband was simply indifferent he didnt feel like he had any say there was too many people too many  other votes for example uh you know hed say well look you and i see different sides of the fence if i go vote youll cancel my vote       i said i sure will he said so i just wont vote i said then mine counts because you could cancel mine too   and then does   yeah i think i think thats a lot of people just indifferent  i know that ive moved around a lot in the past um three years ive had three different addresses each time i change jurisdictions or whatever   uhhuh uhhuh sure   so i just havent because i mean graduate school or whatever so i havent kept track of it i did when i lived steadily in one community i always i voted   uhhuh   but this past time i didnt well actually i voted it for the presidential election but then i didnt vote uh i guess in the two year for uh some legislators and things and   uhhuh well characteristically in some in the local elections   uhhuh   typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue   right uhhuh   if i do not feel very strongly about an issue then i see no reason to go vote   uhhuh right yeah and thats probably one reason why i voted in the the last election but not really this one because this one really didnt matter that much   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   yeah its probably true   well of course of course listening to government the instructors youll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything     well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national issues   well thats the way you get to national and thats the way you make changes about your neighborhood   uhhuh right oh i definitely think so   uh i know that i have been involved in preparing and in in uh carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place even something so simple as getting a street light   uhhuh   in between lights on the end of the block but it makes a big difference when its the difference in having a child run over in the dark and uh   right uhhuh yeah thats true yeah   it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action and thats completely unnecessary In another particular case they were trying to   uhhuh   put in a um senior citizens home   uhhuh   in in an area very near our neighborhood but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes and its less savory   uhhuh   okay and that i was just very i felt very strongly about that those people simply did not have access to safety to security and they were at risk   uhhuh   and it was for elderly people who lived alone and they were going to put a cluster of of houses there for them but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety   no most now thats true   and all it all it did was to in my judgment make them easier targets uhhuh yeah easier targets and so we we did get a petition together and we very strongly resisted it and   prepare them to be victims yes yeah   and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the street   uhhuh right side of the tracks yeah   and uh it it i think that theyre theyre much more comfortable there   uhhuh did they   uh i havent seen too much crime in my neighborhood although we have a good crime watch program but its its very serious just across the street   uhhuh yeah did um did you think i know that Texass last gubernatorial uh election probably brought out a lot of voters   well   did that did that seem to because that really that got national attention national attention i guess having a woman governor running against a man and whatever   well no i dont think it had to do to with woman running against man i think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier   uhhuh   and thats it it was a dirty election people were calling each other uh names and every bit of the trash it was a it was a dirty campaign   yeah   it was a dirty mud slinging campaign   well you know whats funny up here uh i live i see a lot of Virginia news and i guess uh   uhhuh   Senator Robb and Governor Wilder are active right here and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on and the people in Virginia are complaining see Robb is married to Lynda Bird Johnson   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and the people in Virginia are complaining that he is hes using Texas politics in Virginia and theyre really complaining big time because they said that we dont have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in Texas all the time   uhhuh   so you you guys were getting   well of course now thats not all the time weve had some pretty   yeah you were getting slandered i think   we were having some pretty healthy uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but i historically Texas has had   uhhuh uhhuh   mud and muddier campaigns i mean its just i think that eventually you know the better people have sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage unfortunately thats not always the way it should be   yeah uhhuh   you dont want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage you want to do the one who can do the most good   do the most good yeah thats true   and uh   i guess thats why i know that um im previously from Pennsylvania and Dick Thornburg whos now the attorney general is going to run for senator because uh John Heinz a senator from Pennsylvania died in an airplane crash   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and i know that theyre expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide Dick Thornburg into as into the senate   uhhuh   because they dont like  the governor the governors political appointee or whatever and theyre almost expecting landslide   uhhuh uhhuh   out uh turn out right now for  for that election   okay so you so you see thats very negative motivation isnt it   uhhuh yeah   isnt that too bad we really could use a little positive motivation hey we think this guy can really make some changes and were going to support him that was true in a lot of cases in in a couple of the older sixties campaigns   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   uh   what in Texas was that when you   no im talking about national campaigns yeah uh even when John Kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him but there were people who believed he could make a difference now   thats thats true yeah right   thats not to say what has transpired or what really was im saying thats how it was perceived   uhhuh thats right thats perception thats true     and uh   because the those were big political that was a big um turn out election   oh yeah absolutely and and it was people going to vote for i think more than those who voted against   uhhuh uhhuh   i know i know that in my own uh area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didnt go to vote against uh a politician as they did a little bit later when Nixon was running they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases   uhhuh yeah   but i think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people and they voted their convictions   uhhuh uhhuh well i think that also happened with Ronald Reagan   absolutely youre right   he was he was landslided in and people really saw that was   umhum
