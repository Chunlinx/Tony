                    Background        Atrial fibrillation is thought to be more common in        chronic dialysis patients than in the general population        although population based comparisons are not available           Atrial fibrillation is worthy of separate study from        other dysrythmias due to unique aspects of its natural        history and management    Risk factors for atrial        fibrillation may be more common in dialysis and include        age cardiac enlargement and an abnormal        calciumphosphorous metabolism       However the        incidence risk factors and associated mortality for        hospitalized atrial fibrillation have not been reported for        a national population of chronic dialysis patients        Previous studies have also not assessed the effects of        cardioprotective medications on atrial fibrillation in        dialysis patients The management of chronic dialysis        patients with atrial fibrillation is controversial since        studies of atrial fibrillation have generally excluded        patients with chronic renal failure     We therefore        performed an historical cohort study of the United States        Renal Data System USRDS Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality        Study DMMS Wave  which includes information on blood        pressure lipid levels medications and other important        clinical data Our objectives were to determine the        incidence and risk factors for hospitalized atrial        fibrillation primary hospitalization discharge ICD code        x occurring after the initiation of dialysis but        prior to receipt of renal transplantation as well as        determine risk factors for mortality after hospitalized        atrial fibrillation                    Methods                  Statistical analysis          Univariate analysis was performed with ChiSquare          testing for categorical variables Fisher exact test used          for violations of Cochrans assumptions and students          ttest for continuous variables Mann Whitney test was          used for variables without a Gaussian distribution          Variables with borderline significance p value            in univariate analysis and those thought likely to have          a clinical relationship with atrial fibrillation such as          cardioprotective medications and blood pressure were          entered into the multivariate models In addition          variables thought to have a likely clinical relationship          with atrial fibrillation were also entered into the          multivariate model in accordance with established          epidemiological principles    Stepwise forward          likelihood ratio method Cox proportional hazards          analysis was used to assess the association between          baseline factors and hospitalized atrial fibrillation          independent of other factors Loglog plots were          inspected to verify the existence of proportional          hazards Estimated hazard ratios HR along with          corresponding  confidence intervals CI and p values          are reported for all regression covariates Stepwise          logistic regression was used to test the independent          association of patient factors with preexisting coumadin          and cardioselective betablocker use using the same          covariates as Cox Regression above The association of          atrial fibrillation with mortality as a timedependent          variable was tested by Cox nonproportional hazards          regression analysis as previously described             Hierarchically wellformed models were used in the          assessment of interaction terms    Collinearity          diagnostics were evaluated both from the output of the          statistical procedures and by manual generation of models          including only one of several variables with close          relationships for example congestive heart failure and          left ventricular hypertrophy which was assessed by chest          Xray electrocardiogram and echocardiography          Propensity scores     have been used to adjust for          confounding in baseline medication use Since this method          is primarily undertaken to assess uniformity of risk          among strata model fitting was also tested by fitting          models to a  random sample of the study population          and then running the same model for the remaining  of          the population to test for agreement                            Results        A total of  patients were included in the DMMS Wave         cohort Of these  patients had valid dates for        starting dialysis in  From this cohort  had        sufficient information to calculate followup times During        the time of the study period  patients were        hospitalized for a primary discharge diagnosis of atrial        fibrillation with an incidence density of  person        years        Use of digoxin and particularly levothyroxine was common        in dialysis patients Among other antiarrhythmic agents        only amiodarone was used by more than  patients at        baseline and so is the only other agent reported Among        the study population cardioselective betablockers were        used by  of patients hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation vs  of all other patients digoxin was        used by  of patients hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation vs  of all other patients and coumadin        was used by  of patients hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation vs  of all other patients        Characteristics of the study population including        univariate associations with hospitalized atrial        fibrillation are summarized in Table  Table shows the        percentage of patients who were hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation by risk group As shown there were marked        disparities by age blood pressure dialysis modality and        history of left ventricular hypertrophy        Table shows significant factors associated with        hospitalized atrial fibrillation in multivariate analysis        by Cox Regression Factors positively associated with        atrial fibrillation were advanced age    years vs        age  years hemodialysis vs peritoneal dialysis        and baseline digoxin use Predialysis systolic blood        pressure had a U shaped association with atrial        fibrillation with highest risk associated with the low and        high extremes of blood pressure Figure  However        neither predialysis diastolic blood pressure nor        postdialysis blood pressure were associated with the risk        of atrial fibrillation nor were serum albumin levels No        medications except digoxin were independently associated        with atrial fibrillation There were also no significant        interactions between terms specifically between        medications laboratory data or dialysis modality in        patients with preexisting coronary heart disease        There were  total deaths in the cohort through         November  Of the  patients hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation  died during the study period Mean        followup was    years Unadjusted survival after        atrial fibrillation and for the entire cohort is also shown        in Table  Survival was significantly worse after atrial        fibrillation in Cox nonproportional hazards regression        analysis adjusted hazard ratio for mortality          confidence interval  p   The leading        cause of death among patients hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation was unknown  followed by cardiac arrest        of unknown cause  cardiac arrthymia  acute        myocardial infarction  atherosclerotic heart disease         cardiomyopathy  and stroke  Of patients        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation the most common        secondary diagnosis was hypertensive heart disease         followed by congestive heart failure         Table shows Cox Regression analysis of factors        significantly associated with mortality in patients with        hospitalized atrial fibrillation Only two factors the        baseline use of coumadin Figure  and higher systolic        blood pressure were associated with a lower risk of        mortality after hospitalization for atrial fibrillation Of        note calcium channel blockers specifically        nondihyropyridine calcium channel blockers were not        significantly associated with mortality in patients with        atrial fibrillation In fact the hazard ratio for        mortality of patients with atrial fibrillation using        nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers was         although the p value was  and  confidence intervals        were  Dihydropyridine calcium blockers as well        as ACE inhibitors and aspirin were also not significantly        associated with mortality in patients with atrial        fibrillation Because use of coumadin might be biased by        association with factors favorably associated with        mortality logistic regression analysis was performed to        assess factors independently associated with use of        coumadin However only three factors were independently        associated with the use of coumadin left ventricular        hypertrophy on echocardiography adjusted odds ratio          CI  p   chronic obstructive lung        disease adjusted odds ratio   CI  and        aspirin use adjusted odds ratio   CI         p   When Cox regression analysis was performed        limited to patients who had left ventricular hypertrophy        chronic obstructive lung disease or did not use aspirin N        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation   coumadin use        was still significantly associated with improved survival        adjusted hazard ratio   CI  p          Models were robust to testing on random samples of the        study population  vs the remaining                     Discussion        In agreement with some previous studies in the general        population  and preliminary reports from the USRDS           atrial fibrillation was associated with increased        mortality among chronic dialysis patients In the general        population cardiovascular events and not thromboembolic        events are the most common cause of death after atrial        fibrillation    in agreement with the findings of the        present analysis However it is also possible that        thromboembolic events could have been underdiagnosed due to        a low index of suspicion for thromboembolism in chronic        dialysis patients      because of the high number        of deaths with an unknown cause the low rate of autopsies        in this population or a combination of these factors        Vazquez et al    provide further evidence that causes of        death may underestimate the incidence of embolic events in        chronic dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation They        reported that  of chronic dialysis patients with atrial        fibrillation suffered thromboembolic events at one year of        followup        Risk factors for atrial fibrillation in chronic dialysis        patients were consistent with established risk factors              except for the association with hemodialysis        compared with those on peritoneal dialysis In addition        to age left ventricular hypertrophy is also a        wellestablished risk factor for atrial fibrillation in the        general population Many markers for cardiovascular        comorbidity were associated with atrial fibrillation in        univariate analysis Table  but not in multivariate        analysis Table  While the efficacy of cardioversion in        successful conversion of atrial dysrythmias may be helpful        in some settings it is less useful than the duration of        the dysrythmia in patients with atrial fibrillation           However it has never been established whether the same        guidelines apply to dialysis patients The present study        could not assess whether cardiac enlargement affected the        success rate of cardioversion in dialysis patients        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation        Predialysis systolic blood pressure exhibited a U        shaped relationship with the risk of atrial fibrillation        which is similar to the U shaped relationship of blood        pressure with mortality and other cardiovascular events in        chronic dialysis patients Recent reports have indicated        that pulse pressure is a more predictive indicator of        cardiovascular events in dialysis patients than either        systolic or diastolic blood pressure separately           However pulse pressure was not independently associated        with atrial fibrillation in our analysis        Hemodialysis was associated with a significantly higher        risk of atrial fibrillation than peritoneal dialysis in the        present study It is possible this association represents        bias since hemodialysis patients present for medical care        much more frequently than peritoneal dialysis patients and        asymptomatic atrial fibrillation is more readily detected        However there are legitimate reasons why atrial        fibrillation might occur more frequently on hemodialysis        than on peritoneal dialysis First Foley et al        demonstrated that progressive cardiac enlargement was more        frequent in hemodialysis patients than peritoneal dialysis        patients    although these findings were not replicated        in a Japanese study    Other investigators have        confirmed that LVH progresses despite adequate blood        pressure control in hemodialysis patients    Also        hospitalized congestive heart failure is more common in        hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis patients especially        for those on the renal transplant waiting list    The        typical regimen for hemodialysis is likely far less        physiologic than peritoneal dialysis Residual renal        function may also be preserved longer in patients on        peritoneal dialysis although this is controversial            Some or all of these factors may therefore mediate the        higher risk of atrial fibrillation associated with        hemodialysis        The effectiveness of coumadin for atrial fibrillation in        chronic dialysis patients has not been assessed previously        In fact previous reports considered chronic renal failure        a contraindication to the use of anticoagulation in atrial        fibrillation    Wiesholzer et al concluded that        nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation was not an independent        risk factor for stroke in dialysis patients           Therefore Figure suggests several possibilities First        although the clinical indications for coumadin use in this        cohort were unknown coumadin is often given for a limited        period of time     after which it is often        discontinued in the absence of known predisposing factors        Therefore patients who were using coumadin at the time of        the study assessment and later discontinued it might not        have been taking coumadin at the time they were        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation negating a possible        beneficial association of coumadin with mortality after        hospitalization for atrial fibrillation Another        possibility is that many patients not taking coumadin at        baseline may have later been treated with coumadin after        hospitalization for atrial fibrillation Given the growing        evidence that dialysis patients in the modern era may        actually be hypercoagulable primarily due to defects of        the fibrinolytic system      clinical trials of        the use of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and        thromboembolic disorders are warranted Of note baseline        coumadin use in contrast to digoxin use was not        associated with hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and        therefore presumably was not a marker for patients with        preexisting atrial fibrillation        The decision to use coumadin in patients with atrial        fibrillation in whom NSR cannot be established is based on        an assessment of both their risk of serious bleeding and        their risk of stroke Coumadin therapy has been associated        with improved survival in patients with reduced LV systolic        dysfunction in the absence of dysrythmias as well        primarily through reduction in cardiovascular events rather        than reduction of thromboembolic events    This may be        one explanation for the association of coumadin use with        reduced mortality in chronic dialysis patients hospitalized        for atrial fibrillation in the present study                    Study limitations        The present study was observational and not randomized        and therefore associations should not be construed as        causative The study is a random sample of all hemodialysis        patients not the total population although the peritoneal        dialysis population was almost fully captured We did not        have access to information on treatment or conversion to        NSR in patients who were hospitalized for atrial        fibrillation nor did we have information on the type of        atrial fibrillation for which patients presented and how it        was classified within ACCAHAESC guidelines    We did        not have access to information on which patients had        selflimited episodes of atrial fibrillation vs those who        had persistent atrial fibrillation nor the duration or        presence of atrial fibrillation prior to hospitalization or        the study start We did not have information on left atrial        size other than the presence of LVH on echocardiography We        also did not have information on thyroid functions other        than baseline use of thyroxine alcohol use or        preexisting atrial dysrythmias Information bias could        have arisen due to mistakes in coding or spelling        especially for medications We were unable to follow        changes in variables over time Therefore we could not        follow changes in blood pressure laboratory values        dialysis adequacy or medications We could not assess        other factors that have shown to be associated with atrial        fibrillation such as hypokalemia or calcified        aorticmitral valves    although there are many        similarities between the risk factors for valvular heart        disease and atrial fibrillation in chronic dialysis        patients    Our use of atrial fibrillation as an        outcome variable required survival to reach        hospitalization and thus sudden death was not considered        as an outcome However causes of death especially if not        verified by autopsy are also of questionable validity in        comparison to the rates of total mortality         In summary the present observational nonrandomized        study confirms the high incidence and mortality of atrial        fibrillation in chronic dialysis patients Traditional risk        factors for atrial fibrillation such as older age were        confirmed Hemodialysis possibly due to a greater        frequency of progressive cardiac enlargement or more        frequent observation was also identified as a risk factor        for atrial fibrillation Of the greatest potential        importance the use of coumadin at the start of the study        was associated with lower mortality in patients later        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation These findings should        be confirmed in clinical trials                    Author contributions        KCA conceived the original
