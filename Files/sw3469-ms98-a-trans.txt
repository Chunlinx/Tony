                okay well what do you think about it   uh well immigration i know theyre really strict right now because my hundred husband is from out of the country and uh we had to go through a whole very long process to uh to assure the government that he was uh marrying me and not to be a resident here   umhum thats interesting yeah i think thats uh i think its a little crazy i worked with Spanish people   uhhuh   for about two years and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers   yeah thats true i mean you cant just come over to the country because uh you want to   right   you know thats not good enough you have to have a have to have a darn good reason of political or whatever     right exactly   its not a good not a good easy way to get in   yeah i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states   exactly my mother uh actually knew a woman uh in another state that used to marry men just never shed never even meet them and shed just get money for it   uhhuh oh youre kidding   huhuh so uh     sounds like a lot of fun yeah its amazing to me how how many things they would allow   uh   to occur before you know you can come in and   exactly but i mean with the new laws its really its tough now   right yeah its kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now you know i think   exactly well and you know uh my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life you know and they got here but now its a you know its so strict that you you cant just do that   uhhuh right exactly and i think its important that they you know they allow a good number of people in every year because really theyre the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we dont want to do   i agree   and i just i dont know i have personally i have a problem with it i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that theyre going to work and theyre going to be a good citizen that   exactly if theyre not going to be on welfare or or whatever theyre going to be a productive citizen   we shouldnt close our door yeah and you know i i believe that if someone goes on welfare thats when you you know send them back to their country   yeah but   and i think a lot of times were so busy trying to keep them out that were spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in and   well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been uh you know sent back to Mexico just to find their way back   yeah and thats thats what i think you know i i have to laugh because like i said i worked with a lot of those and theyd been deported two or three times and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas   thats right thats our money   or for any other time   yes thats true   but i think you know i think all in all theres a lot of improvements i think the general idea is good but but there could be some work done in the area   i i think i agree i agree   well good   yeah   anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about   uh boy this is spur of the moment um uh but i i dont really see any any uh changes that i think are really blatant right now other than i think they ought to take you know on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a um political refugee   yeah absolutely i think a lot of times we take you know basically who we want to because if you if you have connections its a lot easier to get in   exactly connections and money   yeah and i think you know it should be more of a thing thats based upon someones intent you know   yeah   and that it should be equal to all and then not like the United States basically its not who you know it doesnt it doesnt become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get in   i agree yeah well we got him past that but uh  theres i know theres a lot of other people out there   well great     would probably do a good job here   yep well lets see is there anything i believe in   i think thats it is this like a very short call   no im not sure how long theyre supposed to be but ive enjoyed it its good hearing your your point of view and i think thats neat i think we agree a lot on that and   thats true   ive learned something from it     well it was nice talking to you   well thanks im glad youre home you have a good evening all right   you too   thanks byebye   byebye
