                    Background        Control of gene expression is central to all cellular        processes Transcription factors TFs often function in        networks in which a regulatory protein controls the        expression of another which in turn may modulate the        expression of other regulatory loci or control genes        encoding structural proteins or enzymes These hierarchical        arrangements allow specific signals to be amplified and        provide the information necessary for given sets of genes        to be deployed with particular space and temporal patterns        Thus an emerging theme in regulation of gene expression is        the identification of regulatory networks in which TFs        participate to specify the temporal and spatial expression        of all genes in an organism A first step in making this        possible is the identification of the entire complement of        TFs and the corresponding         cis regulatory elements in the        promoters of all genes        The completion of the sequencing and annotation of the        entire         Arabidopsis genome    has provided        a unique opportunity to start exploring the regulatory        networks present in plants TFs are usually classified        according to the presence of conserved DNAbinding domains            The DNAbinding domain is responsible for        recruiting TFs to specific         cis regulatory DNA sequences in the        promoters of the genes they regulate In         Arabidopsis  previous studies        identified about  TF genes grouped into more than         families     Some of these families are specific to the        plant kingdom or have dramatically expanded in the plants        compared to the animals eg MYB and WRKY suggesting        that they may participate in regulatory networks unique to        the plants Other families are much larger in animals as        for example the homeodomain family Only a small fraction         of the          Arabidopsis TFs have been genetically        characterized and direct target genes for TFs ie genes        to which TFs bind and activate have been identified in        just a handful of those cases Despite the general interest        in investigating the function of all         Arabidopsis genes by year         httpwwwnsfgovpubsnsfnsfhtml and        the knowledge on the number and classification of         Arabidopsis TFs     no resource        is currently available to obtain all the         Arabidopsis TF sequences or        information on their possible binding sites While several        resources are available to search for putative         cis regulatory motifs in a DNA        sequence no initiative has been taken in carrying out this        process at a genomewide level For example PlantCARE        httpoberonrugacbePlantCAREindexhtml a         cis regulatory element database for        plants contains information about  different plant TF        binding sites in  promoters From these  binding        sites  correspond to dicots Clearly this information        is just a fraction of the total         cis regulatory regions present in         Arabidopsis         In the quest to determine Arabidopsis TF function and        establish the regulatory networks that control the        expression of all Arabidopsis genes the development of a        webbased resource that divides TFs into families and        allows the rapid download of any Arabidopsis TF sequence        and the fast identification of mutants linked to the        possible sequences to which these TFs may bind in the        Arabidopsis genome is of pressing urgency Providing these        resources and starting to link TFs to target genes is the        basic motivation behind the development of AGRIS Here we        describe AGRIS constituted by AtTFDB and AtcisDB AtTFDB        is a downloadable database of          Arabidopsis TF sequences with        information on available mutations in the corresponding        genes As information on the expression patterns of TFs is        generated the information will be added to AtTFDB The        first release of AtcisDB AtcisDB  contains an        annotation of the promoter sequences for all         annotated         Arabidopsis genes AtcisDB is linked        to AtTFDB when binding sites for specific transcription        factors have been identified Together AGRIS provides a        first step in establishing the regulatory networks that        regulate the expression of all Arabidopsis genes                    Results and Discussion                  Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server          AGRIS          AGRIS integrates data from a variety of different          sources see Methods section AGRIS currently consists          of two integrated databases AtTFDB and AtcisDB                          AtTFDB Database          AtTFDB consists of a collection of Arabidopsis TF          sequences protein and DNA grouped by family          Information on the TFs can be viewed through two portals          i by browsing the various families to get a complete          list of TF genes in that family or ii by searching for          a specific gene by locus ID in AtXgXXXX format or          using any word found in the description or family name          For each gene found through the search a description is          given and links are provided to display additional search          results from TIGR MATDB SALK and TAIR Nucleotide or          amino acid sequences for individual TF for entire          families or for the entire collection can be directly          downloaded in FASTA format There are also links to          complete alignments Hidden Markov Models and Motifs          files of each family for direct download          A previous analysis of the complete           Arabidopsis thaliana genome          sequence suggested the presence of about  TFs with          recognizable motifs     A search of the TAIR website          httpwwwarabidopsisorgindicated that very few TF          sequences can be retrieved using a search with the key          words transcription factor or regulatory protein In          addition only two TF families MYB  WRKY were          identified and listed within the gene family page          httpwwwarabidopsisorginfogenefamilygenefamilyhtml          Thus to identify TFs a combination of BLAST and motif          searches was used based on the available literature on          known TFs or on motifs conserved among TFs from a          family A few smaller families were identified directly          from published literature ieCCAATDr  EFDP          Many families were found through a domain search and          blast technique Publications were found through PubMed          and the conserved domain motif that characterizes each TF          family was identified Using the motif a Blast was          conducted in the TAIR website the resultant sequences          were then aligned and mismatches were discarded Another          approach especially for large families where very few          TFs had been identified was an iterative Blast approach          A few representative proteins were used to perform a          Blast on the TAIR website The resultant sequences with          an Evalue smaller than  were considered a good          match then the last sequence was used in a subsequent          Blast and so forth until all similar sequences were          identified then they were aligned and any mismatched          sequences were discarded There are some discrepancies          between the previously estimated number of transcription          factors per families from Riechmann et al and those          listed on AGRIS These may be explained due to further          genome refinement after the December  publication or          because of our more stringent analysis although we          continue to add more transcription factors on a daily          basis After identifying the sequences a script          performed an automatic gathering of information from          public online repositories using the list of gene names          to populate the database This database was curated          semiautomatically by discarding duplicated entries          unknown genes and outliers the last ones being          identified by hand looking at the alignments of the          sequences of each individual family In addition          transcription factors that were not readily aligned with          a family but have been documented and studied were          placed together in the appropriately named Orphans          Family The results included  transcription factors          which were subsequently placed into one of  TF          families The breakdown of transcription factors into          families and the queries used for their identification is          shown in Table                           AtcisDB Database          AtcisDB is an integrated database of promoter          sequences with annotations of           cis regulatory elements The          current version of AGRIS contains only  promoter          regions binding sites have also been identified in           regions and introns but they are limited in number and          for the time being not represented Users can search          AtcisDB for a specific gene promoter or the direct target          genes of a specific transcription factor The current          database version At           cis DB  consists of promoter          sequences of  annotated genes The length L          distribution of these promoter sequences are           sequences have L   nt  have L   nt           have L   nt and the rest have          L   nt Nearly  of the annotated genes are          located in headtohead direction sharing bidirectional          promoters of length less than  nt The transcriptional          regulation of such genes being organized as bidirectional          gene pairs and what distinguishing them from other          unidirectional promoter genes is mostly unclear          One of the main features of At           cis DB is mapping of experimentally          known and computationally predicted see Methods for          details TF binding sites to their respective gene          promoters and display in graphical form To date the          website contains mainly predicted binding sites but by          August   the goal is to integrate experimentally          proven binding sites highlighted to show their          significance In addition a web page is being developed          that will provide a complete list of transcription factor          binding sites and a reference for each While the          experimentally known           cis regulatory information is          rather limited the use of high throughput microarray          expression studies in recent times have generated          transcript profiles of           Arabidopsis genes so as to infer          the functions of known and putative TFs Chen           et al    have showed that the          promoter sequences of genes responsive to different          treatments are enriched with known TF binding sites for          those responses They also identified a novel promoter          motif in genes responding to a broad set of pathogen          infection treatments Klok           et al    identified genes          involved in lowoxygen response to           Arabidopsis root cultures by using          cDNA microarray experiments with similar sequence motifs          in the promoters of genes with similar expression          profiles Similar studies      found common binding          sites in the promoter regions of genes responsive to          various conditions AGRIS will be complemented by          extensive searches of publicly available microarray          expression data to include all such information about TFs          and their regulatory motifs present in their target gene          promoters          We also provide a web page at our database where the          users of At           cis DB can report back any of the          validated annotations of At           cis DB from their experiments This          facilitates the generation of a draftannotated version          of At           cis DB                          Database Queries Visualization and Analysis          Tools          A Web interface for AGRIS has been developed using the          JEE technology JSP and Servlet Users can search the          database and retrieve the promoter sequence and          annotation information of a specific gene in several          ways For example users can use a gene name or gene          symbol to search and retrieve the promoter of a specific          gene and a set of genes regulated by the same          transcription factor Web Figure  A typical search

  Locating Promoter Sequence on Arabidopsis            Genome            We downloaded the annotated coding sequences and the            chromosomal sequences from ftpftptigrorgupdated            April   We mapped the coding sequences to the            chromosomal sequences by BLAT     Then for each            gene if the upstream intergenic region is greater than             kb we retrieved the sequence upstream of ATG of            length  kb Otherwise we consider that intergenic            region as promoter of the downstream gene to exclude            any coding region of upstream genes We will repeat            this process immediately after the release of every new            annotation by TIGR so that the promoter sequences in            AtcisDB are based on latest annotations                                 Generation of a map of cisregulatory            sequences for all Arabidopsis promoters            We have collected consensusbinding sequences for            known transcript factors from literature and maintain            that information as a database in AtTFDB We are            providing a draft annotation of At             cis DB  by computational            methods We have developed computer programs to scan            the promoter sequences in At             cis DB for transcription factor            binding sites based on one of the following two            approaches             a Scanning for consensus binding            sites AtTFDB contains the TFs and their consensus            binding sites We have developed Perl scripts to scan            the promoters for consensus binding site occurrence             b Position Weight Matrix Methods            PWM to scan known binding sites We have prepared            positionweight matrices    of those             Arabidopsis transcription factors            for which at least  experimentally known binding            sites exist While the number of             Arabidopsis TFs with these            properties is still small it is rapidly growing PWMs            have been used to estimate the likelihood that a given            sequence binds to a specific TF     If a PWM            exists for a TF we follow approach b Otherwise            approach a is carried out We are refining these            annotations by combining information from the AtTFDB            database                                    Database schema          The database schema AtcisDB and AtTFDB are shown in          Figures and  Six tables are used to store the promoter          sequence and their cisregulatory element annotation          information           BindingSite table stores the transcription factor          binding sites information           TransFacInfo table stores the data of the          transcription factor information associated with binding          site table           PromoterSeq stores the data for promoter          sequence           GeneInfo stores the data of the gene annotation for          each promoter           PromoterInfo stores the coordinate information of          the promoter mapped on genome and relative information          for promoter annotation                          Web interface          A web interface was developed to allow user          interaction with the information in the databases The          web pages were developed using JavaServer
