        hello Ann   hello Chuck   um the other day i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling   umhum   and uh i was kind of interested to hear because they had some people from the EPA and lots of different places   umhum   and uh they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste   um i didnt think that was a new revelation   well its not too new   right so what what is is the EPA recommending now   oh they really didnt propose any solutions actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA   umhum   but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and and uh uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print   yeah   and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into  recycling theyve collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away   why thats a thats a common problem now that seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldnt recycle it anymore which isnt good for business on the other end either i suppose   yeah were doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here theres uh   umhum   weve actually got a kind of a nice set up weve got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that its not a fire hazard and make it into insulation   right   and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because theyre actually buying it and shipping it in from outside   well thats good   so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once youve collected it   right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean thats why they recycle the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that  uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh   umhum   i think theyre even putting it in the roadways these days and theyre making clothes now that are recycled like the recycled plastic Coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that   and theres a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was oh i cant remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill   umhum   and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing because he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them   oh really   he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause its its low weight but its high volume so it takes up a lot of space   right   and theres almost no energy theres very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but theres a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it   huh well its carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but  what   yeah and its more than even paper or something like that theres more energy in it per pound or whatever   what about emissions   well that was  he didnt deal with that he just said burn it he didnt talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so its not very practical is it   oh okay no well thats interesting i bet that was a good day at the uh conference then   yeah well real interesting   did it change anything for you   um not too much im uh i got a bit actually
