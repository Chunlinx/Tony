        okay Ron welcome to the net and uh what did you do about your last auto repair oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth     okay well Larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and and   um   a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights werent working properly it wasnt their fault but we they didnt run it we both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so   my goodness gracious thats   that was a huge repair bill   well thats still not enough for a total is it   i know i hated that   to get its a very expensive automobile   so it wasnt enough to total it but thats my thats been my most uh expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years and   oh and do you buy one every two years   well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i dont know and i leased it on a twenty four month program its the first time ive ever done that but ill probably go back to buying them because i dont care to lease them   uhhuh did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had   no it has the expanding balloons   did that help you   uh it they didnt go off   they didnt go off   no i guess we werent going that sort of upset me we werent going fast enough according when i called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didnt go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and   well what   and the street lights   but you were hit in the side werent you   yes   that may be the problem you you might you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it   yes took off my whole front fender and hood and everything i tell you just   my goodness   took it all off it was uh uh my my doors were okay front and back and   umhum   but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage it was a expensive then i get it back and two weeks after that im driving it in front of the local high school and some young man just wasnt paying any attention and runs in the back of me thats another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage  so   my goodness   so im gonna get rid my twenty four months is up on this car im getting rid of this car     i would think so that doesnt sound like youve got very good luck with that one     my golly how about you Larry   well im relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow dont have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they dont have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle     i understand   and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time   i understand   uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because its rusted away   sure well i understand that because im from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously continuously salting the roads for snow   uhhuh well i just i did i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders   sure   uh done and then it all repainted and then  winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i havent had a chance to drive it very much       but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again   no im gonna im gonna buy it Larry i dont like the rental i think im getting ready to retire myself and im going to im going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car   are you   for three years and  and anyway and   umhum   so but last couple cars ive only driven for two years so id leased this one for two years so ill probably go back and buy one and uh this next car will probably be my retirement car   well thats an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isnt it too large for normal town driving finding parking places and getting in and out the doors   well no sir not really not really uh   uhhuh   no problem at all my wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and we have the Lincoln and uh the not really no problem there at all as finding as far as finding parking places its its convenient in that in that regard   ah yeah well well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips   yes it is and im and i travel im like a traveling salesman dont travel a lot any more but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive   im im very much aware of that umhum yes im sure it is because thats the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but its very quiet and very smooth riding machine   yes is that right well my wifes Toyota is soon to be four years old it only has doesnt even have thirty miles thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been much in such good shape thatll probably be an eight or ten year car   umhum do you do you feel that uh
