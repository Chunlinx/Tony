                                 Culturebox Rules Lish vs Carver            When you read your New York Times Magazine this Sunday or Saturdayif you live in New York you will learn about a raging controversy ok minordispute in the literary world Does former Knopf fiction editor Gordon Lishdeserve credit for author Raymond Carvers success            A quick summary In the early stages of Carvers career Lisha famouswriting teacher and author in his own rightwent far beyond the traditionalrole of fiction editor cutting as many as half the words in a given storyrewriting entire passages changing titles and adding final lines himself Inshort he carved out of a prolix mans copy Carvers trademark minimaliststyle Carver never admitted to being Lishs creation but he chafed andfinally rebelled forbidding Lish to edit heavily or rewrite anymore            The piece is scrupulously fair airing all sides and concluding thatcollaboration if thats what it was may not be such a bad thing especiallyfor readers However the article also includes a certain amount ofvituperation of Lish by Carvers friends Lish is an easy target since hesenormously controversial for a number of reasons his mannered writing stylefor one and his interventionist editorial style for another which made otherauthors careers and also earned their enmity Ive wondered in my head whyLish did what he did comments the poet Donald Hall a friend of Carvers whoobjected strongly to Lishs edit of one story The Bath and republished theoriginal version as A Small Good Thing Was it unconscious jealousy            It may be possible that as Carvers fans claim he wrote his best piecesafter he ended his relationship with Lish but Culturebox is here to tell youthat Lishs version of the story Hall republished is infinitelybettersparser cleaner and much more menacing which just what the storyneeds On the other hand Culturebox may be biased since she is also aneditor and had her own moments of sulking at her ungrateful writers Socompare and contrast the opening scene and decide for yourself EmailCulturebox at cultureboxslatecom if you violently disagree            Lishs version                           Saturday afternoon the mother drove to the bakery in the shopping centerAfter looking through a looseleaf binder with photographs of cakes taped ontothe pages she ordered chocolate the childs favorite The cake she chose wasdecorated with a spaceship and a launching pad under a sprinkling of whitestars The name SCOTTY would be iced in in green as if it were the name of thespaceship               The baker listened thoughtfully when the mother told him Scotty would beeight years old He was an older man this baker and he wore a curious aprona heavy thing with loops that went under his arms and around his back and thencrossed in front again where they were tied in a very thick knot He keptwiping his hands on the front of the apron as he listened to the women his weteyes examining her lips as she studied the samples and talked               He let her take her time He was in no hurry               The mother decided on the spaceship cake and then she gave the baker hername and telephone number The cake would be ready Monday morning in plenty oftime for the party Monday afternoon This was all the baker was willing to sayNo pleasantries just this small exchange the barest information nothing thatwas not necessary                        Carvers version                           Saturday afternoon she drove to the bakery in the shopping center Afterlooking through a looseleaf binder
