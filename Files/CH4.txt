Two days a week Kevin leaves his office  minutes early to take charge of his yearold daughter Sophie while her mother a university professor teaches a late class One balmy spring afternoon Kevin retrieved Sophie at her childcare center and drove the minute route home Invited to look in on Sophies play I met the pair at the front door and nestled into a rocking chair from which to observe unobtrusivelyAfter downing the last bite of her snack Sophie grabbed Kevins hand and led him across the family room to a rug lined on two sides by shelves lled with books stuffed animals and other play props Sophie moved a toy horse and cow inside a small enclosed fence that she and Kevin had put together the day before Then she turned the animals on their sides and moved them toward each otherWhy are horse and cow lying down Kevin askedCause theyre tired Sophie answered pushing the two animals closer togetherOh yes Kevin affirmed Then building on Sophies theme he placed a teddy bear on another part of the rug and offered I think Teds tired too Im going to start a bed over here for some other animalsSophie turned toward the teddy bear lifted his paw and exclaimed She wants a lollipop to hold in her handA lollipop in her hand We havent got any lollipops have we answered KevinLaura has declared Sophie glancing at meHas Laura got a lollipop Kevin queriedYes Shes got all of those and a swing and a table too Sophie remarked referring to my chair which rocked back and forth next to an end tableMaybe this could be a makebelieve lollipop suggested Kevin placing a round piece on the end of a long TinkerToy stick and handing the structure to SophieThats a lollipop agreed Sophie placing it in the paw of the teddy bearCan she suck that while shes going off to sleep asked Kevin Do you think thats what she wantsIts a pacier explained Sophie renaming the objectA pacier do you think The pacier might help her get to sleep Kevin conrmedThis long long pacier Sophie answered picking up the TinkerToy structure looking at its long stick and pausing as if to decide what to do nextLeprechaun is looking pretty tired suggested Kevin laying Sophies stuffed leprechaun next to the teddy bear What do you thinkHe wants a lollipop tooOh he wants a lollipop as well What are we going to use for a lollipop for the leprechaun asked KevinPressing the teddy bears and the leprechauns arms together and the lollipopturnedpacier between them Sophie readily came up with a solution Hes sharing she affirmedOh theyll share All right Kevin agreedThis scene is but a small excerpt from Sophie and Kevins joint play session which persisted for more than an houra remarkably long time for a yearold to sustain any activity Yet when the TV set is switched off and children are free to do as they choose most preschoolers readily become absorbed in pretending At times their involvement is so intense that on being interrupted they react with shock and dismay rejecting an adult who otherwise would be welcomed with joy and affection One mother reported to me that her daughter Mattie reserved the period after she awoke in the morning for conversing with dolls and other imaginary characters If a parent entered too soon to help her wash and dress she dismissed the intruder proclaiming sharply Busy Dont stop my dollies Only smooth and clever entry into the makebelieve activityfor example inviting the dolls and stuffed animals to get up for breakfastcould lure Mattie into starting the real part of her day without protestThe years of early childhood are often called the high season of imaginative play and aptly so since makebelieve blossoms during this time evolving from simple imitative acts into highly elaborate imaginative plots involving complex coordination of roles Eminent child development theorists of the past attached great importance to the role of makebelieve play in early development All were convinced that anything so compelling and engrossing in the life of the young child must be profoundly signicantthe role of makebelieve play in childrens livesAmong inuential explanations of why preschoolers are so drawn to pretending Freuds psychoanalytic theory and Piagets cognitive theory held sway for much of the twentieth century Although each has made valuable contributions to our understanding a new more powerful view of the meaning of young childrens play has arrived on the scene thanks to Vygotskys sociocultural theoryThe Psychoanalytic View Wish Fulfillment and Insight into Social RolesFreud regarded makebelieve play as a form of pleasurable wish fulllment that allows children to act out uncertainties anxieties and hoped for outcomes and therefore to master frightening and frustrating events Young children Freud noted often revisit anxietyprovoking experiences such as a trip to the doctors office or discipline by a parent but with roles reversed so the child is in command and compensates for unpleasant happenings Sophies parents aware of the previous days events might have judged her pretend focus on bedtime lollipops and paciers to contain at least an element of wish fulllment The evening before they had told her Only one lolly from the candy dish and she had complained at having to go to bed while her parents continued to talk and laugh with their guestsPsychoanalyst Erik Erikson built on Freuds vision expanding his picture of makebelieve According to Erikson children draw on fantasy play to nd out about themselves and their social world In all cultures children act out family roles and highly visible occupationspolice officer doctor and nurse in our society rabbit hunter and potter among the Hopi Indians and hut builder and spear maker among the Baka of West Africa As they do so they enter a small social organization whose members must cooperate to achieve common goals And through observing and emulating admired adult gures preschoolers internalize social norms and gain a sense of their future of what they can become and how they can contribute to society Piagets View Exercising a New Symbolic CapacityPiaget acknowledged the emotional function of play and he agreed that through pretending children become familiar with socialrole possibilities But he is best known for stressing the symbolic nature of makebelieve Pretending Piaget pointed out is a vital means of mentally representing the world that along with gestures language and drawings develops rapidly in early childhood Through it children practice and strengthen their capacity to represent their experiences For example when Sophie pretended to put the animals to bed and used a TinkerToy to stand for a lollipop she represented in her mind what formerly she could experience only directlyby going to bed or sucking a lollipop Practicing and solidifying modes of representation Piaget emphasized make it possible for the child to free thought from the here and now create larger images of reality that take into account past present and future and transform those images mentally in the service of logical thinking Nevertheless Piaget was convinced that by itself makebelieve play does little to advance childrens development Rather children merely exercise playfully the symbols they have acquired in other contexts Much like his view of private speech as egocentric and nonsocial Piaget believed that at rst pretend play is a solitary activity in which the child uses highly personal symbols that cannot easily be interpreted by others Sociodramatic play involving joint makebelieve with a partner Piaget claimed is not under way until age  As with other aspects of Piagets theory the direction of development for makebelieve is from purely individual egocentric symbols to social play and shared understandingYet think back to yearold Sophies pretending Sophie is socially engaged throughout From the start she draws Kevin into the activity explains her pretend actions so he can build on them and responds cooperatively and appropriately to Kevins suggestions as he does to hers Vygotskys theory has been the wellspring of our recent appreciation of the profoundly social nature of even very young childrens imaginative playand its wideranging inuence on cognitive and social developmentVygotskys View A Zone of Proximal DevelopmentVygotsky viewed makebelieve play as crucial in childrens learning He regarded it as a unique broadly inuential zone in which children try out a wide variety of challenging skills and acquire many culturally valued competencies Consider the following frequently quoted remarks taken from a brief lecture in which Vygotsky eloquently summed up his conviction that pretend play is a central force in childrens developmentMakebelieve play creates a zone of proximal development in the child In play the child always behaves beyond his average age above his daily behavior in play it is as though he were a head taller than himself As in the focus of a magnifying glass play contains all developmental tendencies in condensed form and is itself a major source of development Why did Vygotsky say that makebelieve play creates a zone in which the child is a head taller than himself If we stop every now and then to watch children at play we can see what Vygotsky meant Recall how Sophie satised both teddy bears and leprechauns desire for a lollipop when just one TinkerToy lollipop was available She had them share a very mature response for a yearold In everyday life Sophie like many Western children her age nds sharing to be difficult As another illustration consider yearold David who has trouble sitting still during group storytime in kindergarten He leans over and talks to the other children In spite of the teachers frequent prompting he cant stay seated for more than a couple of minutes But when David plays school with several of his friends he can sit and pay attention for much longerperhaps as long as  minutes Play provides the roles rules and scenarios that enable David to concentrate at a much higher level than he typically does in nonpretend contextsunique features of makebelieve playHow do the makebelieve scenes just described and others like them serve as major sources of development To answer this question Vygotsky pointed out we must identify the distinctive features of makebelieve playthose that make it unique among young childrens experiences The widespread belief originating with Freud that play is pleasurable wish fulllment characterizes certain playful pursuitsfor example acting out highstatus roles such as doctor parent or teacher and thereby exercising authority over others instead of being directed and controlled But not all fantasy qualies as wish fulllment In the sociodramatic scenarios that young children create a doctor must have patients to inoculate a parent must have children to discipline and a teacher must have pupils to do assignments Makebelieve roles are not equally pleasurablea feature of cooperation that is as true in everyday life as it is in fantasy play Even when makebelieve does fulll a childs wishes such pleasure is not unique to play Many other activities such as eating a favorite treat being granted the undivided attention and affection of a parent and listening to an exciting story are at least as gratifying and sometimes more so than pretending Indeed imaginative wish fulllment can at times be counterproductive In wellknown research on childrens ability to delay gratication psychologist Walter Mischel and his collaborators showed preschoolers some delicious marshmallows and told them that they could have one now or several if they waited until later Children who spent the waiting period in a wishfulllment mode thinking about what it would be like to eat those tasty marshmallows were far less likely to wait patiently and successfully than children who turned their attention away from the treats and thought about other things In this situation and others being caught up in fantasized wish fulllment interferes with attaining larger more rewarding outcomes in real lifeones that would have been realized had the child been able to exercise imaginative selfrestraint What about Piagets belief that through makebelieve young children solidify their new symbolic capacity A burgeoning ability to use symbols certainly contributes to the emergence of makebelieve and as well soon see makebelieve does much to extend young childrens symbolic skills Nevertheless mental representation is yet another feature that is not exclusive to play As we have already noted it also characterizes gestures language and artistic pursuits as well as beginning literacypreschoolers rst efforts to make sense of written symbolsVygotsky concluded that makebelieve play has two crucial features that distinguish it from other childhood activities First the creation of imaginary situations in play helps children separate internal ideas from the objects and events for which they stand Once young children realize that words gestures and other symbols are distinct from external reality they are well on the way to using those representations as effective mental tools calling on them to overcome impulses Second a careful look at childrens pretend scenarios reveals that makebelieve play is above all rulebased play Inspired by experiences in their families and communities children continually devise and follow social rules in imaginary situations In doing so they strive to bring their behavior in line with social expectations and acquire the rules of social life Consider these unique complementary ingredients of makebelieve The rst strengthens childrens internal capacity to become civilized and socially responsible The second provides children with powerful external pressures to act in socially desirable ways Together these features make fantasy play a supreme contributor to the development of selfregulationone that extends the impact of adult teaching and example more than any other early childhood activity To understand makebelieve plays role in development lets take a closer look at each of its unique featuresOvercoming Impulsive ActionFantasy play makes its appearance in the second year of life a time when children must start to suppress impulses and accept that certain desires will remain unsatised In infancy most of the childs wantsfor food stimulation affection and comfortare gratied quickly Such prompt satisfaction grants babies the security that their basic needs will be met As a result they do not have to be preoccupied with those needs and instead can turn their attention outward toward acquiring physical cognitive and social skills Warm responsive caregiving also promotes a view of parents as kind and compassionatean outlook essential for motivating children to emulate and take direction from parentsBetween  and  years of age children begin to acquire language greater understanding of the consequences of their actions and the ability to comply with others requests and directives Consequently caregivers expectations change They increasingly insist that children engage in socially appropriate conduct During the very period in which children must learn to subordinate their desires to social life imaginative play ourishes For Vygotsky this synchrony between socialization and makebelieve is no coincidence Pretend play forties childrens capacity to use ideas to guide behavior The young immature child runs after a ball that rolls into the street without considering consequences drops toys on the spot when another activity engages her and grabs an attractive object from a playmate without regard for the playmates rights and feelings Makebelieve play Vygotsky asserted helps preschoolers conquer these impulses by granting the child repeated practice in acting independently of what he seesJust how does imaginative play help children distinguish ideas from the enticing stimuli around them and use thought to guide behavior According to Vygotsky the object substitutions that permeate childrens makebelieve are crucial in this process While pretending children continually use one object to represent another By making a TinkerToy stand for a lollypop or a folded blanket stand for a sleeping baby children step back from reality The TinkerToy becomes a means for separating the idea lollipop from a real lollipop the blanket becomes a means for separating the idea baby from a real baby This severing of thought from objects and actions occurs because in play children change an objects usual meaning In calling the TinkerToy a lollipop Sophie conjured up the idea of a lollipop and used it to alter the TinkerToys identity As a result rather than reacting impulsively to the sight of a lollipop Sophie relied on ideas to regulate the lollipops very existenceand the teddy bears the leprechauns and her own actions toward itAt rst children nd it difficult to distinguish words and other mental symbols from the objects and actions to which they refer Parents seem to realize this when in the presence of their  or yearold they phrase things this way to an adult companion After we nish running errands lets stop off for some ice cream Ask parents why they spell rather than say the words and they remark If you say ice cream hell want it now He wont be able to waitChildrens earliest efforts at makebelieve also reveal how challenging they nd the task of detaching thought from reality Initially object substitutions are closely tied to the real things they represent Toddlers between ages   and  generally use only realisticlooking objects while pretendinga toy telephone to talk into or a cup to drink from Once I handed a monthold a small wooden block put another to my ear and called her on the phone Ring Ring Hello Lynnay She responded by throwing down the block and turning to another activity Yet when given a plastic replica of a pushbutton phone Lynnay readily put the receiver to her ear and pretended to converseAround age  children begin to pretend with less realistic toys such as a block for a telephone And sometime during the third year they can imagine objects and events with little or no support from the real world as when they say to a play partner Im calling Susie on the phone while dialing with their hands or without acting out the event at all Between ages  and  this detachment of makebelieve symbols from the reallife conditions they stand for is well developed Lets look in on yearold Alison as she draws her father into a makebelieve scenario Notice how Alisons imagination ranges far beyond the immediate play props before hera tea set a toy truck and an ambulance In the span of a few moments she conjures up a fantastic multicolored house and room and travels to a distant land where she witnesses a cataclysmic eventAlison while stacking multicolored plastic spoons I dont need my house painted It just got painted todayFather Just got painted todayAlison YepFather What color was it paintedAlison Its kind of its got brown and red in itFather Brown and redAlison And a little peach colorFather A little peach color What color is your bedroomAlison Well its yellow and orange and redFather That sounds prettyAlison All mixed togetherFather Oh all mixed togetherAlison Well I have a dump truck Orwhat else would you like An ambulance Picks up toy ambulance and hands it to her fatherFather Did someone get in an accidentAlison Well yes Then referring to a newspaper report her father had mentioned earlier in the day This morning it said changes to a lowpitched somber tone of voice Two trains crashingin IndiaVygotsky maintained that in detaching symbols from objects and actions makebelieve play helps children use thought to choose deliberately among alternative courses of behavior In play Alison thinks about paint colors which need not be the color of her real room She learns that you can consider possibilities and choose among them thereby controlling eventual outcomes Imaginative play Vygotsky noted also functions as a bridge from the concrete thought of the preschool and early school years to mature adult thought which can be totally free of real situations In helping children disengage thought from reality pretend play is vital preparation for the much later development of abstract thinking in which symbols are manipulated and hypothetical ideas are evaluated without referring to currently existing real world conditions When imagination eventually combines with the logical abstract reasoning powers of adolescence the stage is set for creativity A truly creative work is both original and sensible its novelty is culturally meaningful and useful Almost always creativity demands a high degree of selfregulationpulling together previously unrelated ideas critically evaluating those ideas and persevering in the face of obstacles In makebelieve Alison experimented with the rst step of this multistep process when she melded news of the train crash in India with the toy ambulance before her As we will see shortly people renowned for their creative accomplishments often report that makebelieve play was a frequent highly inuential aspect of their early developmentAcquiring and Enacting the Rules of Social LifeHad Vygotsky lived long enough to become familiar with Erik Eriksons psychoanalytic theory he would have agreed that makebelieve play teaches children about social roles and provides them with insights into what they can become in their society But Vygotsky was far more explicit about just how pretending helps children acquire dispositions that foster eager willing participation in social lifeChildrens imaginative play Vygotsky pointed out contains an interesting paradox In play preschoolers seem to do what they most feel like doing and to an outside observer their play appears free and spontaneous Nevertheless pretend play demands that children act against their immediate impulses because they must subject themselves to the rules of the makebelieve scene A child pretending to go to sleep follows the rules of bedtime behavior Another child imagining herself to be a mother and a doll to be a baby conforms to the rules of parental behavior And a child playing astronaut obeys the rules of shuttle launch and space walk In this sense makebelieve is not really free play as we often assume it to be Instead its very essence is selfrestraintvoluntarily following social rules While pretending Vygotsky explained children repeatedly face conicts between the rules of the makebelieve situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively and they usually decide in favor of the rules When tired Sophies teddy bear and leprechaun dont stay up late doing just as they please Instead they obey their caregivers and go to bed With only one lollipop or pacier to go around teddy bear and leprechaun share They dont quarrel and grab and if they had done so Sophie or another makebelieve character probably would have intervened and insisted on kind considerate behaviorAccording to Vygotsky childrens greatest selfcontrol occurs during makebelieve play They achieve their maximum display of willpower when at their own initiative they renounce a momentary attraction in favor of rulegoverned behavior The paradox of makebelieve is that in everyday life when children subordinate actions to rules they usually give up something they wantinstead of keeping a treasured toy all to themselves they share it instead of continuing to play they clean up instead of watching more TV they go to bed During fantasy play however renouncing impulse and following social rules are central to the fun of playing Rather than frustrating or disappointing the child selfrestraint is the route to maximum pleasure In sum subordinating immediate desires to the rules of makebelieve scenes becomes a new form of desireone that responds to the childs need to become an accepted member of his or her culture Indeed if you watch preschoolers at play you will see that they rarely violate the rules of their social world And as they jointly create play scripts and follow social rules with peers they come to appreciate societys norms and strive to uphold them A child playing storekeeper experiences rsthand the reasons for having customers line up to pay for making change accurately and for being polite A child playing parent in a household scene becomes aware of parental responsibilities and why its important for children to follow their parents directives In fact an adult who breaks a rule in makebelieve usually brings preschoolers profound respect for social order into bold relief Cara a demanding but spirited yearold likes to initiate makebelieve with the following transparent role reversal Mom Ill be the mother and you be my child  years old Caras mother plays along for a while and then deliberately transgresses refusing to eat her vegetables or pick up her toys At the rst sign of misbehavior Cara lectures in a tone of voice well beyond her years Children must obey their parents because their parents know things they dont so the parents must take care of them As Caras pronouncement makes clear play creates a zone through which preschoolers internalize a basic sense of social responsibility and morality At the same time they acquire a wealth of practical knowledge and skills In extreme circumstances when the organization and predictability of the real world fall apart young children whose prior lives have been lled with parental warmth and involvement often call on rules and rituals in makebelieve to restore their social world Recently I came across the recollections of Alice Cahana an elderly Holocaust survivor recounting her days as a child in the death camp at Auschwitz Alice explained that she and her sister Edith managed despite all odds to stay together Their secret strategy was never to display any emotion that would give away their relationship since a major objective of the SS was to break up families Only at night did they dare to hug whisper and play together On Friday nights they marked the Sabbath in a special way by imagining that they were at home They talked about the evenings events in minute detail to make the image of family life rm and real Alice had always had the responsibility of setting the table and her mother would correct her if she left out even small nonessential items In play Edith would murmur Alice its time to set the table Find the nicest tablecloths and dont forget the owers Where are the napkins for the guests You forgot the fork for Father You really shined the candelabra beautifully this week better than before  After their pretend meal the two sisters would whisper songsThe rules of makebelieve kept alive the integrity of the girls lost social world They kindled hope or as Alice put it an inner light fortifying the children with the selfrestraint and forbearance they needed to endure the next day from makebelieve play to organized games with rulesVygotsky regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool years as essential for further development of playspecically for movement toward game play in middle childhood In makebelieve the rules of play are implicit preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them Instead they are caught up in creating imaginary situationsputting a stuffed animal to bed driving an ambulance to a train crash or ringing up a customers purchase at the cash register Winning and losing team membership and competition and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers Try playing a rulebased game with a  or yearold and you are likely to nd that the child is easily sidetracked If with your prompting and guidance the child does nish the game he or she might say I won or Everybody won regardless of the outcomeWith age the imaginativeness of play recedes In the games that captivate schoolage children rules come to the forefront Six to yearolds are often preoccupied with working out the rules of a game and making sure all players follow them They often spend as much or more time on the details of how a game should proceed as they do playing the game itself Nevertheless every organized game with rules contains an imaginary situation in veiled form In Monopoly children are real estate moguls in baseball they emulate HallofFame idols Children retain both aspects of play in changing balances throughout developmentIncreasing emphasis on the ruleoriented side of play extends the zone forged by fantasy play during the preschool years By making children more aware of the goals of their play activities game play further strengthens childrens capacity to overcome impulse Consciously striving to reach a goal requires planningpostponing action in favor of thinking out what to do in advance organizing ones behavior in accord with the plan evaluating how well the plan is working along the way and revising the plan if necessary In the simple games of the late preschool and early school years the play goal is very clearin hideandseek to keep the person who is it from nding you in Chutes and Ladders to travel a road with as many shortcuts and as few setbacks as possible getting to the nish line rst Gradually the goals of childrens games become more distant and complex Attaining those goals requires more intermediate steps and greater knowledge skill and coordination of play actions with those of othersin Tball and kickball scoring more runs than the other team while adhering to fair procedures for batting pitching and elding in chess moving each type of piece according to its special rule in an effort to checkmate the opposing king Through game play children receive additional experience in setting goals in regulating behavior in pursuit of those goals and in subordinating behavior to rules And in negotiating rules in peerorganized games children deepen their understanding of why rules are necessary and which ones work well In the process they form more mature concepts of fairness and justice Indeed parents and teachers often remark that game play prepares children for the inevitability of real downfalls and teaches perseverance and good sportsmanshipIn sum the development of play proceeds from makebelieve with an overt imaginary situation and covert rules to organized games with overt rules and a covert imaginary situation The vast yet nearly effortless learning that takes place through pretending makes it for Vygotsky the highest level of preschool development The child moves forward essentially through play activity Makebelieve play in Vygotskys theory is the preeminent educational activity of early childhoodcontributions of makebelieve play to developmentVygotsky emphasized the developmentenhancing forwardmoving consequences of makebelieve Was he correct that pretending in early childhood has a farreaching impact on development supporting the emergence and renement of a wide variety of competencies Indeed much evidence ts with Vygotskys conclusion Sociodramatic play with peers has been studied most thoroughly Comparisons of preschoolers sociodramatic activities with their social nonpretend pursuits such as drawing pictures or putting puzzles together in the company of agemates supports Vygotskys view of makebelieve as a zone in which children enhance their own development In social pretending preschoolers engage in lengthier interactions are more involved draw more children into their activity and are more cooperative In view of these ndings it is not surprising that  and yearolds who spend more time at sociodramatic play are advanced in intellectual development and are judged more socially competent by their teachers Furthermore pretend play fosters a diverse array of specic cognitive and social skills which contribute to these broadbaseed outcomes Lets take some examplesAttentionAttention is fundamental to all human thinking It determines the information considered in any task and whether the task will be completed As any parent or teacher knows young children spend only short times involved in most activities and are easily distracted Yet attention becomes more sustained over early childhooda development that equips children for concentrated involvement which will be essential for success once they enter schoolUnder what conditions are preschoolers most likely to display sustained attention Think back to the examples of Sophies and Matties behavior at the beginning of this chapter and the answer will be clear during play especially complex play In two studies psychologist Holly Ruff and her collaborators sat toddlers and preschoolers at a table of toys Childrens patterns of attention changed dramatically with age After playing for a short time with a toy  to yearolds dropped it and turned to another Their attention was externally controlled by the physical properties of the objects Hence they itted from one toy to another and lost interest as the play session progressed But once children began to set goals in play the nature of their attention changed It became effortful as indicated by eyes xed on the toys and a determined facial expression For the youngest children play goals were often as simple as getting a cap off a bottle With age the problems and challenges children set for themselves became more elaborate such as building an intricate structure out of small blocks or acting out a fantasy scenario The more complex childrens play goals the more they displayed focused effortful attention and the more such attention increased over the play session And in one of the studies both construction and imaginative play were powerful predictors of sustained attention between ages  and  With respect to makebelieve when preschoolers create very intricate scenarios either on their own or with play partners they generally stay absorbed for a very long timeRecall the anecdote about David who remained an attentive pupil considerably longer while playing school than he did in other kindergarten activities Preschoolers sustained attention is more advanced in makebelieve than in many reallife pursuits When permitted to select freely among diverse activities at child care or preschool young children overwhelmingly prefer fantasy play Observing in a childcare center richly equipped with play materials Kathleen Kirby one of my graduate students found that  to yearolds spent  to  percent of freechoice periods immersed in makebelievenearly twice as much time as they devoted to any other activity The rapt attention engendered in pretend play may eventually carry over to nonpretend contextsMemoryFantasy play also strengthens young childrens memories Preschoolers remember information better in a play context than in a context in which information is isolated from its everyday use and they are told to remember deliberately Psychologist Lawrence Newman permitted one group of  and yearolds to play with a set of toys and told another group simply to remember the toys Play produced far better recall During the remember condition children repeatedly named and touched the objectsa rehearsal strategy that much like repeating a phone number helped them hold on to information but only briey In contrast the play condition led to many spontaneous organizations of the toys that enabled children to recall effortlessly Often these grew out of makebelievefor example putting the toy shoes on the doll and pretending to feed her the toy banana Narrating imaginative activities also yielded excellent recall as in Im squeezing this lemon or Fly away in this helicopter doggie When children embedded an object in meaningful makebelieve they increased its memorablenessFurthermore children acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script or basic framework of story organization Preschoolers pretend scenarios are often quite storylike consisting of characters settings and plot sequences that include adventure suspense surprise conict and resolution Witness the following trip to Sea World during which Emily and her friends save Baby Shamu from dangerS to Emily Would you come with us Lets go to Sea WorldE Sea World Lets watch Shamu Im the mom All three children run to one end of the room and sit down next to one another They gaze toward the other end of the roomS Oh I see ShamuE Its starting presumably the showA J YeahE Theres a little sh Theres a big momS Theres a daddyE Look He fell on the ice Look at em Mommy and Daddy are fell OhhhhS Patting a pretend Baby Shamu Ohhhh I know youre all right All make stroking motions on a pretend Baby ShamuE Look All better now She pretends to lift Baby Shamu back into the water Children like Emily who have formed a sense of story through makebelieve more readily grasp the organization and meaning of new stories and are therefore more likely to remember them Young pretenders also impose the standards of story organization on the way they recall and explain their experiences to others Their verbal narratives are more cohesive than those of agemates who prefer other forms of play In helping children grasp the storytelling script and in other ways we will take up next makebelieve play is wonderful preparation for literacy Being able to anticipate story organization eases the task of making sense of written prose It also grants children a rm foundation for authoring their rst written narrativesLanguage and LiteracyAs the ndings just mentioned illustrate makebelieve greatly enriches childrens facility with language During sociodramatic activities preschoolers hear speech that describes and comments on actions going on at the moment This helps ensure that language is understandable because it is in tune with ongoing events Consequently when new words arise in the course of a fantasy scene children can determine their meaning easily from cues in the situation In this way vocabulary extends during makebelieve as children introduce words they have heard during recent experiences For example Im going out I need my cloak said yearold Lizzy mimicking an expression she had heard in a TV movie while grabbing a dressup raincoat from a hook in the housekeeping area at child care You mean your coat asked Lizzies playmateRight a cloak is a coat Lizzie explained The amount of time preschoolers spent talking with peers while pretending is positively associated with the size of their vocabularies at age As children engage in play talk they not only build their vocabularies but correct one anothers errors either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak In one instance a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said Hello come to my house please Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior No rst youve got to say How are you What are you doingFurthermore the language skills required to express different points of view resolve disagreements and persuade peers to collaborate so play can continue are complex and often subtle Emilys success in convincing several classmates to join the makebelieve trip to Sea World was partly due to the way she approached themby asking if theyd like to go By experimenting with language during play children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to rene their way of speaking In this way play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogueOpportunities to acquire literacyrelevant skills also abound in makebelieve play In one kindergarten children transformed the blockbuilding area into a makebelieve recycling center with the help of their teacher Signs were prepared that advertised the new center its hours and what it would pay for various goods As in other friendly businesses attendants wore nametags such as Hi Im Charles When customers arrived with goods the attendants had to ll out receipts listing each item its quantity and its value Since many children could not yet spell they used rst letters or drew pictures of items While doing so they often became curious about how to write the full word and asked the teacher to help them What does research say about the role of makebelieve in childrens literacy development The amount of time children devote to pretending at age  is positively related to reading and writing skills after entering kindergarten and rst gradespecically the extent to which children spontaneously read words on game cards and signs understand print concepts and write letters and simple words The more children engage in literacyrelevant play activities like the recycling center the more advanced their literacy skills are as well Preschoolers commentary about language while pretending using such verbs as say talk tell write and explain is a particularly good predictor of reading progress at age  Using language to talk about language happens often as peers jointly create fantasy scenes Such talk may help children treat both oral and written narratives as objects of analysis hence its benets for early reading With respect to writing object substitutions and role play seem to have special benets Frequently using objects to symbolize other objects and transforming oneself into various characters may encourage children to try to make sense of other symbol systems such as how to express themselves with print In their rst efforts to write preschoolers commonly assume that letters just like pictures and rst substitute objects look like their meanings In one instance a child stated with certainty that the word deer begins with the letter O because O is shaped like a deer then he demonstrated by drawing an O and adding antlers to it Flexibly using makebelieve symbols seems to assist children in revising early incorrect ideas about how print is used to communicateHypothetical ReasoningDuring the preschool and elementary school years thought is largely tied to the hereandnow Children think in an organized fashion about concrete information they can directly perceive but have great difficulty reasoning about hypothetical situationsones that do not make sense in the real world For example try giving a child between  and  the following problem Suppose dogs are bigger than elephants and elephants are bigger than mice Which one is the biggest dogs elephants or mice Most will insist that dogs couldnt possibly be bigger than elephants Thats never true they exclaimYet with the help of makebelieve even preschoolers can transcend these limits and reason about situations that defy realworld knowledge Consider the following impossible premises and question All cats bark Rex is a cat Does Rex bark Psychologists Maria Dias and Paul Harris had one group of  to yearolds act out problems like this one using toys that represented the content of the premises A second group was told that the events were taking place on a pretend planet rather than on Earth And a third group merely listened and answered the questions Children in the two play conditions gave more hypothetical responses and also justied their answers with hypothetical ideasfor example by saying In the story cats bark so we can pretend they barkThe capacity to adopt a theoretical mode of reasoning in makebelieve is highly consistent with Vygotskys belief that pretending assists children in separating mental symbols from the objects and actions for which they stand thereby permitting them to manipulate meanings in innovative ways Reasoning about the nonreal is essential for abstract thinking and for many creative endeavorsthat is for human cognition to reach its highest potentialDistinguishing Appearance from RealityAfter kissing their preschooler goodnight and turning out the lights many parents are accustomed to hearing refrains like this Mommy Daddy monsters are in my room again To rid the bedroom of scary creatures pictures and mobiles may have to be removed and a thorough search conducted to assure the child that no monsters are lurking in the shadows waiting to reappear as soon as the parent leaves Uncertainty about the relation between appearance and reality also surfaces in other situations On Halloween a yearold who eagerly dons her costume may become frightened at the sight of her animal or witchlike appearance in the mirror And a father who shaves off his beard and mustache may nd that his young preschooler reacts with puzzlement and distress to his changed appearanceConsistent with these alltoofamiliar experiences research conrms that preschoolers are easily tricked by the outward appearance of things They mistakenly conclude that the way things look or sound is the way they really are In several studies psychologists John Flavell Francis Green and Eleanor Flavell presented children with appearancereality problems in which objects were disguised in various ways The children were asked what the objects were really and truly Before age  or  most children took things at face value When asked whether a white piece of paper placed behind a blue lter is really and truly blue or whether a can that sounds like a baby crying when turned over is really and truly a baby they responded Yes Yet in makebelieve children use objects to symbolize things that are very different from the objects themselvesa ball to stand for an apple a laundry basket for a cradle They do not judge these imaginary symbols to be real so clearly they can tell the difference between pretend and real experiences long before they can answer many appearancereality problems correctly The more  to yearolds spontaneously engage in joint makebelieve with classmates at preschool the better they can distinguish the apparent and real identities of disguised objects Pretending with peers may help children master appearance reality distinctions because it offers repeated practice in transforming a wide variety of objects from their real state to a pretend state and back againUnderstanding the Mind and Its Many ActivitiesMakebelieve play provides a rich foundation for childrens comprehension of the minds wideranging capabilities In Chapter  I noted that childrens elaborate interactions with imaginary companions foster understanding of false belief and other peoples perspectives In sociodramatic play as well opportunities to act out and coordinate various roles probably help children grasp similarities and differences between people in desires beliefs and feelings Recently a mother recounted to me a makebelieve episode initiated by her  yearold daughter Traci involving extended experimentation with and reversals of roles which led to abundant dialogue about mental states One evening Traci her two older sisters and her parents had gathered in the living room to watch a video of The Sound of Music Although Traci showed little interest in the movie her ears perked up at a statement in the sound track reporting the death of the mother of the Trappfamily children Traci began to ask questions to talk about how the mother must have gotten sick and gone to the hospital and to repeat that the mother had died For the next hour and a half she assigned her own mother and herself at least fteen different rolesmother father baby sister doctor nurse and moreas she explored the idea of a mother dying Traci Here youre the baby and Im the mama Honey Im going to the hospitalMother Go to the hospital and have the doctor help you feel betterTraci No Im not going to feel better Im going to dieMother frantically No no I dont want you to die Ill be very very sadTraci OK dont worry itll be all rightSome scenarios like this one ended happily others were lled with depressing events and ended sadly In acting them out Traci imagined and simulated diverse wants hopes worries and strivings of people in her life As this brief vignette illustrates sociodramatic play is rich in mentalstate language especially references to emotion As children learn about mental states from conversing and engaging in makebelieve with adults they transfer this knowledge to sociodramatic play with peers The more  and yearold friends talk about mental states during joint makebelieve the better they perform and the more they improve over the following year on tasks assessing their grasp of mental life These include understanding of false belief identifying the feelings of a puppet acting out emotionally charged situations such as seeing a parent off on a trip and explaining reallife causes of happiness sadness anger fear and mixed emotions for example why one might feel both happy and sad about winning a race against a friend Talk between siblings that focuses on feelings seems to play a particularly strong role in the diversity of themes that siblings act out in their joint makebelieve Complexity of play with siblings in turn is a good indicator of preschoolers understanding of other peoples feelingsmore so than is their play with mothers Why might conversing and pretending with siblings make a special contribution to childrens capacity to read others emotions In interacting with their child mothers spend much time acknowledging and clarifying the childs feelings Siblings as well as preschool friends frequently articulate how they themselves feel Therefore siblings more often expose the child to the inner states of someone other than the child himself or herself The more affectionate and cooperative siblings relationships are the more sophisticated their sociodramatic play Siblings who get along well are probably better at creating and sustaining elaborate makebelieve scenariosplay that contributes to their emotional sensitivity As children build on each others play themes they often refer to their makebelieve with mental terms by making statements like these Lets pretend Lets imagine You act like a pilot and Ill makebelieve Im in the control tower Some experts believe that this suspension of play to communicate about it marks a major change in understanding Now children do not just represent experiences in play they display awareness that makebelieve is an activity in which the mind creates events As a result children become capable of consciously reecting on and deliberately manipulating their own and others fanciful representations and their play becomes even more complex and imaginativeResearchers continue to debate whether preschoolers actually view pretending as a mental state rather than just a series of actions mirroring real life But there is clear evidence that their grasp of makebelieve as a mental activity improves steadily between ages  and  Over time they can answer more subtle questions about the nature of makebelieve For example by age  most realize that pretending depends on having prior knowledge about a makebelieve role That is a person hopping can be pretending to be a rabbit only if he or she knows that rabbits hop Children age  and older also recognize that makebelieve is something you can do just inside your head without using your body at allWhy is this understanding of makebelieve as mental representation so important When children master this and other related ideasthat people are constantly engaged in thought even when they have nothing to do that mental inferences not just direct observations can lead to new knowledge and that prior experiences affect peoples interpretations of new experiencesthey show that they have begun to pay more attention to the processes of thought Thinking about thought makes possible a major advance in selfregulation It permits children to call on what they know about mental life to surmount cognitive and social challenges The child well aware of the minds active transforming capabilities is more likely to attend to relevant information to plan to use memory and problemsolving strategies and to evaluate and revise his or her thinking to make it more effective In sum makebelieve in early childhood is among those factors that promote reective thought which improves throughout the school yearsSelfRegulationAs we have just seen pretend play through its impact on childrens awareness of the mind fosters advanced forms of selfregulation But what about the selfregulatory capacities that emerge earlier during the preschool yearsselfguiding private speech willingness to take on chores and capacity to delay gratication for brief periods Does makebelieve foster these early indicators of a selfregulated child Findings of several studies I carried out with my graduate students suggest that it doesprivate speechIn the rst of these studies we reasoned that if Vygotsky is correct that children learn to overcome impulse and manage their behavior through pretend play then private speech should be especially frequent within makebelieve activities To nd out graduate student Kerry Krafft and I observed  to yearolds during freechoice periods in two contexts differing sharply in encouragement of imaginative play the Y Preschool called this because it is sponsored by the YWCA and the Montessori Preschool In the Y Preschool play formed the basis of the daily program Children had easy access to a wide variety of toys games and books and each classroom contained two centers especially conducive to sociodramatic play a blockbuilding area with hundreds of blocks varying in size and shape and a childsized playhouse brimming with all manner of housekeeping props The Montessori Preschool in contrast actively discouraged makebelieve although not all Montessori schools do so Spurred by philosophical principles advocating realistic activities the Montessori teachers set up work stations from which children selected Typical options were puzzles picturematching and picturesequencing tasks letter tracing small construction blocks containers with water for pouring books and crayons and other tools for drawing and writing When Montessori children strayed into makebelieve teachers often interrupted drawing them back to workstation pursuits Nevertheless Montessori children did engage in pretending but it was sharply restricted relative to children in the Y Preschool who displayed three times as much imaginative play What happened to private speech It showed a parallel trend Children in the Y Preschool engaged in twice as much selftalk as did children in the Montessori preschool Furthermore pretend play emerged as the strongest correlate of both fantasyplay private speech and selfguiding private speech That is the more children engaged in makebelieve the more they talked to themselves to work out pretend characters actions and to guide their thought and behavior during realistic tasks This latter nding suggests that private speech so rich in the makebelieve context may carry over to childrens selftalk when they face realworld challengesRecall from Chapter  that as children master puzzles and other problemsolving tasks their selfguiding speech declines Yet when graduate student Tina Gillingham and I observed preschoolers in a laboratory playroom liberally equipped with fantasyplay props we found that private speech during makebelieve remained uniformly high from ages  to  and actually increased at age  Our interpretation of the prevalence of private speech during makebelieve is that children continually set challenges for themselves in fantasy play Consistent with Vygotskys theory they create their own zones frequently calling on selfdirected language to work out their imaginings and bring behavior under the control of thoughtsocially responsible behaviorIn yet another study graduate student Cynthia Elias and I addressed the question of whether complex makebelieve specically sociodramatic play involving elaborate communication between agematespromotes socially responsible behavior During the fall of the school year we observed  and yearolds as they played in the block and housekeeping centers of their preschools and rated the quantity and maturity of their fantasy endeavors Then we assessed social responsibility by observing the children during cleanup periods recording the extent to which they willingly picked up and put away toys without prompting and assistance We made these cleanup observations in the fall and again in the spring so we could measure gain in responsible behavior Our ndings revealed that preschoolers who more often engaged in complex sociodramatic play showed greater improvement in social responsibility over the next  to  months And this relationship was particularly strong for children rated by their parents as highly impulsivethat is who were poorly selfregulated to begin with In other words children most in need of enhancing their selfregulatory abilities appeared especially sensitive to the benets of sociodramatic playImagination and CreativityIn addition to its contribution to many nonplay skills makebelieve can be examined on its own terms as an imaginative activity that expresses salient aspects of the childs inner cognitive and emotional life In Vygotskys theory the drive to fantasize and engage in role play does not fade away with childhood Instead he maintained the imagination of later years is an internalized condensed form of early childhood makebelieve that can be considered play without action We typically experience it as an elaborate stream of consciousness made up of mental images and silent selftalk that meanders along remarking on new experiences reecting on the past and predicting the futureBy introducing fantasy elements into consciousness this inventive private commentary probably helps us cope with the mundane repetitive aspects of our daily lives We resort to such ruminations while waiting during long car trips or meetings and at other monotonous or idle times In this way early makebelieve forties us with a mental tool that is vital for adapting to everyday life And from time to time we apply logical adaptive thinking to this inner playfulness to harness it for culturally worthwhile purposes The result may be a creative idea or productWas Vygotsky correct that the imaginative mental combinations that form the basis for creativity originate in the pretend scenarios of early childhood Unfortunately we have no longterm studies that systematically observed children for the imaginativeness of their play and then tracked them to document their creative accomplishments in adulthood And even if such studies were available many intervening events could blur the connection between early play and adult creativity At present all we have available to explore this relationship are the recollections of highly creative individuals about their childhoods or the reports of their biographersOn a recent visit to my local library I browsed the shelves devoted to biography selecting several dozen life stories of accomplished writers artists and scientists The accounts were remarkably consistent For most pretend play was an inuential aspect of their early years Often a signicant persona parent an older sibling or a relativepromoted imaginative experimentation and a sense of wonder by telling fantastic stories initiating joint pretend or offering gifts such as books and puppets that inspired makebelieve For example biographical accounts of physicist Marie Curie codiscoverer of radium and twice winner of the Nobel Prize invariably make reference to her fathers untiring efforts to provide his children with ideas and games to ll their spare time A chest of colored blocks had special meaning Marie and her older siblings used the blocks to represent cities mountains rivers countries and continents Their father a high school science teacher often joined in capitalizing on play as a way to teach geography In the home in which Marie Curie grew up one biographer summed up play was learning and learning was playIn poet Sylvia Plaths childhood stories and storytelling were pervasive As a  yearold Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mothers attention While the baby nursed Sylvia sat nearby on the oor impatient and unhappy Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvias envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her picked out all the capital letters on the page and pretended in a very grownup way to readan achievement that attracted much parental admiration Sylvias mother often made up bedtime tales serialized from one evening to the next Almost as soon as they could talk Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks poems and fantastic stories of their own On walks to their grandparents house and on long car trips favorite books invariably came along offering ready inspiration for the childrens imaginative creations Filmstar Charlie Chaplins mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer As a young child Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater As a result playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlies pretending One evening during a performance his mothers voice failed In a pinch the stage manager who had seen Charlie at play led the little boy onstage in her place Charlie continued his playacting unabated which included songs dances and impersonations from his mothers repertoire He was demonstrating the wares of his rst and best teacher in the art of makebelieve and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowdIn these and many other similar biographical anecdotes childhood makebelieve engendered imaginativeness that was clearly related to outstanding accomplishment in adulthood Of course the scientic and artistic talents of individuals like Curie Plath and Chaplin are rare among us Nevertheless as play theorists Dorothy and Jerome Singer point out all children have that same potential for playfulness for trying out possible lives that is the foundation for a humbler but personally meaningful creativityadult involvement in childrens makebelievePiagets view of makebelieve play dominant until recently asserts that pretending emerges spontaneously when children become capable of symbolic thought He assumed that very young children could not share play symbols with others Yet in instance after instance we have seen that adults are central in preschoolers play lives often encouraging and elaborating on their imaginative strivings If adults are prominent in early makebelieve how did researchers manage to adhere to an image of young children as solitary fantasizers for so long The reason is that until recently makebelieve was largely studied in the laboratory in sessions in which children arrived oneatatime and had no alternative but to play by themselves Only during the past  years have researchers seriously addressed the social context of makebelieve Their ndings conrm that pretending like other higher forms of thinking ows from social collaboration More competent partners scaffold young childrens imaginative play guiding its emergence and gradual renement Once pretend capacities are in place children forge playful understandings with peers that serve as microcosms of cooperative activity mirroring social relations and goaloriented pursuits within the larger societyScaffolding Childrens PlayTraci the  yearold who responded so strongly to the mothers death in The Sound of Music often pretends with her own mother Julie For some weeks Traci had been talking about a mysterious creature she called a maserus Tracis description of the creature convinced Julie that the maserus was an imaginative friendly monster Congested due to spring allergies Traci was particularly irritable one morning Well aware that Traci loves makebelieve activities her mother tried to distract her with a favorite pastime As Traci sneezed and whimpered Julie spied a halffull white garbage bag in a corner situated in such a way that it looked like an animal with a snout I think I see a maserus Julie declared pointing to the garbage bag Immediately Traci cast off her irritability and jumped into action Over the next hour she and her mother fed the maserus more trash read books and sang songs to it and laughed at the monsters antics By the end of our delightful session Julie remarked I almost felt the bag was alive When the activity changed to the more practical concerns of the day Tracis problematic irritability resumedRecent research reveals that makebelieve is from the outset a social activity In Western societies it usually rst appears between parents and children although older siblings may participate as well From these interactions children derive many play skills that enhance their makebelieve in other contexts In one of the most extensive studies tracing the development of makebelieve play psychologists Wendy Haight and Peggy Miller followed nine children from  to  years of age repeatedly visiting their homes to make intensive observations of their pretending The researchers found that most makebelievefrom  to  percentwas social across the entire age span Mothers were the childrens principal play partners from ages  to  Over time motherchild play declined and childchild play increased By age  children played about equally with their mothers and with other childrenboth siblings and peers The dominance of motherchild pretend at the youngest ages however was not due to lack of child playmates Up to age  even if siblings and peers were present children preferred playing with their mothers Furthermore Haight and Miller as well as other researchers report clear evidence that mothers teach their toddlers to pretend At age  mothers initiate almost all makebelieve episodes They also demonstrate many pretend actions toward objects thereby showing children how to use one object to represent another Around age  mothers begin to talk about nonexistent fantasy objects In one instance a mother suggested that an empty bowl was full of juicy oranges one for each of her sons miniature zoo animals This change may help children increase the range and complexity of their play symbolsSocial Functions and Consequences of AdultChild PlayJoint adultchild makebelieve serves a wide variety of social purposes Here is a sampling Teaching At times caregivers use pretending as a pleasurable way to teach children realworld skills For example Michaels mother capitalized on makebelieve to encourage her yearold to use the toilet Reluctant at rst Michael became an eager learner after being put in charge of toilet training his teddy bear Enlivening daily routines Often children and their caregivers call on pretend play to relieve the monotony of chores and other repetitive tasks While yearold Molly folded socks with her mother she put a pair together held it up and exclaimed Mommy I made us something to eatDefusing conflict Occasionally makebelieve can defuse persistent caregiverchild conicts Concerned about yearold Nancys use of a pacier her mother had been trying to get her to give it up Nancy resisted As they played with puppets Nancy announced I want a pacier Her mothers puppet responded Little girl You have only a red dot for a mouth I dont think you can t a pacier in thereExpressing and regulating emotion Tracis exploration with her mothers help of what it might be like to have a mother who got sick and died exemplies how parents and children use makebelieve to express and manage intense feelings In pretend scenarios Traci acted out feeling ill feeling better sadness happiness worry love and caringInuencing anothers social behavior Joint makebelieve can be an effective strategy for attaining a social goal When yearold Molly stood at the top of a slide and asked for help her mother tried to get her to slide down on her own Molly refused and stepped into pretend A shark    Theres a shark in the sand Mollys mother immediately helped her downHaving fun As illustrations of adultchild makebelieve throughout this chapter affirm most of the time parents and children engage in imaginative play just for fun In fact some theorists have argued that the earliest expressions of humor emerge out of fantasy play Consistent with this claim participating in adultchild makebelieve seems to precede childrens rst verbal jokes One toddler named Ari having become an avid makebeliever soon showed a corresponding rise in joking At  months he touched a picture of a sheep in a book his mother was reading to him exclaimed Neigh and laughed hysterically At  months while watching his mother wash dishes he remarked Nutmeg the family cat drinks water with spoon and then interpreted Funny thing Ari tell Mommy joke As Aris humor makes plain pretending is not just a pleasurable activity in itself but brings pleasure to life in generalThat joint makebelieve with adults is such great fun is undoubtedly a major reason that  to yearolds are so attracted to it But why is play with adults at least initially more engaging than play with peers While childrens play skills are still limited adult scaffolding makes play more interesting surprising and absorbing In several studies  to yearolds engaged in more than twice as much makebelieve when their mothers were involved than when they were not In addition caregiver support led early makebelieve to move toward a more advanced level For example when mothers actively took part children produced more complex pretend sequencesnot just putting the doll to sleep but brushing her teeth tucking her into bed singing a lullaby and kissing her good night Furthermore during parentchild play makebelieve themes are more varied and parents verbal commentary is especially effective in raising both the duration and the complexity of play In line with the zone children for whom makebelieve is just emerging act more competently when playing with an adult partner than they otherwise would In Haight and Millers investigation yearolds whose mothers engaged in a great deal of pretending ranked especially high in peer play at age  And children of the most imaginative and enthusiastic parents were among the most highly skilled preschool pretendersVital Features of AdultChild PlayHow should parents caregivers and teachers go about engaging young children in makebelieve Effective scaffolding of play is somewhat different from scaffolding of nonplay tasks In fostering play adults might have explicit goals such as teaching culturally valued knowledge and skills and promoting selfregulation and imagination But directiveness and didactic teaching are seldom if ever necessary As play theorist Brian SuttonSmith pointed out more than a quartercentury ago makebelieve enables children who are still acquiring language to represent their everyday lives and inner thoughts and feelings more completely than is possible through any other symbolic means This conrms Vygotskys statement that in play the child always behaves beyond his average age above his daily behavior Look back at the vignettes described in this chapterof Sophie giving a sleepy teddy bear a pacier of Alison recalling the train crash in India of Emily traveling to Sea World and of Traci roleplaying a mother getting sick and dyingand note how difficult it would be for  to yearolds to construct such wellarticulated ideas only in words or in their drawings Consequently adults do not need to tutor preschoolers in pretending as they sometimes do when helping them master puzzles or other similar tasksInstead adult participation in makebelieve works best when it responds to guides and builds on the childs behaviors with demonstrations and suggestions In support of this approach psychologist Barbara Fieses observations of mothers playing with their  to montholds revealed that maternal questions directions and intrusions initiating a new activity unrelated to the childs current play led to immature behavior in which toddlers merely mouthed touched and looked at toys Relentlessly barraging children with information that communicates at rather than with them fails to involve them in dialogue and interferes with optimum development of play In contrast turntaking and joint involvement in which mothers sustained or expanded on their childs play themes evoked high levels of pretending Maternal interactions that suggest play options related to  yearolds ongoing activityfor example saying Oh is the doll trying to swim as the child puts a doll into a toy cupcontinue to predict extended makebelieve sequences and imaginative object substitutions at age  In contrast toddlers whose mothers negate and correctNo dolls dont go in cups they go in the doll housetend to become yearolds who spend much time in simple immature manipulation of toys Finally the shared understanding underlying any type of adultchild communication that creates the zone is also essential in makebelieve Sensitive and mutually rewarding interaction between mother and baby in the rst year of life predicts complexity of motherchild pretending and childrens use of mentalstate words during play at age  Parental behaviors that assist infants in connecting socially and becoming effective conversationalists seem to enhance their play competence and ability to talk about others thoughts and feelings later on In sum quality of adultchild social engagement both within and outside of makebelieve play has much to do with the potential of such play to lead childrens development forwardenhancing sociodramatic play with peersAt child care yearold Sammy joins a group of children in the block area for a space shuttle launch That can be our control tower he suggests to Vance pointing to a corner by a bookshelfWait I gotta get it ready calls out Lynette who is still arranging the astronauts two dolls and a bear inside a circle of large blocks which represents the rocket OK all aboard Discovery Sammy broadcasts into a small wooden block his pretend loudspeaker After Lynette sets up the astronauts Sammy announces Countdown Five six two four one blastoff responds Vance commander of the control tower Lynette makes one of the dolls push a pretend button and reports Brrrm brrrm theyre going upAmong children who have regular contact with peers sociodramatic play with agemates increases greatly between ages  and  As this excerpt reveals by age  children can create and coordinate several characters in an elaborate plot and weave together intricate role relationships and story linesfactors that as we have seen contribute greatly to their cognitive and social competencePretending with peers draws on the diverse communication skills children develop with adults A secure infantparent attachment bond which grows out of caregiver warmth responsiveness and sensitive communication predicts socially mature peer play in early childhood including cooperation empathy and popularity And as I indicated in Chapter  the blend of warmth and expectations for mature behavior that make up authoritative parenting is linked to skilled peer interaction as well Social play with agemates must be responsive and harmonious to result in pleasurable satisfying longlasting play If sociodramatic play with agemates is to serve as a zone for learning shared understanding or intersubjectivity is essential just as it is in adult child dialogues In the shuttlelaunch episode Sammy Vance and Lynette reached a high level of intersubjectivity as they worked out a division of labor and responded to one another in a smooth complementary fashion Of course children do argue and disagree Piaget underscored the role of these conicts in getting children to give up their egocentrism and notice others perspectives Yet conict is far less effective in promoting sensitivity to others beliefs thoughts and feelings than is returning to a state of intersubjectivityby engaging in cooperative dialogues and resolving differences of opinionIntersubjectivity among preschool play partners increases with age When psychologist Artin Gnc observed  and yearolds engaged in sociodramatic pursuits the yearolds more often considered their partners preferences and built on their partners play actsby asking a partner what he or she would like to do introducing relevant new elements into the play narrative compromising in instances of conict and expressing agreement with the partners ideas  These features of play reect childrens developing sensitivity to diverse points of view and their appreciation of the value of a meeting of minds for pleasurable rewarding playResearch indicates that parents and teachers rarely mediate preschoolers peer relations unless intense disagreements arise that threaten safety or in the case of teachers classroom order And when adults do step in they seldom use interventions that help children regulate their own interaction Instead adults often resort to directive strategies in which they tell children exactly what to say and do and therefore solve the problem for them as in Dont grab Ask for a turn or Wait until Sandra is nishedThese techniques are appropriate for children who lack social skills and therefore at least initially benet from clear direction But adults need to modify these strategies to suit childrens play maturity providing assistance tailored to the childs zone Sticking with directive interventions does not prompt children to come up with effective solutions to conict as it arisesstrategies that work because they take into account both the childs and the playmates desiresAt times the adult might model a social skill or give the child examples of strategies as in You could ask Paul Would you let me try it for a while or you could say May we share it At other times the adult might encourage the child to generate possible strategies What could you do to get Mary and Andrea to let you play too In each instance parents and teachers select the level of support that best matches the childs current social capacities and then pull back as the child acquires new social problemsolving skills Many parents and teachers hesitate to mediate childrens play perhaps because they believe incorrectly that children pick up social skills just by spending time with agemates Vygotskys theory tells us that adults are active agents in childrens social development If they wait until a childs negative acts become extreme then their rst impulse is to assert high control and sometimes force The following three suggestions can help parents and teachers select strategies that foster more mature social behaviorIntervene soon enough to prevent peer difficulties from escalating thereby avoiding highly intrusive intervention tacticsFocus on developing the skills of each child not just on quelling disturbances Ask yourself What have I seen this child do in situations similar to this one How can I help the child communicate more effectivelyThink in terms of the support that is necessary without taking over social responsibilities that children can assume on their own Ask yourself How much of my help does the child require to meet his or her goals in this situation A general prompt Some suggested strategies Or a specic directive and a demonstrationCompared to sociodramatic play preschoolers nd it harder to establish a cooperative shared framework when working together on realistic projects such as construction puzzle and art activities To collaborate on these tasks they need much more adult instruction and monitoring than they do in makebelieve activities Here again childrens social competence is more advanced in makebelieve play than in other situations The social skills mastered in sociodramatic activities gradually generalize helping children work toward shared goals in nonplay pursuitsphysical contexts for makebelieve playAdults promote childrens makebelieve not just through scaffolding their pretending and social behavior but also through arranging a stimulating appropriate play environment The physical context of childrens play is important because it shapes play themes and opportunities to interact with agemates Consequently it can have a profound impact on what children learnPlay MaterialsToys and other play props should capitalize on childrens current makebelieve capacities while gently spurring children forward toward a wider range of themes roles and characters and increasingly intricate story lines As children become conscious of the goals of play and more concerned with rules and rulefollowing adults can provide opportunities for game play Then they can extend these understandings by gradually introducing more complex gamesMartha Bronsons The Right Stuff for Children Birth to Age  is an excellent resource for selecting play materials that support development in early childhood Although it is written for teachers preschool and childcare center directors and elementary school principals it can also guide parents Here is an overview of changing needs for makebelieve and game materials from toddlerhood into the primary gradesbeginnings  months to  yearsToddlers need a small selection of realisticlooking toys to support their beginning capacity to pretend These include stuffed animals soft clothbodied or rubber dolls with simple care accessories a play telephone and housekeeping items to support role play large hand puppets for an adult and small hand puppets for the child and transportation toys both the large riding type and the smaller handmanipulated variety Already picture books can inspire makebelieve especially when they depict familiar objects and experiences By the end of this period as toddlers begin to develop the representational capacities and ne motor skills for setting up scenes themselves they enjoy small peg people that t in cars boats and other vehicles Soon after they are ready for more complex scenesdollhouse garage or barn And some start to dress up an activity that can be supported by old clothing of family membersexpanding makebelieve skills  to  yearsBetween ages  and  fantasytheme repertoires expand greatly Children take increasing responsibility for initiating and elaborating makebelieve scenarios rst with adults and older siblings then with agemates During this period they can make use of a wider array of makebelieve materialsdiverse dolls from babies to children their own age and with physical and cultural differences they see in their communities more feeding and care accessories vehicles of different types and sizes play scenes with a larger number of peg people animals and inanimate props large and small blocks for putting together pretend structures and a more varied array of dressup clothingAround this age placing pretend materials in sand and waterplay areas begins to inspire highly imaginative and extended play Also books videos and TV programs with simple narratives offer models that young preschoolers can act out and embellish in makebelieve With respect to TVs potential for inspiring play programs with slowpaced nonviolent action and easytofollow story lines such as Barney and Friends and Mr Rogers Neighborhood lead to more elaborate makebelieve play than do those presenting quick disconnected bits of informationblossoming of sociodramatic play  to  yearsThe mid to latepreschool years are a time of burgeoning capacity for sociodramatic play especially group pretend Children incorporate more detail into their play themes and benet from increasingly varied and exible propshand and nger puppets dolls with articulated limbs that can be manipulated doll clothing with buttons zippers and other fasteners more housekeeping accessories such as high chairs bassinets and cooking serving and washing equipment and diverse play animals including sh reptiles dinosaurs and exotic speciesOlder preschoolers can comprehend and recall more complex stories and they like books and videos about children their own age animals and everyday life such as a visit to a hospital a re station or a factory They also like ridiculous funny and dramatic fantastic tales Often they memorize those they like best and act them out in makebelieveThe years from  to  are a time of peak interest in play scenes such as house school airport farm and zoo In addition to prepackaged scene sets children can be provided the raw materialsshoe boxes pipe cleaners cardboard cylinders aluminum foil and art suppliesto create their own scenes Whereas realistic toys encourage preschoolers to act out everyday roles nonspecic materials often encourage fantastic role play such as pirates or creatures from outer space Fantastic roles in turn prompt more complex peer interaction especially statements that plan and comment on the makebelieve scenario itself as in Ill be the pirate and you be the prisoner Since fantastic makebelieve does not follow highly familiar scripts children must devote more energy to working out each episode and explaining what they are doing to their companionsLiteracy objects offer another powerful illustration of how play materials mold makebelieve content Early childhood educators Susan Neuman and Kathy Roskos provided  to yearolds in a childcare program with literacyenriched housekeeping office and library areas For example the housekeeping area included cookbooks coupons recipe cards grocery packages and pencils and notepads for listmaking Compared to agemates in a control program without extra literacy props the children engaged in far more complex and extended literacyrelated pretending They more often talked about literacy objects pretended to read and write as part of role play and transformed literacy props imaginatively such as calling a cookbook a magic genie book and a piece of paper directions for ballet lessonsChildren at the upper end of this age range start to become interested in games At rst simple games that depend on chance rather than strategy or skill are bestlotto dominoes and card games based on matching and visual memory such as Concentrationadvanced sociodramatic and game play  to  yearsIn the early school grades children display an even greater capacity to create replicas of the world around themskills that teachers may build on in extended projects such as studying a Native American village or the wildlife of a rain forest Six to yearolds continue to like role play and teachers can use it to foster their academic development One thirdgrade teacher invented a magic carpet on which her class traveled to different countries integrating all academic areas into the experiencereading writing math science and social studiesAround ages  and  as children become more conscious of the rules of play they like to act out scripted puppet shows and plays As informal makebelieve declines game play strengthens By the end of this period children formulate and implement strategies and cooperate more effectively in games They have also become interested in competition Hence they are ready for basic strategy gamescheckers chess fantasy and adventure games word games and team sports such as Tball and soccerEquipping and Arranging the Play EnvironmentIn addition to the appropriateness of play materials their quantity and arrangement affect the maturity and diversity of themes in childrens makebelieve These features of the environment also inuence the congeniality of peer interaction With respect to quantity childrens behavior can tell us whether they have too many or too few toys An excess of toys overwhelms and overstimulates The child whose bedroom is piled high with all the latest playthings is likely to cherish and play with few of them Alternatively poorquality childcare centers widespread in the United States are often underequipped with play materials In one such program that I visited the blockbuilding area had only twenty blocks for sixty  to yearolds Although a stove table refrigerator and crib lined the perimeter of the housekeeping area there were just three dolls a handful of dishes one pan and six dressup garments to inspire role play Without adults and play props to engage them many younger children wandered aimlessly And rather than becoming immersed in sociodramatic pursuits older children quarreled over the few toys available Research conrms that when playthings are in short supply preschoolers conicts increaseThe power of play spaces to affect the variety of makebelieve themes is dramatically evident in preschoolers genderstereotyped toy choices and pretend themes By age  gender differences in play are evident and they strengthen over early childhood Parents vary greatly in their genderrole attitudes the more traditional their beliefs the more genderstereotyped their toy purchases and the more stereotyped their childrens play In many classrooms the arrangement of play areas reinforces these sharp gender distinctions Separate housekeeping and blockbuilding areashubs of preschool pretendingresult in girls gathering in housekeeping where they enact domestic roles and boys congregating in blocks where they build intricate structures play energetically with vehicles and create fantastic and adventurous scenariosWhen graduate student Cheryl Kinsman and I collaborated with a kindergarten teacher to rearrange these play spaces striking changes in childrens play occurred We removed the wall of shelves dividing housekeeping from blocks joining the two areas into one While the shelves were in place play was highly gender stereotyped Children largely interacted with peers of their own gender especially when girls were in housekeeping and boys in blocks Also when boys did enter housekeeping their play was generally irrelevant to the goals of the setting In one instance several boys scurried on all fours around the kitchen table each pushing a large wooden truck while a traffic director stood on a chair shouting Green light go Red light stop But once the play areas were joined boys and girls frequently played together And girls especially engaged in more complex play integrating materials from both areas into their fantasy themes Finally negative interactions between children declined after we removed the divider perhaps because the more open play space reduced crowding and competition for materials As these outcomes illustrate play spaces often promote attitudes and practices of the surrounding culturein ways not evident to teachers and parents Our intervention encouraged this teacher to think more carefully about the impact her classroom design had on the quality of childrens play experiencesthe transformation of the childs play worldThe makebelieve play and games of early childhood offer an inuential route to acquiring cultural values and the selfregulation children need to act in accord with those values In the heat of the childs relentless requests for new toys advertised on TV and in the possession of playmates parents seldom stop to ask the question What activities will this toy inspire What values will the activities teach What social rules will my child learn to follow A comparison of the fantasy activities of American children with those of children in other cultures spotlights potent lessons of the play world not given sufficient conscious consideration Childrens makebelieve places greater emphasis on imaginativeness and autonomy in Western individualistic nations than in collectivist societies While American preschoolers often conjure up fantastic roles and vie with peers for the most stimulating and inuential of them children in Asian cultures devote more hours to play in which they perform actions in unison For example in a game called Bhatto Bhatto East Indian children act out a trip to market requiring intricate touching of one anothers elbows and hands as they pretend to cut and share a tasty vegetable On Childrens Day in the Peoples Republic of China preschoolers gather on lawns outside their classrooms to perform largegroup highly scripted activities for their families They sing stories conveying social and moral lessons while dramatizing them with complex hand motions and body postures in which each child acts identically The personal expressiveness and role negotiation in Western childrens play are well suited for developing innovativeness selfreliance and social problemsolving skillstraits important for success in Western school and work worlds Nevertheless Western childrens play has been transformed into an everenlarging culture of conspicuous consumption encompassing a seemingly endless array of costly fancy amusements Parents are quick to feel guilty about depriving children of the latest educational playthings or jeopardizing their integration into a peer network in which toys and other possessions are a salient basis for belonging Yet parents gatekeeper role with respect to play is as crucial as it is in the realm of TV An important point to note is that many contemporary toys undermine imagination and selfregulation Aggressive toys are the most worrisome Preschoolers who transform a stick or block into a weapon are doing little more than exploring a pervasive aspect of their culture But equipping children with realisticlooking guns swords shields and other tools of warfare is tantamount to setting up a training ground in aggression Such toys foster both pretend and real hostility among peers Boys penchant for high activity excitement and risk taking and their view of weaponry as the ultimate in masculinity attract them to war toys Furthermore when boys play with action gures modeled on violent TV and movie characters such as Power Rangers Transformers and XMen their play narrows to mimicking the characters televised behavior and is generally aggressive and stereotyped Video games with violent plots in which children advance by shooting and evading the enemy are yet another fantasy pursuit that largely appeals to boys A growing number of studies conrm that heavy playing of such games duplicates the effects of violent TV by promoting aggression and desensitizing children to violence Furthermore video games even more than TV are riddled with ethnic and gender stereotypes In watching what happens once fastaction video games have entered their households many parents express another concernthat their children will become addicted to these violent amusements About  percent usually boys develop into passionate or excessive players during the elementary school years and desperately need parental intervention Compared to infrequent users children highly involved in video games spend less time productively more often watching cartoons and less often reading One parent whose son Joey spent his early childhood focused on play with Transformers and his school years immersed in video games complained about the boys mediocre grades and lamented Nothing seems to interest him Joey spent so much time with highly stimulating video games that he came to regard slowerpaced pursuits that require greater initiative to reach a goal as dullOf course preschoolerseven those as young as age benet from experience with computers as long as activities are constructive adults are available to support them and children are not diverted from other worthwhile activities But in homes in which family members are preoccupied with the computer especially the Internet time spent communicating and enjoying joint leisure activities declines Therefore the computers value for acquiring new skills and information must be weighed against its potential for detracting from adultchild dialogues and other family activities Childrens opportunities to engage in developmentenhancing makebelieve and game play are at risk in yet another way Their lives are often heavily organized and scheduled Many leave preschool childcare and primaryschool settings which may not recognize the value of play for lateafternoon lessons and adultorganized sports leagues Contributing to the rise in these adultdirected activities is a decline in neighborhood safety making parents unwilling to allow their children to gather outside without supervision In many American communities childorganized games handed down from one generation to the nextfor example red rover statues blind mans buff leapfrog and endless variants on popular sportsare a thing of the past Some experts worry that adultstructured athletics are robbing children of crucial learning experiences that accrue from spontaneous game play When adults control childrens games place heavy pressure on them to win and assign them to specic roles so they lose the opportunity to experiment with rules and strategies then the arguments of critics are valid Furthermore children who join teams so earlyby ages  or that the physical cognitive and social skills demanded are well beyond their current capabilities usually lose interest and want to drop out And parents and coaches who criticize rather than encourage and do not let players forget about defeat prompt intense anxiety in some youngsters Eventually those children may avoid athletics entirelyTo safeguard childrens learning and enthusiasm makebelieve play rather than organized sports is best for preschoolers When children are ready for game play permitting them to select sports they enjoy to progress at their own pace and to participate in decisions about team rules preserves the positive lessons discussed in this chapterin cooperation fair play and willingly following social rules Finally practice times must be adjusted to childrens attention spans and need for unstructured time with family and peers Two practices a week each no longer than thirty minutes is sufficient for  to yearoldsBy observing childrens play themes we can discover much about the values and identities that our cultureby way of homes childcare centers schools and community youth activitiestransmits to the next generation As leaders in childrens development parents and teachers are in a prime position to design and inuence childrens play worlds in ways that shield them from acquiring materialistic and violent attitudes and behaviors and that accentuate plays cognitive emotional and social benets Vygotskys theory reminds us that as long as we think carefully about the play materials we offer the style and content of adultchild play and the social skills we encourage in childrens peer relations makebelieve play can nurture a wide range of capacities essential for academic social and laterlife success
