                                             Here in Havana and indeedin the whole of Cuba there is only one daily newspaper and it normallyconsists of eight thin pages except when Fidel Castro makes a speech at whichtime the countrys paper shortage is momentarily overlooked From Tuesday toSaturday the publication is called Granma  the official organ of theCommunist Party named for that overcrowded boat in which Castro crossed toCuba from Mexico in  Sunday it is called Rebelde Rebel Youthand run by the Union of Young Communists Monday it is calledTrabajadores Workers and run by the Communist trade union movementRebelde is said to have a rather lighter touch than Granma andTrabajadores to be even grimmer but the editorial lines of all threeare identical handed down by Castro himself For a brief period these paperswere printed on recycled sugar cane but this gave them the texture and colorof a stiff brown paper bag and was abandoned in favor of recycled paper LastSaturday Granma announced on its front page that Cubas NationalFestival for the Recycling of Primary Materials would be shown live ontelevision from  am to  pm                           Granma is one of the few traditional Communist Party newspapers left inthe world imbued with irrepressible optimism about the prospects for the sugarharvest and for the Cuban economy in general as the country limps along in theeconomic misery that it calls on Castros insistence The Special Period inPeacetime Among several cheerful sugar stories in the last few days was oneaccentuating the positive aspect of recent flooding in the countryside Whilethis would set back the sugar harvest Granma said it would also makesugar cane easier to plant            Favorite topics of the paper are of course theshortcomings of

collisions in theyears   and  against NASAs reassuring one that the world shouldsurvive until at least             Granma regularly makes favorable comparisonsbetween Cubas human rights record and the United States US policy has beendetermined by wrong American ideas about political democracy it maintainsLast Saturday its main front page headline read The First Human Right Is theRight to Live as a Human Being Cuba Will Continue Fighting Resisting andWinning for as Long as Necessary Since then Granma s front page hasled for three days in a row with the activities in Havana of the visitingprime minister of St Kitts Denzil Douglas            Anancient alleged example of US contempt for human rights was the dispersal in of three identical Long Island New York triplets to see how they wouldgrow up separately This story was published in Granma this week underthe headline Monstrous Experiment The lifting by the United States of someof its antiCuba restrictions was reported briefly by Granma on

published weekly in French Spanish German andPortuguesehas been visited by  million people in  days a surge ofinterest it attributed to the popes recent visit to Cuba and the return of CheGuevaras bones from Bolivia But the paper also deplored the culturaldomination of the Internet by the United States and Europe                           Granma specializes in historical anniversaries finding

Body  an anthology of erotic letters in a review that beganSexuality sensuality passion and pleasure have always been the mainpreoccupation of young Cuban writers            The newspaper publishes justone letter a week from a reader always with an editorial riposte at thebottom This weeks was from a woman and had to do with the desperate attemptsthat she and her fiance made to find somewhere to eat in Havana on the eveningof Valentines Day They tried more than a halfdozen restaurants and pizzaparlors and found them variously full out of food closed for lack of waterfor washing up and charging oneeighth of a months salary for a single pizzaBut they persevered she said firm and optimistic in their search untilthey were finally allowed by a packed restaurant to eat their dinner off thefloor They were lucky enough she said to find a bus quickly and be back homein time to watch the Saturday night movie            The comment at the bottom ofthis letter said the newspaper had decided to omit the names of the restaurantsconcerned because they wouldnt be known by respectable people outside theneighborhood and made no comment on the facilities they lacked Instead itcongratulated the couple on the courage and optimism that had enabled them inthe end to triumph You got home in time to see the film so it really wasntsuch a bad day
