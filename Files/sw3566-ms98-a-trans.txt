        okay were ready to begin     okay uh okay one of the things they said about how you feel about putting you an elderly person in a nursing home um   yes   id had that situation presented to me personally about three years ago when i had to put my place my dad in a nursing home and um   okay   he had Alzheimers and he uh wandered and i had to put him in there for his own safety because i could not i couldnt care for him here any longer i tried as hard as i could   is that pretty much a full time care situation isnt it   yes and uh i had to work and he would get up in the middle of the night and he could get out and wander down the street and i was afraid for his safety um   right   and so i had to make that decision um   did you did you um check into um a lot of different facilities and see what they care they offered   yes i did i checked into the facilities uh the other thing that i did and ive recommended other people to do the same thing sometimes is to check and with people that have family members in that nursing facility you know see if you can find out who who has a family member there or if you go and check it stop and ask somebody when you see them you know do you have you know what relative do you have here um how is the care are you satisfied   yeah   um it took me quite a while to choose   did you find there was a large range of costs involved in in nursing homes   yes very much so there was a large range of costs uh and the cost didnt necessarily reflect the care   yeah   the cost some of the costs went for other amenities for those that were uh up and ambulatory like really nice dining rooms and you know uh things like that but that was for one segment but then the other segment that needed full nursing care i didnt feel i got the benefit of the extra cost   is that what thats what im im thinking uh my mother right now is is able to care for herself and   umhum   uh i was interested in looking uh for something that would have a a range of care i guess so that you know   right and you would want the maybe the uh extra amenities you know like the very nice dining room and you know the freedom of the grounds to be nice so they can walk out there and you know activities youd organized organized activities   yeah yeah organized activities   and things like that   the uh ones that offer more uh uh care i i assumed that they have certain requirements for their uh nursing and medical staff uh some sort of requirements state requirements or   right right yeah each state is different but uh here here in Texas there are certain you know requirements   yeah is there um uh did you find there was a waiting list for some of them or to get into   some of them yes there was a waiting list um   okay   in fact i had uh one when my i first started i went through a series of lets see i had my dad in two different nursing homes when i first started he was in one that wasnt total total patient care but where he could be watched but he had the freedom to wander around and and help caring caring for himself but he could do you know he could feed himself he could do things for himself um   yes   and i had him on a waiting list there then he got so that he could they could not handle him at that level and they didnt have a higher level at that facility which i really didnt think of   yeah uhhuh   you know when i checked him in uh so then i had to go and search i had to start all over again   do you know whether or not uh some of the uh programs such as uh Medicaid a uh help fund any of of the costs involved in in elderly care   uh Medicaid will under certain circumstances Medicare will again under you know have to be discharged from the hospital and for so many days uh Medicare will like i said under certain circumstances my dad did not was not eligible for Medicaid and Medicare would not cover Alzheimers   okay so theres theres uh some things theyll cover and some they wont   so that yeah   okay   it almost goes by case by case   yeah um thats uh thats something i think many people uh have to address at some point or other and and uh it its a tough decision to make especially depending on your the care that is needed and and uh   it is   uh in in todays life more and more children really cant uh with working both couples working it gets almost impossible to do that at home anymore   it it does and
