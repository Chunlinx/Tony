                                 Whats a But For            The LosAngeles Times leads with a story on everybodys front A divided UNSecurity Council voted today to create a new arms inspection system for Iraqwith the promise to President Saddam Hussein that sanctions against his countryimposed after the  Gulf war could be suspended within a year andeventually lifted if he cooperates as the New York Times puts it All three papers note Iraqmay never accept the plan Both Times es state that experts suspect Iraqhas been restocking its supplies of prohibited weapons the LAT lists theseas chemical and biological arms and components of atomic bombs All papersreport that three France Russia China of the five permanent members of theCouncil abstained from voting which might weaken the councils position andthe possibility of Iraqs compliance the US and Britain were the twopermanent members that supported the measure Except for the LAT storywhich explains Iraq said it would cancel diplomatic relations and oil contractswith France if the French supported the resolution theres not much on thereason for the abstentions            The Washington Post s lead is local The Beltway will soon getuglier as a federal appeals court resurrected plans to replace thedeteriorating Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge with a lane one that shouldalleviate congestion            The NYT s leadis also local Gov George E Pataki and bipartisan legislative leaders agreedto raise the states cigarette tax by  cents a pack in an ambitious effortto provide health care coverage for as many as one million uninsured NewYorkers The agreement is part of a larger plan expected to cost  millionover the next three and a half years to expand coverage Passage of relatedlegislation to be introduced possibly next week is highly likely            The focus of the WP s front piece on yesterdays GoreBradley debate isclear by its headline  Debate Centers on Health Care The WP waits till about halfway through its piece beforeindicating that the two Democratic hopefuls discussed anything else It reportsthat both agreed stricter gun control is needed though Bradley claimed hisplan was more serious than Gores A NYT piece reefered to on its front and LAT front piecetouch on many more of the issues discussed The WP gives the impression that the debate was heated TheNYT  while notingthat Bradley showed a new persistence and aggressiveness and that health carewas a contentious issue said the two candidates agreed more than theydisagreed The LAT similarly calls the debate mostly  decorous Gorethinks Bradleys health plan is too expensive Bradley thinks Gores wontreach enough currently uninsured people The LAT has themost detail on the education issue reporting Gore accused Bradley ofinsufficient commitment to federal action on education None of the papers havepoll statistics related to how any of these issues rank on voters list ofconcerns            A NYT frontpiece says that the Environmental Protection Agency ordered  Southern andMidwestern plants mainly electricitygenerating ones to cut in half theiremissions of nitrous oxides that contribute to Eastern seaboard smog at therequest of Eastern states who asked for help meeting national smog standardsThe EPA estimates the order would raise the cost of electricity by one percentbut that costs to consumers are still expected to decline because ofderegulation of the industry the NYT should be more clear about what the final relative costto consumers might be Some executives and officials in the targeted states aredenouncing the mandate            News that an Algerian man named Ahmed Ressam was seized at the Canadianborder because he was carrying bombmaking materials is on all three frontsThe WP cites an anonymous law enforcement official inmaking the claim that possible links between Ressam and antiAmerican militantOsama bin Laden are being pursued and quotes an anonymous Clintonadministration official saying this was not a runofthemill operation This was serious The LAT also mentions the possible connection though bothpapers note a definite link to bin Laden has not been established The NYT makes no mention of binLaden and credits an anonymous government official with the quote Theresnothing mysterious at all about what was in Ressams car though it alsosays government officials are worried that the man could be part of aninternational terrorist group The NYT and the LAT say the State Department recently warned that ithad credible information about terrorist attacks against American citizenstimed around the Jan  millennium celebrations The Post says  the LAT says  ofbin Ladens associates were arrested this week for plotting such attacks            The WP offlead reports Clinton is strongly considering makinga request for government reimbursement of most or all of the  million theClintons owe in unpaid legal bills associated with the Whitewater and Monicainvestigationswhich have already cost the public  million To bereimbursed Clintons lawyers would have to prove that he would not have neededa lawyer but for the independent counsel statute This is the socalled butfor clause So if Clinton can show he wouldnt have been prosecuted by aregular prosecutor hell get the money
