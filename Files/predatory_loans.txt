Lawmakers eye predatory loansLending practices still face scrutinyBy David OlingerDenver Post Staff WriterSunday March  Eileen Ledford says she learned too late that her new home loanwas based on a lieThe mortgage broker put her age at  And he claimed she earned a month  or  a year  from a home quiltingbusiness she had owned for  yearsIm  she said adding that she never owned a quiltingcompany never worked for one and never told a loan agent she didI dont even know how to quiltWhat the imaginary quilting business did produce was a loan thatshe and her husband Linn who is  and suffers from congestiveheart failure cannot possibly affordThree times they have signed with highinterest lenders thatrefinanced their Denver home gave them some cash and escalatedtheir debts The latest is Fieldstone Mortgage Co which ischarging them  a month   more than their combinedmonthly retirement incomeLast month they couldnt make the payment on a house they haveowned for  yearsRyan Reilly the broker who admits putting the nonexistentquilting business on the loan application shared  incommis sions with a company that referred the Ledfords to him ayear ago He said he was just trying to help them get the moneythey needed for credit card bills and home improvementsBut in hindsight I really wish Id never done the loan hetold The Denver Post It didnt really help them in the longrunAt the state Capitol this week Colorado legislators will debatewhat to do about such loansThe Senate is expected to vote on a bill sponsored by Sen DougLinkhart to combat abusive home loan practices It would limitloan fees and ban several predatory practices such as prepaymentpenalties and balloon payments on highcost home loansLinkhart a Denver Democrat introduced the bill at the behestof AARP ACORN and other consumer groups He expects it to pass theSenate but foresees trouble in the Republicancontrolled HouseLining up against his bill are lenders and brokers who contend itwould undermine an already weakened housing market and deny homeloans to people with shaky creditThe Colorado Association of Mortgage Brokers for one iscampaigning instead to license brokers and create a mortgage boardwhere homeowners could take complaints But its proposal facesopposition from the Colorado Mortgage Lenders Association whichargues that brokers should not shoulder new regulations and highercosts just because a few people are writing bad loansIn the House Rep Rosemary Marshall DDenver is preparing apredatorylending bill with fewer restrictions than Linkhartproposed While she supports his bill my objective is to getsomething done this year she saidThe inspiration for this flurry of proposals is thefastgrowing aggressively marketed subprime lending industry Thefederal government now tracks  companies specializing insubprime loans that broaden access to home mortgages but at aprice that typically includes higher interest rates and fees andother costly requirementsElderly and minority homeowners hold a disproportionate share ofthese highercost loansNo good resource for helpUsing federal home loan data The Post reported last year thatblack homeowners in Denver were  times as likely as whitehomeowners to borrow from subprime lenders and Hispanics times as likely The data also showed that black homeowners earningmore than  a year were more likely to get subprime loansthan white homeowners earning less than  a year a patternthat reflected national trendsWhen a highcost loan appears destined to drive the borrower todefault advocates for Colorado homeowners say there are few placesto turn for helpHans Fedge a mortgage broker assisting Linn and Eileen Ledfordsaid he faces the same dilemma again and again By the timehomeowners seek help they have lost much of their equity Theyhave no money for a lawyer And state law enforcement agenciesfocus on patterns of fraudulent behavior not problems withindividual loansThere is really no good resource for the victims to getassisted right now Fedge saidLinn Ledford ran a Denver wholesale showroom and lived with hiswife in a modest house that originally cost  Thirtyoneyears later their old neighborhood is being replaced bysandstonehued luxury homes encircling the Cherry Creek shoppingdistrictThe Ledfords expanded and refinanced their house over time onceto accommodate a grand piano that Linn played But the series ofsubprime loans that took them down what he calls the slipperyslope date to  when he was He blames himself for their predicament including theFieldstone Mortgage loan he persuaded his wife to sign with hergood credit Its just my stupidity and lack of understanding whatcould happen he said I had no ideaWhen Fedge examined the Ledfords recent mortgage loan historythis is what he sawThey refinanced in August  with Advanta a subprime lenderthat charged  percent interest That loan raised their paymentsto  a month or  percent of their current monthlyincomeIn October  they refinanced again with New Century Mortgageanother subprime lender That lowered their interest rate to percent But their principal balance jumped  to and their mortgage payments grew by  a monthIn December  they refinanced with Fieldstone gettingalmost  for credit card debts home improvements and thegrowing gap between their expenses and incomeThe new loan raised their mortgage debt  to Its costs included  in broker commissions and a prepayment penalty to terminate the New Century loan Theirinterest rate climbed to  percent and could go as high as percent Their mortgage payments immediately jumped  a monthto All based on a nonexistent home quilting businessA copy of the loan application shows that Ryan Reilly listedEileen Ledford as the yearold owner of The American Quilt Hersupposed income  a month The Ledfords actual income a month from Social Security and a small annuityFedge called the brokers misstatements unconscionableReilly does not deny putting information on the application formthat he knew was incorrect But he said he thought the Ledfordsunderstood they could qualify only if he put down a statedincome typically an undocumented business income that raises theborrowers interest rate I told them You guys dont make enoughmoney  he saidReilly also said he thought mortgage brokers commonly exaggeratebusiness proceeds in statedincome loans  I would say  percentof the time they are padded  adding that he was  andinexperienced at the time and has not repeated the mistakesinceIm trying to get away from the mortgage industry in Coloradohe said Theres so much conflict in it and theres not manyregulationsCouple felt uninformedThe Ledfords say they came away from a hurried loan closingwithout understanding how much their mortgage payments wouldincrease or how Reilly had qualified them to borrow They say they didnt know the application described Eileen as aquilting company owner until Fedge pointed it out That I did notsee when I signed the papers she said I would have saidWhoa right awayTheir new loan has forced them to put their home up for sale Ifthey sell it they face another prepayment penalty of almost to Fieldstone MortgageFedge and Jose Vasquez a Colorado Legal Services lawyer assertthat Fieldstone bears some responsibility for approving a loanbased on a suspiciously lucrative income from an elderly womanselling quilts from her house They asked Fieldstone to trade adeed to the house for  enough cash to let the Ledfords buya condoI know that Fieldstone is interested in finding a workableresolution said Adam Bass a lawyer for the company adding thathe cant comment on the details of the Ledford loanMeanwhile the phone calls persist from solicitors hoping torefinance the Ledfords home againWe get at least a dozen calls every other day Eileen Ledfordsaid It feels like hundreds
