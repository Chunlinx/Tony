Member Subcommittee onOversight of GovernmentManagement Restructuring and the District of ColumbiaCommittee on Governmental Affairs United States SenateDear Senator VoinovichPeople are the federal governments most valuable asset inmanaging for results and you have emphasized the importance ofempowering and involving employees to help agencies achieve theirgoals and improve government operations As our studies of privateand public sector organizations have shown highperformingorganizations focus on valuing and investing in theiremployeeshuman capitaland on aligning their people policiesto support organizational performance goals However strategichuman capital management is a pervasive challenge in the federalgovernment and is one of the governmentwide areas that we haveidentified as high riskIn addition the Administrations emphasis on workforce planningand restructuring will require federal agencies to examine how theycan flatten their organizational hierarchy and improve their workprocesses The Office of Management and Budgets May  bulletin called for agencies to use workforce planning toredistribute higherlevel positions to frontline service deliverypositions that interact with citizens Effective workforceplanning and restructuring efforts will build upon implementationof the Government Performance and Results Act of  GPRA toaddress resultsoriented goals improve performance and assureaccountability To optimize the provision of services to citizensit is crucial that employees understand the connection betweentheir daily work activities and the results their organizationsseek to achieve HighRisk Series An Update  GAO Jan  Office of Management and Budget Bulletin No  WorkforcePlanning and Restructuring May  At your request this report examines selected experiences fiveagencies have had in implementing practices that helped empower orinvolve frontline employees Our objectives were to  identifyand provide examples of the key practices agencies used to empowerand involve employees identify some of the barriers that these agenciesexperienced and strategies they used to address them and provide examples of reported performance improvements fromempowering and involving employees As agreed we have examinedselected employee empowerment and involvement practices at specificcomponents within the Federal Aviation Administration FAA theFederal Emergency Management Agency FEMA the Internal RevenueService IRS the Office of Personnel Management OPM and theVeterans Benefits Administration VBA The practices we examinedat specific agency components were selected from those initiativesagency officials identified that had in their view successfullyempowered and involved employeesThe organizations we reviewed used six keypractices in the initiatives thatResults In Briefwe reviewed to empower and involve employees Figure identifies the practices and provides some examples of how theorganizations used themFigure  Six Practices Used to Help Empower and InvolveEmployeesDemonstrating top leadership commitment Top leadershipcommitment is crucial in instilling a common vision across theorganization and creating an environment that is receptive toinnovation Leaders of the agency organizations we reviewedenvisioned needed changes communicated openly with employees andinstituted organizational changes For example the Director of theFAA Logistics Center decided that the Center needed to operate morelike a private sector business He met in open forums withemployees to discuss his vision and with the help of employees andunion representatives reorganized the CenterEngaging employee unions Effective labormanagementrelations help to achieve consensus and solve problemsexpeditiously In some cases the unions participated inpredecisional discussions with agency management before changeswere implemented For example IRS involved its employees union inpredecisional discussions about proposed new policiesTraining employees to enhance their knowledge skillsand abilities All five agencies provided formal or onthejobtraining to employees to support the changes that were being madeFor example OPM provided onthejob cross training to a retirementprocessing team so that the team could adjudicate retirement claimsunder both the Civil Service Retirement System CSRS and theFederal Employees Retirement System FERSUsing employee teams to help accomplish agency missionsAll five agencies used teams to help accomplish agency missionsTeams helped flatten organizations by merging divisions andenhanced flexibility in meeting job demands For example VBAregional offices created selfdirected employee teams and mergeddivisions to process veterans benefits claims from beginning toend Team members learned new skills and had more flexibility tohelp each other accomplish tasksInvolving employees in planning and sharing performanceinformation The agencies involved employees to varying degrees inplanning and shared performance information with them For exampleone IRS division used an employee team to help develop itsstrategic plan and shared performance information One way thatFAAs Logistics center shared performance information was byposting performance data in charts graphs and tables throughoutthe building so employees could see the Centers progress towardachieving organizational goalsDelegating authorities to frontline employees Employeesat each of the agencies had been delegated authorities In someinstances employees were formally authorized to approve specifieddollar levels of program assistance or procurements For exampleFEMAs public assistance coordinators were authorized to approve upto  in financial assistance to citizens adversely affectedby natural disasters or other emergencies In other instancesteams of employees were provided new authorities to make decisionsrelated to their work processes workloads training needs andwork schedulesFor the initiatives we reviewed the agencies undertook changesthat represented a significant shift from their traditionaloperations and as such encountered organizational and culturalbarriers that needed to be overcome as they sought to empower andinvolve employees These barriers included a lack of trustresistance to change and lack of buyinPage  GAO Human Capitalfrom frontline employees and managers and a variety ofimplementation issues such as workload demands The agenciesdeveloped strategies to address these barriers such as maintainingopen communication and reassigning and hiring personnel Managersand employees adapted to the changes at their agencies over timeparticularly once they perceived benefits such as improvedcommunication from the new practicesIn implementing the practices to empower and involve employeesagencies identified a range of examples to demonstrate theperformance improvements these efforts have accomplishedPerformance improvements cited included increased efficiency andimproved customer satisfaction For example operating as a teamhas allowed FAAs Logistics Center to substantially reduce the timeneeded to make emergency radar repairsFAA IRS OPM and VBA generally agreed with the contents ofthis report FEMA did not comment on the reportBackgroundNo management issue facing federal agencies could be morecritical to their ability to serve the American people than theirapproach to strategic human capital management includingattracting retaining and motivating their employeesHighperforming organizations in the private and public sectorshave long understood the relationship between effective peoplemanagement and organizational success However the federalgovernment which has often acted as if federal employees werecosts to be cut rather than assets to be valued has only recentlyreceived its wakeup call As our January  Performance andAccountability Series reports made clear serious federal humancapital shortfalls are now eroding the ability of many federalagenciesand threatening the ability of othersto economicallyefficiently and effectively perform their missions The problemlies not with federal employees themselves but with the lack ofeffective leadership and management along with the lack of astrategic approach to marshaling managing and maintaining thehuman capital needed for government to discharge itsresponsibilities and deliver on its promisesAll five of the agencies we reviewed have experienced challengesin managing their human capital Each has implemented managementchanges in response to the challenges they face includingimplementing strategies to empower and involve employeesFAA faces challenges including the need to enhancecommunication and teamwork and to provide employees with thetraining and skills they need to operate effectively For examplewe have reported on FAAs implementation of management reformsincluding delegating authorities to teams to improve itsrulemaking processes In our July  report on

model for retirement claimsprocessingTo meet our objectives we asked officials at five agencies toidentify initiatives they had that empowered or involved employeesFrom the inventories of the initiatives they developed in responseto our request we asked agency officials to identify those agencycomponents and initiatives that in their view had successfullyinvolved and empowered employees We sought to identify practicesthat were commonly implemented by the agencies within the past years In some cases agencies focused our attention on practicesthat began earlierWe interviewed agency executives managers supervisorsfrontline employees and union representatives to discuss howagencies had implemented these practices to empower and involveemployees and we analyzed related documents and information theyprovided We did not attempt to verify the performance data thatagencies providedWe included FAA in our review because it has certain exemptionsfrom the Federal Acquisition Regulations designed to facilitatedelegating procurement authorities to lower levels We included IRSand OPM in our review given IRS exemption from certain title personnel provisions and OPMs human

notdesigned to provide examples that could be consideredrepresentative of all the employee empowerment and involvementinitiatives at the agencies reviewed or the federal government ingeneralWe conducted our work from October  through August  inaccordance with generally accepted government auditingstandardsThe five agencies we reviewed implemented key empowerment andinvolvement practices as part of making organizational changesintended to realign organizations and processes to improveperformance The practices were  demonstrating top leadershipcommitment  engaging employee unions in making changes training employees to enhance their knowledge skills andabilities  using employee teams to help accomplish agencymissions  involving employees in planning and sharingperformance information and  delegating authorities tofrontline employeesDemonstrating Top LeadershipCommitmentTop leadership commitment is crucial in developing a visioninitiating organizational change maintaining open communicationsand creating an environment that is receptive to innovation Inearlier reports and testimonies we observed that top leadershipmust play a critical role in creating and sustaininghighperforming organizations Without the clear and demonstratedcommitment of agency top leadership organizational cultures willnot be transformed and new visions and ways of doing business willnot take rootConsistent attention to employee empowerment and involvementissues helps to ensure that changes are sustained Agency leadersneed to commit their organizations to valuing and investing intheir employees by empowering involving and providing them thetools to do their best and by implementing the modern performancemanagement and incentives systems needed to focus employeesefforts on achieving agency missions and goals Top leadershipcommitment entails time energy and persistence in providingincentives and establishing accountability Agency leaders mustcommit their organizations to valuing and investing in theiremployees and focusing their employees efforts on achieving statedagency missions and goals While top leadership commitment can bedemonstrated in many ways the following are examples employees andmanagers identified for the selected initiatives we reviewed atthese agencies Think strategically about areas where innovation would makegood business sense Leaders conceptualized new approaches toimprove performance and engaged employees and managers in shapingthe implementation of that vision For example the Director atFAAs Logistics Center saw the need for operating more like aprivate sector business and envisioned the organizational andoperational changes that would be required to do that TheLogistics Centers Director helped to ensure that all employeesshared his vision by discussing proposed changes with his toplevelmanagers and by meeting with frontline Managing for Results Federal Managers Views Show Need forEnsuring Top Leadership

their organizations to improveperformance and increase the coordination of missionrelatedactivities For example a Branch Chief in OPMs Retirement andInsurance Service enabled a new team to improve claims processingby among other things providing crosstraining for the team tohandle both CSRS and FERS claimsCreate an environment of trust and honest communicationLeaders made themselves available to employees and unions promotedopen and constructive dialog and were receptive to ideas andsuggestions from employees at all levels Following an approach tochange management that is transparent and highly participatory is akey element in involving and empowering employees For exampleseveral of the agencies held townhall meetings with employees todiscuss workplace issues and provide a forum for input andfeedback IRS employees said that they felt that management usedthe information they provided about proposed changesTarget investments and provide incentives to facilitatechangeLeaders provided funding and created financial and otherincentives to support new ways of working and to encourageemployees to attain the agencies goals and objectives Forexample the FAA Logistics Center Director committed to providingevery Logistics Center employee with a  cash award if theCenter met all of its performance targets for fiscal year  Atthe time of our review the Logistics Center was on track to meetor exceed its goals Participate in efforts to benchmark successfulorganizationsSome leaders visited organizations that were models forenhancing organizational flexibility and maintaining qualitystandards By visiting and benchmarking model performancepractices leaders demonstrated to employees their personalcommitment to making the changes needed for their offices or unitsto become highperforming organizations For example theDirector of one VBA regional office visited several private sectororganizations to observe how they processed claims and ensuredaccuracy The insights gained were factored into the changes madein regional office claims operations Benchmarking is a critical part of an effective improvementprogram because it helps an organization identify outstandinglevels of performance that have actually been achievedBenchmarking therefore helps define specific reference points forsetting goals for improving performance See Managing for ResultsCritical Actions for Measuring Performance GAOTGGDAIMD June  Page  GAO Human Capital Use a degree performance feedback system One leader usedinput from team members to improve the teams performance An OPMBranch Chief who supervises the crosstrained claims processingteam implemented a degree feedback system for assessing bothher and her team members performance Under that system teammembers provide her with input on her performance as a team coachas well as input on the performance of other team members She thenuses that information for selfassessment and in providingperformance feedback to individual team membersEngaging Employee Unions Involving employeeunions as well as involving employees directly is crucial toachieving success Major changes can involve redesigning workprocesses changing work rules developing new job descriptionsestablishing new work hours or making other changes to the workenvironment that are of particular concern to employees unionsObtaining union cooperation and support through effectivelabormanagement relations can help achieve consensus on the plannedchanges avoid misunderstandings and more expeditiously resolveproblems that occur The following are examples of how agenciesengaged employee unionsDevelop and maintain an ongoing working relationship withunions Agencies worked cooperatively with employee unions andfound that an ongoing relationship enhanced communication Forexample OPM maintained a continuous dialog through weekly meetingsof management and union representatives to share information andaddress workplace issues Officials at OPMs Retirement OperationsCenter at Boyers PA and the American Federation of GovernmentEmployees AFGE said that their excellent working relationshiphelped facilitate the adjustments made to incorporate newtechnology at the Center They said when new technology reduced theCenters need for file clerks union and management officialsworked together to ensure that affected employees received advancenotice about upcoming changes training in new skills andinformation about available job opportunitiesDocument formal agreements Agencies had formalagreements to serve as a foundation setting forth the manner inwhich labor and management would work together For example theagreement between IRS and the National Treasury Employees UnionNTEU was designed to ensure that employees are adequatelyrepresented and informed of proposed new policies and have inputinto the proposalsTraining Employees to Enhance TheirKnowledge Skills and AbilitiesThe agreement also provides for continuous improvement in IRSoperations in part by providing employees the authority resourcesand other inputs they need to effect changes and to be accountablefor performing effectively and provides for NTEU participation invarious forums such as business process improvement teams andcrossunit committeesBuild trust over time Some agencies have undertaken alongterm effort to create an environment of trust and openness inworking cooperatively with unions For example both IRS and NTEUofficials credited the excellent working relationship theydeveloped over the last decade for helping to reorganize IRSOfficials at IRS stated that the reorganization has resulted inoperating divisions that are focused on serving taxpayers andflatter decisionmaking structures with clear endtoendaccountability The NTEU President said that the union was willingto expedite some negotiations on missioncritical issues because atrusting relationship had developed and IRS employees felt thatmanagement used the information they provided in shaping the newIRSParticipate jointly in making decisions Agenciesinvolved unions and incorporated their input into proposals beforefinalizing decisions For example several unions providedsuggestions about how agencies should share performance informationwith employees In another instance OPMs Operations Center andAFGE worked jointly on predecisional matters such as the hiring ofa new director of the Operations CenterBoth employees and managers viewed training as a criticalfactor in learning how to work in new and different ways Toimprove customer service employees may need new skills such asthe ability to analyze and improve work processes or the ability towork effectively together on teams In addition to jobspecificskills and work processes training in teamwork and communicationsand encouragement and coaching through mentoring and networking canhelp employees adapt to new ways of working that involve changes intheir roles and job expectations VBA officials for instance toldus that along with providing various training modules employeesalso need onthejob training coaching and mentoring to enhancetheir expertise through actual experience in processing claims Thefollowing are examples of how agencies trained employees in newprocessesProvide a mix of onthejob and formal training Agenciesused a variety of training techniques to help employees adjust toorganizational and operational changes For example OPM providedonthejob cross training so that a claims processing team couldadjudicate both CSRS and FERS claims According to the BranchChief because the team received crosstraining it was able tohelp another division reduce its backlog of FERS cases OPM alsoprovided formal training to teams in how to make decisions insetting goals planning and assigning work and scheduling overtimeand trainingProvide training on building team relationships and newways of working When making significant changes to theiroperations agencies provided training to help facilitate changeFor example when IRS undertook a major reorganization its OgdenUT Service Center trained its employees in the new ways ofconducting business The training workshops included  learninghow effective teams functionimproving working relationships among peers managers andemployees and managers and union stewards  enhancing effectivecommunications among employees union stewards andmanagersincreasing discussions about ways to improve workprocesses and meet customers needs and  creating a morepositive workplace environment The employees we interviewed saidthat training on effective working relationships was especiallybeneficial because they got to know their coworkers and gained anappreciation for each others viewsCommit sufficient funding and time to training Agenciesconsidered training needs in budget decisions and their workforceplanning For example as FAAs Logistics Center was beingreorganized to operate in a more businesslike manner it trainedemployees about the need for as well as on how to develop qualitywork processes This enabled employees to document information thatwas required for the Logistics Center to receive InternationalOrganization for Standardization ISO  certification forquality work processes To receive this certification anorganization must show that it has standardized highqualityprocesses that result in products and services that are provided ina timely mannerISO is a worldwide federation of national standards bodiesrepresenting  countries ISO  certification recognizesstandardized quality processes established by organizations toproduce consistently highquality products or servicesPage  GAO Human CapitalUsing Employee Teams To Help AccomplishAgency MissionsAdopting a teamsbased approach to operations can improveemployee morale and job satisfaction by creating an environmentcharacterized by open communication enhanced flexibility inmeeting job demands and a sense of shared responsibility foraccomplishing agency goals and objectives Using teams can alsoassist in integrating different perspectives flatteningorganizational structure and streamlining operations In a priorGAO report on best practices we said that commercial firms beganusing integrated product teams in the s as a way to get betterresults faster An integrated product team is a concentration ofproduct expertise within a team of employees who together havethe authority to design develop test manufacture and deliver aproduct In examining FAAs efforts to modernize its air trafficcontrol systems we stated that although FAA has identified anintegrated team approach as key to the agencys efforts to deploysystems that meet performance goals major offices still tended tofunction in stovepipes that inhibit an integrated teamapproachThe following are examples of how teams were used in the agencyinitiatives we reviewed Create teams of employees who represent multipleorganizational functions and different grade levels Agenciesflattened their organizational structures by including employeesfrom various organizational functions and grade levels on teamsFor example VBA consolidated regional office operations by mergingtwo divisions and creating teams with members from both functionswho could process claims from beginning to end In some casesforming teams provided opportunities for frontline employees toassume leadership roles FEMAs teams at the US FireAdministration provided opportunities for frontline employees tolead teams whose members included a mix of employees andsupervisors Agencies also took steps to streamline their processesby using a team approach For example VBA streamlined its claimsprocess by allowing one employee to handle all aspects of a claiminstead of requiring employees to write referrals and wait forresponses from other divisions VBAs team approach also Best Practices DOD Teaming Practices Not Achieving PotentialResults GAOApr   Air Traffic Control Role of FAAs Modernization Program inReducing Delays and Congestion  GAOT May  Page  GAO Human Capitalenhanced accountability to veterans because team members wereresponsible for handling specific claimsEstablish an integrated working environment with commongoals When agencies established teams this provided anenvironment in which individual team members were encouraged towork together toward achieving team goals For example FEMAs USFire Administration teams had members from units throughout theorganization The teams met on a weekly basis and identified waysto implement over  Board of Visitors recommendations forimproving the Fire Administrations operations These teamsfacilitated communications and employee involvement by maintaininga focal point for the organization working toward consensus andposting performance data showing progress toward addressing theserecommendationsAssign team responsibilities and provide an environmentfor learning Agencies assigned a broad range of responsibilitiesto teams and allowed members to help each other and learn newskills For example VBAs claimsprocessing teams were responsiblefor controlling claims from when first received until finallyadjudicated That required the team to conduct a full range ofclaims functions including receiving and controlling the claimscontacting veterans and hospitals to obtain information and makingbenefit decisions Team members were able to assist other teammembers when needed which helped develop team members skills infunctions they did not previously perform To enable the team toefficiently meet their objectives the teams were also responsiblefor setting their work schedules and managing theirworkloadHold teams accountable for results The agencies heldteams accountable for accomplishing their work and workingtogether in a team environment encouraged team members to shareaccountability When teams made decisions about how to do theirwork employees told us they felt greater accountability for theteams overall performance For example members of the FAALogistics Centers integrated product teams were accountable forall aspects of the Centers products including maintenancerepair storage and shipping The teams performance was measuredon a regular basis providing direct feedback to theteamsInvolving Employees in Planning andSharing Performance Information Physically collocate team members when appropriate Agenciescollocated team members when the employees had been working in thesame building or facility Although technology is being used tohelp bring teams that are geographically dispersed together in avirtual environment to the extent that team members are alreadylocated nearby moving team members to a shared location improvedcommunication and enhanced efficiency For example collocatingOPMs retirement team members facilitated the sharing ofinformation among members and led to improved work processes andcustomer satisfactionInvolving employees in planning and sharing performanceinformation can help employees understand what the organization istrying to accomplish and how it is progressing in that directionInvolving employees in the planning process helps to develop agencygoals and objectives that incorporate insights about operationsfrom a frontline perspective as well as increases employeesunderstanding and acceptance of organizational goals andobjectives Involving frontline employees in the goalsettingprocess also helps create a clear line of sight throughout theorganization so that everyone understands what the organization istrying to achieve and the goals it seeks to reach Employees we metwith appeared committed to working toward the goals of theiragencies and to providing high quality service Advances in the use of information technology and theInternet are continuing to change the way federal agenciescommunicate use and disseminate information deliver servicesand conduct business See Electronic Government Challenges Must BeAddressed With Effective Leadership and Management  GAOT July  Page  GAO Human CapitalSharing performance information can provide employees with amore meaningful perspective about how their daytoday activitiescontribute toward the organizations goals and objectives Sharingperformance information also allows supervisors to provide clearerand more specific feedback to teams and frontline employees ontheir expectations progress and performance Agencies use ofperformance information can be improved In May  we reportedthat based on a survey of federal managers at  agencies at nomore than  of the  agencies surveyed did  percent or more ofthe managers respond that they used performance information to agreat or very great extent However at the agencies we visitedmanagers used performance information and shared this informationwith frontline employees through various mechanisms Some of theseagencies such as VBA and IRS used a balanced scorecard approachwhich is intended to provide a balanced perspective regardingagency results customer satisfaction and employee feedback Atone of VBAs regional offices for example computerizedinformation is continuously displayed on video screens providingemployees with current performance informationThe employees we met with were aware of their agencies andtheir units performance goals and objectives and they said thatsharing performance information had enhanced communications acrossall levels of the organization Employees told us that sharingperformance information provided everyone with a focus to worktoward and a status report on their progress They also said thatsharing performance information generated more performancerelateddiscussions including at townhall meetings other meetings withmanagers and during team meetingsThe following are examples of how agencies involved employees inplanning and sharing performance information Create mechanisms to involve employees in the planningprocessAgencies used various mechanisms to develop strategic plansgather feedback from internal stakeholders for identifying gaps inexisting strategic plans and obtain employee input and feedbackFor example one IRS division used an employee team to help todevelop its strategic plan The team ensured that all divisionemployees had opportunities to Managing for Results Federal Managers Views on KeyManagement Issues Vary Widely Across Agencies GAO May  Page  GAO Human CapitalDelegating Authorities to FrontlineEmployeesprovide input and the agency used that input as part of itsefforts to develop a balanced set of goals and objectives for thedivision Post performance information throughout the workplaceAgencies shared performance information with employees byposting it through a variety of means including charts graphsnewsletters and agency intranet postings For example FAAsLogistics Center posted performance charts and graphs in the entryfoyers of its buildings and at the entrances to its organizationalunits Such postings permitted employees to easily see how theirunits performance was contributing to agency goals and objectivesThe Logistics Center also had a monthly newsletter for sharingorganizational performance information and providing an arena foremployees to share informationShare performance information in meetings Agenciesfrequently held townhall and other meetings to discuss programperformance and organizational issues Agencies used townhallmeetings to help employees better understand how their work effortscontributed to overall organizational success The townhallmeetings also provided a forum in which employees and managerscould discuss organizational changes and suggest operationalimprovements For example IRS Ogden UT Service Center employeeswe interviewed said that for the first time regular and effectivecommunications between Center managers and employees was occurringThey said that in addition to listening managers were takingaction on employees suggestions which made the employees see thattheir input was valued Frequent team meetings provided employeesan opportunity to obtain feedback about agency performance Forexample VBA teams shared performance information at weeklymeetings information that helped the teams assess their progressin meeting performance goalsSurvey employees on their views regarding organizationaldirection Agencies used surveys to obtain employees views suchas input regarding the direction of organizational changes IRSWage and Investment Operating Division surveyed employees on thestrengths opportunities and priorities for each of the divisionsbranches shared survey results with employees and implementedchanges as a resultDelegating authorities to frontline employees involves thetransfer of authorities from managers to those employees who arecloser to citizens and provide services and information as part oftheir daytoday activities Providing delegated authorities canenable employees to control their own work processes and schedulesDelegating authorities also gives employees the opportunity to lookat customer needs in an integrated wayPage  GAO Human Capitaland effectively respond to those needs Delegating authoritiescan benefit agency operations by streamlining processesFurthermore delegating authorities to frontline employees givesmanagers greater opportunities to concentrate on problems orpolicylevel issues If employees believe they have the authorityto tackle goals and objectives beyond their formal job descriptionsand assigned units then when customers have legitimate complaintsempowered frontline employees can make it right immediatelyrather than having to wait for management to get involvedThe following are examples of how agencies delegated authoritiesto frontline employeesEmpower onsite staff with authority to make decisionsAgencies delegated authorities and empowered frontline employeesto exercise responsibilities to more fully address customer needsFor example FEMA public assistance coordinators are onsite at thedisaster or emergency to observe the conditions and to coordinatepublic assistance They were delegated the authority to determineapplicants eligibility to approve up to  in publicfinancial assistance and to help to ensure that applicants arekept fully informed throughout the public assistanceprocessEliminate layers of review Agencies reduced the numberof approvals needed for various activities and delegated greaterauthority to frontline employees to make decisions For exampleFAAs Aeronautical Center delegated authorities to its audiovisualteams to make decisions while on location such as the need tovisit locations in addition to those originally planned andapproved This allowed the audiovisual teams to more efficientlymeet customer needs At FEMA delegating authority to the PublicAssistance Coordinators eliminated two additional state reviews ofapplications for assistance and two other reviews byFEMAProvide more time for managers to focus on problem areasor policy matters Agencies targeted managers skills on moredifficult problems or policy areas by delegating some authoritiesto frontline employees For example VBA managers said they wereable to use their time more efficiently after delegating daytodayclaimsprocessing authorities to the teams They said that bydelegating these authorities they could concentrate on policymatters and more difficult problems that the teams were unable tohandleEstablish a new position with appropriate authority Someagencies identified situations in which new positions of authoritycould help benefit operations For example VBA as part of itsefforts toAgencies Addressed Barriers To EffortsThat Empowered And Involved Employeesreengineer its claims processing established a new decisionreview officer position and provided employees in those positionsthe authority to review and change claims decisions that veteransappealed Prior to this veterans appeals were addressed under aformal hearing process Because decision review officers have moreflexibility to address appeals informally creating this newposition provided the opportunity to streamline the process andsave timeThe agencies we reviewed undertook changes that represented asignificant shift from their traditional operations and as suchencountered organizational and cultural barriers that needed to beovercome as they sought to empower and involve employees Some ofthe barriers included a lack of trust resistance to change and alack of buyin and implementation issues Despite encounteringthese barriers the employees and managers we met at each of thefive agencies perceived benefits from the employee empowerment andinvolvement practices that their agencies had implemented Toaddress the barriers the agencies used such strategies as opencommunication a commitment to change and providing performancefeedbackAll of these efforts entailed cultural transformations andtherefore there was some natural resistance that took time andeffort to overcome Nevertheless the experiences of these agenciesdemonstrate that organizations can make progress in addressingbarriers to empower and involve their employees The following aresome examples of the barriers encountered and the strategies usedto address themLack of Trust The agencies identified alack of trust as a barrier they experienced in their efforts toempower and involve employees A lack of trust can frustrate agencyattempts to implement major changes in employees daytodayworking environment Throughout our review managers unions andemployees continuously emphasized the importance of trust ingaining acceptance for changes For example some employees fearedfor their job security as FAAs Logistics Center began to implementmore business like operations However they told us that theylearned to trust the Logistics Centers Director as they recognizedthe need for the changesSome employees were skeptical that managers would listen totheir input for planning purposes They were also concerned thatperformance dataResistance to Change and Lack ofBuyinwould be used to justify punitive actions rather than toincrease employees understanding about the direction of theagencys performance In addition working in a more openenvironment requires employees to trust and help each other whichsome employees said initially was a barrier to working as a teamMaintaining an open door policy that encouraged employees to sharetheir views and demonstrating a vision and commitment to changewere two approaches that agencies used to develop trustAnother barrier that agencies experienced was resistance tochange and a lack of buyin Employees and managers resisted makingchanges because they had to work in new and unfamiliar ways Someemployees found it difficult to transition from working underdirect supervision to working on a team with little directsupervision For example according to FEMA officials some teammembers continued to seek leadership and guidance from managementdid not trust other team members and were reluctant to speak outin the team environment until they eventually adjusted to workingin a team environmentAccording to officials from the five agencies some managersfound it difficult to operate in a new environment of more opencommunication and feedback Some FEMA managers and supervisors werereluctant to allow employees to have delegated authorities in areassuch as budgeting procurement and time and attendance reportapproval At FAAs Aeronautical Center some employees withcontracting responsibilities were initially uncomfortableexercising newly delegated procurement authority to purchase goodsor services up to a certain dollar amount without supervisoryapproval The employees said that they gained confidence as theybecame more experienced in exercising the new authority and someof the employees and managers who initially resisted changesadjusted to them gradually over time In some cases the offices wevisited made managerial and supervisory changes when individualswere unable to adjust to a more open work environmentA lack of buyin resulted in some employees and managers beingreluctant to fully participate in training They tended to view thechanges being made as another flavorofthemonth initiativeThus they were not as open to receiving new information oradopting new ways of working IRS provided an example of a solutionto this barrier To encourage managers to buy into team concepttraining IRS has decided to train section chiefs who will thentrain employees in their work unitsImplementation IssuesImplementation issues such as workload demands and performanceincentive issues also presented barriers to change Althoughemployees generally appreciated the changes made to work in a teamenvironment high workload demands affected some team membersability to exercise their delegated authority VBA for examplehas a large and growing backlog of compensation and pensionclaims  Although team members had the authority to set theirschedules and determine their daytoday work priorities heavyworkload demands prevented them from being able to plan and managetheir work Some of VBAs decision review officers also told usthat their ability to exercise their delegated authorities had beenlimited by the claimsprocessing backlogsAnother implementation issue that affected teams involved theincentives that agencies provided to teams to encourageperformance For example some employees said that working on teamswas demotivating when poor performers obtained an equal share ofteam rewards Some employees and managers said that not enoughmoney was available for rewarding employees and teams that mettheir goals and objectives Such issues were commonly addressed inteam meetings and in individual performance feedbackThe timing of training was another implementation issue thatagencies cited as a barrier For example some team members told usthat it would have been helpful if they had received trainingbefore being reorganized into teams rather than after Becausetraining was not provided prior to moving to a team environmentthe teams were immediately faced with the need for team members totake time off of the front lines for training and skill buildingProviding training at the appropriate time for an employee canachieve better results The accurate and timely processing of compensation andpension claims is one of the

Substitute for Return Authority has expeditedtaxpayer compliance In some cases IRS employees are authorized toprepare substitute tax returns for taxpayers that did not file orfiled a false return Instead of referring requests to a differentoffice as was done in the past IRS has delegated this authority torevenue officers This allows onestop case resolution because therevenue officers now maintain complete control of the case throughcollection of any balance due By streamlining IRS processesadditional taxes are being assessed within  to  months muchfaster than the  months it usually took before This alsobenefits taxpayers because the amount of penalties and interestadded to taxpayer accounts is reduced when assessments are moretimely IRS reported that during a fiscal year  pilot

streamline their organizations they needto recognize how human capital contributes to achieving missionsand goals Effective changes can only be made and sustained throughthe cooperation of leaders union representatives and employeesthroughout the organization All members of an organization mustunderstand the rationale for making organizational and culturalchanges because everyone has a stake in helping to shape andimplement initiatives as part of agencies efforts to meet currentand future challenges Agencies can improve their performance bythe way they treat and manage their peopleIn this report we have identified six key practices used inselected initiatives to help to empower and involve employees inidentifying and implementing needed changes These practicesareAgency Commentsproviding sustained leadership commitment to opencommunications and support culture changeengaging unions to include all perspectives in achievingconsensus about needed changesusing a variety of formal and onthejob trainingapproaches to facilitate the development of new skillsencouraging employees to combine their resources andtalents by working together in teamsinvolving employees in planning and sharing performanceinformation so that employees help shape agencies goals and betterunderstand how their daytoday activities contribute to resultsandempowering staff by giving them the authority they needto make decisions and effectively conduct agencyoperationsEach federal agency will need to consider the applicability ofthese practices within the context of its own mission needs andculture Nevertheless we believe that agencies can improve theirperformance enhance employees morale and job satisfaction andprovide a working environment where employees have a betterunderstanding of the goals and objectives of their organizationsand how they are contributing to the results that American citizenswant We believe that the practices we identified should beconsidered by other agencies as they seek to improve their uniqueoperations and respond to the challenges they are facingWe provided drafts of this report in August  to theSecretary of Veterans Affairs the Secretary of
