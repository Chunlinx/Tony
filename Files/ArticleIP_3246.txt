                                 Bogus Nights            The critic Terrence Raffertyhas a sensible column in the current GQ on the vapidity of independentfilm In  Rafferty writes independent movie after independent moviearrived in theaters on waves of critical admiration and moviegoersunaccustomed to the peculiar moral universe of indieness must have emergedfrom these experiences deeply perplexed wondering perhaps how the reviewerswho carped about studio films like Steven Spielbergs majestic flawedAmistad could embrace wholeheartedly stuff as dubious asDeconstructing Harry  The Sweet Hereafter  Boogie Nights and In the Company of Men  Rafferty correctly identifies indie filmsair of smugness Because its supposed anticommercial values are preapprovedby a youngish leftofcenter audience indie filmmakers are encouraged to beless rigorous with themselvesto accept limitations that theyd be better offtrying to correct or transcend            This is afamiliar debate but Rafferty turns the usual cant around Its thehypercapitalist studio mentality that is usually deemed corrupt Independentfilms no matter how incompetent are thought to be wellmeaning Raffertypasses over obvious chances to criticize the indies in technical termsnoreview of Boogie Nights prepared me for what a patchy tedious film itwasand instead finds something morally defective in them He has inmind Woody Allen Anthony Minghella  The English Patient  Neil LaBute In the Company of Men  and Quentin Tarantino This rather disparategroup is tied together by a desire to resist the strictures of studiofilmmaking and to advertise that resistance to a discerning audience Soinstead of uplifting stories we get studiously downbeat ones instead of goodvs evil we get calculated ambiguity instead of violence as plot device we getviolence as happenstance and instead of a corporate worldview we getselfexpression and selfregard            Rafferty uses the word moral quite pointedly He thinksthat these movies are destructive that they enjoy degradation I think hesmostly right Tarantino notably manipulates our capacity to be aroused bydeath No less offensive however is the automatic presumption of quality inwork that defines itself merely by its choice of subject matter and mannerismBecause a Martin Scorsese epigone named Paul Thomas Anderson announced a filmon the subject of LA pornbecause he promised to show some dickhe wascelebrated as a poetic chronicler of subcultures Meanwhilebetterthanaverage studio filmsId name Titanic and The DevilsAdvocate are picked apart by highbrow critics even by those who admittedenjoying them Tony Gilroy and Jonathan Lemkins script for The DevilsAdvocate was witty and literate Andersons for Boogie Nights wasnot            Mostfreethinking filmgoers will admit the existence of morally repugnant indieposeurs But what does that species have in common with the almost universallyadmired Coen brothers This writingdirectingproducing teamJoel Coendirects Ethan Coen produces both writehas cannily outlasted the cyclicalfaddishness of indiedom Their movies Blood Simple  RaisingArizona  Millers Crossing  Barton Fink  The HudsuckerProxy  Fargo and now The Big Lebowski have been eccentricin the best sense avoiding both mainstream studio practices and the indiementality that mindlessly reacts against them And yet something is notworking Every Coen opus after Blood Simple has in one way or anotherfallen flat            I dont subscribe to the standard critique ofthe Coensthat they are too cool and too clever by half that they care morefor wordplay than for fleshandblood characters In fact they have atremendous gift for character They can write a role and find an actor for itin a way that creates a small myth on the screen Im thinking in particular ofFrances McDormands unflappable pregnant cop in Fargo  John TurturrosBarton Fink the mediocre leftist playwright who tries to go Hollywood and inthe new film Jeff Bridges incarnation of Jeff Lebowski a k a the Dude anamiable stoner who is drawn into a Big Sleep inspired kidnap schemeWhat these characters have in common is an instantly plausible blend ofidiosyncrasy and stereotype The Dude is burdened with all the clichs of hiskind but he also shows pleasing eccentricities such as an eye for interiordecor That rug really tied the room together he says after one of the badguys urinates on it His bowling buddies and coconspiratorsJohn Goodmanscharacter a guntoting Vietnam vet with an intellectual streak and SteveBuscemis a nice guy whos always one step behindare also neatly drawn Aslong as they are simply chatting together at the bowling alley the film ischarming and alive            Thetrouble starts with the plot The great flaw in most of the Coens work issurprisingly an inability to sustain a plot over a twohour span I saysurprising because their first movie Blood Simple  came so close toperfection Its plot really was simpleman hires hit man to kill philanderingwifeand appeared complicated only to the characters in the film The plot ofLebowski  on the other hand is a mystery to all It has to do with thekidnapping of the young wife of a millionaire also named Lebowski and debtsowed to a porn impresario I wont describe it in more detail because itcrumbles to nothing long before the end Careless plotting first cropped up inthe Coens murky gangster picture Millers Crossing  and it hurtFargo  the best of their recent films If a character buries a suitcasefull of money we should find out what happens to it In Lebowski  welose track not only of plot devices but of whole characters who come and gowithout finding a reason to be Turturro is wasted as a bowler named Jesus aconvicted pedophile in Spandex He is an amazing creation but he has nofunction            The crux of the Coens plot problem is climax Over andover they have imposed an artificial resolution on a sequence of brilliantcharacter studies In Barton Fink  for example Finks adventures ins Hollywood lead him through a splendid gallery of vintage Los Angelescreaturesa madcap studio head a ginsoaked Faulkneresque novelist aseemingly ordinary insurance salesman Goodman again who makes strange noisesin the hotel room next door Then what The Coens put a dead woman in Finksbed and set fire to the hotel In Fargo  the kidnappingturnedmurderscheme never finds a satisfying second act and the Coens create an illusion ofclimax only by having one thug kill another in a giant geyser of blood InThe Big Lebowski  the climax is so farcically arbitraryone characterdrops dead of a heart attackthat the Coens seem to be laughing at their owninability to wrap things up Anyone whos tried to write a screenplay knows thedifficulty of writing a climax The process is always artificial The art is inhiding the artifice The Coens shrug off that task with annoying arrogance            Do theseenormously talented filmmakers show a moral failing in the sense thatRafferty developed in his piece I think they do Their sin is pride The Coenshave reached a stage where they no longer question their ideas or flesh themout You can catch them in the act as it were by comparing a shooting scriptwith the final product I have such a script for Barton                Fink The shooting script is the script as it stands before filming begins thescript that you can buy in book form is a continuity script which has beenedited to match the film The degree to which the shooting script matches thefilm is astonishing Page after page has been shot word for word Thisneedless to say is unusual even directors who write their own scripts veryoften make major changes during production The Coens had shot everythingverbatim right down to unfinished sentences I dont know  I mean andhesitations uh er If the script were airtight such faithfulness toself would be admirable But when the script is flawed             The moral is that the Coens might actually beable to make further artistic advances if they shackled themselves to the evilstudio system Someone needs to speak to them in timetested studioplatitudesto say that the script goes nowhere in the third act or that thereare too many marginal characters They might also profit from filming othersscripts But the hype that greeted Blood Simple appears to haveconvinced them that they are sufficient unto themselves Theyve reserved anindependence they havent earned
