                hi uh how do you feel about gun control   oh i dont like a total ban on it but on the other hand i dont like total idiots pulling what they did down in uh my home state of Texas down in uh near Fort Hood   yeah uhhuh   uh i think the right of ownership needs to be protected but i dont think theres too much wrong with having it registered and having you think about it a little bit   i dont think so either and i think that every gun should be covered cover covered   um   because i think that uh and it doesnt hurt people to have a waiting period   well they make us wait to get married in most states i dont   yes  right     unless you want to fly to Las Vegas or so   uhhuh but i   yeah uh its just sickening i was on the University of Texas campus when that Chapman climbed the tower and killed twenty two people one of my friends was wounded and he was from   kill a   La Paz Bolivia and they flew and got his mother here real quick but and a hippie pulled him out of the out of the additional gunshot range so ever since then old Oscar said hippies are okay my buddy   uh     it was back in the sixties when Vietnam was going on so   yes i remember when that happened   so ive lived in New York City where they have a uh pistol control and uh big deal you go across the county line into Yonkers and you can buy a pistol and come back into the city   so there isnt really a gun control there   not really   no   uh   well i i think that every gun should be covered from rifles and the automatics and and handguns because people need if theyre out after a gun they need a cooling off period   yeah   we have guns in our home but my husband uh used to hunt all my sons hunt   um ive got a shotgun and a pistol   oh we have   and the kids have BBs     sometimes i think theyre about as dangerous but uh   well id shoot it more often it wasnt against the city ordinance those birds steal my dogs bird dog food my i dont think thats fair     yeah well we live close to the Wasatch well we live right on the Wasatch front so were only about well we have  mountains in our backyard and the deer come down and eat our   um   uh shrubs during the winter   do they really   uhhuh we we had a snow storm the other day and the deer come down and eat the shrubs they keep them trimmed for us   we got the airconditioning going in the building today   oh my heck   it must be seventy five degrees out there   i think its about twenty well its about twenty eight here   i dont think that has anything to do with gun control   no     uh   but i im i   i i dont think its a constitutional well so what if its constitutional or not if if if my wife drives to west Texas alone shes going to carry a gun i dont care what they say   well dont you think too if the government i mean like in Yugoslavia and these places that the government comes in and takes over China dont you think if the people had a gun they would have more say in in in establishing a democracy   uhhuh wasnt that amazing Yugoslavia was a semi Soviet state and no guns were allowed and all of a sudden everybody has one that wants to fight the war where did they come from   yeah uhhuh   they were hidden under the bed all these years   then they must have been   i dont know i dont know   they must have been hidden somewhere because they came out   well you know one thing about the Killeen situation that was pointed up is there were a lot of military people in the  in and around   uhhuh   uh if the military had been allowed to carry even side arms they could have stopped this idiot quicker   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   uh i had a cop once say in Texas its not against the law lets see what i say i said it would be all right legally if i put on a a side gun and walked down the street with a gun strapped on my side its clear view and you couldnt arrest me he said yes i can arrest you i said what for he said breaking the peace i said whos peace am a bothering he said mine im the cop that was that was a joke it was a joke   is that right oh       oh   but i think if you take them away from everybody then only criminals will have it and you would have more problems but but registration wont hurt anybody will it   no thats what i think that it should be is registration and guns that can be traced   yeah you can go to pawnshop i dont i dont know if you all live near big city Salt Lake City if theyve got them or not but you go to a pawnshop and buy it for cash and you dont have to show nothing   but then no i think they have um and you just hand over the cash and thats it   yeah you if you can show them a drivers license but you can steal those so easily its pitiful   uhhuh well im about an eight on that i think that uh that we need gun control but you know so many laws would be uh necessary if wed just use common sense   umhum   you know just registering the guns and wow i dont know i guess people lose their common sense when they when they get mad or when they   get too drunk   uhhuh uhhuh   ill be theres a law in Texas says you cant have them in bar i think it would be a lot more sense if they say please check them at the front door because i know people are in there with them on   oh really   oh yeah i it just nerve racking to know that if youre in a   that that youre in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you   yeah         theyre not supposed to but then again so
