        a uh Golden Retriever   ooh thats one of my favorite kinds of dogs how long have you had it   yeah is it really weve had him for lets see he just had his fourth birthday   fourth birthday   yeah and we got him when he was about eight weeks old and uh hes pretty okay we like him   does he shed a lot   he does thats the one thing we dont like about him in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off       hed probably look pretty funny if we did that   how much does he weigh now   he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything and they put him on the scale and hes up to ninety four now   oh   but hes not a real hes not a real tall uh dog for a Golden Retriever hes kind of stocky shorter and stockier   hm is he good with family   he is its uh just me and my wife and uh hes kind of our temporary substitute for having kids i guess we treat him like our kid right now so hes spoiled rotten     yeah i can understand that   because i you can get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids  how about you   umhum well we have a cat whos also about four years old and  hes our spoiled child right now too  and he also sheds a lot   uh uhhuh yeah   but we uh we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday but we figure well get the kids and then the the dog   thats probably a good idea theyre good though uh have you ever had a Retriever before   no but my husband had one when he was growing up   because i i find that theyre good around other animals like cats and other dogs they dont tend to get real jealous or territorial they like to play   hm   and especially with kids they love to play with kids in   is is your dog an inside and outdoor   no hes pretty much an inside dog   hm   he stays in we were kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than id want him to be out too much and he doesnt like it if we tie him outside hes hes really a wimp   oh really     and when it comes to being alone uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that but he does not like to be tied outside hell hell just bark and bark and bark   huh when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back or   no hes uh taken to the training pretty well and uh he knows where our yard is and we have a pretty small yard but he seems to know the boundaries   hm   and he usually is good about staying within them although our next door neighbors have a dog too and uh she she is good friends with my dog   oh yeah   and so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff but hes pretty good he stays out of the street and uh if i catch him i call him and he comes back       so he hes pretty good about taking to commands and things   hm did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own and   no we never did i i trained him on my own and uh this is the first dog ive had all my own as an adult   uhhuh   weve had kids or weve had dogs when i was a kid but this this is the first one that i uh took in so i wasnt sure if id be able to get it all right the first time but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well i never really had to hit him or anything just you know firm tone of voice   uhhuh huh amazing   and those sorts of things i i see other people out there and they hit their dogs and try to and and those horrible collars that they put on them with invincible invisible fencing least i think it   invisible what   invisible fencing have you heard of that   no what is that   its uh its a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it   oh   and if they get too close to that perimeter it it zaps them yeah yeah   huh boy id be afraid to walk around if i was that dog   yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to so he held on to the collar and he walked out to the perimeter he said it was a good jolt   oh really   yeah so i i dont take too well to to those sorts of training techniques i dont think theyre always necessary if you put enough patience into uh   hm yeah just be consistent and diligent with it and   umhum its uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat   hm yeah hes indoor and all declawed because i know the uh average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months and   somebody just told me that because of the leukemia   yeah yeah that and also just um getting hit i guess or getting beat up  and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years   wow quite a difference what uh what kind of climate do you have   so yeah well um  its we just moved recently  so now were in the um Dallas area and its very very nice and     oh
