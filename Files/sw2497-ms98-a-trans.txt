        i think my daughter talked to somebody in Carolina what is that is it a school up there that uh   yeah North Carolina State   oh great great thats wonderful yeah   yeah yeah i i didnt know that we were going to be talking to mostly TI folks i thought it was all scattered out among graduate schools or something yeah   is that right yeah we uh we thought the opposite we thought well its going to be TI people and i think they went to customers you know people that use TI computers and everything which is fine   yeah yeah one of one of our professors went down to a seminar you guys had uh sometime last year and got the information and brought it back and   uhhuh actually they dont talk about much uh of what its for but my wife keeps keeps ask asking me and im saying well your computer is eventually going to just answer your voice you know theyre theyre of course its very obvious for people with handicaps but in general i guess it would be faster   thats right sure yeah you you yeah you could just sit there and talk   than typing and everything so oh yeah its its uh around the corner   reminds me of something i read in an Isaac Asimov science fiction thing one time uhhuh   right well i mean its so uh TIs uh been the pioneer on a little advertising for TI not that i know that much about the uh voice synthesis but theyve been working on it for years and years you know they have the Speak and Spell and all of that of course but theyre     yeah yeah   theyre going to take it much further and i guess in aircraft and all that a lot of it is going to be like you talk to the computer like two thousand one or two thousand ten ten when you talk to the computer and yeah   yeah yeah like Hal yeah   Hal right that was great well what do you think about the metric system you well what do you do out there are you a professor you say     no im a im a student here um yeah i think we should adopt it i i think were a little bit backward as far as the rest of the worlds concerned   okay   um i know it causes a problem for industry in a little in a small way but nothing that wont be overcome in a little bit of time   yeah well were not going to have much to fight over because i do too uh being an engineer most General Motors have pretty much and im not too sure about the rest of the cars im sure all the Japanese cars   oh yeah   im somewhat of a car buff almost all of it is metric   uhhuh what what what bothers the heck out of me is uh one of these socalled American made cars where part of its put together in Japan and what youve got is youve got standard and metric   uhhuh   you know you go in there with a wrench and you know oh golly its not a metric its a standard   right right well i i work on GM cars only and i havent noticed that that much usually the metrics will fit theyre so close theres an overlap   uhhuh   uh you know theres something funny that i havent really resolved with metric ive got to really go to the store and see if its true i cant remember the size i think its uh eighteen or something like that i have a set of metric and and the old wrenches too and i think thats an exact size of the threequarters and they dont make it in metric they just skip over it and it   yeah youre right youre right because mine goes from seventeen to nineteen yeah   right and i was thinking ive got to get an eighteen because i dont i dont like im so used to when im grabbing tools for my car to grab for the number you know   uhhuh   because i dont even bother with the unless im working on a bumper or something but the engine parts and all are all metric you know   yeah a friend of mines got a a Colt and i was doing something to it and golly half of it was standard and half of it was metric it was the most irritating thing   i havent noticed it mostly being yeah well i mean well on General Motors cars it was all metric i use my metrics essentially when i work on the cars i dont well i guess uh in changing the oil i guess thats uh i dont even know a nine sixteenths or something like that i dont even remember   yeah i dont either i cant convert them im hope   uh but i was thinking i just had a cheap set of metrics in fact uh i thought well i guess either i lost the eighteen and then i i started to see it in stores and i noticed that the cheaper sets again im calling it cheaper sets minus the eighteen i thought well ive got to go to an expensive place go to Sears and get Craftsman tools there       and see if i cant get that eighteen i want a full set you know   yeah   i still havent checked out to see if they do make the eighteen i im sure they do   they dont uh you think so ive ive ive never seen one ive never seen one ive never seen one   well i guess they do i dont know why they wouldnt oh you havent really i just thought it was my set so i just didnt have a a good quality set you know   no as a matter of fact i dont think is there a sixteen i dont think theres a sixteen either   uh i think its what number did i just say eighteen something that is the same as a threequarter and it that i id rather have it all metric   yeah i would too i mean we were just about the last holdout in the world to to hold on to this old archaic system i mean even Englands gone metric   right Texas uh Texas Instruments makes equipment for the semiconductor business you know we make not a lot of but we make we were making a lot of our own manufacturing equipment and i bet they have a lot of metrics there i think that uh the only emotional part might be in miles you know mile signs but that thats could be last anyway maybe pick a year two thousand say okay well slowly change but i think   yeah yeah and and even changing the things i mean first off i i mean you need to address do you even need to change the signs because for so long people are going are going to be able to equate miles to kilometers i mean when you drive around Europe you do the same thing   right right well i think the speedometers dont the cars have them both now am i not mistaken i i i look at mine i dont even know i read it   yeah most of them do they have the uh yeah they have the the kilometer inside and the and of course the miles per hour great big so you can see it um   upper and lower yeah right   yeah i i i its silly i dont i dont think that we ought to be any different it causes a lot of problems a lot of times between uh different countries in their manufacturing stuff and   oh no i dont think so either i dont even know how many businesses are actually doing it without an order im not too sure that the government needs to order it although i guess they would have to in again mileage signs but uh it   well you know even even uh interstate signs and stuff you you can reprint the number of kilometers on on that reflective uh stick on tape stuff that they use to uh   yeah yeah right   uh stick on those things and they can just all thats all they have to do i mean that wouldnt cost a great deal of money and uh   uhhuh   i i i just dont see any problems with it i think its just uh obstinate Americanism   oh yeah i think that i i guess it was uh five years ago or more than when they it failed and i guess people just got tired of talking about it im not too sure i guess there was no one really pushing it and no one saying that it was going to mean business to us i think nowadays   uhhuh   we all would say who are in industry and everything wed say hey this means business we ought to   thats right   uh make everything metric and i just and i see no problem with it at all   thats right exactly right i mean   uh   i i i can think of one for instance you take a you take a textile industry and theyre selling stuff by the by the yard you know now now theres a big difference between a yard and a meter when youre talking about fabric   uhhuh right yeah right   and i dont   well i i im ready to convert i i we probably all thought it was strange you know again five years ago but i dont think theres that many people with reservations anymore i dont know if uh   no i mean look at all the all the food containers are labeled uh with both systems i mean thats no problem   sure right in fact they said it failed and then i guess it has failed but i in in general there was still a lot of people that i i im not sure its a total failure because so much has converted you know   yeah well   and im not too sure that its actually not a success more than a failure you know i dont know what percent has actually converted   yeah i i i just i just chock it up to this obstinate Americanism because they sit there and and they just dont want to learn a new system you know its just like they they wont learn foreign languages they go some you know they expect everybody to speak English yeah   uhhuh oh youre absolutely right you that thats a pet of mine too i just wish we all and us down here in Texas of course should all speak Spanish   yeah   we should have six and eight years automatically of Spanish and i i push my daughters ive got two daughters and   sure   uh one is taking Latin and one has taken Spanish but not enough of it and uh i think we we down here especially should speak and California New Mexico and all that really   sure sure i mean you you look around at all these other countries i mean i mean you look at Japan not only do they learn the metric system they also learn the our system you know and and they also take three languages   right right   i mean well i mean its no wonder that were getting beat out on everything in the world because those people those other people out there are working   oh yeah yeah theyre working theyre out theyre studying harder and theyre working harder   yeah i mean look whos taking the the engineering jobs and the and the math jobs and the science jobs you know theyre all Orientals   uhhuh   i mean weve got loads of uh Asians here in school just like we do at every other school around this country   yeah what are you taking in school by the way you say youre in school   uh what am i taking uh Masters in public administration   yeah oh well you know my wifes uh a well i have a daughter in college you know and uh whos got down at UT University of Texas i mean and my wife also has gone back for a teaching and English and English as a second language uh which is you know just teaching kids that are have have their native language and not English   right yeah   and so shes going back for that and so i i ive got three people im supporting in in school now and i guess i ought to go back myself im getting enthusiastic because they theyre having so much fun you know     uh i i dont hold out much hope for anything coming out of this Masters i im taking it more or less just because im interested in it but im im also taking a uh paralegal course and i i really want to   oh thats great   do that more than anything else i i went to law school for a year and a half and uh decided well i dont really want to be a lawyer i mean i knew that going in i just wanted a law degree because it would open all kinds of doors but   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   its just too much work for a uh a degree youre going to hang on the wall and never use so i said well maybe i ought to save some money here   yeah   so i got out of that and got back into the Masters and then decided well paralegal is really the nuts and bolts of the law and thats what i really like yeah   sure politics and everything you ought to do what you like uh you im an engineer and even when i was going through engineering school halfway through they said up dont need any more engineers weve got too many they go through this phase all the time but i think you still should do what you want because uh     sure   if youre good at whatever you are you know and theres employment   yeah i mean
