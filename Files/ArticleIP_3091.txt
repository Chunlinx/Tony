                                 Suits Me            Up until a few weeks agothe presidential campaign was marked by a deliberate effort at restraintnoinsults few attacks an unvarying tone of stern politesse The candidatesclothes followed suit which meant of course suits No Tshirts or zipperjackets on the body no cowboy hats or tank helmets on the head Just thecareful hair of each unconvincingly dark for Dole unconvincingly gray forClinton the contrasting hair of their running mates soberly dark for Goreyouthfully gray for Kemp and similar suits on all the very differentbodies            Not that they haventlapsed Bob and Bill have each momentarily given in to the populist urge andappeared in leisure wear or rough gear but thats always been a mistakeClothes like that are supposed to show the public man in private the regularguy with his guard down but they usually just make him look childish            It is oneof the paradoxical effects of suits that instead of concealing character undera bland exterior they enhance it Bill Bob Al and Jack are more visible intheir smooth dark envelopes than they are in the multicolored bunchy stuffrequired for golf or hiking picnics or beaches Such exposure may not alwaysbe flattering but it does let the voter sense the man behind the slogan Dolemay be trustworthy but in a suit he comes across as withheld and static Kempis youthful and beefy but he takes his coat off to jump around which likehis exuberant faith in quick fixes seems a little bit foolish Clinton isplump bouncy and optimistic Gore is solid but sedate And for once thecandidates look like heads of state before theyve even taken office clad inthe same somber outfit as Prime Minister Netanyahu Boris Yeltsin or PresidentKarimor of Uzbekistana very dark suit a pure white shirt with starchedspread or pointed collar and a tie with a generous but disciplinedpattern            This is the costume not of power as people woozily saynor of rigid conformity and unimaginative conservatism but of classic andflexible modernity Suits are the dress of civility itself They aim to avoidembarrassing or intimidating others either with displayof bare skin orstartling coloror with a show of personal force Instead they mean tosuggest with selfrespecting reticence the idea of a strong but adaptableorder in things This is the look we want in our leadersthe look of unlosablecool in shifting circumstances            This campaign has featured anicely symmetrical ensemble of youthful gaffers and aging youngsters each teamstarring one white head and one brown one thick body and one thin one mobileframe and one stiff But what this civilized sartorial theater underscores moreclearly than anything else is that the president is sexy and the others arenot In breathing tailored life they are stiffs except for Bill Hes theonly one you want to hug the one carrying his flesh with obvious pleasureready to share it with others Images of him with his tailored arms across theshoulders of other leaders seem reflections of genuine impulse all the morepoignant in the context of sober modern dress No wonder hes ahead in thepolls            It isinstructive to contrast the candidates with politicos who dont obey thefashion rules Dick Morris for one cant hide his unpalatable stump of a bodybehind the trappings of genial sensuality He may wear a soft collar a suitwith wide lapels and a brilliant yellow tie covered with yellow sunflowers ora buttondown collar with a glen plaid suit and a brilliant magenta tie but itonly emphasizes his lack of bodily selfpossession            In American life a dark suit is a given it isa costume generated out of modern mans honorable and heroic past particularlyhis political past When it comes to suits we are all Republicans andDemocrats still in thrall to the Great Emancipator the Ultimate PublicFigure whose great black suit merged his great American soul and body intosuch a forceful image of physical appeal and high principle Candidates mightusefully remember that there are no photos of Lincoln in fishing gear orcountry clothes His presidential suit alone created his special blend ofpersonal attractiveness and public statesmanship a blend our leaders arealways being urged to emulate There were moreover no attempts to carveLincoln in the nude with drapery as there had been with Washington no effortsto heroicize him out of his trousers just as there were none to popularize himwith comfy sportswear            Lincoln sits forever in hismonument his marble words glowing high up on the walls behind him and besidehim His marble sleeves and pants legs break into noble tailored folds aroundhis endless arms and legs his marble lapels lie gravely along his chest hismarble buttons watch chain necktie and collar points create small episodesalong the front of his lean body over a marble shirt and waistcoat that createa stately sequence of carved wrinkles            The statue enshrines Lincolnand his tailoring along with him a suited beacon for all future politicalgenerations Washington and Jefferson in their antique knee pants cant hope tocompete neither can Teddy Roosevelt in his boots and gun nor Reagan in hiscowboy outfit nor frankly Dole and Clinton in their exercise clothes Intheir expressive selfeffacement suits make grownup politics possible Itsone of the things they were invented for
