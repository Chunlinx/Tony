          okay so uh do you own a PC   um no not personally but yes uhhuh yeah several   but you have one at work okay and now because um  see im doing my uh Masters in Computer Science and Computer Engineering   uhhuh   and um and i dont i dont have one but i have to use them like during especially during my undergrad   right uhhuh   you you use um like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software you know like its easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk   uhhuh uhhuh   because um the grader can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level youre doing projects which are are so big and you have to have so many people sharing the same data   yeah umhum   that you cant use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame   right right yeah i know i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home but its one that the company has loaned me and that thats been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our um   oh okay   um computers that i have up here and you know do work from home   but does it have uh like a disk drive   oh yeah yeah yeah yeah   oh okay because uh the ones that we use you you know are like Unix base systems and so they dont have a disk drive you know so you cant you you the only way that you can do it is through a modem   right uhhuh right right   and you you know you just do it that way but thats uh thats the only way that you can get to through to the system you cant store it anywhere   yeah right yeah no i um i i have both because that thats what i use all the time is Unix systems um versus the DOS but then i teach DOS classes uh at night uhhuh part time so   oh okay and then you also have to do all your grading on the PC   well that thats the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i dont uh i dont have to have grade any grades no grade books so thats great   oh okay       okay   but uh no i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect and um also for my spread sheets um so i think its extremely helpful and very useful   yeah well uh for us its uh uh you know its like for doing like you know like resumes   uhhuh   and presentations we use like for example a Macintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than the PC than you know the IBM PCs or anything compatible with that   umhum yeah right   due due to the fact that well you know i i havent tested the the PS two yet but i dont know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line   umhum right   use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster   right thats true thats true   and uh you also get you know when you see it on the Macintosh with you know the one i have that doesnt have any color you can look at it and thats the way its going to print out   uhhuh   and especially if you have a laser printer its going to print out the same way as its on the screen   oh umhum   and so with you know with the IBM what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page   umhum   and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know its like every time that you have to do something is its really a pain   oh umhum what a hassle yeah yeah   and also you know its like for for presentations its like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a PC it can be easily represented on a on a PC you know like years back when you didnt have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers   umhum yeah   and get a graph which you werent sure if it was okay or not you know but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets   right yeah umhum right right   you can see what the trend is over the years   yeah and i love all the windows that they have out now too they have really simplified things   yeah that that i i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error   right right right   instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um   uhhuh   uh well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope thats right   umhum     get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four   yes yes yeah yeah   so you take a look at line fifty four you take a look at the output at the same time and you can see that where it messed up because you know its like in the old computers the ones that uh were using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout   umhum   every time that you ran your program you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background   yeah right right yeah i know i uh i remember my college days  and having to do that too   did did you learn it in computer science   oh yeah uhhuh  i sure did   and when was this   uh i graduated in eighty six   oh okay   yeah so its been fairly recent   yeah i know because uh all i know is that when i came here in eighty seven they still had uh it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in   the cards ah dear i didnt have to bother with that at all thank goodness yeah   so yeah no but it it was just sensational because i walked in and they go oh my God theyre still using this it was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out and you know   yes wow wow   you can get a hard copy of it and thats about it   uhhuh wow   so but i mean the price of computers has gone down they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started   uhhuh   they said that uh cars would cost two dollars and they would run forever   oh that would be great     so i mean its like you know the the joke with the Yugo you know its like yeah you you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away     uhhuh uhhuh   and that that thats the way it would be you know its like   wow   yeah i think ill buy a new car today you know so yeah but i mean the price has really gone down i mean IBM which um       an IBM PC in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars   oh sure oh sure   and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because uh you know because of the parts basically you know what   right yeah and the two eighty six too so yeah   yeah the the parts and the labor is what theyre charging you theyre not charging you you know over pricing it because its like if we sell it for less you know its like were losing money you know its like we want to sell it to break even at least   umhum right umhum   and i think they stopped producing the IBM PC   umhum   and uh and the uh PC Junior was a total failure   oh yeah   to them they had uh theyre trying to get out small computers but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the IBM PC       and so you couldnt you know its like sure bring out  into the market something thats smaller when nobody nobody uses anything thats smaller than you know this you know and so   yeah oh   but over the past years IBM has been producing uh like every two years they bring out a whole new system you know like the P C B X T D A T and the PS one PS two things you know and so   umhum   its just that you have to always compete and uh Macintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools   yeah   because of of their you know you can work with it a lot easier   yeah thats true   so thats what theyre trying to do oh well   well   ill leave you back to your work and uh have a good lunch all right bye bye   okay thanks  bye
