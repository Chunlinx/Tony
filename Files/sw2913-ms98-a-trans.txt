VCR and a lot of tapes   yeah   and uh my husbands a movie fanatic   i think youd really like Pretty Woman it was it was really a it made you feel really good it was just a happy movie   oh what about Total Recall have you seen that   yeah oh i saw that one   thats good   i i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was   yeah it was violent i try to get away from that my little boy oh he loves Robocop   yeah   and that movie i have to ill fast forward it everytime they come to the part where theres have you seen it   yeah   the part where theyre shooting Mercy   i dont like that   that it oh thats horrible  that is horrible and their their the language on thats filthy     i dont see why they have to do that i mean   yeah   i mean know everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know   yeah   use different words instead i think   yeah yeah i know     but i i think lately Pretty Womans been my favorite i went and bought the video ive probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times   um my husband bought me like um uh i think Pretty in Pink for my birthday  with a  wait a second  the uh       i will in a minute Kyle

the first time hes interrupted my phone calls   now now i havent seen Pretty in Pink that had um   Molly Ringwald yeah it was cute but it wasnt i like the um Sixteen Candles or sixteenth birthday or

well if you like love stories its sweet oh its sweet   i do   it really is and thats a tear jerker it gets you  i mean it makes you feel really sorry for her  but its hilarious too especially with that uh little guy in it oh he looks like a little   oh gosh   i dont know he  looks like a little boy next door   oh   but hes sixteen oh its a cute movie i cant remember his name he kind of looks like Doogie Howser     hm i dont know   dont know either hes got curly blonde hair he just a little freckly little   but probably know him if i saw him   boy yeah if i could remember the name i know youd know his name because hes played in a few movies but uh   i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was um Sleeping with the Enemy   okay ive heard about that but i cant remember it   that thats thats Julia Roberts new movie   okay yeah Julia Roberts is good   yeah shes this one you know Pretty Woman was kind of a light comedy   uhhuh   and a romance and and this one was a lot more dramatic   wasnt it a murder mystery   it it well it   like sort of   it was like uh it was a mystery it was a mystery she disappeared from her husband uh husband who was abusing her   oh okay the yeah thats the one i wanted to see where he was on she was on a carnival at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something   yeah yeah   well did that come on TV or did it come out in the   no it came out in the theater   oh well   and i think you know around here its already quit playing but i dont i dont know if its still playing anywhere else   oh i id like   but it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat   real good i want to see that yeah i seen the uh previews for it on TV down here its but its just been down here a couple weeks i think   oh okay because we saw it probably   yeah   four or five months ago   a month is well i know it hasnt been that long since ive seen the previews for it but yeah i wanted to see it her husband was that was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache or   yeah hes uh he was a real psycho in the movie it was it was scary   and no he shaved the beard off yeah oh id like to see that what about oh there was a we got one back here a while oh i want to see War of the Roses too have you seen that   oh yeah boy uh i i didnt like it no it was i didnt like the way it ended   you didnt i know well the only reason i know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night Christopher Reeves   uhhuh   told that you know i cant believe they killed them  or or or who was it Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas     might have been Michael Douglas oh that starred in it yeah it was Michael Douglas   yeah Christopher Reeve wasnt in it at all   huhuh   okay well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that i cant believe they killed them and Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy  so i know that they die but i havent told my husband weve both been wanting to see it         it was i i it was it was weird it was a different movie from anything ive ever seen   thats what well we was uh teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle   yeah   they did that didnt they and they marked off routes that they could go or something   yeah thatd be kind of hard for us weve only got one bathroom i dont   weve got two bathrooms but well it might actually if he takes my my house kind of looks like two trailers put together  and one bathroom is at the end of of one side and ones in the middle of the other so we could do it     oh well that wouldnt be too bad   no and he could climb out the window  well and we our whole house has you know every room leads to     did   three rooms so we can you know yeah well yeah you can get around  you just cant go out the front door honey  sorry   get around well did you see Fatal Attraction   yeah thats coming back on too   i know its going to be on on the on CBS Tuesday night and and thats kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff thats kind of how War of the Roses was   uhhuh hm well   parts of parts of War of the Roses was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know   eerie feeling or i want to see it though id like to see that and uh The Never Ending Story came out on Disney this month i think i wanted to see that   i ive heard about that but i dont know what its about   The Never Ending Story its a childs movie but oh its good i enjoyed it   yeah i love Disney movies   yeah i do too
