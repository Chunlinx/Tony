                 well um i dont know im  have only been um selected for jury duty one time and it was sort of a a rude awakening to our judicial system um after having served on the jury and uh come to a decision uh and and really it was a case that was cut and dry the uh the defendant  on uh the witness stand admitted he was guilty       and then uh the first thing that was done was after um we we found him guilty his attorney jumped up and uh started going through the procedure you know routine for filing an appeal which you know i i i know that thats the right uh but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why go through it one more time when you know he admitted he was guilty of the crime so um i dont know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me   it right i have never served on a jury i have been called like only twice in my life and and uh at the time ive been a legal assistant and nobody wanted me on their jury so ive been excused but uh       i uh i dont know i look at the people who get excused and and its supposed to be a jury of your peers and im not sure it always is uh   right   and it is a lot it is a huge burden to put on people who dont know the law uh you know that especially in criminal cases when youre deciding someones life   uhhuh   i im not so sure that you know that thats something that is that you can really really have the knowledge to do as as just a lay person   oh not i agree with that and certainly um i think that uh  i know that uh i have heard of people being you know in on a on a criminal case and uh saying that you know and i think youve got this option  that if you want if you are found guilty by the jury that you can choose  even before the trial begins  for the judge to sentence you uh and that i i think i think im correcting correct in that  but uh   well a lot of states the judge can set i mean they do set the penalty you know the the judgment  at once its rendered guilty you know the sentencing is done by the judge  in in a lot of the cases um some cases it is up to the jury but   uhhuh   you you know youre told if you find them guilty then this is the choices that they have to make its either life or death you know   right right   but uh i dont i dont know it just it it seems like in some of these cases i dont know that you could really have an impartial juror because of the media given   right   and i dont you know in todays age of television the coverage like it is theres no way that you can be shielded from it   well i i understand what youre saying and at the same time  im afraid that there are people out there that walk are walking around that have no more conception of whats going on day in and day out than if someone came down from Mars       and and unfortunately those people who my in my book i would i would consider them to be terribly uninformed might be deemed the most eligible people to be put on the jury  while like like you said earlier i dont necessarily would  i dont think id consider them to be a jury of my peers   uhhuh   you know so i but thats well you know one of the reasons why i hope i never have to be in a position to have a jury listen to what  a case of mine and i hope i never you know am in that situation   well i know when ive been you know called to jury duty they had to stand up there or stay you know until they dismissed me and i look at the people and the reasons that they get dismissed um before they even you know the selection is is even started it is your profession you know nine tenths of them are your professional people   right right   who are out in the world you know the rest are retired or theyre housewives or uh
