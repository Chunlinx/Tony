                                 Dungeons and Dragons            It hasalways been easy to make fun of Edward BurneJones  the EnglishPreRaphaelite painter and designer How could a serious European artist acontemporary of Degas and Manets spend his time filling medieval ghost townswith somnambulant knights and maidens Who are these anorexic figures withtheir stoned expressions and overshampooed hair as Sir John PopeHennessyonce quipped The Metropolitan Museum of Art never much of a showplace forBritish art has mounted a BurneJones exhibition that in its sheer size andcomprehensivenesstheres always one more room than you thought including adining room decorated by the masterasserts the artists importance Butyouve got to be in the mood for this is an art that like Wagnerian opera orsumo wrestling both wickedly caricatured by BurneJones requires asuspension of ordinary impatience Henry James who reviewed a key exhibitionof  wisely advised his audience to approach BurneJones good humouredlyand liberally since he offers an entertainment which is for us to take or toleave            It is easyto laugh at BurneJones It is harder to understand him He knew exactly whathe was doing and he did it exceedingly well I mean by a picture he wrotea beautiful romantic dream of something that never was never will bein alight better than any light that ever shonein a land no one can define orremember only desire It is the piling on of negatives that is significanthere for BurneJones was a profoundly reactive artist The Impressionists havetrained our eyes to see the modern world of work and leisure in a certain wayand in a certainnaturallight and to think that it is a good thing to banishmyth from modern painting But BurneJones hated that light and that worldinventing another one from Arthurian romances and early Italian paintings Themore materialistic science becomes he boasted to Oscar Wilde the moreangels shall I paint            Born in Birmingham the stronghold of Britishindustrialism BurneJones was the son of a gilder and framer whose handicrafttraditions predated the Industrial Revolution His mother died within a week ofhis birth The theme of recoveryof his fathers craft ethos of a motherssoothing presenceruns through BurneJones career At Oxford he met WilliamMorris another middleclass dreamer in flight from the modern world They tookrooms together in London in  Their idols were the PreRaphaeliteideologues John Ruskin and Dante Gabriel Rossetti whose passion for medievalItalian art before the individualizing tendencies of the Renaissance hencepreRaphael they shared BurneJones studied briefly with Rossetti and hisearly work with its intense floral patterningthe flowers on the groundblending with the flowers in the maidens costumescould easily be mistakenfor Rossettis            WhenMorris and his associates launched a design firm in  BurneJones joined upas a founding member The two close friends form an interesting contrastBurneJones railthin and reclusive had a singleminded devotion to thevisual arts and especially to drawing The overweight Morris caricatured inseveral of BurneJones witty sketches and nicknamed Topsy applied hiscapacious mind to every aspect of culture and society literature and arteconomics and politics architecture and city planning He was one of thetowering figures of Victorian Britain and remains a forcehes a darling ofthe Labor Party and the academic leftin its intellectual and political lifeMorris wanted to work out the nuts and bolts of an actual socialist society toreplace the capitalist industrial society he so hated            BurneJones hated it no less but theres little of thesocial critic in his temperament He was content to accept commissions and toleave the arguments to Morris He was the brilliant medieval craftsmanenvisioned by Morris turning out extraordinary designs for just abouteverythingnot only such Morris staples as tapestries stained glass tilesfurniture and book illustrations but also jewelry fans and embroideredshoes All but the shoes are on view at the Met The Morris emphasis on thehandmade the roughhewed and the handeddownwhat Thorstein Veblen a yearafter BurneJones death wickedly called the exaltation of thedefectivedid not reverse the Industrial Revolution Machines after allmake things more cheaply Like the Bauhaus and other utopian schemes toredesign the world however it left a lasting and positive imprint oninternational taste            In hispaintings BurneJones almost never portrays the world of the artisan exceptin a caricature of Morris his fat ass as wide as the loom at which he worksHis languid figures lined up across the canvas do almost nothing they cansometimes work up the energy to idly pluck a lute or to roll the dice on abackgammon table see  at the Metropolitan BurneJones prefers stasis toactivity he likes to paint people asleep turned into stone or trees orchained up like the maiden waiting to see if the dragon or King George getsthere first In the story of Briar Rose or Sleeping Beauty he found aperfect theme with knights and maidens and kings and queens all asleep amidthe flourishing underbrush BurneJones lovers seem always in freeze framelike the frustrated couple in that PreRaphaelite touchstone Keats Ode on aGrecian Urn Bold lover never never canst thou kiss Though winning nearthe goal The beautiful  also at the Metropolitan where the mood isso lulling that even Cupid has drowsed off is BurneJones idea of bliss            When his women unexpectedly wake up like Galatea in hisPygmalion series or the spurned lover emerging from the almond tree in Merseyside its often disconcerting and the men look as thoughthey should have let sleeping maidens lie The culminating image in this veinis  Merseyside in which BurneJones found biographical resonance inthe scene of the magician lured to his doom by the femme fatale NimueThe model for the temptress with snakes in her hair was Maria Zambaco asculptress of Greek background who was in turn BurneJones pupil studioassistant and lover before he broke with her in  and returned to hislongsuffering wife Modern women with their sexual appetites remained in hismind a threat as great as modern machinery In a bizarre late painting calledca  Ringling Museum of Arts Sarasota Fla an armored boat withoversize phallic anchors looms in a harbor the banks of which are lined withscantily clad women BurneJones explained with characteristic vagueness andparanoia that he had depicted a sort of SirenlandI dont know when orwherenot Greek Sirens but any sirens anywhere that lure men on todestruction            By  BurneJones wasamong the most famous painters of Europe his reputation thanks tointernational exhibitions and traveling critics was as high in Paris and theUnited States as in Britain He who had painted so many knights accepted abaronetcy in  Two years later Morris died within a few months of thepublication of his Kelmscott Chaucer  which had illustrations byBurneJonesone of their greatest collaborations Two years after that SirEdward died of a heart attack He had spent a lifetime imagining solemn andritualized occasions The Prince of Wales arranged a memorial service inWestminster Cathedralthe first time a British artist had been so honored Itwas the one scene in his lifethe right mix of ceremonial and stasisthatBurneJones himself might have found visually appealing
