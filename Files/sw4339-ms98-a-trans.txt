        yeah Jonathan uh you you say you say its near and dear to your heart buying a car is uh something youre contemplating i take it     uh fantasizing about cant do it right now our situation is that were a two car family   ah uhhuh   and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago its got a uh five year loan so thats still got a couple years to run   uh uhhuh   and the car i get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra thats gonna be ten years old next month so   wow  you get   i think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years when i can   uhhuh what do you think youll uh what kind of a car do you think youll buy next   well  since i just turned forty im thinking about a forty year old mans cars something uh something real sporty but uh realistically with uh   umhum uhhuh   the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldnt wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat something a little seating room   right uhhuh   how about you   well i think the next car we get will probably be a  well i i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now its a nineteen eighty seven   uhhuh   and uh whatever i get i wanna have uh air bags uh both drivers and passenger side and a four door because its much more convenient if youre carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and   sure   safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car uh you know im not looking for one with a great big engine uh something thatll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it   sure   right now weve got a V in it and that seems to be just fine i know they said theyre coming out with some Vs now and i think thats probably a little overkill for this day and age   yeah im surprised to hear that the Vs are coming back uh theyve got some pretty powerful s   umhum   and uh you know Vs seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon   right i uh i drive a a truck a Ford truck i i like trucks because theyre spacious and its handy to haul things uh its not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but theres so many occasions when ive had to move some members of the family or do this or that its its handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one   sure is uh traction much of an issue for you up there terms of   traction uh not really um you know its a two wheel drive truck and i figure if its so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway   actually uh pretty good way of looking at it yeah we uh we had a small accident with our mini van   wow   a few years ago a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we werent aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and   hm   this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that havent had any problem since   uhhuh what kind of what make is the mini van   its a Mazda   Mazda i see   and uh were pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability fuel economy isnt great being a minivan but uh its real nice for carrying around our kids and others and   uhhuh right   its uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around so weve been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon   umhum one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager i guess   uhhuh right   and uh they have a a child thats five years old and its really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends im sure thatll be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home were in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home wed certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value   yeah i think that were gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway   uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that youd be interested in or is that a not an issue   uh  id be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra   umhum   and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires its its done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably dont wanna be driving anyway   uhhuh right   so i know id be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again weve weve got the same issue with getting kids into the
