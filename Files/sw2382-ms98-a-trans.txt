        okay do you want to go first   well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic   fitness and exercise   oh God  No why dont you go first   okay um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling and just walking uh and swimming i i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall and the doctor said that running and jumping isnt real good for my knee anymore so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit   well let me ask a personal question how old are you   thirty eight   oh well then you you get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop   uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape its just that left knee that just doesnt want to do everything it used to   oh well youre lucky then because ive battled arthritis all my life i mean even since i was like about two or three thats when they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and uh i do water aerobics   really ooh oh i bet that helps   religiously do water aerobics   umhum   i used to do it about six times a week and now im down to about four but its about the only thing that keeps my mobility in shape in in there uh  i tried weight training  and im telling you you just i just cant lift the things   yeah   and the shock on the system is is just too much so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and   yeah   trying to keep in shape that way but you know its hard to find i mean its really hard to find a place thats going to offer water aerobics because what im finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way   thats right thats right   to get in shape without having to spend anything or its the geriatric crowd   thats right   so ive considered even becoming licensed to teach it   well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do       yeah but you have to have an indoor pool   this is true   so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means youre really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training   well now at   and that does look very odd in the water   i can believe that have you tried the uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center   no and you know thats the only place i havent tried and people have told me now thats the Texan facility   yes   i have been told that thing is just lovely   it is they keep it at eighty one degrees yearround   huh have do you use that facility a lot   um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center   hum do you know if they have child care there   um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet         you need to put that on there seriously   they dont i dont i dont work at TI   oh you dont   no i used to work at TI as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and i used to fill out those attitude surveys and uh   oh yeah   uh  me and the uh insurance adjusters adjusters are are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and uh   yeah   i get my attitude expressed through them but i find it to be very sometimes its kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks uh and   this is true   never having lived in Texas before i started to work for TI and i came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers and   yeah   boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just dont say that you know and its not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified   well its not now what year are we talking about   were talking nineteen seventy eight   okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then   they couldnt have gotten anymore in the dark ages   yeah you know we still dont have a day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it   i understand i understand that theyre now covering womens preventative health care and uh the reason im at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um   yes yes   i had been rated number one in the field and then i took uh when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early   ooh my gosh   and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure   could you hold the phone for one second thanks   okay im back   and then they used to uh and then i had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them back to back and of course to maintain and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because thats when i go into labor thats like four and a half months and i dont even know it   wow of course its real easy to take care of the first one when youre on your back   oh yeah very easy very easy and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasnt premature then they said they wouldnt cover the cost of the monitor i think thats kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar   really   bill but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty five layoff   yeah yeah   and ill tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didnt have any coverage under my name and i went back and i said what the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and hes got a good salary we didnt think that youd be coming back anyway and uh   yeah really   you know weve got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was this way we didnt have to layoff an active person and wed just let you go and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know youve got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldnt get my insurance benefits and i couldnt get my uh termination benefits either   yeah there you go   i was just pissed as hell that they could do that   i i can believe that   but i i guess things have gotten better ive been told that theres flex hour and those kind of things   oh yeah flex time is great   i still dont think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again   i i can understand i can understand well its been good talking with you   but let me ask you this since you use T exans how much is it a month   yeah oh shoot its only about ten bucks a month   now is that for an individual   yeah i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something its no big deal   thats it   yeah   now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes youre taking   uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge   God thats cheap   yeah it is   thats really cheap do you have to be an active TI employee to join Texans or   or or a dependent or a dependent of one   or the dependent on God i am so dependent these days its offensive to me  alrighty well i im seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence   really   wonderful   yeah  so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy i think im going to go contact Texans i really think i am i mean that beats any offer ive heard in a long time   yeah oh yeah its great   huh alrighty when youre there on weekends is it crowded as hell   uh well it would depend on when you go its not its not excessively crowded on the weekends   see id want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty   oh i dont think that would be bad at all if youre in Richardson youd probably wanted to come to the to the Dallas site   oh i im actually right on the Plano line   oh well then you could go either one the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more   yeah   niceties amenities and youd probably like the pool there   oh God it sounds like i would i might do that then okay i learned something here   well im good im glad well thank you you have a good day byebye   you can go back to work now thank you byebye
