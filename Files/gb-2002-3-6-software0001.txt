                    Rationale        Microarray technology has radically changed the way        researchers address many biological questions It is now        possible to measure messenger RNA levels quantitatively for        thousands of genes or even entire genomes using DNA        arrays microarrays or chips    Researchers can in        a fairly straightforward fashion examine the overall        transcriptional response of thousands of genes in normal        cells and tissues in disease states in response to        biological genetic or chemical stimuli such as drugs or        during normal biological processes such as cellcycle        progression and embryonic development            Two of the most commonly used microarrays for        geneexpression measurements are oligonucleotide GeneChip        expression arrays made by Affymetrix and custommade cDNA        arrays Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays are created by a        combination of DNA synthesis and photolithographic        techniques whereas cDNA arrays are constructed by spotting        or printing PCR products or oligonucleotides onto glass        slides      Affymetrix arrays contain sets of        multiple  mer oligonucleotide probes specific for each        gene or expressedsequence tag EST whereas spotted        arrays generally contain longer cDNA probes usually  to         bases or oligonucleotide probes usually  to         bases for each gene        The large amount of information generated from        microarrays has been a great strength but is sometimes        seen as a frustrating weakness   A significant        obstacle in microarray research has been the inability to        process experimental data easily assess the data quality        manage multiple data sets and mine the data with        userfriendly tools that can be quickly learned and applied        for routine analysis by laboratory scientists          Two HTMLbased microarray filtering and analysis        programs were written one for the Affymetrix platform        Bullfrog and one for the cDNA platform Spot to address        common dataanalysis needs Our aim in creating Bullfrog        and Spot is to provide simple tools that enable researchers        at all levels to analyze their data in multiple ways        without having to use more complex software without having        to call in bioinformatics experts and without having to        learn to program in scripting or database languages        Bullfrog and Spot were built with an easytonavigate user        interface and adjustable analysis criteria and were        written to run quickly allowing multiple microarray        experiments to be filtered in several seconds They were        created to provide the bench researcher with uncomplicated        tools that help focus microarray data from thousands of        genes to a relatively small number of highconfidence        differentially expressed candidates The programs are not        intended for highlevel statistical or other complex        analyses but they do make it easy to export filtered data        to GeneSpring or other visualization and clustering        programs Lastly the programs are freeware made publicly        available to the research community in the hope of        accelerating functional genomics research                    Manipulating data sets in Bullfrog        Bullfrog and Spot can be used to select genes probes        probe sets or spots that behave in specific ways across        multiple experiments by using a combination of more than         different qualitative and quantitative criteria Figure         To illustrate a few of Bullfrogs capabilities we use data        obtained in geneexpression studies of the adult mouse        brain using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays   A        simple question to ask is what genes are differentially        expressed between two different regions of the brain for        example the cerebellum and the amygdala in a        SSvEvTac SvEv inbred mouse strain As in most        experiments it is important to first estimate the        falsepositive rate for this type of comparison between        brain regions The best way to realistically approximate        the falsepositive rate is to perform and analyze        independent experimental replicates of the same brain        region from multiple different mice We used RNA from the        cerebellums of two different mice with samples prepared        separately and hybridized to two different chips Ideally        replicate comparisons from wellcontrolled experiments        would show no differentially expressed genes However        experimental noise and biological variation may lead to        genes being scored as differentially expressed between        replicates For example small differences in the brain        dissections or differences in the exact time of sacrifice        can affect geneexpression patterns It is very important        to estimate the falsepositive rate for the particular        experimental system being studied and to set analysis        filter criteria that lead to appropriate levels of false        positives without sacrificing sensitivity to lowabundance        mRNA transcripts or subtle changes in gene expression        To estimate the falsepositive rate a comparison        between the data for independent replicate SvEv        cerebellums was made that is expression data from mouse         cerebellum versus expression data from mouse  cerebellum        This comparison file saved as text from the Affymetrix        GeneChip MAS  software was loaded into Bullfrog and        the filter criteria were selected A number of different        criteria may be selected but our default criteria for        calling a gene differentially expressed are as follows a        qualitative difference call of Increase I Marginal        Increase MI Decrease D or Marginal Decrease MD        a fold change expression ratio of greater than  an        average difference change of greater than  after scaling        to a mean signal or target value across the entire array        of  and an absolute call of Present for the probe        set in either or both replicate cerebellums The use of        multiple filter criteria reduces the risk of erroneously        assigning a gene as differentially expressed while        maintaining sensitivity to rare mRNAs and small differences        in expression           When applied to the cerebellum replicate data the        filter criteria yielded  probe sets scored as        differentially expressed out of  a falsepositive        rate of approximately  We have carried out a large        number of analyses using a combination of qualitative and        quantitative filters and consistently observe        falsepositive rates of less than  between well        controlled independent duplicates using the default        selection criteria     For example  duplicate        comparisons for data from different brain regions and        different strains of mice were analyzed using the default        qualitative and quantitative criteria The number of probe        sets out of  that were scored as differentially        expressed ranged from  to   to  of the total        considered with a mean value of  SD   and a median        value of  For the cerebellum data decreasing the        foldchange cutoff from  to  increased the number of        selected probe sets to  A lower falsepositive rate was        achieved at the expense of sensitivity by increasing the        average difference signal change requirement from  to         and maintaining the qualitative criteria and the        foldchange threshold at  The average difference        signal is proportional to mRNA abundance   and the        average difference change is the difference between the        signal intensity for a probe set on chip  and the signal        intensity for that same probe set on chip  Raising the        average differencechange threshold to  which        corresponds to about  copies of the mRNA transcript per        cell on average   yielded  genes scored as        differentially expressed producing a very low        falsepositive rate of less than         A common mistake when analyzing geneexpression data        from oligonucleotide arrays is to ignore the qualitative        calls absolute and difference calls and focus solely on        the quantitative values for example the average        difference fold change and average difference change The        qualitative calls are important however because they        provide an assessment of the consistency of the behavior        across the multiple probes in a probe set The use of the        qualitative calls enables one to determine not only whether        there is a signal or a signal change but also whether        the signal or the signal change is due to the gene for        which the probe set was designed    Signals or        signal changes that are not consistent across a probe set        should not be interpreted with confidence Ignoring the        qualitative calls in an analysis of the replicate SvEv        cerebellum data and using only quantitative thresholds a        fold change greater than  and an average difference        change greater than  yielded a long list of  genes        scored as differentially expressed In other words        ignoring the qualitative calls increased the falsepositive        rate by a factor of  To maintain the low falsepositive        rate obtained with the combination of qualitative and        quantitative criteria approximately  using only the        quantitative fold change and average difference change        criteria the thresholds would have to be set very high        for example fold change greater than ten and average        difference change greater than  Fold change and signal        change thresholds this high result in a tremendous loss in        sensitivity This example demonstrates that an effective        way to preserve a low falsepositive rate while maintaining        high sensitivity is to use a combination of both        qualitative and quantitative filters Bullfrog is designed        to help researchers apply these types of multiplecriteria        analyses        The best way to reduce the falsepositive rate is to        combine the filtering criteria described above with the use        of multiple independent experimental replicates Inclusion        of expression measurements for cerebellar mRNA from two        additional SvEv mice cerebellums from mouse  and mouse         further reduces the falsepositive rate To include data        from more mice a file for the comparison between        independent replicate cerebellums from mouse  and mouse         was created in GeneChip Cb versus Cb This comparison        file was loaded into Bullfrog along with the comparison        between the data for mouse  and mouse  Figure  The        filter criteria were set to select genes that scored as        differentially expressed in both comparisons I MI D or        MD fold change   average difference change   and        P present in at least one measurement Directional        consistency was also imposed on the two comparison files        Directional consistency means that the direction or sign of        a change is the same in both comparisons Adding the        additional replicates and using these filter criteria        yielded only  genes out of  indicating a very low        falsepositive rate with only moderately stringent        selection criteria again consistent with what we usually        observe            Once analysis criteria and an estimate of the        falsepositive rate had been established it was possible        to confidently assess differences in the geneexpression        patterns between the cerebellum and the amygdala Pairwise        comparisons between cerebellum Cb and Cb and amygdala        Ag and Ag samples were made in GeneChip for example        Cb vs Ag and Cb vs Ag Both of these comparisons were        loaded into Bullfrog and filtered using the criteria that        yielded the very low falsepositive rate I MI D or MD        fold change   average difference change   and P in        at least one measurement An analysis of the        cerebellumamygdala comparisons with these criteria yielded         differentially expressed genes In the list of         genes cerebellumspecific genes such as Purkinje cell        protein  PCP and         N methylDaspartate NMDA receptor        NRC subunit were identified as being specifically        expressed in the cerebellum and not the amygdala        consistent with expectations    On the basis of        careful analysis of independent replicates a high        percentage of the  genes are likely to be correctly        identified as differentially expressed Therefore Bullfrog        provides the bench researcher with a way to quickly        identify differentially expressed genes for further        analysis and followup                    Manipulating data sets in Spot        Many of the features available in Bullfrog for        oligonucleotide arrays are available in Spot for cDNA        arrays To illustrate the specific capabilities of Spot we        use experimental data from a timecourse study of wildtype        and mutant mouse thymus CJ Winrow DGP CT Vibat        TJ Bowen MA Callahan DJL AJ Warren BS        Hilbush A WynshawBoris KW Hasel Z Weaver and CB        unpublished observations The mutant mice typically        acquire Tcell lymphomas at age  months   The cDNA        array experiment compared gene expression in the thymus of        the mutant and wildtype mice at four different times         weeks  weeks  weeks and  weeks        As with Affymetrix experiments cDNA microarray        experiments require meaningful independent replicates to        determine the falsepositive rate and to confidently        identify genes that are differentially expressed It is        recommended when performing cDNA microarray experiments        with the standard twofluorophore cohybridization        reactions that all experiments and replicates be performed        in fluorophorereversed pairs Reversal of fluorescent        labeling in which the two samples to be compared are        labeled once with one fluorophore and once with the other        helps compensate for differential incorporation of the        fluorescent dyes and other sources of fluorophorerelated        systematic errors or bias   Newer labeling strategies        such as aminoallylbased labeling reduce some of the bias        associated with differential fluorophore incorporation but        it is still important to use fluorophore reversal           Fluorophore reversal results in two measurements for        each pair of samples a forward measurement fluorophore          experimental sample fluorophore   control sample and        a reverse measurement fluorophore   control sample        fluorophore   experimental sample        To estimate the falsepositive rate for the cDNA        experiment described above RNA samples from two        independent thymuses from wildtype mice at age  weeks        were compared using fluorophore reversal replicates The        array data were background subtracted normalized and        analyzed with the custom cDNA normalization program        described below The forward measurement file was loaded        into Spot together with the reverse measurement file saved        from the custom cDNA normalization program Application of        the standard filter criteria a difference call of I MI D        or MD fold change   signal change   in both files        after scaling to a mean signal or target value across the        entire array of  an absolute call of P in at least one        measurement and directional consistency yielded  gene        scored as differentially expressed out of  To        increase sensitivity the foldchange threshold was        decreased to  and the scaled signal change cutoff to         This more sensitive filter yielded only  genes out of         indicating a low and satisfactory falsepositive        rate        Once the falsepositive rate had been estimated the        timecourse comparisons were filtered for differences        between mutant and wildtype mice For this cDNA microarray        experiment there were four timepoint comparisons of        mutant to wildtype mouse thymus  weeks  weeks  weeks        and  weeks First we looked for differentially expressed        genes wild type vs mutant at each individual time point        Using the criteria established above  genes were found        to be significantly different at  weeks five genes at         weeks four at  weeks and nine at  weeks None of these        genes was common to all time points However three genes        were common to the  and week time points two genes to         and  weeks and one gene to  and  weeks        Both Bullfrog and Spot allow the user to apply the        filtering criteria to a subset of the loaded files done by        checking the Filter box for the relevant files only        Bullfrog and Spot display the results for all loaded files        but the filter criteria are only applied to checked files        It is often useful to filter using only a subset of the        files while viewing the results across all the files For        example in the timecourse experiment it is possible to        identify the  genes that were differentially expressed in        the first time point while also monitoring how those same        genes behaved in the other three time points Using this        feature eight candidate genes were found that were        directionally consistent for all time points but were        slightly below at least some of the thresholds for some        time points Similar to Bullfrog Spot quickly identified a        list of differentially expressed genes for further analysis        and followup To determine all this information including        estimating the falsepositive rate and testing the        selection criteria required less than ten minutes                    Further features of Bullfrog and Spot                  Doubletiered filters          In addition to the commonly used filters described          above Bullfrog and Spot have several doubletiered          filters located on the right in Figure  An example of          their use is to select genes that are differentially          expressed with a fold change greater than  in six of          six files AND with a larger fold change of greater than           in at least one of the six files          Bullfrog and Spot also contain a simple logical Venn          function The Venn function taken from Venn diagrams          allows two or more lists of probe sets or spots to be          compared to find common occurrences within the lists The          Venn function lets the user quickly identify the genes in          common between lists generated from different          measurements or using different filtering criteria In          addition Bullfrog and Spot allow the user to save the          results of a filtering operation and reload them for          further filtering                          Attaching gene information          Once a filtered list of genes has been generated gene          information can be attached to the list This information          can include GenBank accession numbers UniGene numbers          with direct hyperlinks to UniGene Resources Locus Link          IDs gene names gene descriptions BLAST

Bullfrog and Spot before hierarchical or kmeans          clustering                              Program architecture of Bullfrog and Spot        Bullfrog and Spot are Internet Explorer  client        applications running on Windows NT operating systems They        are written using a combination of C HTML and Scripting        code VBScript and JScript They are relatively small        programs  MB and  MB respectively and are easy to        install Double clicking the setupbat module registers        Bullfrog and Spot onto the hard drive        The C module Atlprovdll performs the        computationally intensive functions such as parsing and        filtering the Affymetrix or cDNA data files This module        makes the data files accessible as a Microsoft OLEDB data        source allowing script code to communicate through        Microsofts Active Data Objects ADO interface        Atlprovdll is a C Windows Dynamic Link Library developed        with Visual Studio  The ADO Interface uses the Active        Template Library ATL to implement the appropriate        Component Object Model COM Interfaces as provided by the        Visual Studio Wizard for creating an OLEDB data        provider        The Bullfroghtm and Spothtm modules have scripting        code that uses the ADO interface to query the C module as        if it were a database These modules are a combination of        static HTML VBScript and JScript that produce HTML on the        fly DHTML and use ADO commands and Recordsets They were        developed and debugged using Microsofts Visual InterDev        and Visual StudioNET The static HTML provides a simple        and familiar user interface for loading files and choosing        filtering options The user interface has scripts to        dynamically create and modify the pages HTML DHTML such        as occurs when displaying a results table        Bullfrog and Spot require that data from experiments be        saved as specific file types before loading Bullfrog        requires that the data from chp comparison files be saved        as txt files tabdelimited text refer to the users        manual for complete instructions Spot requires that data        from the Excel summary files discussed below be saved as        csv files commaseparated text These files can then be        loaded into their respective programs for

   Excel macro and was written in Visual Basic for        Applications VBA using Microsofts Visual Basic Editor        The program background subtracts and normalizes raw cDNA        data before data analysis and filtering in Spot The        normalization program output includes quantitative        information and qualitative calls similar to those used for        Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays Raw median pixel        intensities for each gene are loaded into Microsoft Excel        Median pixel intensities are used because they are less        likely to be affected by small artifacts or slight        imperfections in spot morphology The regional background        is calculated by dividing the cDNA array into  equal        sections and the average of the lowest  of spot        intensities in a section is considered the section        background a section typically contains  to  spots        The background signal is the result of nonspecific        hybridization binding of the fluorophores to the glass        surface and fluorescence and reflection from the surface        of the cDNA array The lowest  of spots typically         spots was chosen as a balance between using multiple spots        at different locations that accurately reflect nonspecific        signals and not including too many spots that contain        real signals A separate background value is calculated        for each section to help correct for background that may be        uneven The background is subtracted from each spot in a        particular section before further scaling or processing of        quantitative results For more information on background        subtraction please review the Salk cDNA analysis algorithm        guide in the users manual folder available with the        online version of this article or at          After background subtraction the cDNA array signals are        linearly scaled and normalized to compensate for        nonbiological variation for example differential        fluorophore incorporation different amounts of labeled        sample arraytoarray variability Backgroundsubtracted        signals are scaled to an overall average target value that        can be set by the user the default value is  The        scaling factor is calculated on the basis of the total        signal intensity after ignoring the lowest  and the        highest  of signals We determined empirically by        analyzing large amounts of cDNA array data and testing        different combinations of high and low exclusion        percentages that ignoring the bottom  and top  of        signals led to scaling factors that were consistent and        well behaved for example the mean and median of the        resulting distributions were approximately equal More        important scaling factors calculated in this way        consistently resulted in the smallest number of genes        scoring as differentially expressed between replicates        To identify scaled signals that are detectable above        background and to accurately estimate fold changes        ratios a threshold is set using the scaled background        values Scaled signals that are less than the threshold are        considered undetectable and are set equal to the threshold        value For more information on scaling and the setting of        the thresholds please review the Salk cDNA analysis        algorithm guide in the users manual folder available with        the online version of this article or at          The custom cDNA normalization program generates a file        in Microsoft Excel that provides a single printable summary        sheet for each experiment Table  The file includes        information on the cDNA array background the raw average

correlation coefficients This file provides an        assessment of the overall quality of the data and a summary        of the experimental results for each cDNA array At the top        of the summary file not shown in Table  are several        userentered parameters that define the experiment If        controls were spotted on the cDNA array a control summary        is also created In addition to the data summary the        detailed results for each spot on the microarray are        provided in a table for further analysis with Spot or other        programs The results for each spot or gene include an        absolute call of present P or absent A a call of        present indicates that the signal was greater than the        regional background AND greater than the local background        measured in the four corners surrounding the individual        spot the scaled intensity the difference between the        scaled fluorophore intensities the fold change or ratio of        the twocolor intensities expression ratio and a        qualitative difference or change call of I MI D or MD        change calls are based on the fold changes across the        duplicate spot data The spotbyspot results are easily        exportable to other programs for further visualization or        clustering Once the cDNA data are normalized and in a        systematic format similar to the normalized Affymetrix        data the data are ready for further analysis in Spot To        download the Salk cDNA analysis algorithm guide see the        users manual folder available with the

valuable        research tools for microarray users Bullfrog Spot and the        custom cDNA normalization program were not designed to do        complex statistical analyses and visualization Rather        they were designed to help the researcher narrow their        search from tens of thousands of gene candidates to several        hundred or fewer that meet specific but adjustable        criteria Bullfrog Spot and the custom cDNA normalization        program eliminate some of the difficulty of handling large        numbers of array results and allow researchers to answer        crucial questions about their data quickly These programs        along with detailed instructions and user manuals may be        downloaded at                      Downloading files        The
