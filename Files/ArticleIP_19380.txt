                                 Attention Must Not Be Paid            This week a revival ofArthur Millers classic  tragedy Death of a Salesman opened onBroadway Something seems redundant about this sentence since Millerstragedies from the s and s exist in a state of nearperpetual revivalLast year the Roundabout Theatre staged an acclaimed version of A View Fromthe Bridge  Millers  tragedy about immigrant life The season beforethat it was All My Sons  Millers  tragedy about a sons discoveryof his fathers wartime corruption In  Millers own son produced a finefilm version of The Crucible  Millers  tragedy about the Salemwitch trials as a parable of McCarthyism On the basis of these four workswritten over a period of only eight years Miller is frequently referred to asAmericas greatest living playwright            Arthur Miller did notdie or quit working in the s He remains alive and continues to writemoreprolifically in fact than he did back then Yet despite the immense nationaland international interest in his four famous postwar plays the dozen or so hehas written in the last  years are all but ignored If youve read or seenany of the more recent ones The Ride Down Mt Morgan  The LastYankee  Broken Glass  or The American Clock  you might agreethat this neglect is warranted These works are labored didactic andhumorless with weak characters and weaker ideas Even if you think as I dothat Millers classic plays are somewhat overrated the gap between his earlywork and everything since is mysteriously wide What happened to this manAttention must be paid            The crisp  th anniversary production ofDeath of Salesman  which comes to the Eugene ONeill Theatre in New YorkCity from the Goodman in Chicago is a good place to begin the inquest BrianDennehy restores the original girth to the role of Willy Loman who was playedon stage in  and in the first film version by the looming Lee J Cobbbefore he was downsized by Dustin Hoffman Stuffed into a threepiece suit thatvisibly wilts in the course of his decline Dennehy uses his bulk as his chiefdramatic asset Just carrying his own weight seems a terrific burden for hischaracterthe working stiff as beached whale Almost everything else about theproduction is equally strong The design and staging are clever but not tooarty Sliding screens and rotating platforms convey effectively the chaos ofLomans mindthe jumble of present past and fantasy This is aChicagoschool production the kind associated with the Goodman Steppenwolfand Wisdom Bridge theaters Robert Falls the director draws out the dramaticvigor and intensity of the text without adding any heavy interpretive overlayof his own            Such a limpid productionprovides a window into the merits and flaws of the play itself The chiefstrength of Death of a Salesman is its psychological acuity and itsinsight into family misery At its heart is the headbutting relationshipbetween the disappointed father and his troubled son Biff played by KevinAnderson What the play captures so well is the way in which a parentsfrustrations and projected ambitions can poison a childs life Willys pushinghis sons to succeed and his unwillingness to accept their failures develop intodelusion and insanity In catching this phenomenon Miller created a great roleon the American stage            But Millers weaknesses as a dramatist are also latent inthis play I hope I never have to sit through Death of a Salesman againnot because its depressing and bleak but because its unrelieved andunchallenging As a dramatist Miller not only has no sense of humor he alsofails to grasp how changes in tone and texture can be used to make tragedytolerable Here as in his other plays he seems terrified that someone mightaccuse him of entertainment Nor is there much loveliness to his languageMiller occasionally writes a brilliant line such as Willys response to thecallow boss who fires him after  yearsYou cant eat an orange and throwthe peel away But more often when he reaches for poetry he achieves onlyportentousness as in the nearly playwrecking requiem that Willys friendCharley delivers at his funeral No one dast blames this man The humorlessstilted quality of Millers writing makes Salesman feel like a dentalextraction            The other problem isthat while Miller at his best is fierce and brutal he is seldom intricate orsubtle Death of a Salesman is of a piece with powerful butuncomplicated works of literature from the same era such as The Grapes ofWrath The social content of the playits indictment of the values ofAmerican capitalism and consumerism as they say in  th gradeEnglishretains something of its currency But you dont get a lot more outof this point by hearing it made again and again Miller is a preachyplaywright who lets you know what youre supposed to think about everythingthat happens in his moral universe In his didacticism he denies his charactersambiguity and hence a life of their own            What redeems Death of a Salesman is its furiousenergy and the fact that Millers arguments were fresh when he wrote it But inhis subsequent playsboth the few that are good and the many that are not sogoodthese ideas become steadily more tiresome For example BrokenGlass  is Death of a Salesman compounded by issues of Jewishselfhatred and sexual impotence The setting is Brooklyn in  PhillipGellburg is an upscale Willy Loman who has devoted his life to a company thatthrows him onto the slag heap as soon as he begins to falter As Gellburgslife comes apart selfunderstanding eludes him He dies begging forgivenessfrom his martyred wife            In all his plays Millerremains fixed to the same set of concerns corruption and the worship ofmaterial success loyalty and betrayal fathers and sons public responsibilityand personal conscience That list is surely rich enough to support a lifetimeof playwriting but Miller handles these themes in the same way again andagain That way identifies him as a playwright of the immediate postwar era aperiod characterized by the anxiety of affluence the worry that risingmaterial status was being purchased at the expense of decency and mutualresponsibility His plays have a message and its always similar if not thesame            It isnt just themes and arguments that recur in Millerswork Plots and characters do too His plays most often involve the devastatingloss of ones childrens respect  All My Sons  Death of aSalesman  A View From the Bridge  The Price  The Ride DownMt Morgan  This leads to suicide as the only remedy for shame All MySons  Death of a Salesman  After the Fall  The Ride DownMt Morgan                The Crucible  Millers men struggle with theirconsciences but his women never do Theyre either saintly maternal figuresKate Keller in All My Sons  Linda Loman in Death of a Salesman Elizabeth Proctor in The Crucible  or destructive temptresses AbigailWilliams in The Crucible  Catherine in A View From the Bridge Maggie in After the Fall  The lack of interest in womens minds isanother thing that dates Miller and makes even his more recent plays seem likeperiod pieces            To some extent Millers fate is that of theBroadway stage Since the s the middleclass audience for his kind ofserious social drama has shriveled The theater has ceased to be the placewhere Americans explore issues of the kind raised by Death of aSalesman  But Millers failure is ultimately his own As his ideas grewfamiliar and then stale he found no way to complicate them develop them ormove on to something else Death of a Salesman  his greatest play isabout the devastating effects of professional failure But Millers career is atestament to the opposite problem creative paralysis brought on by earlysuccess
