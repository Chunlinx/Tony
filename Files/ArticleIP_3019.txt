                                 Tales of the City            Fred Siegel a senior fellowat the Democratic Partys Progressive Policy Institute has written a scathingattack on urban liberalism Siegel blames liberal ideology for most forms ofurban declinefor welfare dependency spiraling crime rates inefficientservices and failing public schools It is not New Deal liberalism that is atfault either No he says the problems plaguing cities are the product ofpolicy choices produced in the s            Siegelsupports his argument with case studies of three cities New York WashingtonDC and Los Angeles He chose those cities he says because they shaped notjust the urban but also the national agenda Politics and policy in thesecities represent liberalism and big cities to the rest of America Thecritical moments in the history of those cities he says are the Los Angelesriots of  and  New York Mayor John Lindsays attempt to forge a NewDeal liberalism by expanding welfare and creating multicultural schools NewYorks fiscal crisis and the collapse of municipal service in Washington underMarion Barry The cities lived in the shadow of the riot ideology he writesand it is in the name of the riot ideology and of righting the wrongs ofracism that liberals went on to justify the violence of the s and itscriminal aftermath The power to disrupt became a way of extracting money fromthe federal government he says            Siegel clearly wrote this book out of a frustration whichI share with a general failure to face up to the shortcomings of the policiesof the s Yet Siegel a professor at Cooper Union and the author of severalrespected books is too good a historian not to know that he has produced anincomplete onedimensional account of the decline of Americas cities Thereare three serious problems with his argumentfirst an analysis that givesurban liberalism an unconvincing degree of importance in accounting for thisdecline second a methodology that picks out three cities that are not reallyrepresentative and third an oddly unbalanced account of urban history thatplaces ideologically motivated mayors liberal intellectuals and radical blackactivists center stage            Was the socalled liberalideology really responsible for the deterioration of Americas cities Siegelbarely considers other explanations As historian Kenneth T Jackson argues inCrabgrass Frontier The Suburbanization of the United States  centralcities began to degenerate and suburbs to boom as early as the s whenmany people started buying cars The Federal Highway Act of  and theInterstate Highway Act of  produced the roads that enabled thismiddleclass flight A series of wellintended federal mortgage and loanprograms developed during the New Deal led to policies of redlining thewholesale branding of certainoften blackneighborhoods as greater creditrisks The Federal Housing Administration and the GI bill of  ensuredlongterm mortgages for home construction and sale which made it cheaper forthe white middle class to buy new homes in the suburbs than to rent or evenmodernize older homes Meanwhile many areas in the aging central cities weredeclared ineligible for loan guarantees Add to these disastrous policies asegregated publichousing program that concentrated affordable housing for thepoor in central cities and you see why by  the suburbs were growing times faster than the central cities and why in  not a single one of the residents of Levittown was black            At thesame time the manufacturing base of the inner cities eroded Between  and most of the older central cities lost half of their manufacturing jobsAccording to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development by suburbs were the principal sources of employment in the  largest metroareas            Clearly these longterm trends and federalpolicies left cities besieged and impoverished But Siegel doesnt justundervalue these trends he also gets his chronologyand therefore hiscausalitywrong The wrenching loss of manufacturing jobs the source oflowskill jobs at decent wages and the flight of the white middle class to thesuburbs began before the riots While the socalled riot ideology mighthave exacerbated these trends it certainly could not have been heldresponsible for them The decline in urban economies occurred in almost everyAmerican city even in those without the legacy of s riotslike theSun Belt cities of Houston Phoenix and San Diego whose economies actuallygrew in the s and s before falling off in the s            Siegelalso fails to grasp certain key political facts of urban life Simply putmayors cant afford to be raving ideologues They are practically the lowestliving things in Americas political food chain Both state and federalgovernments can mandate programmatic spending without providing the fundsStates limit the citys legal authority to raise revenue through taxes anddebt while the federal system forces cities to compete with one another fortax revenue Siegel fails to address the basic problem of a federal system thatmakes local governments dependent on their local tax base to fund basicservices infrastructure and education Wealthier jurisdictions will always dobetter than cities with high concentrations of poverty            Siegels choice of cities to study also presents amethodological problem In social scientific terms Siegel selects cases thatdont offer the opportunity to test the null hypothesis He stacks the deckThis is really a book about New York Los Angeles and the District of Columbiaare invoked only insofar as they can support his claims about riot ideologyBut if Siegels theory is correct then cities where riot ideology did notinform local policies should have had different outcomes in terms of fiscalpolicy the quality of the public schools and the condition of the localeconomies But this is not the case Moreover Washington is never used in theurban literature as representative of anything other than itselfits historygovernance and economy are understood to be unique            One of therecurring themes in Siegels book is that urban liberals were maumaued byblack militants Siegel argues that funds from the federal Community ActionProgram a neighborhoodbased antipoverty program were used to buy peace fromthe black militants allowing them to develop their own neighborhoodbasedpatronage networks This was supposed to have been particularly true in NewYork where white liberals like Lindsay were easily guilttripped Heres wherea broader selection of cities would have made a big difference In political scientists David Greenstone and Paul Peterson examined the CommunityAction Program in five citiesNew York Detroit Los Angeles Chicago andPhiladelphiaand found that it worked differently in each place In ChicagoMayor Richard Daley retained complete control over the federal funds anddistributed them to black neighborhoods through his Democratic machine In NewYork Lindsay used them to augment a scheme for political decentralization thatbegan in the s under Robert Wagner More importantly all these mayorswent to Washington for funds and of them only Lindsay would be considered aliberal reformer No doubt the mayors who took these funds did try to use themto consolidate their political bases They were operating in thegreaturbanmachine tradition of buying support            In the last few lines of his book Siegel waxes strangelyoptimistic            Even after being takendown a notch or two cities will remain by virtue of their concentrations ofenergy and intellect at the center of the American political imaginationThese great cities will continue to shape our future            But if ideologically drivenmayors and radical black activists have taken over then the future of Americancities should be bleak It isnt of course Across the country immigrantgroups faithbased institutions and bootstrap mayors are reinvigoratingcities In New York for example where more than half the citys currentpopulation is foreignborn immigrants have helped renew neighborhoods Koreansand Chinese have revitalized Flushing Queens as have Russian Jews BrightonBeach Caribbeans Flatbush and Dominicans and Irish Washington Heights Eachof these stories is more important to New York Citys future than those thatSiegel chose to tell            Whats more New Yorkscurrent renaissance is happening because there is something to come back toThe overspending that the city engaged in during the Depression which Siegeldecries may be contributing to the current rebirth of the citys economywhich centers on tourism culture financial services and informationtechnology In New York there is at least an infrastructure to rebuildcultural institutions that draw tourists and a wealth of human capital withtechnical and creative energy Were it not for LaGuardias grand vision ofpublic hospitals colleges parks public transportation and affordablehousing New York City might have just been another Newark In a recent Galluppoll New York was identified as the city that Americans would most like tolive in Nothing in Siegels work could explain this perception
