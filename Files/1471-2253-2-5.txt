                    Background        PKQuest is a new generic physiologically based        pharmacokinetic model PBPK     A PBPK provides an        approach to modeling drug distribution and metabolism that        is based on the use of a physiologically realistic model of        the animal This new PBPK has been designed to provide a        rigorous mathematical treatment that takes into        consideration all the different biochemical and        physiological properties that a drug may have and yet be        very simple to use Other papers in this series have        described the application of PKQuest to propranolol D          O ethanol inulin and protein bound        antibiotics       This paper will describe the        application of PKQuest to volatile solutes with particular        emphasis on anesthetics        The use of a PBPK to model pharmacokinetics requires        detailed information about the bloodtissue partition        coefficient for each organ This is the feature that has        limited the applications of PBPK to human studies since it        is normally assumed that these tissue partition        coefficients must be determined for each specific solute        that is studied The major design philosophy behind PKQuest        is to increase the predictive power of the PBPK so that it        can applied to a large variety of solutes without the need        for this specific information This is accomplished by        preprogramming a standard human data set that contains        most of the information that is required to model the        different solutes The new approach for the volatile        solutes that is developed in this paper is to assume that        the tissue partition of these solutes is determined        entirely by a the oilwater partition coefficient and b        the fraction of lipid in the blood and each organ i klip        i A set of standard human values for klip i is        assigned for each organ Using this assumption the        pharmacokinetics of any inert volatile solute is completely        determined as a first approximation by just  parameters        the waterair Kwair and oilwater Kfwat partition        coefficients This allows PKQuest to be used to predict the        pharmacokinetics of any inert volatile solute for which        experimental values for these simple physical chemical        parameters are available If the solute is metabolized as        is the case for halothane and toluene then additional        adjustable parameters eg metabolic liver Km and Vmax        must be added        As a test of this approach to modeling volatile solutes        PKQuest was applied to the simultaneous uptake and washout        measurements of Munson et al    and Carpenter et al           for N          O enflurane halothane and        methoxyflurane Application of PKQuest to these        simultaneous anesthetic measurements provides a stringent        test of the PKQuest assumptions because only the specific        partition coefficients Kbair etc vary for the different        gases while all the other parameters eg percent body        fat klip fat blood flow ventilation etc must be        identical In addition using the same set of parameters to        fit the roughly  fold difference in concentration between        the Munson et al and Carpenter et al data provides        another test Finally to show that the validity of this        approach extended beyond the anesthetics it was also        applied to toluene a volatile solute for which detailed        human PBPKs are already available Since the value of the        oilwater partition coefficient varies from  for nitrous        oxide to  for toluene the ability of PKQuest to model        these different solutes using a single set of organ fat        fractions klip demonstrates the generality of this        approach        Anesthesiologists have used physiological models        incorporating airwater partition coefficients and volumes        of distribution to predict the kinetics for more than a         years     However there have been only a few        applications of detailed organ specific PBPK to        anesthetics Mapleson and colleagues developed a detailed        anesthetic PBPK      and measured the relevant PBPK        parameters       Smith and colleagues            and Fukui and Smith     have developed complex PBPKs        in which the anesthetic interacts with and modifies the        organ parameters The primary application of these models        has been to illustrate the theoretical importance of the        different model components The only detailed attempts to        fit human data with a PBPK are for nitrous oxide in man           and halothane in infants     Allott Steward and        Mapleson    also fit a PBPK to the experimental data        for halothane in the dog Both of these halothane studies        were incomplete because they did not account for        metabolism The most complete PBPK for halothane is the rat        study of Loizou et al    which includes a metabolic        component that is saturable and inactivates There have        been no previous attempts to use a PBPK to model multiple        simultaneously measured anesthetics such as is described in        this paper        In contrast to the PBPK model of Mapleson            PKQuest does not model the vascular time delays and        therefore is not applicable to short time kinetics less        than a minute However PKQuest does incorporate a number        of features that are not present in Maplesons model        including tissue metabolism capillary limitation either        in the lung or tissue and ventilationperfusion        mismatch        The PKQuest

Methods                  PBPK program and its assumptions          PKQuest    was used for all the analysis in this          paper All the figures shown in this paper are direct          copies in jpeg format of standard PKQuest output          PKQuest makes several simplifying assumptions see              It is assumed that each organ can be modeled as a          single wellstirred compartment For the volatile solutes          studied here it is also assumed that the bloodtissue          exchange is flow limited so that the partial pressure in          the tissue is equal to that in the vein leaving the          tissue This is clearly an approximation and effects such          a diffusion gradients countercurrent exchange and          heterogeneous organ blood flows      will produce          small deviations from this assumption It is also assumed          that the influence of the anesthesia in the Carpenter et          al studies on the PBPK parameters can be neglected               Although these solutes may consist of stereo          enantiomers it is assumed that there is no significant          difference in the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers          which is supported by experiment      It is          assumed that the metabolism of N            O and enflurane is negligible                and that the loss through the skin can be          neglected              The free water concentration C           free  plays a central role in the          PKQuest calculations see    for details For the          blood or any organ the free concentration can be related          to the total measured concentration Ctot by the          relation C           tot  C           free wfractfw where wfract is the          water fraction in the organ and fw is the fraction of the          solute that is free in the water phase The parameter fw          i the fraction free in organ i including vascular          compartments characterizes the fraction free and          bound and the corresponding tissueblood partition          coefficients In general this parameter must be          experimentally determined for each solute and organ          However for these volatile solutes it is assumed that          the bound solute is equal to the solute dissolved in          the blood or tissue lipid For this case the parameter          fw i is completely determined by Kfwat oilwater          partition coefficient and klipi the fraction of lipid          in each organ          fwi  wfractiwfracti  Kfwatklipi          Although PKQuest uses only Kwair waterair          partition Kfwat and klipi for the actual          calculations a variety of combinations of Kfwat Kwair          Kbair bloodair partition Kbwat bloodwater          partition etc can be entered For example for the          anesthetics investigated here the  parameters Kbair          Kwair and Kfwat are known experimentally and are entered          PKQuest then uses these  parameters to calculate the          corresponding value for klip blood and replaces the          default standard human value by this experimental          value                          Experimental pharmacokinetic data          The experimental data was obtained from previous          publications The anesthetic data was based on the          results in the papers by Carpenter et al    and          Munson et al     Both of these studies determined          the simultaneous uptake and washout of nitrous oxide N            O enflurane halothane and          methoxyflurane Munson et al used low subanesthetic          concentrations of all  gases with a total inhaled          concentration of about  so that the second gas effect             was negligible Carpenter et al first induced          anesthesia with high  concentrations of N            O and then after the N            O had equilibrated added the other           gases at concentrations about  times higher than that          of Munson et al at a total inhaled concentration of          less than  and then washed them out while maintaining          constant N            O levels Thus the second gas          effect can also be neglected for the data of Carpenter et          al for enflurane halothane and methoxyflurane but not          N            O The experimental data points          were obtained by using UNSCANIT Silk Scientific          Corporation to read the data from the published figures          figs and  Munson et al figs and  Carpenter et          al          The Munson et al data    represents the mean value          for  healthy fasted unanesthetized males breathing for           minutes a gas containing   methoxyflurane            halothane   enflurane and  N            O The Carpenter et al data             represents the mean values for  male and  female          healthy subjects undergoing donor nephrectomy The          subjects were administered  N            O for  minutes and then a mixture          of  isoflurane   enflurane  halothane          and   methoxyflurane was administered for  hours          After discontinuing these gases anesthesia was          maintained with fentanyl thiopental and N            O for the duration of the operation          The Carpenter et al washout data was collected at          intervals during the first day and once a day for the          next  to  days Since subjects became ambulatory upon          recovering from surgery with the associated changes in          PBPK parameters eg muscle blood flow ventilation only          data out to  hours was used In fitting this data it is          assumed that using the mean values of the concentration          versus time averaged over a population is equivalent to          treating these values as representative of a single          average person     For this data with its          relatively small standard error typically   to   of          the inspired concentration this should be a reasonably          accurate assumption          The toluene data was based on the published          investigation of Pierce et al     Pierce et al             exposed  male Caucasian subjects to  ppm each of          Htoluene and Htoluene for two hours at rest and          collected venous blood and alveolar breath samples for up          to  hours Their subjectspecific PBPK explained           of the observed data variability and found          interindividual toxicokinetic differences All the data          for each individual in this series was generously          provided by CH Pierce Two different individuals in the          Pierce et al series were chosen to be modeled by          PKQuest The two subjects subjects a and  in Table I          of Pierce et al were chosen because they had large          differences in percent fat content  versus  and          corresponding differences in toluene kinetics                          Experimental partition coefficients          The partition coefficients were based on previous          published data The values of Kwair for the anesthetics          enflurane  halothane  N            O  methoxyflurane  were          from the review by Steward et al     The average          values of bloodair partition coefficient for the Munson          et al subjects      Table II were used for the          anesthetics enflurane  halothane  N            O  methoxyflurane  The          value of Kfwat was obtained from different sources          enflurane      N            O      halothane               methoxyflurane      Identical values were used          for modeling the Munson et al and Carpenter et al          data          For the toluene data the value of the bloodair          partition coefficient was measured for each of the two          subjects that were modeled Table I     The value          of the lipidair partition coefficient was based on the          average value reported by Pierce et al

to those used in all the          other applications of PKQuest       A list of some          of the parameters is included in additional file  For a          complete listing see the routine on the

with Kfwat          determines the tissuewater partition This parameter set          was determined by finding values of klip that would          reproduce the tissueair partition coefficients reported          by Zhou et    for a number of anesthetic solutes for          human heart brain liver muscle and fat and assuming          that the other organs skin intestine kidney had          similar values The values of klip chosen for each organ          are liver  intestines  kidney  and all          other organs  The only other parameter that was          adjusted to fit the data for these solutes was the fat          blood flow The PKQuest global simulated annealing and          local Powell optimization routines were used to select          the fat blood flow that provided the best fit to the          enflurane data This value was then used for all the          other solutes that were investigated                          PKQuest Maple input procedure          The pharmacokinetics for each of the solutes is          completely characterized by the Maple input procedure for          that solute The complete procedures are available on the          web

figures in the second and third rows          show the semi log plots of the uptake and washout          respectively All the figures shown in this paper are          copied directly from the standard PKQuest output          The corresponding plot for the enflurane data of          Munson et al    is shown in the right hand column of          fig  Exactly the same set of parameters were used          except that  the fraction of body fat was reduced to           the standard literature average value    for          the  young male subjects used in this study and  the          experimental inhaled enflurane concentration was            for  minutes versus  for  minutes for          Carpenter et al The fact that both sets of data can be          fit using an identical parameter set even though the          concentrations differ by a factor of  indicates that          the enflurane pharmacokinetics must be linear over a          large concentration range                          Nitrous oxide          Figure compares the PKQuest output with the          experimental data of Munson et al    for N            O The N            O data of Carpenter et al could not          be used because of the large second gas effect The          partition coefficients used for this calculation are the          standard N            O literature values Kwair              Kfair    and Kbair Munson et al              fasting subjects All the other parameters are          identical to those used for the Munson et al enflurane          data See additional file for the complete N            O Maple procedure The agreement          between the PKQuest predictions and experiment is          excellent for the N            O uptake However there is a          significant deviation between the predictions and the          data during the washout that is especially apparent in          the semi log plot There is no obvious explanation for          this discrepancy and it may be artifactual see          Discussion Section                          Halothane          There is an additional complication when modeling the          halothane data because a significant fraction of the          halothane disappearance is the result of metabolism                     Loizou et al    developed a          detailed PBPK in the rat with the halothane metabolism          described by a  parameter function that included both          MichaelisMenten and inactivation components Although          there is qualitative evidence that halothane metabolism          in humans is nonlinear saturating at higher          concentrations     the quantitative aspects of          halothane metabolism are poorly characterized in the          human Probably the most relevant data is provided by          investigations in miniature swine Sawyer et al             reported that the percent liver clearance during the          halothane washout in miniature swine was  at an          alveolar concentrations of  and fell to  at an          alveolar concentration of  Halsey et al    found          that  of the halothane entering the miniature swine          liver was metabolized at a steady state alveolar          concentration of           For this study it was assumed that the halothane          metabolism could be described by a two parameter          MichaelisMenten Km and Vmax liver component The two          parameters were adjusted to so that they a provided a          good fit to the experimental halothane data of both          Carpenter et al    inhaled concentration of           and Munson et al    inhaled concentration of           and b were roughly consistent with the          miniature swine data The final values in partial          pressure units were Km   ml ml and Vmax            mlmin for the standard  Kg human This corresponds to          a water concentration for Km of  moleliter and a Vm          of  molemin This Km is similar to the Km of           moleliter in the rat     Given the limited human          quantitative data that is available these human          metabolic parameters should be regarded only as a first          approximation Figure shows that this set of metabolic          constants provided a good fit to the  fold range of          inhaled halothane concentrations used in the Carpenter et          al   concentration and Munson et al            concentration experiments The partition coefficients          used in these calculations were the standard literature          values Kbair   Munsen et al fasted subject          Kwair      and Kfair       See          additional file for the complete halothane Maple          procedure For these parameters the percent liver          halothane clearance varied from  at an alveolar          concentration of  to  at a concentration of           to  at a concentration of   similar to the          swine data Using the PKQuest PBPK results  of the          halothane should have been recovered during a  day          washout period relative to the total uptake This is          somewhat greater than the  recovery directly estimated          for this same data by measuring the mixed expired          halothane concentration and ventilation rate once per day          for  days     The standard output of PKQuest          provides all the above information fractional liver          clearance recovery during washout etc                          Methoxyflurane          As shown by the results in figs  PKQuest provides          an accurate description of the human pharmacokinetics of          the uptake and washout of enflurane and halothane and the          uptake of N            O In contrast the PKQuest          predictions are clearly incorrect for methoxyflurane          Figures show the PKQuest predictions for the alveolar          concentration solid line compared with the experimental          data of Carpenter et al fig  left column and Monson          et al fig  right column See the additional file          for the complete methoxyflurane Maple procedure The          partition coefficients used for these figures are the          standard literature values Kbair   Munson et al             fasted subjects Kfwat       Kwair                It can be seen that the PKQuest concentrations          during uptake are about  less than the experimental          values The actual error is even worse than this because          these PKQuest predictions ignore metabolism which can          account for as much as  of the total removal                  Including metabolism would increase the          difference between the PKQuest and experimental results          during uptake The explanation for this poor fit is          provided in the Discussion section                          Toluene          Some of the most comprehensive and sophisticated human          PBPKs have been developed to describe the          pharmacokinetics of volatile toxic solvents such as          toluene       styrene      and methyl          chloride     The most involved models incorporate          several different fat and muscle compartments with          different flows and allow for changes with time in the          blood flows as the subjects exercise level varies                These studies have also introduced a Bayesian          approach to determine the population distribution of the          PBPK parameters      PKQuest cannot complete with          these PBPKs for this class of solutes The only purpose          of applying PKQuest to toluene is to show that the new          approach developed here of using just klip and the          oilwater partition coefficient to characterize the          tissue partition is valid for a wider class of solutes          than just the anesthetics gases at least as a first          approximation PKQuest was applied to data for two          individuals subjects a and  that were chosen from          the detailed investigations of Pierce et al             because they had large differences in percent fat content           versus  and corresponding differences in toluene

klip          vein The input function was a  hour inhalation of          toluene at a constant gas concentration of  M The only          adjustable parameters are the metabolic kinetic          constants The rat liver has a number of enzymes involved          in toluene metabolism     Since the Km for all of          these enzymes is in the mM range while the blood toluene          concentrations for this data are in the M range it was          assumed that the metabolism is linear which in PKQuest          is indicated by using Tclr in place of Vm and Km The          value of Tclr was obtained by using the Powell          minimization routine that is built into PKQuest to          optimize the fit to the blood data Pierce et al             divided the metabolism between the liver and lung          However since there is little direct information about          human lung metabolism of toluene it was assumed here          that only the liver was involved in the metabolism          Subject a was modeled using the same procedure using          the body weight  Kg fat fraction  alveolar          ventilation and Kbair measured for this subject See          the additional file for the complete subject a Maple          procedure The value of Tclr for subject a was set          equal to the Tclr of subject  scaled by body weight          All the other parameters were identical to those for          subject           Figure shows the agreement between the PKQuest          predictions for the arterial black and venous red          blood concentration and the experimental data for subject          a left hand column and  right hand column during          the time course of toluene washout PKQuest allows an          arbitrary number of different organ concentrations to be          simultaneously displayed Pierce et al sampled          arterialized venous blood Since the PKQuest venous and          arterial concentrations are identical at the time points          of the experimental data fig  the distinction          between artery and vein is not significant Figures show          the corresponding fits for the alveolar gas          concentration It can be seen that the agreement is quite          good and the differences in the pharmacokinetics for the          two subjects can be explained by differences in the fat          fraction It should be emphasized that there is only one          adjustable parameter for these  subjects  the Tclr of          subject                           PerfusionVentilation Mismatch          A unique feature of PKQuest is that it provides a          direct simulation of the mismatch between perfusion and          ventilation A detailed description of the equations and          procedures used for this simulation is provided in the          original paper     Briefly the lung is divided into          Nlung equal volume compartments with the blood flow Q          and ventilation V to each compartment determined by a          bivariate uncorrelated lognormal function                        The value of Nlung is determined by the user input          parameter Ndim Nlung  Ndim  The two parameters                     Q and            V the log standard deviation          characterize the distribution of the blood perfusion            Q  and the ventilation            V  to the different compartments of          the lung The default values of            Q and            V of  were determined by applying          the analysis of Wilson and Beck    to the          ventilationperfusion ratio distribution for normal young          men     The rates of perfusion and ventilation to          each lung compartment are assumed to be uncorrelated see             for details This assumption is consistent with          recent direct measurements of regional perfusion and          ventilation      Results will be shown here for          the case where the lung is divided into  equal volume          compartments Ndim   Nlung   This provides a          good test of the importance of perfusionventilation          mismatch Increasing Ndim to  corresponding to           lung compartments changes the results by less than           Using the default values of            Q and            V the fraction of total flow and total          ventilation assigned to each of the  compartments is          flow fraction ventilation fraction                                                                                      Figure shows the influence of perfusionventilation          mismatch on the PKQuest results for the enflurane data of          Munson et al     The predicted alveolar          concentration is shown for a the  compartment          homogenous lung model black and the  compartment          model with b the default normal values for sigv and          sigf red c twice the normal values of sigv and          sigf green and d three times the normal values of          sigv and sigf blue It can be seen that the           compartment model with normal sigv and sigf red is          almost indistinguishable from the homogeneous           compartment model black Thus normal values of          perfusionventilation mismatch have no significant effect          on the uptake and washout of enflurane It is not until          the normal values of sigv and sigf are increased by a          factor of about  that differences become          significant          Although the effect of the perfusionventilation          mismatch is small it can be important for some          experimental measurements Figure shows the alveolar          black arterial red and venous green N            O concentration using the           compartment model and the default normal of values of          sigv and sigf for the conditions of Munson et al              with all concentrations expressed in terms of the          partial pressure gas concentration It can be seen that          the perfusionventilation mismatch produces a small          difference in the alveolar and arterial concentrations          during uptake for the  compartment lung model alveolar          and arterial concentrations would be identical This          result is in quantitative agreement with the experimental          measurements of Eger et al    in conscious subjects

and conclusions                  Enflurane nitrous oxide halothane and          toluene          The simple PKQuest approach of using a single set of          standard human values for the lipid fraction of each          organ klip to predict tissueblood partition provides          an accurate prediction of the pharmacokinetics of these           volatile solute The word prediction and not          description is purposely used here because most of the          parameters are based on the default previously          determined set of PBPK data and there is a minimum of          adjustable parameters For example in the PKQuest input          for the enflurane pharmacokinetics fig  there are no          adjustable parameters Every constant in the procedure          enflurane listed above is predetermined from previous          measurements In this sense the time dependence of the          alveolar enflurane concentration during washin and          washout shown in fig is a true prediction based on          previous measurements          This example for enflurane is slightly misleading          because the default blood flow in standard human was          adjusted to give the best fit to the enflurane data The          fat blood flow parameter plays an important role in          determining the accuracy of the fit to the experimental          data Figure compares the PKQuest output for enflurane          using the default fat blood flow  litersminKg          black and twice the default value red The generality          of this fat blood flow value is evidenced by the good fit          that was obtained when it was used in the modeling of the          Munson et al and Carpenter et al data for halothane          fig  and the Pierce et al data for toluene figs          and  solutes for which the fat blood flow has a          larger influence because of the larger value of the          oilwater partition coefficient          This use of the enflurane data to determine the fat          blood flow illustrates one of the main advantages of          having a PBPK program such as PKQuest that is general          enough that it can be applied to a large variety of          solutes Since different solutes have different          sensitivities to the different PBPK parameters using a          variety of solutes to optimize the parameters increases          the validity of the PBPK Other examples of PKQuest          standard human parameters that were optimized this way          are the muscle blood flow optimized using human D            O pharmacokinetics     and the          extracellular space optimized using human inulin          pharmacokinetics              The single most important difference between PKQuest          and other PBPKs that have been applied to these solutes          is the way the tissueblood partition coefficient is          handled The conventional approach is to directly measure          this partition coefficient for each solute in various          classes of tissue in animals and then use these values          in the human model In contrast in PKQuest this          partition coefficient is determined just from the value          of the oilwater partition coefficient along with the          default value of the organ and blood lipid content          Since this partition coefficient is a simple physical          chemical value and is usually available in the          literature this means that one can apply PKQuest to          solutes even when no animal tissue partition data is          available The ability of this approach to describe the          pharmacokinetics of solutes with an oilwater partition          varying from  N            O to  toluene demonstrates the          large range of its validity          The pharmacokinetic approach that seems to be          currently favored for anesthetics is to use a general          multicompartment fit rather than a PBPK      In          this approach the data is first fit with a          multiexponential function that is then interpreted in          terms of exchanges between a central compartment the          vascular system and an adjustable number of peripheral          compartments a mammillary system Although this          approach may be mathematically similar to a PBPK it is          completely different philosophically The advantage of          the multicompartment approach is that it is completely          general and puts no restrictions or previous assumptions          on the pharmacokinetic model This advantage is also its          main disadvantage For example in a multicompartment          analysis of anesthetics by Yasuda et al    there are           different rate constants that are optimized for each          different anesthetic and these constants are then          interpreted in terms of compartments and flows In          contrast the major design feature of PKQuest is to have          as many parameters as possible set by default based on          previously determined measurements with the amount of          user input reduced to its absolute minimum For the case          of the typical volatile solute described here the user          only needs to input the waterair and oilwater partition          coefficients and the metabolic parameters All the other          parameters required for the PBPK organ volumes blood          flows alveolar ventilation organblood partition and          volume etc are determined simply by a call to          standardhuman By using all the previous information          that is available to restrict the model and minimize the          number of adjustable parameters PKQuest greatly          increases the predictive power of the analysis          The one exception to the generally good agreement          between the PKQuest predictions and the experimental data          for these solutes is for the washout of N            O fig  Although the differences          between the PKQuest and experimental data are small in          absolute value they represent large relative values For          example for the last data point  minutes the          PKQuest prediction for the end expired gas concentration          is  while the experimental value is  for an          inhaled concentration of  This difference is          larger than the standard error of the last data point          This difference may be artifactual For example the          experimental N            O data fig  has a marked          difference in the degree of equilibrium reached during          uptake  versus washout  This result is not          expected theoretically and is not consistent with the          detailed experimental results of Salamitre et al             who found approximately equal equilibration times during          uptake and washout of sub anesthetic doses of N            O Another indication of the problem          presented by this discrepancy is that it was not possible          to significantly improve the fit by adjusting any or all          of the PKQuest parameters Any parameter change that          improved the fit for the washout significantly worsened          the fit for the uptake and the addition of a          perfusionventilation mismatch did not improve the fit          One possible explanation is a small error in the          quantitative measurements made in  of Munsen et al             at low N            O concentrations Other          possibilities are a difference in some physiological          parameters eg ventilation during uptake and washout          or an error in reading the data off the published linear          plot                          Methoxyflurane          Methoxyflurane is a notable exception to the generally          good agreement between the PKQuest PBPK and the          experimental data For methoxyflurane the experimental          end tidal partial pressure squares fig  is about           greater than the PKQuest prediction during uptake line          fig  It is assumed in the PBPK model that the          arterial blood and alveolar gas partial pressures are          equal and correspond to the experimentally measured end          tidal gas partial pressure Thus the error in fig is          equivalent to the statement that the arterial partial          pressure is significantly less than the end tidal partial          pressure This discrepancy for methoxyflurane had been          noted previously in the older literature Holaday et al             reported that during methoxyflurane uptake the          arterial partial pressure was only about  of the end          expired value Similarly Stoelting    observed that          at the end of the methoxyflurane uptake the arterial          partial pressure was  of the end expired while during          washout the two values were nearly identical Despite          these clear indications that there was something          anomalous about methoxyflurane this problem seems to          have been generally ignored in the recent literature          This inequality is almost certainly caused by the          classic washinwashout artifact that has been described          for gases with large bloodair partition Kbair          coefficients            This artifact          is created when during inspiration the high          concentration gas dissolves in the tissues of the          bronchial tree and then during expiration moves back          into the air raising the end tidal concentration above          the alveolar values For extremely soluble solutes such          as ethanol Kbair   the expired gas concentration          is dominated by exchange with the conducting airway and          is almost independent of the alveolar concentration               For gases of intermediate solubility such as          styrene Kbair   or toluene Kbair   the effect          is less dramatic and has often been overlooked This          analysis provides a good example of the advantage of a          PBPK such as PKQuest over the more general compartmental          mamillary model It is obvious from the PKQuest          analysis see fig  that some model assumption must be          wrong In contrast in a detailed compartmental          mammillary model analysis of the simultaneous uptake          and washout of methoxyflurane and other gases it was          recognized that methoxyflurane was different but the          reason for this discrepancy is not clear              The strongest evidence supporting this explanation for          the discrepancy in the methoxyflurane data is provided by          a comparison with toluene Since the bloodair partition          coefficients are similar for toluene Kbair   and          methoxyflurane Kbair   this artifact should be of          similar magnitude for these two solutes During the          uptake of toluene in resting subjects the end tidal          partial pressure is only about  the arterial value              similar to what is observed for methoxyflurane                and see fig  However when these same          subjects begin to exercise increasing the ventilatory          rate by a factor of  the arterial and end tidal gas          concentrations become approximately equal              Presumably at the higher rates of ventilation there is          relatively less time for exchange with the airways and          the artifact decreases This suggests that solutes such          as methoxyflurane or toluene are right on the boundary of          where this artifact becomes important The artifact          becomes negligible for halothane with a Kbair of  as          indicated by the nearly identical end tidal and arterial          partial pressures     and the good agreement between          the PKQuest results and the experimental data see fig                    For solutes such as toluene      styrene             and methoxyflurane    there is at first glance a          peculiar asymmetry in the data that has caused some          confusion during uptake there is a large difference in          the end tidal and arterial partial pressures while          during washout there is only a small or negligible          difference However this asymmetry disappears if the          data is reexamined as follows For the resting toluene          data of Carlsson et al    during uptake the inspired          concentration is  mgm  the end tidal concentration          is  mgm  and the arterial concentration is  mgm           Assuming a Kbair of  this arterial concentration          corresponds to a gas concentration of  mgm  an end          tidal  arterial difference of  If the artifact were          not present and the end tidal equaled the arterial then          the end tidal concentration should have been  mgm           Thus the net rate of gas uptake inspired  end tidal          is decreased about    by the artifact          If a symmetrical error was present during washout the          washout rate should also be decreased by  by the          artifact Since during washout the inspired          concentration is zero this means that the washout end          tidal concentration should be  less than the arterial          partial pressure Thus if the artifact was symmetrical          the difference between the end tidal and arterial partial          pressure during washout should be only about  of the          difference during uptake  versus  difference          Errors of this magnitude  can be swamped by the          normal variations in Kbair that result from variations in          the blood fat content          The observant reader should at this point be asking          why toluene can be modeled by PKQuest figs and  if          it has a similar Kbair and therefore similar          washinwashout artifact as methoxyflurane There are           reasons  Only the washout data was modeled so that one          would expect only a small  error and  This small          error in the washout data was not present because the          value of Kbair that was used for this modeling Table I          Pierce et al     was determined from the          experimental ratios of the bloodend tidal air for each          subject and thus automatically compensated for this          artifact The fact that the average value of this in          vivo Kbair was about  larger than the in vitro          value    is consistent with an end tidal partial          pressure that is  less than the arterial partial          pressure                            Competing interests        None declared
