            so what sort of car are you interested in getting next   well actually i love the car i have i have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible   ah   and i love it and i would get another one in a minute unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red Ferrari or you know a little Corvette or something like that and thats what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car and id love an expensive one but i probably can never afford it so   uh well i understand and can sympathize with that because i also enjoy driving performance automobiles um i currently have an eighty seven five liter Mustang GT that ive done a bunch of modifications to to make it uh handle and perform better   uhhuh   and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was um the best car i could get regardless of money  uh i probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari   uhhuh yeah well im a nurse here and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari   a a three twenty eight GTS   and i couldnt tell you but its just beautiful and i go out and i love to touch it but i cant even do that because of the  of the alarm so i just look at it a lot       you just go hunting go out and lust after it   really exactly but it sure is a pretty thing   so have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari   no im working on it  no i really havent no huhuh   oh   i did test drive a Corvette last year maybe the year before it was brand new white it was like a big marshmallow when you sat in the seats they adjusted to fit around you   ah   i mean they came in and up and out and i mean they did whatever and and we went for a test drive in that and i was able to open that up pretty good and that was really fun and i wanted it but i had a choice of that or my house   yeah there theres something about having a place to live i dont know   and i felt that i should continue to live in my house so yeah you know its just necessary and i did i thought well a tent wouldnt be bad but  probably not practical   could sleep in the back of the Vette   yeah right  so   i find that uh that the Corvettes are are becoming really really nice cars   they are theyre pretty arent they lately they really are   yeah and theyve theyve improved the performance and the suspension such that theyre actually a lot of fun to drive   really   its not like driving a a Winnebago or something   oh no no no see im not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now and they go isnt that a nice van and i go hm       not really you know how about a Greyhound bus   uh nice yeah nice isnt the word id choose maybe practical isnt that a practical van   yeah i mean that you know theres some that are prettier than others and yeah the new type is prettier than what their they used to look like but i sure dont think its attractive you know its not like like driving a little sports car   yeah its its very hard to find something practical thats also attractive   yeah i dont think that happens so but i i love mine so and i i bought it because i drove a friends in Hawaii and i just went home and i walked in and i picked it out and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and i never did i just went back and signed the papers and i knew nothing about my car when i got it nothing i didnt know how anything worked   oh so it was a completely new experience for you and im sure you enjoyed every minute of it   yeah and ive had it its almost three years actually and ive i still love it i put the top down everywhere i go i timed it when i first got it and it took twenty minutes i mean twenty seconds and so i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didnt have twenty more seconds   right   so   and you and you couldnt get how long does it take to go back up about the same time   twenty seconds yeah thats all it takes i mean its just a button thats it you you release it right at the top so you dont have to get out or anything   yeah so so you wont get yeah and twenty seconds you probably wont get caught in anything too substantial   well i did actually last week going to the airport i just hit a downpour and i was on a highway going like eighty       so i really did i mean i was soaking wet i thought i would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over   whoops   but it all dried out you know didnt take long when the sun came out but   it was kind of funny im sure people around me really enjoyed it  so   yeah oh no i was just down in Austin last week and the weather was pretty nice too so   oh and wasnt it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything yeah yeah   with the bluebonnets out yeah it really was yeah i decided that Austin is certainly someplace that i could handle living   yeah a lot of people say that and its pretty far from where i live its about hm two or three hours maybe two hundred
