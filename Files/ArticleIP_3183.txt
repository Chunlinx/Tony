                                 Plain Speaking            In June shortly beforesummer began President Clinton issued a governmentwide memorandum the firstdirective of which takes effect as soon as summer comes to a close By thebeginning of October if not before federal bureaucrats are supposed to haveput into place the first elements of the governments Plain LanguageInitiative which aims to make the government more responsive accessible andunderstandable in its communications with the public Those elements includethe use of something called Plain Language in all documents other than officialregulationsfor instance in all letters forms notices and instructionbooklets The official regulations themselvesthat is to say the entirecontents of the daily Federal Register must come into compliance byJan              What isPlain Language Ordinary English speakers might well give different answersbut according to the government Plain Language uses short sentences commoneveryday words except for necessary technical terms and you and otherpronouns instead of handsoffish nouns such as applicant or lessee PlainLanguage also uses the active voicealthough a White House press releaseaccompanying the presidents memorandum notes that the Plain LanguageInitiative which now forms a part of Al Gores Reinventing Governmentprogram was developed oops by an interagency group of plain languageenthusiasts This group the press release goes on was formed in Implementation of the new regulations it warns must be begun by October  For its part the Plain Language Action Network a government task forcecharged with promoting the regulations states on its Web site We are guidedby a small steering committee Ah well There is nothing intrinsically wrongwith the passive voice and the active voice sometimes sounds stilted Besidesthe Romans didnt build their city in a day            What impact the full force and majesty of the United Statesgovernment can actually have on the English language remains far from clear Tobe sure some official language programs have enjoyed success In the lateMiddle Ages for example the central governments of England and France set outto turn the dialect spoken at the royal court into a national language Withthe advent of a standardized court vernacular a cadre of scribes trained touse it a kingdomwide reliance on the legal and other documents the scribesproduced and the military might to back up such relianceunder thesecircumstances the spread of the kings English and the kings French wasrapid The language theorist Stephen Pinker asked once to define thedifference between a dialect and a language replied A language is a dialectwith an army Today of course government pronouncements constitute a smalland probably shrinking

Stillgovernments persist in stepping into language debatesand outside groupspersist in putting pressure on governments to do so I wont bother mentioningFrance In England a citizens lobby called the Plain English Campaign led bya former housewife named Chrissie Maher has sought since  to make Englishlaws and regulations more straightforward The campaign has spread throughoutthe Commonwealth of

impoverished I think in a world where theoccasional malpractice case was never passed off as a negative patientcareoutcome or where the occasional plane crash was never described as a failureto maintain ground clearance            The one area of modern life where I wish Plain Languagewould make more of a mark is the ScrippsHoward National Spelling Bee Over theyears the words dispensed to the young competitors seem to have become moreand more obscureto the point where the contest lies largely beyond the reachof amateur enthusiasts and is accessible only to a specialized class
