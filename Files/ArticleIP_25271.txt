                                  Fortune and Mens Eyeballs            Bill Gross a PasadenaCalif businessman has a great moneymaking idea His firm FreePCcom willship you a free megahertz Compaq computer Hell also give you freeInternet access and a free maintenance contract In return all he wants is twolittle things Your soul and a pound of flesh No just your eyeballs and a bitof demographic information Eyeballs is Webspeak for the number of people whosee a Web pageand presumably any ad that is on it If a Web page is servedto  computers that counts as  eyeballs although literally itsmore like  assuming two eyeballs per person            Gross company willplace ads on a small portion of the screen as you use your free computer Andwith the information you give him about your income tastes and so on he willbe able to sell you to advertisers whose products and pitches are aimed at yoursort of person The more an advertiser knows about you the more it is willingto pay to reach you On the Internet such information is even more usefulbecause its easier to finetune who sees an ad The ad you see at the top ofthis page may be different from the one your neighbor sees when she visits thissame article Bill Gross can send each of his free computer owners ads forprecisely what he or she is most likely to buy In this way Gross hopes to makeback his costs and then some            Of course Gross is not the only one with this idea TheWeb is full of sites that give away valuable stuff free in the hope of makingit back in advertising                   Slate                notoriously for starters Andthis practice is not unknown in other media either Television programming isstill mostly free to the user And even newspapers and traditional magazinesdont begin to cover their costs from what readers pay Those readers areheavily subsidized by advertisers hoping to sell them stuff Whats notableabout the Web is the profusion of free offerings that go way beyond mereeditorial content filling in the space between ads Theres an online storecalled Onsale atCost selling computer equipment at the true wholesale priceOnsale atCost may be the only store in the world to hire PricewaterhouseCoopersto document that it is not going to make a profit CBSs SportsLinecomactually pays you to get sports scores from their site The site counts thenumber of times you visit SportsLine and frequent users are given Tshirts andsunglasses Each time you visit you are even entered in  million prizesweepstakes And AllAdvantagecom promises to pay you up to  per month fordownloading an application that displays ads in the corner of your screenItll pay you even more if you can convince your friends to sign up aswell            eFaxcom will give you afree fax number and allow you to receive faxes by emailfree Everyone wantsto give you free email Free personal address books and calendars freemapping services free personalized news and weatherall are available inexchange for your eyeballs and a bit of information about yourself eitherasked for explicitly or gleaned from what you reveal in using the freeservice            Which raises the question How much can your eyeballspossibly be worth Suppose I could insidiously find out enough about you toinfluence every purchasing decision you make Suppose I could promise thatevery ad I sold you would go straight to your spending reflex What could Isell that power for            Lets do some mathNewsweek says Gross pays  for the computer Add  a year for theInternet connection and the service contract and assume the computer has ausable life of two years Hes paying  per year for your attention How onearth is he going to make this back Well suppose some ChiatDay ad wizard cancreate a series of banner ads which by blinking in the corner of your screencompel you to go out and buy  worth of stuff Its hard to imagine butits not crazy But  of sales isnt good enough HewlettPackard isntgoing to pay  for your eyeballs if youre just going buy one HewlettPackard printer HewlettPackard needs  in profit  which maymean  or  printers  That is Gross must convince his advertisersthat theyll get  of profit per customer which means saysomething like  in sales  Each year Just from you And justbecause of his ads            Now consider that advertisers spend an estimated billion plugging goods and services to Americas  million households Inother words advertisers as a group think that affecting the purchasingdecisions of an entire household of average eyeballs is worth  per yearThats for all the ads you see in every medium from television to billboardsin the course of a year Bill Gross is betting that his ads alone aimed atjust one person will be worth almost half that amount Maybe he will manage tofind bigger spenders Or maybe hell be wildly more successful in affectingtheir decisions Or maybe hes nuts            His task will be easierif his  doesnt have to come out of what advertisers are already spendingbut by convincing them that its worth spending more Thats where thedemographic information comes in This is not a new concept of course JohnWanamaker who built a department store empire in  th centuryPhiladelphia once said Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted  Ionly wish I knew which half            Targeting is a solution to Wanamakers problem You candeliver Lexus ads to affluent customers pulling down more than  peryear To less fortunate customers you can deliver say Hyundai ads To get asense of how valuable targeting is to advertisers the New YorkTimes which makes you give demographic information in order to registerfor the sitecharges four cents for a banner ad thats shown to everyone andsix cents for one that is targeted In other words targeted ads are worth percent more Yahoo can tell what your interests are by the search youreentering In writing this article I entered Lexus into Yahoo and sureenough a banner ad for a Lexus popped up above my search results And when Ientered New York Times I got a banner ad for the New York Times  BothLexus and the Times pay for this service On average these targetedsearch engine ads cost  percent more than ordinary bulk ads            But is the Internet somiraculous an advertising vehicle that Gross will be able to siphon off per person from total ad spending of  per familyor persuade advertisersto spend an additional  to reach each of his customers This isnt soobvious After all targeting is not unique to the Internet A Lexus ad inCar and Driver or Fortune is pretty well targeted at affluentpeople who like fancy cars And ads on the Internet at least so far lackoomph A banner at the top of a Web page just isnt the same as a luxurioustwopage color spread            Targeting may increase what advertisers will spend pereyeball but it also reduces the number of eyeballs they have to pay forUnless Wanamaker was willing to pay double for reaching the right half of thepeople his total ad spending would go down and not up The apparent goingpremium of  percent for a targeted ad on the Internet suggests that Internetadvertising may be as likely to reduce total ad spending as to increase it            Last year advertisers spent  billion on theInternet compared with  billion spent on broadcast TV and  billion spenton cable Thats  percent of the  billion total spent on ads in all mediaThe Internet ad market is growing at two or three times the rate of any othermedium So suppose advertisers direct onefifth of their resources onto theInternet That would be a tenfold increase in the Internets share Andsuppose the total market for advertising doubled  In this highlyoptimistic scenario Internet ad spending would be  per household In otherwords Bill Gross could break evenprovided he was the only advertiser on theWeb            Eyeballs are worth money only because they areattached to wallets And the size of the wallets is a strict limit on the valueof the eyeballs So have I just argued myself out of a job by mathematicallydisproving the theory on which my paycheck is based Not at allor at least Idont think so Free magazine articles are one thing free computers areanother Exchanging stuff for eyeballs makes sense as long as the cost ofproviding the stuff is less than the value of the eyeballs to advertisers Whatit has cost                   Slate                to provide this article by me can be the basisfor a very profitable adbased business Take my word for it
