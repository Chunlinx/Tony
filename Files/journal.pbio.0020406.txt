                            Penguins have been receiving a lot of bad press lately They are considered somehow        counter spare strange Unlike most plant and animal groups they do not show a peak of        species richness towards the equator and a decline towards the poles This more        conventional spatial pattern is conveniently known as the latitudinal diversity gradient        because of the strong covariance of richness and other measures of biodiversity that it        describes It is one of the most venerable welldocumented and controversial largescale        patterns in macroecology Willig et al  Equatorial peaks in species richness have        characterised the planet since the Devonian  million years ago Crame  and        are typical of a wide range of both terrestrial and marine plants and animals Gaston         Willig et al  Despite the fact that this pattern has been documented since the late        s sustained interest in both the regularity of the pattern and its likely underlying        mechanisms is relatively modern The realisation that human activity is posing substantial        threats to biodiversity has quickened the pace of this interest Willig et al  Where        the peaks in richness lie biodiversity hotspots how these peaks relate to centres of        endemism areas that support large numbers of species that occur nowhere else and how        these patterns are likely to change through time especially in the face of major        environmental change are major concerns Without such knowledge conservation is unlikely        to succeed        Although spatial patterns in biodiversity and particularly the latitudinal gradient        are increasingly well documented for a range of taxa the proposed mechanisms underlying        these gradients remain controversial In essence the multitude of mechanisms proposed to        explain diversity gradients can be reduced to three categories historical ecological or        null Most significant in raising the temperature of recent discussions is the question of        the relative importance of each of these major categories Historical mechanisms are those        that suggest that earth history eg the opening of the Drake Passage and the cooling of        Antarctica and phylogenetic history have played major roles in generating current patterns        in diversity and tend to emphasise regional and especially longitudinal differences        therein Qian and Ricklefs  Ricklefs  Explanations involving ecological        mechanisms often downplay the significance of such regional differences and give most        attention to covariation between current diversity and variables such as energy and water        availability and to the ultimate mechanisms underlying this covariation Hawkins et al         Currie and Francis  By contrast null models and specifically the geometric        constraints model argue that the expected pattern of latitudinal variation in richness is        not a uniform one but rather a middomain peak which is almost inevitably the outcome of        the random placement of a set of variable species ranges within a bounded domain Colwell        et al  but see also Zapata et al  It is deviation from the middomain        expectation that is then argued to be of most interest In many cases the historical and        ecological mechanisms might be difficult to disentangle such as the historical effects of        the establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its consequences for energy        availability in the region today Clarke         Nonetheless juxtaposing these three major mechanisms raises several questions that        could substantially inform the debate in many ways but have enjoyed far less attention        than debating the relative merits of each of them The geometric constraints model suggests        that to the extent that there is symmetry in the continuity of land or water about the        equator declines in richness from the tropical peak should also be symmetrical with any        asymmetries in the latter matching those in the former Indeed most texts and reviews        dealing with latitudinal diversity gradients only briefly mention hemisphererelated        differences and focus instead on the general decline of diversity away from the tropics in        both directions eg Brown and Lomolino  Willig et al  However that        diversity gradients in the two hemispheres might in many cases be highly asymmetric has        long been appreciated Gaston  Although several historical hypotheses suggest reasons        why this asymmetry should exist reviewed in Brown and Lomolino  differences in        present ecological factors such as temperature gradients and rainfall variation might        also explain such asymmetry If ecological factors are important then these asymmetries        should show up not only in diversity patterns but also at other levels in the ecological        and genealogical hierarchies From the perspective of ecological explanations for such        spatial variation the questions then are how common and strong are such asymmetries how        common are they in patterns of diversity and what if any might be the ecological rather        than null or historical mechanisms responsible for them                    Continents and Climates        The last  million years have seen both a substantial steepening in latitudinal        diversity gradients and the fragmentation of continental land masses Crame  By         million years ago the continents had largely assumed their current positions and a        latitudinal temperature gradient very similar to the present one had been established        Today  of all land is in the northern hemisphere and between latitudes  and         north the ratio of water to land is about  whereas between  and  south it is        approximately  The continentality of the north and oceanicity of the south have        considerable effects on the climates of the hemispheres as has long been appreciated        Bonan  Although there is obviously much local and mesoscale variation terrestrial        temperatures in the south excluding Antarctica are usually warmer and much less extreme        in terms of their absolute range than those in the north Figure A especially over the        winter months Southern sites between  and  typically have mean July temperatures        between  and  C whereas at similar latitudes in the north mean January temperatures        vary from  to  C In winter the smaller range of variation in the south is around a        physically and biologically significant threshold the freezing point of water In the        north winter temperatures are more variable but generally well below this point Ocean        water temperatures are much less variable than those on land although variability in the        ocean surrounding Antarctica is much reduced compared with that of the Arctic Figure        B        Mean annual precipitation is spatially more complex Overall precipitation is slightly        higher in the south than in the north at least below  latitude However much of this        precipitation falls over the ocean in the south leaving the more temperate parts of the        southern continents as dry as their northern counterparts Bonan  Spatial patterns in        rainfall variability are also complex but variability tends to be higher and        predictability lower in southern areas From a biological perspective the significant        factor is not necessarily just the magnitude of the variance but also the mean about which        it occurs Guernier et al         Clearly the spatial complexity of climatic variation is much greater than the present        overview would suggest However these broad brush strokes capture the hemisphererelated        variation that might be most significant from a biological perspective                    Ecological Consequences        If differences in climates do cascade upwards to influence individuals species and        broader scale patterns in diversity their influence should be readily detectable at the        level of species life histories and distributions In birds largescale geographic        variation in life history variables such as the incidence of cooperative breeding extent        of parental care survival and the timing of reproduction has been studied for at least        the past  years and the mechanisms underlying this variation have been much debated        Taking phylogeny and the idiosyncrasies of the Australian avifauna into account southern        species typically lay small clutches and have long fledging periods and it is often        difficult to predict their date of first laying or indeed whether they will lay in a        particular year at all Covas et al  Russell et al  By contrast northern        species lay larger clutches and have shorter fledging periods and laying date is more        readily predicted making investigations of phenological shifts associated with modern        climatic change more straightforward eg Crick et al         These kinds of differences extend to other taxa Thus although the variation of        metabolic rate with latitude is becoming increasingly well known for a variety of groups        Lovegrove  has recently suggested based on comparative work taking both species body        mass and phylogeny into account that unpredictability of resources associated with        considerable interannual unpredictability in rainfall in turn partly a consequence of El        Nioassociated variability has been responsible for the evolution of generally low        metabolic rates in terrestrial mammals of most of the southern continents Although El Nio        effects are by no means restricted to these regions it is perhaps low resource        availability to start off with associated with considerable unpredictability that is of        most significance see also Guernier et al         Insect life histories also show hemisphererelated variation Lowtemperaturerelated        diapause is virtually absent in southern species eg Convey  and metabolic        ratetemperature relationships are much shallower in the south than the north AddoBediako        et al  The latter is a consequence of relatively cool growing seasons and lack of        pronounced seasonality in the south However the clearest example of a hemispheric        asymmetry is that of cold hardiness strategies Sinclair et al  Insects can survive        subzero temperatures either by tolerating internal ice formation or by reducing their        freezing points to avoid ice formation altogether Although there is further variation        within each of these strategies in general freezeavoiding species need to undergo        substantial preparation for winter cold and consequently can take some time to emerge from        the cold hardy state This also seems to be true of strongly freezetolerant species that        can survive freezing far below the point at which they actually freeze By contrast        moderately freezetolerant speciesthose that can survive only a few degrees of        freezingappear to need little preparation for a freezing event and seem perfectly prepared        to continue with their routine activities immediately after thawing In northern cold        climate areas with the exception of the Arctic where extremely low temperatures constrain        insects to being strongly freeze tolerant most cold hardy species avoid freezing whereas        in the south most are moderately freeze tolerant Figure  Microclimates reveal why this        is the case As might be expected from macroclimatic variation southern temperate insects        are faced with regular freezethaw cycles ie variation about  C including        pronounced summer cold snaps whereas the continental climates of many areas in the north        mean that once temperatures decline below freezing for winter they stay below this        threshold        Northsouth asymmetries also show up in snowlines treelines the frost tolerance of        trees and the proportion of winter deciduous species Woodward  Krner  Krner        and Paulsen  Indeed such differences have long been appreciated for vegetation In        marine systems one of the bestknown asymmetries is the low upper thermal limit to        performance and survival in Antarctic compared with Arctic ectotherms This difference in        limits to survival and performance is characteristic of fish invertebrates and macroalgae        eg Wiencke et al  Figure  Asymmetries are also apparent in the geographic        ranges of a wide variety of animals and plants Rapoports rule proposes that species        ranges will be larger at high than at low latitudes Stevens  The pattern is thought        to be a consequence of considerably greater temporal climatic and especially temperature        variation at high latitudes and the resulting need for broader physiological tolerances of        individuals These broad tolerances enable the species to which these individuals belong to        occur across a wider range of sites than species at lower latitudes However if there is        much less temporal temperature variation in the south than in the north evidence for the        rule should be less forthcoming in the southern hemisphere This is indeed the case        Consistent increases in latitudinal extents with latitude are uncommon in the south and        Rapoports rule is now largely considered to be a northern phenomenon Gaston et al                            LargeScale Asymmetries in Biodiversity        In the years since Platnick  suggested that the world is pearshaped from a        biodiversity perspective with more rapid declines in richness from the equator in the        northern than in the southern hemisphere evidence that there are largescale asymmetries        in the latitudinal diversity gradient has been accumulating Seed plant and mammalian        family richness per unit area declines more steeply in the northern hemisphere than in the        south Woodward  Gaston et al  and similar asymmetries mostly at the species        level have been noted for other groups such as New World birds several groups of insects        spiders foraminiferans and a variety of benthic marine taxa Platnick  Rex et al         Eggleton  Blackburn and Gaston  Culver and Buzas  Rodriguero and Gorla         Nonetheless not all groups show these trends and a recent metaanalysis albeit        one on a relatively coarse scale failed to find consistent northsouth differences in        latitudinal gradients Hillebrand  Recent reviews particularly of marine diversity        have pointed out the difficulty of making comparisons of this kind owing to sampling        constraints Clarke and Johnston  However it remains remarkable that even simple        exercisessuch as plotting richness values for different latitudes or latitudinal bands        against each other for the hemispheres and examining the resulting relationship or        overlaying them on the same range of latitudesrarely appear in the literature Thus it is        not yet clear how common or strong hemisphererelated asymmetry is        By contrast it appears that proximate ecological correlates of diversity gradients        differ considerably between north and south Although both historical and ecological        factors have led to variation in the numbers and identity of species across the globe        Ricklefs  climate and particularly energy and water availability is a strong        predictor of broadscale patterns in species richness for both plants and animals However        the extent to which energy and water availability constrain species richness varies In a        recent comparative analysis Hawkins et al  showed that water availability is the        key limiting component of richness for the southern hemisphere but for temperate regions        of the north energy availability is more important Figure  They ascribe this        difference to the warmer and less thermally variable conditions of the southern hemisphere        which as we have already noted have considerable effects on species life histories        Of course biodiversity is not just species richness but also encompasses the        ecological complexes of which species are a part Although potential northsouth        asymmetries in interactions have not been widely explored recent work is providing        tantalising glimpses of such variation Thus it appears that on the basis of a        straightforward not phylogenetically corrected comparative analysis specialisation in        plantpollinator relationships is much greater in the south than in the north European and        North American orchids are typically visited by five species of insects whereas in        southern Africa the median is a single pollinator species per species of orchid Johnson        and Steiner  Figure  Insectplant interactions might also vary in other ways        between the hemispheres as the rarity of showy autumn colours and the paucity of aphid        specieswhich are thought by some to be a driver of these displays Archetti and Brown        in south temperate areas suggests Asymmetries in patterns of human disease point to        similar hemisphererelated variation in interactions between organisms Guernier et al                            A World in Flux        Despite considerable spatial complexity there do seem to be regular northsouth        differences in species life histories and patterns of range size variation that are        consistent with disparities in the climates of the two hemispheres Figure  These        differences extend to the proximate ecological mechanisms underlying spatial variation in        species richness and in some cases apparently to ecological interactions However what        is less clear is the regularity and strength of northsouth differences in spatial        diversity patterns and especially the latitudinal gradient in diversity as well as the        ways in which abiotic variation between the hemispheres might extend through the        genealogical and ecological hierarchies to effect such differences Indeed if the extent        to which abiotic differences between the hemispheres influence biodiversity patterns is to        be better comprehended several key issues deserve attention        First both phylogenetically independent and nonindependent comparisons of life history        traits and physiological variables across a variety of groups are required Contrasting        these approaches will provide considerable insight into how much of the signal is based on        phylogenetic patterns and how much on current ecological responses Whilst in some cases        data may be obtained from the literature it is likely that new work will have to be        undertaken especially in the southern hemisphere where the number of past investigations        of such traits is generally much lower than in the north Moreover replicated studies        using similar methods might substantially improve the signaltonoise ratio which can be        weakened in macrophysiological or largescale life history and physiological comparisons        by the fact that different methods often lead to different outcomes        Second there is much to be said for the application of similar methods to        investigations of largescale hemisphererelated patterns of species interactions        Differences like those in plantpollinator systems discussed here might extend to other        interactions in marine and terrestrial systems Contrasting phylogenetically independent        and nonindependent comparisons are likely to provide much insight into the reasons for        those asymmetries that are found        Finally comparisons of latitudinal gradients and their underlying correlates in the two        hemispheres for the same taxon sampled using similar methods and investigated with        methods that take cognisance of likely confounding effects are required This approach will        provide a means of determining whether asymmetries in the climates of the two hemispheres        really do translate into differences in biodiversity patterns Such an approach goes to the        heart of the question of the processes underlying the latitudinal gradient in species        richness and could go a considerable way to teasing apart the importance of historical        ecological and null explanations and identifying the mechanisms that underlie them        In our view clarifying these issues is of considerable importance What is at stake is        not a set of arcane ecological questions but rather questions that are central to        determining whether ecological and conservation lessons learnt in one area can be applied        more broadly For example it has been suggested that climate change will cause substantial        extinctions in the near future Thomas et al  Indeed responses by species to such        change via phenological shifts and northward movement of species range margins are well        documented for northern hemisphere species Parmesan and Yohe  However if there are        substantial differences in abiotic environments such that patterns in diversity and their        responses to change differ between hemispheres then such shifts may not be of similar        consequence in the south To date southern hemisphere studies represent less than  of        the total in this field Root et al  suggesting that it is not at all clear how the        considerable biodiversity in the south will respond to future change We find such a        situation extraordinary Thus whilst penguins might at first appear counter spare and        strange they serve as a reminder that differences between the north and south might not be        so much strange as remarkable and worthy of closer attention
