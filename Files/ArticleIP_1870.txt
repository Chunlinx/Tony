                                 Slobodan Milosevic            Back when there was morethan one superpower the United States and the Soviet Union treated littledictators as playthings dolls to dress up and knock down But these days thebesieged tyrant of an ailing country can make the United States look mousyThis month Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ignored the United Stateswhen it commanded him to halt the Serbian assault on Albanians in KosovoThrowing a bone to the outraged Americans Milosevic repeated his meaninglesspromise to consider negotiating with moderate Albanians Meanwhile he courtedRussias support for his escapades raising the specter of a Cold Warstylestandoff            Time andagain Milosevic has played the United States for a patsy His pattern Hebehaves in his most Hitlerian way then promises to improve and weasels awayunscathed By some American accounts he even emerges as a hero He isapplauded for helping to cobble together the Dayton Peace Accords that endedthe Bosnian War In his memoir To End a War  UN ambassador nomineeRichard Holbrooke calls Milosevic intelligent and downright affable Newspaperprofiles add the requisite charming details Sure he murdered thousands ofinnocent Croats and Muslims but he loves cigarillos and insists thatjournalists join him for fancy meals and drinking bouts            The Butcher of the Balkans genius is his chillypragmatism He has a sensitive political ear If he needs to compromise hecompromises At the end of  for example thousands of students took to thestreet calling for his resignation Instead of rolling out the tanks Miloseviccaved in to all their demandsshort of handing them his own head Soon afterhis concessions the movement splintered Later he retracted most of hisconcessions Machiavelli or Trotsky could not have scripted it better For aquick backgrounder on Milosevics cynical orchestration of the Bosnian Warclick             Milosevicapplies this same savvy to his diplomatic dealings Unbelievably he hasconvinced officials in Foggy Bottom that hes indispensable to Balkan peace andstability The reason The alternatives to Milosevic are considered even moremonstrous This is a perception that he created himself Quietly he bolstershis most radical opponents giving them air time to grandstand on stateruntelevision He carefully calculated the rise of Vojislav Seselj who calls forthe ethnic cleansing of Serbia and has written tomes paying homage tomilitarism and fascism Despite Milosevics genocidal record he does appear tobe tame in comparisonthe housebroken Hitler            How did Milosevic come by this cold pragmatismHe is a product of the hellish postStalinist bureaucracy a place wherebetrayal was a much better career strategy than principle His rise to power isa tale of backstabbing and machinations An ambitious law student Milosevichitched his star to the rapidly advancing career of his older schoolmate IvanStambolic Milosevic served as Stambolics righthand man as the latter rose totop positions in the state energy corporation the state bank and theCommunist Party Milosevic seemed destined to die a hatchet man            Then in he got lucky Stambolic sent Milosevic as his proxy to a party meeting inKosovo where Serbs were grouching about their oppression by the Albanianmajority It was a standard apparatchik affair ending with a predictableaffirmation of the old Titoist line that the party must crush nascent Serbnationalism But departing from the meeting Milosevic encountered a crowd ofSerbs who were being restrained by police and filmed by live televisioncameras As the camera turned to Milosevic he hesitated bumbled and thenyelled Nobody has the right to beat these people His remarks electrifiedthe crowd which spontaneously broke into the Serbian national anthem Theincident made Milosevic an overnight symbol of rising nationalist sentimentand he milked his accidental celebrity to the fullest Months after hispronouncement he ousted and replaced Stambolic as head of Serbias CommunistParty accusing him of not being supportive enough of downtrodden Serbs            Milosevic has carried the postStalinist mindset into thepostCommunist era He refuses to allow the liberalization of the Serb economyletting corrupt cronies run state monopolies and pillage the state coffersNearly every year he reorganizes his Cabinet deposing old friends and allowingno one to accumulate significant power            Milosevicdoesnt care about the trappings of power He doesnt put his name on airportsor collect seaside villas or bed women Although he has a gift for oratory heis a recluse who hates crowds Quite simply he has an apparatchiks attitudeHe will hang onto power at all costs He has a paranoid fear well notparanoid because its true that if he doesnt ruthlessly boost himself acolleague will do him in            Theres something darker at work as wellMilosevic was born in a small Montenegrin village to two schoolteachers Bothhis parents committed suicide Those who regularly deal with Milosevic say hesuffers from more than a touch of depression himself When protesters marchagainst him he grows despondent and doesnt leave his office for days It issaid that he hasnt a lick of genuine humor and rarely displays empathy UnlikeHitler whose inner circle adored him Milosevic humiliates his staff and keepsno confidants            In thepursuit of power Milosevic has run Serbia into the ground The war heinstigated provoked UN sanctions that wrecked the Serbian economy Althoughmany of the sanctions have been lifted inflation remains sky highUnemployment hovers near  percent And the countrys manufacturing output hasbeen reduced by half during his tenure His popularity is said to be at analltime low            To prevent any of his discontented subjects from revoltingMilosevic has reverted to the nastiest of his old apparatchik instincts In thelast year he has temporarily closed dozens of independent newspapers andtelevision stations because they griped too loudly about him He has alsoexpanded the secret police which now totals an estimated  officers Onethird of this force is said to be specially trained to quash riots Anotherthird is said to be devoted to preventing army coups            The current tumult in Kosovocompletes a circle for Milosevic He launched his career there and it seemsfitting that he return His Serb army and police seem to be doing their best toprovoke war This week Serb soldiers murdered  people trying to cross theAlbanian border If war does erupt it may not be contained as it was inBosnia Albania Macedonia Greece Turkey and even Russia could be drawn intothe conflict How much of the world would Milosevic sacrifice for the sake ofhis power As much as it takes                           If youmissed the sidebar on Milosevics role in the Bosnian war click
