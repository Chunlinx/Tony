                            The study of genetic material from ancient specimens was in its early years dominated        by a race to sequence DNA from extinct species like the dodo and the woolly mammoth Now        that the supply of these crowdpleasing curiosities has run dry scientists are starting to        ask new questions of ancient DNA aDNA that are revealing how the genetic makeup of        prehistoric populations changed through time These findings look set to trounce        assumptions about how evolution really unfolded However there is still concern that many        studies are not paying enough attention to the exacting protocols needed to overcome the        technical challenges of the discipline and to defend it from the ridicule that has plagued        it in the past        In  while         Jurassic Park was still taking in millions of dollars at the box office        scientists claimed to have extracted and sequenced DNA from an millionyearold dinosaur         When sceptical researchers took a look at the sequence it turned out to be of human        rather than dinosaur origin To make that mistake youd have to try really really hard        says Alan Cooper head of the Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre at Oxford        University in the United Kingdom If you think youve sequenced some dinosaur DNA the        first thing youd do is run a phylogenetic analysis on it he says Had they done that        properly with any mammal at all involved in the treethey would have found that their        sequence was grouping with the mammals and not with the reptiles or the birds says        Cooper Perhaps theyd watched Michael Crichtons inventive fiction one too many times he        suggests                    Setting the Standards        It was this kind of bungling study that highlighted the need for an exacting protocol        that would steer researchers around the significant pitfalls posed by DNA decay and        contamination A list of authenticity criteria emerged during the s aimed at        preventing similarly bogus claims from entering the literature  This list includes        stringent laboratory controls cloning of products amplified by polymerase chain reaction        PCR replication of results from a second independent extract and for really new or        unexpected results replication of results by an independent research group        Such requirements have allowed work on aDNA to move on and mature Now its possible to        focus on the really interesting questions that aDNA can answer What were able to do with        ancient DNA is really look at evolution says Cooper The fossil record can only hint at        how evolution unfolded It just shows you theres a bear and then theres not a bear he        says It doesnt show you where it came from or what the relationship between the groups        is By contrast aDNA can do just that giving researchers a window onto the population        genetics of the past and revealing how evolution really played out And the signs are that        descriptions of the evolutionary process based on the fossil record and modernday gene        pools are far too simple The modern data is clearly misleading us says Cooper        Evolution is much much more complex and dynamic than we would hope                    Thinking Big        Because of the decay that occurs with time there is a limit to how far back aDNA can        gaze Box  Your ideal preservation conditions are something that falls under ice        freezes instantly and stays frozen until you get it says Cooper As soon as we get up        to  million years ago we cant get anything to work and thats even under deepfrozen        conditions But within the past  years there are several major evolutionary events        that are worth studyingincluding a glacial maximum around  years ago the invasion        of the New World by humans about  years ago and a global mass extinction about         years ago These relatively recent events should be a good model for working out how        similar events affected genetic diversity throughout evolutionary history        Coopers latest work has analysed DNA from over  bison fossils from Beringiathe        frozen wastes between eastern Siberia and the Canadian Northwest Territories  What        weve done is carbondate a shitload of bison and get DNA out of them Its the largest        aDNA study to date he says Figure  The icy conditions mean that good quality        mitochondrial DNA could be extracted from most of the specimens The bison could also be        dated accurately This allowed Cooper and his colleagues to trace the changes in the bison        genetic diversity from  years ago to the present It was even possible to predict        the effective population size throughout this period of bison evolution Our analyses        depict a large diverse population living throughout Beringia until around  years        before the present when the populations genetic diversity began to decline dramatically        they note        This finding challenges some common assumptions It has been argued that modern bison        are descended from Beringian bison but Coopers data suggest otherwise All modern bison        belong to a clade distinct from Beringian bison he and his colleagues report        Furthermore the dramatic decline in the numbers of bison occurs long before humans arrive        on the scene scuppering the idea that hunting pressure was primarily responsible for the        demise of the bison As the glacial maximum approached  years ago the cooler dryer        conditions were probably responsible for the downturn in the bison population argues        Cooper Climate change is giving the animals an absolute whacking he concludes        A similar analysis of brown bear DNA excavated from permafrost and cave deposits in the        Arctic is also challenging conventional evolutionary wisdom  Being able to get both a        radiocarbon date and some DNA from a specimen pins a particular genetic sequence to a        particular moment in time These data suggest that genetically and geographically distinct        groups of bear have replaced each other relatively often during the last  years        Regional extinctions and replacements seem to be tied to climate change and competition        with the much larger shortfaced bears the authors argue Figure         Recent analysis of aDNA from Haasts eagle has also thrown up a surprising result This        New Zealand giant had a wingspan of up to three metres and a weight of around  kilograms        says Michael Bunce an anthropologist at MacMaster University in Ontario Canada Analysis        of aDNA from yearold specimens indicates that this extinct creature is closely        related to the little eagle from Australia and New Guinea which typically weighs less than        one kilogram The common ancestor of these two eagles lived as recently as  million years        ago he and his colleagues estimate  It means an eagle arrived in New Zealand and        increased in weight by  times over this period says Bunce Such rapid size change        is unprecedented in terrestrial vertebrates        In addition to illuminating these natural events the study of aDNA can also show        changes in the frequency of key genes that occurred during the domestication of crops and        animals For example aDNA from samples of early maize reveals when certain desirable        traits appeared  Its the first study of ancient DNA that looks at phenotype says        Svante Pbo an evolutionary anthropologist at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig        Germany One can actually look at specific genes that early humans selected during        domestication of an important crop Pbos analysis suggests that the alleles typical of        contemporary maize were already present in Mexican maize  years ago so just a couple        of thousand years after its initial domestication from the wild grass teosinte Figure         Quite early on properties were selected that were not only the structure of the plant but        also the biochemistry he says        aDNA is also being used to decipher human origins Mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthals        looks quite different from the mitochondrial DNA of early modern humans  This lends        support to the hypothesis that modern humans have a single African origin rather than the        alternative hypothesis of multiregional evolution where the ancestors of modern humans        bred with Neanderthals aDNA could also in principle be used to shed light on the        evolutionary position of the yearold hobbit recently unearthed on the Indonesian        island of Flores  Both Cooper and Pbo have offered to have a go at isolating DNA from        the hominid skeleton but the early signs are that DNA has not survived The somewhat        moist and tropical preservation conditions make the recovery of DNA improbable says Peter        Brown the paleoanthropologist at the University of New England in Armidale Australia who        led the hobbit study Efforts to extract DNA from other bones collected at the same site as        this tiny hominid have not produced results We have made attempts with Stegodon molars        he says but so far without success                    Ongoing Controversy        However in spite of the authenticity criteria and this transition towards testing the        big questions in evolutionary biology aDNA research continues to invite controversy In         a team of United States researchers claimed to have cultured a bacterium sealed        inside a millionyearold salt crystal  For Cooper this is the sort of study that        should require replication by an independent laboratory before publication When we        repeated that work with the same primers we were pulling up halobacteria from everywhere        he says We took some dust from the top of the natural history museum in Oxford extracted        DNA used their supposedly halospecific primers and extracted a whole bunch of sequences        including some that fell within their diversity This strongly suggests says Cooper that        the bacterium that was cultured was a modern bacterium rather than an ancient specimen I        cant see any logic for having  million years without any evolution        But Russell Vreeland a microbiologist at West Chester University in Pennsylvania and        first author of the saltcrystal study is adamant that his methods were exacting The        probability of having a contaminant in our sample was one chance in a billion he        calculates If you use a BandAid today on your skin or your children you are  times        more likely to have an infection from that BandAid than I am to have a contaminant Its        completely unscientific to argue that the cultured bacterium was a result of contamination        simply because it resembles modern bacteria says Vreeland Thats throwing out the baby        with the bathwater If you can show that nothing has penetrated your sample and the DNA is        inside then the age of the DNA has to be equal to the age of that rock he says I think        you can make your criteria so stringent that you miss reality        Others are alert to this danger Sticking rigidly to the authenticity criteria can be a        problem argues Tom Gilbert of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the        University of Arizona The criteria can both hinder the publication of good studies that        do not adhere to all the criteria and also enable the publication of erroneous results        that adhere strictly to them he says Part of the problem is that many referees of aDNA        papers do not have a background working with aDNA so are inclined to use the authenticity        criteria as a checklist rather than critically evaluating each bit of research on a        casebycase basis For example he says a recent highprofile study that followed all the        criteria found that aDNA from two CroMagnontype humans was very similar to DNA from        modern humans  But this could just mean that the specimens were contaminated by modern        humans As no information was provided on the samples handling history says Gilbert        it becomes impossible for a reader to decide whether the sequences are authentic or        contaminant Box  Such papers will continue to appear as long as the authenticity        criteria are used by authors and referees as a checklist he says This does not mean the        criteria should be relaxed he adds but they should be used in a more intelligent way        But allowing authors the freedom to use the criteria as they see fit could come at a        cost says Cooper The trouble with a casebycase basis is that it basically equates to        no standards because then people will do what they feel like doing and were back to the        s again he says                    Agreement        This ongoing disagreement over how aDNA studies should be judged does however stem        from a common concern As more and more biologists come to appreciate the unique ability of        aDNA to probe the evolutionary process it is more important than ever to stress the        immense challenges of working with just a few fragments of degraded DNA that might have        come from several different sources It is obvious why an archaeology lab might want to set        up its own aDNA facility But this is like creating molecular biologists without a license        says Pbo You wouldnt buy an accelerator and say I will now start doing my own carbon        dating he says You have to really have experience working with low copy number        However in spite of the continual problem of eager but inexperienced biologists trying        to extract DNA from specimens in the university museum there is a sense that aDNA is        starting to fill in the gaps in our understanding of key moments in evolutionary history        So at the start of  as aDNA research enters its st year the discipline is perhaps        coming of age
