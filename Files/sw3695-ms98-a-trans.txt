        uh   me think a political event that happened this year   yeah i   well theres David Duke   yeah   and then theres the dissolution of the Soviet Union   yeah       those two pretty much take care of everything   yeah     so what do you think about David Duke   well  if i was a mind to i might burn a cross on his yard   yeah   thing that what scares me is some of the things he says i agree with   yeah   you know i just dont agree with his methods   thats true i   you know i think that the way to you know cut out the welfare poor is not to cut out welfare its to provide an equal opportunity for people to make a living       uhhuh definitely i agree with that   and protect them from themselves   umhum   basically you know ive ive seen this very close hand a kid twelve years old can make about three thousand dollars a day dealing crack   yeah   if he lives to his twenty first birthday it would be a miracle   umhum   so were we as a nation have an obligation to our future generations to   provide them some other avenue or   yeah to make dealing crack a a crime punishable in such a way that nobody would want to do that and and it our constitution expressly forbids that kind of punishment   uhhuh yeah its like i say what kind of you know what kind of punishment thats three thousand dollars a day thats thatd take some kind of punishment to deter deter deter it   yeah i im considering doing it you know and i got a job today anyway   yeah definitely i mean yeah surely i uh i uh i havent listened to a lot of his views i just you know the thing about that i kind of concerned me is how they the people now want to keep him off the presidential ballots and stuff   well   and ive kind of wondered you know really if thats right or   right or wrong rarely has anything to do with politics   yeah thats true   uh what im seeing here is that the real problem see David Duke addresses symptoms   umhum hes getting to some some serious issues   the real problem is if i work for a man say i work for a guy as a matter of fact im going to work for a guy Friday new job   uhhuh   he sells Kelley tires   uhhuh   now if i roll in there a brand new set of B F Goodrich tires week after next should i expect my job to be there   yeah uh well uh see   see what im saying   yeah   you know if you drive onto the Ford manufacturing lot in a Datsun   yeah   i believe that not only should you be fired you all of your assets should be given over to the government   why is that   because youre crippling the very economy with which youre trying to survive in   oh thats true thats true   now i believe in free choice dont get me wrong   yeah uhhuh   and im i figure im allowed to drive any kind of car i want because i dont work for a car company   yeah   i drive American made   uhhuh   thats just because im an American i believe that thats the way you ought to do it   uhhuh   i mean sure having a Mazda or a Nissan or whatever theyre called these days sure thatd be a real status symbol but you aint gonna impress my neighbors   yeah   you know my neighbors driving a thirty year old pick up truck       you know   well i think you got a point too i can see we do a lot of complaining but you dont see a lot of us you know a lot of people willing to buy the American stuff theyre like you say theyre all out for that status symbol and   you know sure yeah now the last time i bought a calculator i bought one from Texas Instruments   umhum   because my wife works at Texas Instruments and uh the next time i buy a computer it will be a Texas Instruments   yeah well that makes that makes good sense like i say if we i think were the of the opinion now that uh somebodys got to support the economy but its not necessarily going to be the American public they want somebody else to do it because were not willing you know were under the impression that somebody else makes a better product or little snazzier or something but   they they do make better products the scary thing is we finance their research   exactly thats true   you know the T I came out with the with the transistor they didnt make beans off of it     yeah umhum yeah we just did the core research and then they put it into some consumer product and make all the money off it yeah   you know right exactly you know i i have a real fundamental problem       with people who drive a Mercedes and have a Sony TV and scream and holler about the welfare poor i really have a problem with those guys   umhum yeah yeah because theyre not doing anything themselves to really help   theyre exagerrating exagerrating as a matter of fact theyre exagerrating exagerrating exagerrating whats it exacerbating the problem   yeah   theyre making it worse   i can see i can see i i see what youre saying   i used to work for a guy this summer he drove BMW i i quit him   oh really   i say hey you know   what uh was it in the tire business again or   no it was in construction   oh   um i i i see i am a dealer for construction software   oh uhhuh   i had worked for this company as as an employee
