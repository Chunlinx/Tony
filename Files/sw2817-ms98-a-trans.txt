          okay Amy uh what do you think about taking care of the elderly   well i certainly um can appreciate the patience and the you know energy and money and time and effort it require would require for someone to you know take care of their elderly parent or whatever in their home   uhhuh   uh i think that you know would definitely be preferable if the person is you know able able to do that i think sometimes people take on i know i have one friend who is taken on more than she can handle you know with her her mom just needing constant supervision and for one person to be able to cope with that you know is really difficult but i know its hard not to feel guilty you know to put somebody in a nursing home i if i suppose if you could find a nursing home that you thought really comfortable you know that they were getting adequate care but i think thats probably pretty hard to do at times   uhhuh uhhuh   ive not ever been put put in this position i personally would have a real hard time taking care of my father       hes getting up there but hes very difficult to live with and i think that would be a real consideration in in um entering him into our family unit here you know   yeah   so theres a lot of factors involved   what is the point at which you would go from home care to institutional care   well i think i would in some ways have to decide how much personally you know i was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect you know the rest of my family because i have two small children   uhhuh   and um we dont have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldnt have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person   uhhuh   i think you know just the medical aspects too would be a big question how much um it would require you know in terms of nursing care at home and i know that there is uh often times insurance companies wont even pay you know and if they took families for doing things if if they were in a nursing home would cost you know a hundred times more so thats   uhhuh   thats a consideration too but i dont know it it would be a really rough choice to make you depending on the parent their personality and your own family and whats going on with im home all day anyway with the young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but   uhhuh   um the only people ive seen is my husbands grandmother has been in a nursing home for several years i know that uh theres been a lot of questions from other family members as to whether shes getting enough attention and whether they just kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while it its really tragic to go in those places   yeah what would you what would you look for in an institution   so  i dont know um i think i would uh look for a place that definitely had the physical attributes and it wasnt a sterile kind of environment but had a comfortable feeling to it that respected uh   uhhuh   that you seem to see some respect for peoples privacy and the attitude that the staff would have towards the patients and i was visiting a friend in the hospital and there was a nurse screaming at an older man who was there was a head injury unit and he had apparently       wet his pants and they had a blanket draped over him and the blanket had either fallen to the floor or he had dropped it on the floor and the nurse was just screaming at him about how obscene that was or something and i just thought gosh if i walked into a place and i saw a staff member just berating or humiliating humiliating a patient i would definitely that would be something id really want to be on the look out for um   yeah   i would hope they would have uh some you consistent staff i know they dont pay that much in a lot of those places and so theres probably a lot of turnover that would be another thing that would be you know something to be important because i think its confusing particularly if people are in some state of you know mental confusion anyway to have constant new people on staff and having to develop new relationships and   uhhuh   oh i dont know what else other than that maybe some place had activities you know that they could participate in instead of just kind of sitting there watching the wall or something you know talking to other people who had family members there see how responsive the staff was to     right   the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member it it would really be hard because when we go to visit im sure places have you know their best foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of whats going on behind the scenes it would really be hard to know its kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids   yeah uhhuh   you know so uh im sure that if you have enough money you can find just super care but you know the cost of this probably just horrendous   right would you consider a transitional institution such as one that allows the resident sort of like an apartment complex for elderly people   yeah i think that would be great i i had wished often um with my husbands grandmother that she had been in a place like that because she had lived alone in an upper story of an apartment building away from even friends not really close by her or a grocery store or anything and i thought she could have lived a a lot longer if she had been in a place where she didnt have to climb up and down the stairs haul groceries and then she would have people to check on her and didnt have to cook because she just got to a point where she wouldnt cook just for herself and then she fell down and nobody knew about it for hours and hours and hours and   uhhuh   so i think that would be great if if you know if i had to choose a place for myself thats definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time and you know it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that   yeah   yeah   thats uh you know i hope if my my mother ever gets to the point where she cant take care of the home herself that she would consider uh the apartment type   umhum yeah   setting you know from what ive seen with my grandmother grandmother who passed i dont know maybe ten or twelve years ago they had her in a setting like that where she was responsible to go to they had dinner in the cafeteria and she had her own little room it wasnt like she didnt have a stove or anything in her own apartment   yeah they had their own privacy yeah   yeah but you know she could walk to walk to the dinner hall and had games and stuff so it was sort of like a step between a   umhum   nursing home and a uh you know just a retirement village or whatever theyre called those so i guess theres different levels you just have to be sure and match your loved one with that   right yeah yeah i dont know you know how many of those there are but i definitely think its a great idea to have that kind of thing you know for people i know that um in that way too that sometimes the elderly can be more involved with their families they can have their grandkids and that kind of thing over to spend the night or theres a lot more freedom i think   uhhuh   instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and told where youre going to be and what youre going to do in a nursing home   yeah its shell become uh   so   you know a bigger issue as you know the medical profession continues to you know increase longevity   yeah yeah   were going to see you know geriatrics will be a a big part of the medical profession i think   yeah yeah   so   lets hope its true   its a lot to consider   it is ive ive had had a lot of uh thought thought provoking conversations on  the topics  yeah   yeah yeah i i guess im a big advocate of um decreased morbidity which is where the elderly person through i dont know a healthier lifestyle and exercise and eating right can   umhum   uh you know sustain them for longer periods of time   right right well as the insurance companies get more into this preventative health care i think that will help it just seems very slow that that happening but uh yeah i definitely think that will help   right yeah hopefully uh yeah the insurance companies will see the advantage of signing up a sixty year old for a uh you know exercise class or   yeah yeah   well uh its been fun talking with you   okay well take care thank you byebye   all right bye
