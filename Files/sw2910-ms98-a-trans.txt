              i think i get most of my news uh in headlines from the radio and then i follow up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention   well i i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion i i im from New York originally and now that i live in Florida i live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime   umhum   and i i feel that the the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the New York Times ive always read the New York Times when i was younger and i try to find now that it has a national edition i read that i also read uh         i i i guess i do watch uh McNeil Lehrer on P B S because i i lean to that coverage and and ive guess im   uhhuh i like them but they take so long i dont always have time   yeah well yeah thats a whole hour show actually its an hour show each evening and and uh we we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up     uhhuh   i find that im leaning on uh i travel a great deal uh even overseas and i find that i lean on uh C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and im im i im quite satisfied with the way they put it out i mean i i dont believe everything they say but its its coverage you know   yeah i think C N N does a pretty good job i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad until the Gulf War   yeah yeah   and they seemed to have the best coverage they had more information sooner than most of the other networks   uh well yeah i i i uh Peter Arnett was reporting direct from uh Iraq i think this is scandalous the way everybodys picking on him i i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didnt like it that was just too bad you know   yeah yeah well uh i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted but i think they said that frequently enough that  you shouldnt criticize the man for giving us one perspective uh   yeah oh yeah i mean i no that thats right i think so and and i guess if it comes to um to magazines i dont read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to Time and U S News and World Report i i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or i i i also subscribe to something called World Press which is uh a magazine that only talks about other uh excerpts from the world press which sort of gives you a different slant than its not   umhum   as slanted as the New York Times or as biased perhaps as a local paper   yeah   but uh that i guess and the radio uh i listen to P B S radio a lot and i also listen to uh these twenty four hour news stations when im driving i   yeah we have a C B S twenty four hour station that i listen to on the way to and from work and   yeah do you read uh are you from southern or northern California   northern im from uh the peninsula Palo Alto   so so well yeah is that what is that the San Francisco paper out there is uh the major paper   well its horrible The San Francisco paper is just wretched   yeah thats a terrible paper     so i subscribe to the San Jose Mercury News um uh Palo Alto is about midway between well its a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper and   is that pretty good oh the what is that the Chronicle isnt it   yeah theres the Chronicle and the Examiner but theyre uh both run by the same people   oh oh yeah they just they really are probably the worse papers ive ever read i   theyre just horrid so we read the   yeah well can you get the L A paper up there thats a pretty decent paper isnt it or   uh we can but i dont like it so we subscribe to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the Mercury News   yeah yeah yeah well thats another one i read i forgot that i read the Wall Street Journal not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but   yes well again i read that uh  two columns on the front     yeah uh i think i i agree with you that the problem seems to be they dont have enough time to do all the stuff i feel pretty well versed in in what im doing because i i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or   umhum   although i watch that i spend a lot of time reading about these things im quite interested i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today   yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage i dont feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the uh the news coverage   the if anything they i think they listen   we almost have too much   well i dont know i i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the Dan Rathers of the world and and listening and taking their word for it or their comment actually they i think they slant things but   well i cannot stand Dan Rather i remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston and i hated him then     no kidding oh well i didnt know that yeah   and i would not watch that man for money and  he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach so   yeah yeah was was  he   uh i watch Peter Jennings and uh and Tom Brokaw sort of alternate   yeah well how do you feel about it i guess i i got to say if thats the subject if the subject is do i feel that were well enough equipped to i dont know if if it said that i feel im well enough equipped   do we get enough news or something like that do we get uh the do we get the news that we want and i do i really think   yeah to yeah yeah i think i do too i think you have to let uh you yous got to segregate some of it   yeah   well thats about all i have to say   okay well nice to talk to you bye bye   nice talking to you bye bye
