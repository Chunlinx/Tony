                 were set   okay   what changes do you feel have happened   oh i guess the first thing has been the right for the right for women to vote i think that has been a major change and also the fact that um there are so much many more women in the work force nowadays than there were and thats probably going to increase you know   right increases increases each year doesnt it   im sorry   it increases each year i think   it sure does yeah theres a lot more women in the work place nowadays   well and i think women have kind of had uh in the past the real subservient role   role right   and uh   thats changing   uh well we we still do to some degree but uh   right   uh i think its not as much as it was   yeah right yeah i i agree it   i and especially i think with women increasingly working theyre going to have to demand more from men because theres just impossible impossible to keep up on everything else   definitely has changed uhhuh yeah yeah   have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home   well you know theyve been talking about and i dont know um what the status is on it but you know women get maternity leave and stuff like that and i know that theyve theres been discussion about men also getting maternity leave   right   to help out but you know i havent really heard much about that recently   well you know theres a lot of companies that wont give maternity women maternity leave for that very reason   uhhuh   uh in fact i know the school districts down here you they dont have maternity leave um you simply have to take accumulate accumulate your sick leave   oh is that right oh   and take your sick leave   uhhuh   and i dont know uh if bigger companies do but when i was employed with the school district i didnt have maternity leave either and that was the reason because they thought was showing prejudice to women and not to men but   huh thats interesting   so uh   thats a bummer though  i mean   yeah it is you have to save all of your uh vacation time   you got to take some time off   you do you have to save all your vacation time and thats usually how its uh happened but uh     yeah uhhuh   what do you see uh changing in the future   i think that were probably going to see a lot more companies um run by females   right and and top level   and well probably im sorry right right upper management more women in upper management and probably uh well see more females in political roles   maybe top level   more governors and i think you know roles like that   thatd be kind of nice   well weve got in Texas we have a a female governor and we had a female mayor here in Dallas and she just her term just ended   thats right thats right   and uh so i think were probably going to see more of that in the future   yeah i think thats probably good a little more integration   uhhuh   and uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners and   right you know i mean and thats fine with me but sometimes i mean im not a womens libber by any means but i do there are issues that you know as far as like equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff i   i think right   totally am for but i dont get into the um   right   the real  women libber  movement you know   no i dont either i dont think theyre ever going to prove that men and women are equal   yeah   we just function differently   right right   and uh im not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and you know that type of that type of thing but uh one of the big changes uh   yeah right   theyre doing in Salt Lake is uh and theyre probably im sure in Dallas since youre big places a lot more women are uh working right out of their home with their PCs or their lap computers or whatever   yeah ive ive heard of that um i havent really talked to anybody thats you know too involved with that but i mean i think that is a like the cottage industries   i think that   is is that what youre talking about women working out of their homes   right   yeah um i think its wonderful   right you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week and   yeah   course theyre talking about uh that were going to be able to do our grocery shopping and   oh i know by the phone and all that   banking and everything like that so uh itd be kind of exciting in some ways to to see a little bit more of that and some ways it might be kind of scary   right   think anybody could do it but   right   anyway   yeah i wouldnt mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and   right   going an hour later and picking it up   right but then you know theres the process of selection would you have to give them  the brand and uh   right right   you know when you shop you usually compare the prices and would be nice though
