        well how do you feel about spot testing spot testing for drugs   well basically i think it would be a good idea myself i uh i think if somebodys not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i dont think one test positive should   umhum   uh be uh the end of it you know i i think they should test more than once   right yeah its its refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may they yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy   it umhum   and i dont see you know that to me that just doesnt sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that youre working for   thats right   and they i believe that they have the right to know if youre using a a dangerous substance   umhum umhum theres so many jobs that uh really have other peoples lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and its uh     but umhum   uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you dont know about it   right   you know and i just um i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false       positive report   yeah no i i i agree that you know you there there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you you something can get mixed in the mail or   umhum umhum   uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to and yeah you   or somebodys test get mixed up with somebody elses i mean those things do happen   right yeah   uh i certainly wouldnt want peoples lives ruined uh wrongly   right and you know ive the the the company that i work for uh has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a uh urine test   uhhuh   and they they say that thereve been you know they they theyve also implemented random testing   uhhuh   and  it hasnt happened to me in the couple of years that you know its been in progress but uh i i fully agree with it and theres you know theres all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel its an invasion of privacy and   uhhuh umhum   i i agree with you if if if you feel its an invasion of privacy youve youve probably got something youre trying to hide   yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesnt require the testing   yeah right   uh to me its to me its not an invasion of privacy i think its people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe is in jeopardy or uh   or the quality of their products   yeah their work the work theyre doing for their company uh those things are all affected if not immediately it certainly does eventually   yeah   i think thats where a lot of the problem is at first it doesnt seem to uh bother the quality of work   umhum   but eventually it does   right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that youre misusing to get the same effect   umhum umhum umhum   hum   course i feel the same way on the AIDS problem i i dont think thats an invasion of privacy thats the only communicable disease that theyre not allowed to test for       you know and its destroying a lot of peoples lives   and then and one of the few that they dont have a cure for   yeah and its you know its its destroying peoples lives and i i think that person plus anybody in danger should should be know about it and be aware of it   yeah   so i dont know its its kind of hard to i guess the the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy of course thats not supposed to be what were talking about today i guess so   yeah   i kind of get off on a tangent here uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments uhhuh   yes i do and im im down in the the central but i dont know how familiar you are with Texas but im in a we live in a town uh near a town called Temple which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway   um oh thats probably way my brother did live in Grapevine Texas thats near Dallas   right were yeah were probably about two two and a half hours south of him   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   so   its pretty hot down there probably   oh my its actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday and its cooled things down somewhat its getting more humid now but   yeah oh did you really oh thats great uhhuh we we need rain real bad up here its uh everythings really getting dry its uh   um its been about three weeks since we had any   yeah its kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and uh its getting real bad     hum wow   so so   how about that well i hope you do get some rain up there   um so do i       uh i cant think of anything else uh   but yeah i i i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know   uhhuh uhhuh uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesnt think theres anything wrong with them i can see them objecting you know theres a lot of people that think theres nothing wrong with   one of the things i found interesting it its funny that you mentioned that TI is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world     umhum umhum   including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal   um umhum umhum   and the policy doesnt apply to those folks   um is that right   yeah they dont have to submit to drug testing like like they do here in the States and some places abroad   oh ill be darn   yeah i thought that was kind of interesting too   yeah yeah the different cultures and that too uh   yeah i mean uh uh from from a quality standpoint thats not i mean just because its not illegal doesnt mean it doesnt affect you the same way   no no im sure it would have to affect you the same way i i cant think that would make any differen ce whether it was legal or not it it would have to affect you the same way   yeah right yeah but like if youre going to do business in another country youve got to respect their rules i mean if if you know thats thats the trade off i guess   umhum oh yeah you cant you go by their laws   yeah   the same way our people have to go by their laws when theyre over there thats why a lot get in trouble   hum     because they have to follow their rules and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs and   right   you use them you pay for it   usually with your life in some places you know   yeah yeah a lot of them yeah where where is it they lose a   thats right   if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger is that where it is i thought wow  you know thats quite a deterrent   yeah from the Middle East yeah Iraq Iran in that area yeah well in in Saudi Arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and stuff like that you get the death penalty   yeah yeah   so its pretty strict over there   yeah so i guess you know we really we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is   well people tend to take the first amendment out of context which which means you know i could do anything i want to and you cant stop me and you know   umhum umhum they they abuse it is what they do yeah yeah   yeah yeah so thats   so   i dont know im im im glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy      um
