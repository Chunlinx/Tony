        what was one of the latest ones that youve seen actually   oh i guess i think we rented Pretty Women a couple weeks months ago   uh right the last two years i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home ive uh   umhum   uh become available to come and go more often so i said hey its worth it ill just go at the matinee hour and i can see what i please     yeah   no more costly than renting one the last see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX Two and that is a really good movie if you like special effects kind of gory and lots of you know action   umhum uh whos in that one i dont know if i have even heard of that one   um do you know that i dont follow performers i dont follow actors some i know some i dont um   oh   uhhuh yeah   and he was the guy the guy that played in it he wasnt the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in uh oh the one about the old people   Cocoon   the Cocoon uhhuh he was a blonde haired heavyset alien   oh okay   in Cocoon   oh okay   i dont i dont know what his name is   uh i think i know who you are talking about though   yeah at any rate i also saw not long ago Once Around that was with Richard Dreyfuss   okay   and that one was just a very poignant story it it it had people it was it was you know a lot of people said it was a really funny movie but it was a very it was a poignant humor and there was it was like uh uh Steel Magnolias the characters played very well   umhum   off one another and there was humor involved but the story was a very dramatic story   umhum   and i enjoyed it very much what are some others that you have seen lately   oh im trying to think uh just the other night on HBO we watched The Hunt For Red Red October again and thats one that   oh whoa yeah thats one i can watch over and over and over again   yeah i was going to read while it was on but then when it started i just couldnt you know read that was a really good movie   it sure was and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that   yeah theres quite a few uh movies out now that i would like to go see my husband is not a real big movie goer and i guess more than anything that is why we dont go plus by the time you get a babysitter and then pay to go to the movies   umhum umhum yeah umhum   it just gets pretty expensive   right you dont work   no i stay at home   okay well you are going to have to find a mothers day out and have him call in sick one day   yeah       go during the day thats right yeah   thats right theres nothing wrong with that go in the early hours its a matinee its not crowded the uh the price is as reasonable as renting a video   yeah   and thats the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i was Warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time   umhum umhum   and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded there was more gore than i was interested in seeing but then the movie settles down to a comfortable action uh i cant really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but   umhum yeah   uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully   yeah   but uh in the first scene the Warlock chopped off a guys finger because he wanted the ring and then   ooh   bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and i could not handle that i said whoa im glad i have not had dinner       then uh i saw Awakening thats a wonderful wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro uh   Robert Robert De Niro yeah okay i think you said Peter yeah   Robert De Niro what did i say Peter i said Robert De Niro and he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person and of course Robin Williams always just has a   umhum   an air about him that you cant help but enjoy what he is doing even when hes sad you know you have great faith that he will get happy again   umhum   and then oh lets see theres a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos i guess i can wait another month and they will be videos   yeah   one is Silence of the Lambs ive heard a lot about that one they say if you really want to be        uh you really want some suspense thats the one to see and i understand thats a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television uh   well you know i think i read about that too   umhum  and then Thelma and Louise i think its time we had a lady abuse the guys movie its about time for one of those i want to go see that and im going to try to get in Dances With Wolves   yeah oh you havent ive heard that is wonderful and   umhum ive heard its wonderful too but i its just that they are both very long uh movies and the matinee starts before i get can get away from work and after after that i get involved in other things and dont want to   yeah oh yeah yeah   dont want to go back   yeah ive heard thats we uh we uh rented the other one i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately uh was Presumed Innocent with uh Harrison Ford i guess hes in there and i thought that was really good   uhhuh you know i saw that and i really i cannot remember too much about it   it was the one where he was a defense uh not defense he was a prosecutor prosecutor and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the DAs office   uhhuh uhhuh   and then he ended up being accused of it   oh thats right i remember now yeah i remember   yeah so i mean it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was   umhum umhum well ive had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies i think he ought to stay Indiana Jones         i realize that he would like his career to develop but i dont want to see him in other things   but uh i tell you Sean Connery in the Hunt For Red October i i never did care for him as in the James Bond movies i dont know he was too   i was never into those movies either but   i yeah i didnt care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceit ed and had more women than he needed and  i didnt like him but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older i thought   yeah i thought he looked real good with a beard too   oh yeah yeah he does and there is just a theres a i dont know uh i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time   yeah      and i enjoy those and i enjoy i enjoy some of the Michael J Fox movies i didnt care too much for the last one either it just was not enough to it uh   what was the last one im trying to think uh the last like Back to the Future then was the last one   no no no it was called uh  Hard Way where he was an actor trying to portray   oh okay trying to be a cop or something yeah   trying to portay a policeman and uh that
