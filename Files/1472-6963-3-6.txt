                    Background        Since the publication of the Diabetes Control and        Complications Trial results demonstrating the efficacy of        intense glycemic control using insulin therapy and frequent        selfmonitoring of blood glucose SMBG in improving health        outcomes    SMBG has become a principal component of        diabetes management While the efficacy of selfmonitoring        independent of other selfmanagement practices is still        uncertain the practice is recommended for patients using        either insulin or oral drug therapy    As a result        managed care organizations MCOs are under increasing        pressure to cover the cost of selfmonitoring equipment           and to improve rates of SMBG among their diabetes        patients           In addition to logistic barriers to SMBG     some        recent evidence suggests that adult diabetes patients who        may be at greatest risk for poor outcomes eg        minorities elderly lower SES may be least likely to        selfmonitor     In a study of more than         managed care patients with type   and type          diabetes Karter et al    identified older age        male gender nonwhite race lower socioeconomic status        English language difficulty higher out of pocket test        strip costs intensity of insulin therapy greater alcohol        consumption and smoking as independent predictors of less        frequent selfmonitoring in diabetes patients This study        was the first to move beyond simple reporting of        descriptive statistics in order to assess predictors of        SMBG in managed care settings Unfortunately the validity        of the study findings is limited by the reliance on        selfreports of selfmonitoring an unreliable measure of        actual behavior           The purpose of the current study was to examine the        relationship between patient characteristics and SMBG in a        large health maintenance organization HMO using objective        measures of selfmonitoring practice Specifically we        tested the hypothesis that controlling for type of drug        therapy and severity of illness diabetes patients at        greatest risk for poor health outcomes eg older age        multiple chronic conditions nonwhite race lower        neighborhood SES are less likely to practice SMBG The        study population included more than  adult managed        care patients using insulin oral or a combination of the        two drug therapies Our use of objective measures of SMBG        distinguishes this study from previous attempts to identify        predictors of SMBG in managed care This paper represents        the first phase of a larger study to evaluate the effect of        distributing free home glucose monitors to diabetes        patients at this New England HMO                    Methods                  Study Setting and Data Sources          Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates HVMA is a          multispecialty group practice serving nearly           people in diverse ethnic and socioeconomic communities in          and around Boston Massachusetts At the time of the          study nearly all of the patients at HVMAs fourteen          health centers were insured in Harvard Pilgrim Health          Care HPHC one of the largest HMOs in New England Home          glucose monitoring test strips were covered by HPHC and          all members had coverage for prescription medications          The automated medical records system AMRS at HVMAHPHC          captured data from all ambulatory and inpatient          encounters between plan members and providers in a          combination of both coded and narrative fields The AMRS          has been previously used for research purposes              In addition to AMRS data we mapped patients addresses          to census tract information to control for the          socioeconomic characteristics of the patients          neighborhood of residence                          Study Cohort          In order to be eligible for inclusion in the study          patients had to be at least  years old and to have been          diagnosed with diabetes or to have received at least one          prescription for insulin or an oral sulfonylurea at some          time between December   and November   This          study represents the first phase in an evaluation of the          implementation of a policy to provide free home glucose          monitors to HPHC patients All data for this study were          collected from medical records covering the year          preceding the policy change  For          continuity of the study cohort we included only those          patients with no more than  days disenrollment between           and  Patients with gestational diabetes          were excluded                          Dependent Variables          Our outcomes of interest were the likelihood of           any SMBG and           regularity of SMBG once initiated          Patients were classified as having ever selfmonitored if          they filled at least one prescription for selfmonitoring          test strips during the study period Test strip use has          been employed in previous studies as a reliable indicator          of actual SMBG in diabetes patients      As only          a very small number of patients were using urine test          strips to monitor glycemic levels  we did not          include urine testing as a measure of          selfmonitoring          Regular SMBG among patients with any test strip use          was defined as filling prescriptions for  or more test          strips per quarter ie testing an average of at least          once per day for those using insulin or combination          therapy and  or more per quarter ie testing an          average of at least once every other day for those using          oral sulfonylureas only Cut points for regular use were          based on dispensing patterns and recent guidelines          recommending testing three to four times per day for          insulin users and less frequent testing for noninsulin          users    We assumed that test strips were used evenly          over the period between test strip dispensings Test          strips were prorated over a minimum of  days if the          next dispensing occurred sooner than that and over a          maximum of  days if there was no subsequent dispensing          during that period Multivariate analyses were limited to          patients using drug therapy and stratified by type of          drug therapy ie insulin alone or with sulfonylureas          sulfonylureas only                          Independent Variables          We identified variables in the AMRS that represented          factors that may influence preventive health behavior             as well as those identified in the literature as          being predictive of SMBG     Available demographic          information included gender age race and Medicare or          Medicaid insurance status as recorded by the provider or          health plan Given the small numbers of other minority          groups at HVMA we combined all racial groups other than          white or black into a single category labeled other We          then created two dichotomous variables black and other          with white race as the reference group          Census tract level data were used to represent the          socioeconomic status of the patient and their          neighborhood of residence We created an index composed          of the sum of four weighted census tract measures ie          percent with a college education median household          income percent of households in which English was the          primary language and percent home ownership The          variables included in the index were standardized for          summation by centering them around a mean of zero Their          relative weightings in the index were determined using          factor analysis Among several measures created from          census tract variables to measure neighborhood SES the          index created using the factor analysis approach proved          to be the strongest predictor of SMBG in univariate          analyses          Clinical assessments of health status as measures of          susceptibility or potential for the threat of poor health          outcomes included two dichotomous measures of body mass          index    ie overweight  kgm  BMI            kgm  obese BMI   kgm  and an age and          genderweighted chronic disease score CDS    based          on the presence or absence of  specific comorbidities          determined from pharmacy dispensing data In several HMO          settings the CDS has performed as well or better than          Ambulatory Disease Groups as a measure of illness          severity explaining  of variation in health care          utilization costs and mortality    We included          deciles of the CDS in multivariate regression analyses          We categorized the last recorded HbAc test value for          each individual into two dichotomous measures          representing poor and very poor glycemic control ie          poor HbAc   very poor HbAc   with          HbAc   as the reference group          Average standard monthly dose of oral diabetes          medication used was also included as an indicator of          severity of illness These standardized measures were          constructed by first calculating median monthly dose of          each drug type received in the entire study cohort during          the study period The actual dose received in a month          divided by this median dose yielded a standardized          monthly amount for each patient We then calculated the          median of these patientlevel standardized measures for          the year and included it as a covariate in the          multivariate analyses          Dichotomous variables representing the number of HbAc          lab tests    if  tests   and the number of          physician visits    if  visits   were included as          measures of predisposition to use health services The          HVMA primary care site defined as the health center          where at least  of outpatient visits occurred defined          for  of patients was included as a fixed effect to          control for variations in practice patterns As the vast          majority of patients  paid a  copayment for          test strips during the study period cost to the patient          was not included as a covariate of interest                          Statistical Analysis          Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS V             All analyses were stratified by type of drug          therapy none insulin alone or in combination with oral          sulfonylureas and oral sulfonylureas only in accordance          with the literature which suggests greater rates of          monitoring among those using insulin therapy               We used chisquare tests to compare baseline          differences in demographic status and health care          utilization by type of drug therapy and in glycemic          control by level of SMBG eg none any regular use          For patients using either form of drug therapy we used          logistic regression to estimate the factors associated          with the likelihood of initiating SMBG and regularity of          SMBG for those with some test strip use We first          examined the univariate relationships between each          candidate predictor and our two SMBG outcomes Age          gender chronic disease score the number of HbAc tests          and primary care location were controlled for in all          models Other variables were included in the multivariate          models if univariate pvalues fell below  We used          backward selection to remove variables not significant at          the  level Overall model fit including the necessity          for interaction terms was ascertained using likelihood          ratio statistics    Tests of mixed ie          hierarchical or random effects models    where          census tract was defined as a higherlevel random effect          produced no evidence of clustering at the census tract          level indicating that the fixed effects approach was          adequate                            Results                  Characteristics of the Sample          The total study sample consisted of  patients          among whom  used no drug therapy  used insulin          therapy alone or in combination with oral agents and           were taking only oral sulfonylureas The study cohorts          defined by type of therapy varied considerably with          respect to several important demographic and clinical          characteristics Compared to those using drug therapy          the nondrug therapy group was more likely to be female           vs  p   white  vs  p            and to have no comorbidities  vs  p            As shown in Table  insulinmanaged patients          were more likely to be female  vs  p            of younger average age  vs  p            and Black  vs  p   compared to those          using sulfonylureas They were also less likely to be          enrolled in Medicare  vs  p   which          was consistent with the differences in age While          sulfonylureamanaged patients were more likely to be          obese  vs  p   insulin patients had a          higher number of comorbidities on average than either          the sulfonylurea only or the no drug group  vs           vs  respectively p   in both group          comparisons There were no significant p            differences in neighborhood SES by type of drug          therapy          As shown in Table  insulinmanaged patients had more          health center visits on average    than those          using either oral    or no drug therapy             this difference was statistically significant p            Compared to sulfonylureamanaged patients          insulinmanaged were more likely to have been          hospitalized during the study period  vs  p            and to have had an emergency room visit  vs           p                            SMBG Lab Testing and Glycemic Control          SMBG frequency was well below recommended guidelines          for both insulin and sulfonylurea patients Table           Insulinmanaged patients were more likely to selfmonitor          compared to those using oral medications  vs  p            However regular SMBG was far less prevalent          among insulinmanaged and sulfonylureamanaged patients           vs  respectively p   Only  of          patients managed without drugs used any test strips          during the year          Approximately  of drug therapy patients had at          least one HbAc lab test per year In contrast fewer          than half of patients managed without drugs were tested           p   Among patients with at least one lab          test insulinmanaged patients had higher average HbAc          levels  test value   compared to          sulfonylureamanaged    and nondrug managed             patients p   for both          comparisons Over half  of all patients on drug          therapy who were tested had at least one HbAc value          greater than  during the study period and  of          those not on drug therapy who were tested had similarly          elevated glycemic levels p   There were no          significant differences in glycemic level by level of          SMBG for those without any drug therapy and for patients          using sulfonylureas However for the insulinmanaged          group patients who monitored regularly were much less          likely to be in very poor control  with HbAc            compared to patients with no test strip use  or          with irregular test strip use  p   for          both comparisons                          Predictors of SMBG          Results of the multivariate analyses examining the          likelihood of any SMBG are presented in Table  For          insulinmanaged patients higher SES of the census tract          was significantly associated with greater odds of SMBG          Odds Ratio   Confidence Interval  as          hypothesized Further older age OR  CI           male gender OR  CI  and          obesity OR CI were significantly          associated with lower odds of SMBG However higher level          of comorbidity was associated with greater odds of SMBG          an effect that ran counter to our hypothesis OR           CI  Two or more laboratory HbAc tests OR           CI  and four or more physician visits          OR  CI  were also significant          correlates of SMBG          As in the insulinmanaged group higher SES of the          census tract was significantly associated with greater          odds of any SMBG among patients using oral sulfonylureas          OR  CI  Older age OR  CI           was associated with lower odds of SMBG Two or

black race OR           CI  and very poor glycemic control OR           CI  The only covariate identified as a          significant predictor of regular SMBG in the          sulfonylureamanaged group was having two or more HbAc          tests OR  CI  The lack of significant          predictors of regular SMBG for patients managed with          sulfonylureas may be due to the small proportion  of          regular users in this group                            Discussion        Our findings suggest that managed care patients who may        benefit the most from intensive diabetes management may be        least likely to selfmonitor blood glucose Among insulin        users older age and lower neighborhood SES were associated        with lower odds of any SMBG Further black race and lack        of glycemic control were significantly associated with less        frequent SMBG suggesting that these characteristics may        represent significant barriers to adherence For patients        using oral medications older age and lower neighborhood        SES were also associated with lower odds of initiating        SMBG        Our findings for lower SES older age and black race        were consistent with those of other studies      In        contrast to our hypothesis having multiple comorbidities        was associated with higher odds of any SMBG for the insulin        group However this result may be consistent with sicker        patients being urged to monitor more frequently There was        no evidence to suggest that glycemic level was associated        with SMBG except for patients using insulin Among this        group lack of glycemic control eg HbAc   was        associated with less than half the odds of frequent SMBG        In a recent study using data from the third National Health        and Nutritional Examination Survey  Harris           found no association between glycemic levels and SMBG        controlling for type of drug therapy        There are several limitations to this study which merit        discussion Most importantly the cross sectional nature of        the study design prevents us from drawing causal inferences        about the relationship between the chosen covariates and        SMBG behavior For example the association between        glycemic control and SMBG could suggest either that sicker        patients are less likely to practice SMBG or that patients        who practice SMBG are more likely to be in glycemic        control Furthermore as most states now mandate coverage        of home monitoring equipment the impact of variations in        coverage of test strips which may cost the patient more        than the monitor in the long run may be a more relevant        topic for future studies Also more evidence of the        efficacy of SMBG for patients with Type  diabetes is        needed especially given the potential importance of belief        in the efficacy of SMBG on patient behavior           The policy to cover the cost of home glucose monitors at        this HMO was implemented in anticipation of the DCCT        results In further analyses of the policy we found that        the barriers to SMBG identified in this study did not        change over time Further the rate of SMBG changed very        little pre and postrelease of the DCCT findings and the        policy change at HPHC Lastly similarities between our        results and those from more recent studies of diabetes        selfmanagement would lend additional support to our        conclusions regarding SMBG        Test strip dispensings are not a perfect measure of        actual use but are likely to be more objective than        selfreports Also failure to control for individual SES        may have caused us to overestimate the effect of        neighborhood SES      Still other studies have        found a significant effect of neighborhood SES on        individual health and mortality even when individuallevel        SES was controlled for in the analyses                Using an index similar to our own Diez Roux et al           recently found that living in a relatively disadvantaged        neighborhood was associated with greater incidence of        coronary heart disease among whites even after adjusting        for individuallevel SES Hazard Ratio   CI                Missing data may have introduced bias into our results        In particular we only included patients who were        continuously enrolled thereby limiting the        generalizability of our study to continuously enrolled        managed care patients with diabetes Further approximately         of the study population did not receive an HbAc test        during the study period and we anticipate that patients        with lower average HbAc levels were less likely to have        had a lab test Race data were unavailable for  of the        study population However in a comparison of race data        from the AMRS to member selfreports it was found that        blacks were only slightly more likely to be incorrectly        categorized  of blacks vs  of whites or counted as        missing  of blacks vs  of whites relative to        whites unpublished data Choo P Platt R        Data on duration of diabetes and type of diabetes which        Karter et al    identified as predictors of SMBG        adherence were not consistently available in the AMRS        Therefore we controlled for severity of illness using type        and intensity of drug therapy the number of comorbidities        glycemic level and health service use Still it is        possible that the association of younger age with higher        likelihood of SMBG may in part reflect differences in type        or duration of diabetes among insulin users        The greatest strength of our study is the use of more        objective measures of SMBG Data on test strips are less        vulnerable to response biases that may hinder the detection        of important relationships Furthermore the structure of        the pharmacy benefit at the time of our study makes it very        likely that all test strip dispensings would occur in        health plan pharmacies While our data were gathered from        one HMO the large and diverse patient population at HPHC        increases the generalizability of our results to other        managed care settings                    Conclusions        While the efficacy of SMBG has yet to be demonstrated        MCOs are under increasing pressure to cover the cost of        SMBG equipment for their patients and to improve rates of        SMBG Our findings provide troubling evidence that MCOs may        face the greatest challenges in changing the        selfmonitoring behavior of the patients at greatest risk        for poor health outcomes Concern over health disparities        has drawn increased attention toward communitybased        interventions for diabetes Results of ongoing        interventions may provide managed care organizations with        useful strategies for reaching the groups most at risk for        poor diabetes outcomes In addition wellcontrolled        longitudinal studies of the relationship between the        factors identified in this study and patterns of SMBG and        selfmanagement more generally can inform future        interventions
