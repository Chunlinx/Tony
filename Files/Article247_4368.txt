                                 Evolutionary Psychology Teaches Rape             Culturebox was not surprised to learn from the latest issue of TheSciences that evolutionary psychologists have come up with an answer to thequestion of why men rape From the beginning ev psych has portrayed the warbetween the sexes as both natural and inevitable Men have to spread theirgenes around by having sex promiscuously and by whatever means necessary womenlavish their scarce reproductive resources only on partners wholl stick aroundto ensure that their children thrive So there was nothing startling about thearguments of Craig T Palmer and Randy Thornhill author of a famous study onbeauty arguing that throughout world cultures men and women prize symmetricalfeatures which correspond to genetic health Rape they say is either adirect reproductive strategywhat men resort to when all else failsor thebyproduct of other reproductive strategies such as a strong male sex driveand the male desire to mate with a variety of women What was newsworthy iswhat the authors suggests we should do to prevent rape            Now before Culturebox reveals Thornhill and Palmers nifty solution to thisageold problem she has to digress a bit on the subject of evolutionarypsychology Heres her beef with it Evolutionary psychology is not very goodon the aspect of the human psyche shes personally most interested in which ishow humans are different from animals Ev psych insists rightly that we notignore our similarities to the higher and lowerorder creatures but its weakon subjectivity selfawareness selfconsciousness whatever you want to calliton how we explain our tangled mass of hormonal impulses to ourselves Andyet this ability to reflect on ourselves underlies art architecture poetrygovernment journalism and all the other forms of willed culture andcommunication that animals dont and cant have The new sociobiologistsdo address complex social institutionsparticularly ones that requirecooperationbut only in the broadest of terms They find ways to boil themdown into highend unconscious reproductive strategies            Some evolutionary psychologists understand the limitations of their fieldThey know that it has explanatory power only in general terms and is uselessin the particular case They know that their account of human motivation isdeliberately reductivedesigned to make it easy to grasp large patterns ofbehaviorrather than a rich and accurate description of what and who we areThornhill and Palmer however are not among these modest evolutionarypsychologists And so they boldly stray into efforts to modify the behaviors ofindividuals They propose a course to teach young men about rape                           Completion of such a course might be required say before a young man isgranted a drivers license The program might start by inducing the young mento acknowledge the power of their sexual impulses and then explaining whyhuman males have evolved in that way The young man should learn that pastDarwinian selection is the reason that a man can get an erection just bylooking at a photo of a naked woman why he may be tempted to demand sex evenif he knows that his date truly doesnt want it and why he might mistake awomans friendly comment or tight blouse as an invitation to sex Most of allthe program should stress that a mans evolved sexual desires offer him noexcuse whatsoever for raping a woman and that if he understands and resiststhose desires he may be able to prevent their manifestation in sexuallycoercive behavior The criminal penalties for rape should also be discussed indetail                        Now anyone who has read George Orwell or seen A Clockwork Orange canimagine the scene The strapping teens slump embarrassed in their seats whileevolution instructors lay out their statesanctioned definition of humannature The first message to be drilled into boys heads is We believe youregenetically programmed to rape The second and inevitably less impressivemessage is Oh and by the way were not going to let you do it            Heres what Thornhill and Palmer propose for women                           Young women should be informed that during the evolution of humansexuality the existence of female choice has favored men who are quicklyaroused by signals of a females willingness to grant sexual accessFurthermore women need to realize that because selection favored males whohad many mates men tend to read signals of acceptance into a womans actionseven when no such signals are intended               In spite of protestations to the contrary women should also be advised thatthe way they dress can put them at risk                        In other words Thornhill and Palmer are asking the state to say that itbelieves that men are born rapists and that women are under an obligation notto dress or act provocatively Culturebox can see the criminal lawyerscomposing their geneticdeterminist defenses already Why even the statesaid he couldnt help himself                        Back in  when journalist Robert Wright popularized the field ofevolutionary psychology with his book The Moral Animal  he wrote anarticle on ev psych and feminism in which he acknowledged that evolutionarypsychology would be used to naturalize sexist behavior He thoughtphilandering husbands would be the ones taking advantage of the argument abouthow cheating was hard to control He did not foresee the day when evolutionarypsychologists would call for the government to sponsor their theories in a wayvirtually guaranteed to generate the very behaviors they are supposed toprevent But it was a foregone conclusion that when evolutionary psychologybegan to focus on genetic predispositions and majoritarian norms to theexclusion of everything else some literalists would in fact forget everythingelse They would forget that we are products not just of evolution but also ofwhat we imagine ourselves to be And that if we teach our children to seethemselves strictly as beasts theyre bound to act like them
