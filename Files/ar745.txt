                    Introduction        Transforming growth factor TGF is a dimeric protein        of  kDa molecular weight originally isolated from        platelets      There are three distinct mammalian        isoforms TGF TGF and TGF with TGF being the        most abundant isoform Almost all cell types express TGF        but the highest level of expression of TGF is in        platelets and bone     Mature TGF consists of two        identical peptide chains each containing  amino acids        linked via nine disulfide bonds     TGF is        synthesized as part of a large latent protein complex        unable to bind to cellular receptors with mature active        TGF produced by cleavage            TGF is a mutifunctional cytokine that plays an        important role in immunomodulation inflammation and tissue        repair     Many studies have suggested that TGF could        be a potential therapeutic reagent for the repair of soft        tissue and bone and following ischemic injury It may also        have applications for the treatment of chronic inflammatory        fibrotic and autoimmune diseases      In contrast        other studies have demonstrated that TGF can cause        inflammation and fibrosis      The potential use of        TGF for the treatment of human disease thus remains        controversial            Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease        It is characterized by a chronic erosive inflammation of        painful and debilitating joints with progressive        degradation of cartilage and bone accompanied by        proliferation of the synovium     Rheumatoid arthritis        remains incurable and in many patients difficult to        treat As a novel approach to therapy we and other workers        have focused on developing the methods for local transfer        of genes encoding therapeutic agents to the joint                  This strategy also can be applied to the        treatment of osteoarthritis and for aiding the repair of        the cartilage and other intraarticular tissues        Since TGF has antiinflammatory properties as well as        being able to stimulate new matrix synthesis by        chondrocytes it represents a possible therapeutic agent        with which to treat pathologies associated with rheumatoid        arthritis and osteoarthritis by local gene delivery Other        workers and ourselves have previously examined the effects        of TGF gene transfer on matrix synthesis in chondrocyte        cultures demonstrating a significant stimulation in the        production of proteoglycans     In addition we have        demonstrated that the TGF gene was able to overcome the        inhibitory effects of IL on matrix metabolism in        chondrocytes in culture            To examine the effect of TGF on joint pathology we        used adenovirusmediated intraarticular gene delivery to        confer sustained intraarticular TGF expression in both        nave and arthritic rabbit knee joints Intraarticular        injection of adenoviral vector expressing human        transforming growth factor AdTGF resulted in a high        level of TGF accumulation in the synovial fluid        Intraarticular TGF expression was antiinflammatory        inhibiting white blood cells However TGF expression        also induced significant pathology in the rabbit knee as        well as in the adjacent muscle including stimulation of        glycosaminoglycan GAG release and nitric oxide synthesis        and enhancement of fibrogenesis and muscle edema These        results suggest that although TGF may have        antiinflammatory effects sustained expression of TGF        has adverse effects on joint pathology                    Materials and methods                  Vector construction          The recombinant adenoviral vector used in the present          study originates from replicationdeficient type           adenovirus lacking E and E loci     The human          TGF cDNA was inserted in place of the E region in the          shuttle plasmid pAdLox     where expression is          driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter          The recombinant AdTGF virus was generated by          CreLoxdriven recombination in Cre  cells              Briefly a confluent  cm dish of Cre  cells              was split into five  cm dishes Transfection of          these cells with pAdLoxhuman TGF was performed by          the calcium phosphate precipitation method with  g          pAdLoxhuman TGF construct digested with           Sfi I and  g  helper virus DNA          The transfected Cre  cells were fed daily until there          were visible plaques The cells were harvested and          exposed to three cycles of freezethaw The recombinant          virus was purified and amplified by infecting two  cm          dishes of Cre  cells using  l lysate The AdTGF          virus was purified using cesium chloride gradient          ultracentrifugation at            g  rpm and C and then          dialyzed three times against Trisbuffered saline          The titer was determined by measuring the viral DNA at          optical density  nm OD            nm  using the formula viral          particles  OD            nm  dilution      The          adenovirus expressing luciferase was kindly provided by J          Kolls LSU Medical Center New Orleans LA USA                          Animals and experimental arthritis          New Zealand white rabbits weighing  kg were          purchased from Myrtles Rabbitry Thompson Station TN          USA To establish antigeninduced arthritis AIA          rabbits were sensitized to ovalbumin by intradermal          injections of  mg ovalbumin emulsified in Freunds          complete adjuvant Arthritis was initiated in both hind          knees of rabbits  weeks later by the intraarticular          injection of  mg ovalbumin dissolved in  ml Geys          saline The different adenoviral vectors were injected          intraarticularly  hours after injection of          antigen                          Experimental protocol          Twentyfour hours after induction of AIA adenoviral          particles encoding either the human TGF or luciferase          were suspended in  ml Geys saline and injected into          the joint space of the knee through the patellar tendon          Different doses of virus        and              viral particles were injected intraarticularly into          three rabbits per group for analysis of the effects of          TGF on nave joint pathology and the treated rabbits          were sacrificed  days postinfection to observe the          doseresponse effects Another group of three nave          rabbits was injected with    viral particles and          sacrificed  days postinfection for longterm          observation          There were two groups of AIA rabbits used in the          study The first group of three rabbits was injected with             viral particles and the second group of six          rabbits was injected with    viral particles Each          rabbit received the indicated dose of TGF virus in one          knee and the same amount of the adenoviral vector          expressing luciferase AdLuc virus in the opposite knee          as the control          To lavage the rabbit knee joints  ml Geys saline          was injected into the joint space through the patellar          tendon After manipulation of the joint the needle was          reinserted and the fluid was aspirated Leukocytes in          recovered lavage fluids were counted using a          hemocytometer The levels of TGF in conditioned media          lavage fluids and sera were measured using an ELISA kit          R  D Systems Minneapolis MN USA as directed by          the supplier The levels of sulfated GAGs in lavage          fluids were determined using a colorimetric dyebinding          assay using dimethylmethylene blue     The          levels of total nitrite in lavage fluids were measured          with Nitric Oxide Assay kits Calbiochem  Biosciences          Inc La Jolla CA USA          Articular cartilage fragments shaved from the femoral          condyles were placed into  ml NeumanTyell serumfree          medium Gibco New York USA to measure the rate of          proteoglycan synthesis The fragments were then incubated          with SO             Ci for  hours at C and          the media harvested and stored at C Proteoglycans          were extracted from the cartilage by incubation for           hours in  ml of  M NaOH at C with gentle agitation          Following chromatographic separation of unincorporated          SO            using PD columns Pharmacia          Uppsala Sweden the levels of radiolabeled GAGs          released onto the culture media or recovered by alkaline          extraction were quantitated by scintillation counting                                       Histology          For histological analyses tissues harvested from          dissected knees were first fixed in  formalin The          fixed tissues were imbedded in paraffin sectioned at           m and stained with H  E                          Statistical analysis          All data collected are expressed as mean  standard          error Statistical significance was analyzed by analysis          of variance and Students           t test Correlation coefficients            r  were calculated using Pearsons          method                            Results                  Expression of TGF after intraarticular          injection of AdTGF          To test the effects of adenoviralmediated human          TGF gene expression in nave and AIA rabbit joints                 and    particles of AdTGF were          injected into either nave or arthritic rabbit knees The          same amounts of AdLuc were injected into the          contralateral knees Lavages were performed on day  day           and day  and the levels of TGF were determined by          ELISA Fig           TGF expression was detected in all knee joints          receiving either    or    viral particles with          higher levels detected in the arthritic knees A          significant drop in TGF expression was observed after           days of postviral injection No significant levels of          TGF were detected in the    viral particle          injection group and in the contralateral joints receiving          the different doses of luciferase virus Furthermore no          significant expression of TGF was detected in the          serum          It is important to note that detection of TGF in          the synovial fluid required acid activation suggesting          that the protein is in its latent form Moreover there          were no observed therapeutic or adverse effects following          intraarticular injection of the low dose             particles of AdTGF                          Alterations in joint anatomy after intraarticular          AdTGF injection          Three days after injection of AdTGF the knees          receiving the highest dose of virus became enlarged with          a reduction in joint movement In addition the muscles          adjacent to the joints showed signs of swelling and          reduced movement The animals were sacrificed on day           postinjection and the joints were analyzed The size of          the joints and the adjacent muscles increased          dramatically both in nave rabbits   contralateral          knees           P   and in AIA rabbits            contralateral knees           P   Fig           The movement of joints was also severely limited with          the AdLuc contralateral knees moving freely at           whereas the knees treated with AdTGF virus could only          move at  The limitation to joint movement was not          due to the enlarged muscles since when the muscles were          cut away the limitation of movement was still observed          In addition when the joints were analyzed  days after          viral injection at a time when the muscle size returned          to normal the joint still could not move freely The          limitation to joint movement could thus be due to          possible synovial hyperplasia or effects on ligaments or          cartilage metabolism          It is important to note that we did observe an          increase in creatine kinase levels in the serum that          would suggest muscle damage data not shown In contrast          to the highdose TGF group only a very mild effect          was observed on the gross joint structure in the group          receiving    viruses and no changes were observed in          the group receiving    viruses                          Effect of TGF on cartilage metabolism          To determine whether overexpression of TGF had          effects on cartilage metabolism in nave and AIA rabbit          joints GAG synthesis by articular cartilage and GAGs          released into synovial fluid as a result of proteoglycan          breakdown were measured The rabbit joints receiving          AdTGF had significant higher levels of GAG release          compared with the contralateral AdLuc joints in lavage          fluids at day  day  and day  for the nave rabbits          and at day  for the AIA rabbits Fig ABC GAG          release levels correlated linearly with the levels of          TGF in lavage fluids            r   in the nave rabbits In          addition only the highest dose of AdTGF was able to          stimulate GAG synthesis in the nave rabbit joints from          day  and day  but the stimulation was marginal There          was no statistically significant difference between GAG          synthesis by the nave rabbits with the two lower doses          of viral injections and in the AIA rabbits Fig          DEF          Taken together these results suggest that          intraarticular expression of TGF stimulated cartilage          matrix degradation while having only a minor effect on          the promotion of new matrix synthesis This is in          contrast to the results observed on matrix synthesis in          chondrocytes in culture where TGF was able to          stimulate significant new matrix synthesis as well as          overcome the suppressive effects of IL on matrix          metabolism                               Inhibition of white blood cell infiltration and          elevation of nitric oxide synthesis          To determine whether TGF expression could inhibit          the mild inflammation induced by intraarticular          injection of high doses of adenovirus or the severe          inflammation occurring in the AIA model the levels of          white blood leukocytic infiltrate in the synovial lavage          fluids were determined Fig           The joints of nave rabbits receiving the highest dose          of AdTGF adenovirus had significantly lower levels of          white blood cell infiltration in lavage fluids at day           day  and day  The white blood cell infiltration in          the nave joints directly correlated with TGF          expression levels in the lavage fluids            r   In the AIA rabbit knee          joints there was a reduction in the infiltration at day           and day  compared with the contralateral control          AdLuc joints consistent with TGF having an          antiinflammatory effect Surprisingly TGF expression          elevated nitrate levels in the joints receiving highdose          injections of TGF adenovirus at day  day  and day           for nave rabbits and at day  for the AIA rabbits          compared with the control joints Fig DEF The          nitrate levels also directly correlated with the levels          of TGF in lavage fluids            r   for nave rabbits          These results suggested that TGF is indeed          antiinflammatory in arthritic knees but is able to          induce production of nitric oxide through an unknown          mechanism                          Histological analysis of the intraarticular          effects of TGF          The nave and AIA rabbit knee joints receiving          AdTGF and AdLuc were also examined by histology          There was significant fibroblast proliferation around the          myofibers in the nave rabbits joint receiving AdTGF          There was also mild hyperplasia of the synovial lining          but without any evidence of inflammatory cells being          observed Fig AB There were some inflammatory cells          in the contralateral synovial lining but no evidence of          synovitis Fig CD The synovium from the TGF          virus treated joints was highly fibrotic  days after          viral injection with evidence of osteometroplasia found          in the synovium Fig EF but with no evidence of          inflammation or angiogenesis Fig F          There was mild inflammation under the synovium in the          contralateral joints receiving AdLuc Fig GH The          synovium in the AdTGFtreated AIA rabbits showed          evidence of hyperproliferation with mild inflammation          Fig IJ compared with the contralateral control          joints that had severe inflammation Fig KL In the          muscle tissue adjacent to AdTGFtreated joints there          was evidence of both fibroblast and myofibroblast          proliferation between myofibers with intracellular edema          but there was no evidence of inflammation or myonecrosis          Fig MN In contrast the muscle tissue from the          contralateral controls knees was normal Fig OP          There was also mild fibroblast proliferation and synovial          inflammation in the    AdTGF group but no          significant histological changes were observed in the             viral group          These data taken together suggest that TGF is able          to stimulate fibrogenesis and to suppress inflammation          Moreover the results suggest that elevated TGF levels          result in chondrogenesis within the synovial tissue                            Discussion        TGF is a mutifunctional cytokine that plays an        important role in immunomodulation inflammation and tissue        repair Given that TGF is able to induce new matrix        synthesis from chondrocytes in culture as well as able to        block inflammation         in vivo  it has been proposed that        local intraarticular gene transfer of TGF could be        therapeutic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as        well as osteoarthritis To examine the effects of TGF on        joint pathology we used adenovirusmediated        intraarticular gene delivery to confer sustained        intraarticular TGF expression in both nave and        arthritic rabbit knee joints Intraarticular injection of        AdTGF virus into the rabbit knee resulted in        dosedependent elevated levels of expression of TGF in        the synovial fluid but not in the serum        Intraarticular TGF expression resulted in        dosedependent biological effects in the rabbit knee as        well as in adjacent muscle In particular local        intraarticular expression in nave joints stimulated        cartilage breakdown as measured by synovial GAG levels        without enhancing new matrix synthesis In addition TGF        expression stimulated nitric oxide production Similarly        in arthritic joints where TGF expression inhibited white        blood cell infiltration it also stimulated GAG release and        nitric oxide production Although there was a reduction in        inflammation in arthritic joints TGF expression induced        fibrogenesis and muscle edema In addition TGF        expression in the adenovirally infected synovial lining        also resulted in induction of chondrogenesis in the        synovium Elevated TGF expression in the synovial fluid        thus resulted in a variety of adverse pathological        changes        A previous study examined the effect of AdTGF in the        knee joints of nave CBl mice where gene transfer of        TGF to the mouse knee resulted in hyperplasia of the        synovium as well as in chondroosteophyte formation at the        chondrosynovial junctions     The present experiments        have shown similar effects on synovial proliferation but        also have extended the murine studies to examine the        effects of TGF in both diseased knee joints and normal        knee joints in the rabbit Similar to the previous report        we have observed evidence for intrasynovial chondrogenesis        as well as osteometroplasia following TGF gene transfer        Whether TGF directly or indirectly stimulates        proliferation of synovium is unclear but this pathology        apparently is mediated through an ILindependent        mechanism        It has been speculated that intraarticular delivery of        TGF would result in enhanced synthesis of new matrix            Indeed we have reported previously that the TGF        gene is more effective than insulinlike growth factor type         and bone morphogenetic protein type  genes in        stimulating new matrix synthesis from rabbit chondrocytes        in culture We have also demonstrated that TGF is able        to partially overcome the inhibition of new matrix        synthesis by IL in cultured chondrocytes The results        presented in the present article however suggest that        TGF expression is unable to enhance new matrix synthesis                in vivo in either nave joints or in        particular in diseased joints Moreover it appears as if        TGF confers adverse effects by stimulating cartilage        degradation through an unknown mechanism In contrast to        the adverse effects of intraarticular adenoviral gene        transfer of TGF we have shown that gene transfer of        insulinlike growth factor type  to the rabbit knee        results in an increase in new matrix synthesis without any        adverse effects            Taken together these results suggest that increasing        the intraarticular levels of TGF has no therapeutic        effect on cartilage metabolism resulting instead in higher        rates in cartilage degradation Use of the synovium as a        target tissue for TGF gene transfer resulting in        elevating the intraarticular level is thus not        appropriate for the enhancement of repair of cartilage        defects Instead for TGF gene therapy to be effective        in promoting repair of damaged cartilage the level of        TGF will need to be highly regulated as well as        expression localized TGF expression would need to be        targeted at the appropriate levels to the site of        cartilage damage such as through gene transfer to        chondrocytes or stem cells involved in repairing the        damaged tissues        TGF has been shown to be therapeutic in several        different animal models when expressed systemically from        muscle tissue      This suggests that elevated serum        levels of TGF can reduce general inflammation as well as        inhibit IL and tumor necrosis factor alpha production        resulting in a systemic therapeutic effect In addition        TGF has been shown to be therapeutic in murine models of        collageninduced arthritis following delivery in        genetically modified T cells     This observation        suggests that targeting TGF to certain sites of        inflammation through the use of arthogenic T cells also can        be therapeutic However our results suggest that local        expression of TGF unlike systemic expression is not        therapeutic due to adverse pathologies associated with        elevated intraarticular TGF expression        Although our results do not preclude the development of        gene therapy approaches to express regulated TGF        systemically to downmodulate the immune response the        results suggest that any clinical application of local        TGF gene transfer should proceed with caution TGF is        clearly a potent cytokine able to confer multiple effects        when expressed intraarticularly         in vivo                     Conclusion        Gene transfer represents a novel method for obtaining        high intraarticular levels of therapeutic agents for the        treatment of arthritis TGF is able to stimulate new        matrix synthesis by chondrocytes in culture as well as able        to reduce inflammation         in vivo  In this report the effects        of intraarticular expression on both nave and arthritic        rabbit knee joint pathology were examined by        adenoviralmediated intraarticular gene transfer of        TGF The results suggest that elevated TGF expression        confers adverse joint pathology including an increase in        cartilage matrix degradation without stimulating new matrix        synthesis In addition TGF expression induces muscle        edema and fibrogenesis        Although TGF may have certain antiinflammatory        properties it is unable to stimulate repair of damaged        cartilage and even stimulates cartilage degradation        Moreover elevated TGF expression also induced muscle        edema and fibrogenesis Gene transfer of TGF to the
