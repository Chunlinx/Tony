             so what do you think   i figured you were going to ask me first here i was going to ask you first this is a difficult one i mean unfortunately the first thoughts are sort of negative     umhum   but then when i give myself a chance to think about it a little bit more i recognize the positives as well uh   yes   positives for sure are technology and   uhhuh   um some of the changes that the computer age has brought i think that kids growing up today are just uh very much more facile than i was as a kid in terms of the use of computer technology and you know   yeah right thats true i mean im twenty six now and i came through high school with about the first generation that had computers in the classroom   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and all that and it certainly has been good for me   yes   so i see myself you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that its much easier for me than for lets say my colleagues who are a lot older but just as intelligent and whatever   umhum and the earlier you learn yes the younger you are probably the easier it is   uhhuh   um some of that i think probably we take for granted you know the changes have happened so rapidly that its its easy for us to forget how quickly it has changed   thats true   i think probably the other thing i that came to mind is is the increased awareness on our part of the the criminal element if i can put it that way you know you dont you dont uh casually let kids play in the street or you know ride their bike to friends if youre in an area where youre at all concerned about   uhhuh and what do you think thats just a question of becoming more aware or has it become less safe over the years   abduction i think its changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years theres definitely been an increase in that type of crime   yeah i would agree with you   and im not sure why you know uh certainly a question that we could spend hours on you know whether whether there is a change in   um thats right   in the way a lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is you know more mental illness or something that causes that sort of thing to go on uh i dont know   uhhuh yeah i dont know i think a lot of what causes it is just economics naturally     but you know kidnapping is a strange thing you know what kids today are not nearly as free as i was when i was a kid in terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my bike around the neighborhood or   uhhuh   being being informed at a very young age about uh going to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you i mean i never had a concept of that as a kid so thats certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty years   uhhuh yeah i suppose it has uh   anyway what are some positives that you could  youve thought about besides  spending too much time on the criminal element     thats right uh its   huh   well lets see i think that the mass communication that we have in the world now is in general a good thing and i think it has its good points and bad points but in general its pretty positive   uhhuh it really does bring us together as a global community doesnt it   uh more or less yes i mean it is we have the   um   global village you know like Maclean was saying but it doesnt   umhum   i dont think that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a world   uh thats a good point   which which hopefully maybe coming well have to see   uhhuh uhhuh i think thats something that uh is a political influence as well you know probably people feel it on a personal level more than they might um on a on a global level you know just being informed about what other countries and   uhhuh   other cultures are doing   right   in a way that we might not have been informed before but yet politically uh their activities arent arent influencing how our leaders direct legislation as as much as they could its still really focused on our interests you know what i mean   well yeah thats definitely right i mean and when were       right well with things like the war in Iraq we were   uhhuh   dealing with other peoples affairs for our own interests certainly is what i believe   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   um   McDonalds uh burning up the uh the rain forests in order to have more cattle grazing so that  somehow thats something thats not going to work out in the long term in that kind of a cycle its going to catch up to us at some point   uhhuh umhum yeah   what else has changed social changes uh i think that theres probably a greater awareness sensitivity on the part of men and women to to what the other   um   um is adjusting to in life
