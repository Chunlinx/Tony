                                 Machines in the Garden            In the animated ecologicalepic                   Princess Mononoke                the camera travels over landscapes with aclear steady gaze like a Zen hang glider The images have none of thecominatya popsurrealism of American cartoons many of which have charactersthat spring out of the frame like jackintheboxes The Japanese directorHayao Miyazaki who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and isreported to have done  percent of its paintings himself seems to work fromthe outside in to begin with the curve of the earth then the mossy hills thewatercolor foliage the nubby stones the whorls on the wood the meticulouscarvings on a teacup He captures the texture of light and the currents of airYou could almost settle down in this landscape A view of nature that somewould call treehugging doesnt feel softheaded when the trees are renderedin such brilliant and robust detail            But then soft is nota word you can apply to Princess Mononoke  however pantheistic itsworldview The film which is rated PG is full of splattery carnage IfMiyazaki in long shot is contemplative in closeup hes ferocious Hes bothinside and outside the action He knows when to rock your world and when toinduce a state of sorrowful detachment According to the New                YorkTimes  Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when theirimaginations flagged and writers for Star Trek named an alien speciesafter one of his features Watching Princess                Mononoke which hasbeen dubbed to DisneyMiramax specifications by American and English stars butretains its twohourplus length its gory beheadings and its grimnearapocalyptic finaleyou can understand their worship It isnt thatMiyazakis work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miraclesits that everything is sublimely in proportion            The movie has a scope that makes Hollywoods homileticfollowyourdream fables look even more solipsistic Miyazaki is after nothingless than the moment in our history the film is set in the  th and th centuries when the power shifted from a natural world to oneshaped by human technology Its the beginning of what Bill McKibben calledthe end of naturethat is when nature became no longer an autonomousselfregulating force but one touched and in Miyazakis view poisoned byhuman industry            The hero Ashitaka awarrior from the isolationist Emishi clan is forced in the first scene to killa marauding boara god turned into a demon covered in roiling corrosiveworms by an iron ball lodged in its body Infected destined to be consumedbyand to die ofrage Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the ironballs source He discovers a fortresscumarmsmanufacturing plant calledIrontown presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film theregal Lady Eboshi On one hand shes a benevolent industrialist who presidesover a warmly matriarchal society on the other she wants to destroy theforest harness its resources and exterminate its animal deitieschiefly theSpirit of the Forest a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life ordeath and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker            P rincess Mononoke builds to a fullscale war betweenhumans and the animal kingdomwhich does not by the way consist of yourfathers cartoon critters In fact the boars and apes have little patiencewith Ashitakas call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony theydlike to eat him The wolf god Moro is slightly more sympathetic but thatsbecause her adopted daughter San a k a Princess Mononoke is human San isfirst seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother then as the gore dripsfrom her mouth training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred Hersecond appearancea lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshiis oneof the movies high points Its Miyazakis use of soundand silencethattakes your breath away the determined tap of the wolf princesss shoes as shescuttles over the fortresss rooftops the silence of Eboshi and her army asthey stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky Theirbattle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definitionits almostsubliminal            Its a shame that thewolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film eithersaving him or being saved by him She loses that punkbitch allure The voiceof Claire Danes doesnt help When Danes says Id do anything to get youhumans out of my forest she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack ofparking spaces at the mall San needs a more ragged voiceId be interestedto hear the original Japanese actress Billy Crudup is just as DisneyfiedMiramaxed but that doesnt hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived fromthe start as a rather bland ingnu Gillian Andersons growling Moro soundssilly she doesnt have the breath control and the feyhick tones of BillyBob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamirofflike mercenary JigoBut Minnie Drivercoming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan onceagain provides a voice that the animators deserve Bring the strangeah to melateah she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loinsof Flash Gordon fans everywhere I would like to thank himpuhsonally            The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononokecloser to its American counterpartsbut not by a lot Theres always somethingwondrously strange The kodamas are little tree spirits on doughboy bodiesThey cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks then theirheads pop back with a conclusive rattle Something about them seems just rightI could watch them for hours Miyazaki limits their appearances to secondshedoesnt wear out their mystery the way that say George Lucas would And noHollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypseas the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick caustic tarlike gelthat recalls the postHiroshima black rain Can you take the kids I thinkso As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference Childrenunderstand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessedworld Princess Mononoke  at least can tell them why            A special smile  acertain touch  So begins the elevatormusic theme song of                   Music ofthe Heart                 I never had a lot that I loved so much The credits hadjust started and I was already looking for a barf bag Did Miramax and directorWes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspariplayed here by Meryl Streep whose violin courses in East Harlem elementaryschools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide A fabled taskmasterher story was told in the  documentary Small Wonders  Guaspariused music as a way to teach selfdisciplinealong with the healthyselfrespect that follows in its wake When the New York school board cut thefunding for her program she proved a marvel of selfpromotion attractingfeatures in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students atCarnegie Hall for a benefit Fiddlefestalong with Itzhak Perlman IsaacStern and other legendary fiddlers            Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on theset learning the violin she doesnt play any instruments that she didntbring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta Maybe thatswhy the performance seems so natural Let her always learn an instrument on theset Still she doesnt make much sense of Guaspari The script by Pamela Gray A Walk on the Moon  has her students complain of her nastiness andperfectionism but Streepwho has made herself look dumpy thickwaisted andbedraggledis so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippyniceness Instead of a monument to an individuals iron will Music of theHeart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses thekindness of strangers            Directors of violentgenre pieces like Craven who got this mainstream gig in return for doing theScream sequels or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly tobelong to Establishment Hollywoodto go to the Academy Awardsthat theyneuter themselves Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can bethey forget that violenceeven if its just emotional violencebelongs inordinary dramas too Craven does good work with the young actors in theclassroom scenes but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and amushy TVmovie humanism that blands out its texture OK I was a puddle aftersome scenes like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improveher posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace But how muchmore emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenlyseeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman Stern Joshua Bell etcwed seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up Theres toomuch music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers            In outline                   The Limey                 is a lean littleBmovie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit Terence Stamp whos newlysprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of hisbeautiful daughters death My names Wilson  Who dunnit The filmdirected by Steven Soderbergh would be worth seeing just for Stampsperformance at once rockhard and goofily blinkered and for Peter Fondaswittily selfparodic turn as the suspected killer a music producer who coastson s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work Ohman he says the fear finally seeping through the ether This is getting alltoo close to me            But the pictures glory is its layered and intricatesyntax The dialogue moves aheadthere are great gobs of expositionbut theimages continually double back to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren as hisdaughters acting teacher simply gazing at each other or to Stamp sitting ona plane remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach the lens of his homemovie camera creating an eerily brightalmost supernaturalspot that dancesover her face The films most violent act happens well off screen You hearthe distant poppoppoppoppop of the heros gun The rest is onlyhalfglimpsed fantasized or saturated by memoryor is the present thememory Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup            Some including the critic at Time  havequestioned Soderberghs sanity But of courseSoderbergh flouts time I seea method to his madness Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in JulienDonkeyBoy  Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essentialdramatic gesture Hes saying This not all that other stuffis whatsimportant He telegraphs the endingyou know the Limey will somehow be at theroot of his daughters deathbut its still an emotional wow The climaxjustifies the technique It says the point of this odyssey isnt revenge butregretfor irredeemably blown chances and a tragic waste of love            Soderbergh is one of those rare filmmakers who learnon the job Working within a tight genre structure hes discovering hundredsof ways of editing a given scene that can give it the richness of a novel Ishe totally successful No he misses now and then which is why the techniquesticks out But what a fantastic effort See it and weep for whats missing inmost other movies
