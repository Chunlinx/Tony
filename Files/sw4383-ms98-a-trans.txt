        do you think should be done for the the uh huge budget we have     uh uh well i think the first thing that every every time they talk about it they they say well we cant cut this or we dont need to cut this out of the budget because its such a small amount in comparison to the overall decifit deficit but i think they need to start doing it i mean the taxes are going to grow so high theres no way well ever pay off what we owe now our children is going to pay it   yeah i know Graham Krugman that guy Krugman was it uh Grudman hes  hes not going for we elected him for that uh again and he said that he didnt think that wed ever be able to have uh balanced budget   i dont think so they had an article in the paper here the other day about       uh the interest alone in the year two thousands going to be more than John Kennedys entire budget   umhum   and when its its gone ridiculous now i dont know whats going to happen   well be like California soon right        or what or New York   bankrupt     yep totally everything yeah       the year two thousand that uh wed be totally dependent on foreign capital and   i think so like Japan   yeah   uh i dont know if thats such a bad thing one so once Japan becomes if were dependent on them theyre most certainly dependent upon us i dont think that the world market would would be as possible for them with out us i mean i dont think Europe is consumer oriented as we are   huh   they more or less have to sell to us whether where else would you sell that many Toyotas and Hondas and stuff itd have to be here   well  you go were the money is and if you dont have the money anymore then thats that   yeah   um   i dont know i think the first thing we could do is uh id like to see Congress  attached to the decifit or you know or   performance right   uh   attach performance   yeah performance calls like you might have at work or or i might have too     uhhuh   yeah   certainly do   you do i do too uh its uh i dont know why they should be uh unregulated and and over the last twenty years weve strictly gone down hill and the salarys gone up   well actually their  well thats one thing but we also got to change the voting stuff and the uh special interest groups and all that stuff you know we we take a lot of the blame for it we have to start voting we have to start talking we have to start uh doing something about it but were so apathetic its almost ridiculous   well for one thing uh weve got lives to live i mean for us to uh to stay knowledgeable on all these issues its a full time job   umhum   i mean i go to work every day just like you do i dont i cant sit down and keep up with all of this thats why we elect them   oh i understand that but we have to go to vote     yeah   we have to uh participate in political parties or something uh those kinds of things and we dont even do that   no i i dont even think uh participation would have  as far as democrats and republicans go itd have to be a third party     oh still i mean we have the right to do it we dont do it thats the whole problem we dont exercise those rights i dont know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean um that would definitely cut down on the consumerism  and which really pushes a lot of the uh you know itd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment   um         you know  do you sometimes think its got to a hopeless position now that theres nothing we could do to reverse it   well i dont know i think if people put their minds to it they can do it its just a matter of mobilizing uh you know the people that do it its a very difficult task im not saying that any of this is easy   you know were were talking about numbers that i cant even comprehend the numbers were too large for me   yeah well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that talking about the numbers of atomic bombs and how many times you can bomb the world over and how incredible that was and now you you know thats coming to a point where thats less likely less and less likely right economic ruling brought that down
