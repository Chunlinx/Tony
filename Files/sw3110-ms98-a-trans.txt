        okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when schools going on     um a little bit during the school year were um definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks   yeah oh really   um during during the school year and of course thats a good idea because i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and   oh yeah   you know so its pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts   oh yeah   you know because then youve   but those arent that new i mean i have some that were way old  yeah   oh thats oh thats true the old culottes thats right but those are just real comfortable and um       you know allow you the privacy and all   oh yeah yeah theyre very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of     the only uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if its split it it varies though between the principal from one principal to another   yeah yeah   there are some like um some principals insist that you not wear um anklet type shorts   oh yeah   i mean socks um that you have to wear hose you know hose but i know of other schools   uhhuh   where they wear um you know anklets and   yeah well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and um   umhum     i couldnt find any hose one day but i found some knee highs so i put those on and the wind caught my skirt and he said what have you got on   umhum   how embarrassing i know i hate that you really have to check on the   yeah it was real funny       check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so   yeah its pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so       the one day that i did it and i got caught   do you wear um suits very much   um no i really dont my dont i work for a computer company but its not uh real visual i mean its not like an IBM where you have to wear your blue suit   umhum yeah right   but um i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy   umhum umhum   because especially i mean you know its nice sometimes in in a suit because if youre hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but uh im more comfortable in a dress   umhum yeah   so but   i am too and i   the best thing are you from Texas   uh ive been here seventeen years   oh well you qualify   but im from   but im from Illinois   oh well see thats whats so funny because so many girls move down here from the north and they have these heavy wool suits and its like God what do i do with that   thats right thats right   i said well thats the best part about Texas you can buy uh one dress that you can wear pretty much all through unless like its the like two cold months and winter in December   thats right right all right that really is nice i um im kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes       and i i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were were wool or just you know really nice things and   yeah   and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them   umhum     but like i said im kind of a   yeah but youd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale   yeah thats  thats really true  because who would want it down here but anyway they they still sit around in drawers and boxes and i i get them out   really hum   at the beginning of the winter   yeah   out of a box and put them in my drawer and then at the end of the winter i take it out of the drawer and put it back in the box and sometimes i never wore it       now that is silly isnt it   well thats really weird because last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so   yeah are you from here then   well yeah Oklahoma and Texas so i mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter but um i guess i just didnt notice it because i never really dressed very warm so   umhum well the thing is that you know it it does get cold but its just such a short season you know and you just   yeah yeah   cant wear that much   well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so   oh how nice   ive been yeah i mean i go into every store and i i go do you have Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like im strange but   Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit   its called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and um   huh where have you found them   um ive been fortunate ive found them in in a catalog and then theyre a lot cheaper than you can find them at Dillards   um but they carry them at Dillards   so um yeah they do have them at Dillards and   hum ill have to look at those that sounds interesting   yeah i really enjoy them ive gotten ive and its real funny too because ive had a lot of compliments on them when i wear them so   umhum umhum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i i really do too i just i dont know im really comfortable in   yeah w ell im short and ive been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it it gives you more of an elongated look   umhum   so um ive always been more comfortable in the longer ones   umhum i like that too   yeah so my my husbands kind of whiny he says well i like the shorter ones  and im like well yeah you dont have to sit with your legs crossed all day long   thats real good very well   thats exactly right     so   oh well   but anyway but i dont have any play clothes because i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work   for work   so on the weekends and   well you you work year round right yeah   yeah but its just kind of frustrating because on the weekends you want to go out to play and you dont have any play clothes   umhum   so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend   umhum thats true   put them with my shorts or something   yeah thats true well i have more summer stuff i guess for that kind of casual because we do go on a  um i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husbands   um   mom and family and we usually go to the beach while were out there so   yeah   uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since im doing summer school i havent worn hardly very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them all together so to take them on our trip   yeah well ive lost weight recently so im now getting to dig out the things i havent worn for a while so thats kind of fun   oh how nice   well i took i went through my closet this spring and i i took some stuff out and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because im so tired of looking over it and its all just a little bit too tight   yeah   but it isnt so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really dont want to get rid of you know i really want     yeah   to keep them because theyre nice and so i thought well ill put them in there and then maybe ill feel so bad that i cant wear them now   uhhuh     and ill do something about it but so far   yeah well thats something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because i i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and its like what are we going to do       oh thats funny   said well well have to get a bigger house   yeah thats right  hey when you have kids you definitely have to have     oh i know and then plus well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me and im like well what am i going to do with all this stuff   oh   i dont think it will fit my dog   you think theyre hinting   yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because then ive got the whole wardrobes and fortunately shes had a boy and a girl   yeah thats right ooh yeah youll be glad believe me oh because i   so that worked out yeah sure i will be because God i was in was in Foleys the other day and i turned the wrong direction and i ended up in the little kids clothes and i just picked up something for my niece and it was just it was like thirty bucks  i thought golly   um oh its just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is       um is when the kids get old enough that they really care what theyre wearing   oh yeah i can imagine   my kids are twelve and fifteen   oh   and um you know theyre both boys so theyre probably not as picky as if they were girls but       on the other hand  they can be pretty picky and you know     yeah   i mean i could get away with you know with it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because   umhum   they didnt care   yeah definitely   anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of       certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst   oh God yeah i can imagine   uh gee um my son just came out the other day and hes his what is it i think theyre Reebok   uhhuh   whatever my other son has Nike Airs at the moment but these Reeboks   oh     and i was thinking he bought them in March it was early March he bought them and they are demolished       i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them     oh my gosh   the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean thats how worn out they are       and they cost i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyns they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars   uhhuh wow on sale   on that much of a sale   oh my gosh   and my husband and i were just talking you know its i mean were talking minimum of three of those a year   oh my gosh   thats a hundred and eighty dollars a year for hi s tennis shoes     oh my gosh   you know and my husband   maybe i wont have kids   oh its just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of of really good you know work leather nice       mens dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said   uhhuh wow   but ill be still be wearing them in ten years   yeah   and and hes i mean were talking a just a piece of rag   oh no   so anyway   i just cant imagine   before we go visit grandma   yeah really well my mother had three girls but i dont remember being that picky about my clothes
