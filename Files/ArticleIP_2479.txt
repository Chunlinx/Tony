                                 The Case Against the Case Against Microsoft                           Note Ralph Nader madethe case againstMicrosoft in Slate two weeks ago In the following article hotlinkslead to more detailed discussion                        It is no crime for a companyto be successful The are designed to complement not displace market forcesThe laws do not prevent market winners from enjoying the fruits of theirsuccess or protect losers from the consequences of their failure            What theantitrust laws do condemn is anticompetitive conducttruly exclusionary orpredatory actsby firms that have the power to raise prices or excludecompetitors from the market Microsofts critics have never established thatMicrosoft and its conduct satisfy either element of the law            In most discussions of Microsoft it is just assumed thatthe company has monopoly power However no court has ever reached thatconclusion Even though more than  percent of the personal computers in theworld use Microsofts operating system it is far from clear that an antitrustcourt could be persuaded that personal computer operating systems constitute aseparate market After all Microsofts critics claim that browsers in the nearfuture will or perhaps already do             Evenassuming for the sake of argument that Microsoft does have monopoly power thequestion still is whether truly anticompetitive behavior accounts for itssuccess We dont need to speculate about the answer because governmentantitrust enforcers have spent the better part of seven years puttingMicrosofts competitive behavior under a microscope            Almost seven years ago the Federal TradeCommission set out to determine whether Microsoft had monopolized personalcomputer operating systems After one of the most extensive antitrustinvestigations in history completed by the Justice Department when the FTCfailed to issue a complaint the government found only a single ratherpicayune practicethe socalled per processor licenseworthy of challengeAccording to the government itself that practice did not account forMicrosofts competitive success Rather than suffer the cost and hassle oflitigation Microsoft agreed to a ending the practice            ForMicrosoft acceding to the consent decree was just the beginning Bill Gatescouldnt blow his nose without starting a new investigation The JusticeDepartment stopped Microsoft from acquiring Intuit the maker of Quickenpersonalfinance software It threatened to block Microsofts introduction ofWindows  because Microsoft included the             Now comes the charge that Microsoft has by including itsInternet browsing software Internet Explorer with Windows  Microsoftpoints to a that was negotiated by Microsoft for the specific purpose ofallowing the company to include IE with Windows            It istelling that the government chose not to attack the bundling of IE withWindows as an actual antitrust violationmerely as a violation of the consentdecree Whatever the technical merits of the governments interpretation of thedecree you have to wonder what important public interest will be served if thegovernments case succeeds Microsoft makes the IE browser to consumers who buynew personal computers with Windows  installed And more convenient seamlessaccess to the Internet from the desktop will  It is hard to see anyanticompetitive danger that justifies denying people these benefits            Microsofts inclusion of IE with Windows doesnot prevent computer manufacturers from installing competing browsers orputting those browsers on the desktop Indeed the computer companies thatwanted to take IE off their desktops the behavior Justice wants to preventMicrosoft from forbidding probably intended to give Netscape Navigator anexclusive position on the desktop Microsoft did not demand that Netscape beremoved only that IE be there as well This may be the first time that thegovernment has gone against a company with a smaller share of sales in order toprotect the ability of its dominant competitor to secure an exclusive            So afterseven years and millions of dollars spent investigating Microsoft thegovernment seems to have found virtually no anticompetitive acts to accountfor the companys success Is this because all Microsofts competitorslicensees and suppliers are too scared to tell the government what they knowUnlikely Has the government not tried hard enough Hardly All the incentivesfor antitrust enforcersmedia adulation professional recognition andcongressional budgetary rewardspush the government toward bagging thebiggest game We taxpayers are employing an army of lawyers and economists whospend their every waking momentand probably a few in dreamlandthinking ofways to get Microsoft They are the best in the business and their effortshave turned up precious little            The ongoing government scrutiny itself may help to explainthe absence of verifiable episodes of anticompetitive behavior by Microsoft Aswarm of government enforcers peering over a companys shoulder is a strongincentive for it to behave More fundamentally though Microsofts success isnot a mystery requiring any criminal explanation The real and obvious sourceis the good fortune of being the preeminent operating system on IBM PCs Thisis not an antitrust violation            Microsofts position is a reflection of an economic phenomenon often referredto as network externalities a k a positive economic feedback orincreasing returns to scale In the market for personal computers the valueof a machine is directly proportional to the number of applications that run onit Both suppliers and consumers will gravitate toward  regardless of whetherit is technically the best Once such a standard becomes predominant it willbe very difficult to displaceat least until the next paradigm shift comesalong            Being the operating system on IBM PCs whichset the standard for personal computing meant that Microsoft became thestandard personal computer operating system The fact that Microsoft won thatround is no guarantee it will emerge the winner of the next paradigm shift Inthe browser wars Microsoft faces a formidable array of opponentsSun andOracle to name just twoand after two years it still lags behind Netscapeeven though IE generally gets better reviews than Navigator            Microsofts competitorshowever want the government to put some sand in Microsofts saddlebagsHowever frightening Bill Gates may seem or however unfair and imperfect themarket phenomenon of network externalities may appear do we really wantantitrust lawyers and economists determining Internet standards Its difficultto believe the answer is yes
