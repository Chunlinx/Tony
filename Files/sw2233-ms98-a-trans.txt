              so what do you think of uh public schools today   well the problem were having down here in public schools is is financing for one thing   uh   uh and and the uh the tax districts theyre in the process of of rearranging the tax tax districts   so they cant decide   and uh some of the more rich schools are those are those schools that are financially well off are going to have to support those are arent especially in the minority neighborhoods neighborhoods   um   and uh theres a lot of problems with that   oh   a lot of debate going on with that   and and and the restriction is it sort of   yeah restructuring   sort of screwing screwing around with whoever is getting what money to what school   right right   yeah  we actually dont have we have were having some problems of own up here with teachers   yeah   but um we are we are apparently im im fairly new to Rochester ive only been here a couple a few years and we are supposedly Rochester public schools are are one of the model the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country   yeah   they have very specific programs that um that are being implemented at the moment that everybody is watching you know to make sure that theyre all theyre all working and uh for instance they have a mentor teacher program where um there are teachers who take a year off or so and gets to go around and and help other teachers learn how to teach   yeah   and things like that but theyre having a lot of problems here because um because they also pay the teachers i think much better than others places in the country   yeah thats a problem down here its uh   they they pay them well   uh not no not too well   oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers   yeah yeah   but theyre having a large problem negotiating contracts they have been in contract they have been without a contract i believe for over six months or something like six months   yeah   and they are now putting in you know some sort of federal arbitrator i think or something because they just have a horrible time getting the you know getting their contracts straightened out they have been good and they only walked out once or twice i believe they keep getting you know they theyll go all the way to your table theyll have some proposal and then   yeah   someone wont like it for some reason or some of them will say vote it down and it just goes but   yeah i think uh someone that really wanted it or i really dont understand or i guess i do understand people that i guess that want to teach teach its it must be inborn in them or something because theyre certainly not going into it for the for the money nor the prestige or whatever   yeah so that thats that thats always im im actually im a PhD student at the moment   yeah   and um its always occurred to me that that um you know i mean so looking at it so all so i have some bias in this   yeah   but it but its always seemed to me that that those people who should be paid the most i think or paid significantly you know significantly more are are teacher types because they sort of hold for of the future in our hands than almost anyone else yet yet i dont think that uh it it its being done i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think were lacking in some very specific areas   yeah   that that need to be worked on i will   i think one thing too thats hurting the teachers as far as recruiting teachers is that the uh theyve lost a lot of their their authority in the classroom   yeah how what do what do you mean by that   well i mean uh they no more punishment per se   oh yeah   i im speaking mostly of elementary   umhum   uh you know its if some if a teacher does anything that uh theyre liable to have a law suit against them for for uh cruel and unjust punishment or whatever   thats true thats true   its uh   but well i think that   and of course youve got the drugs and the uh other problems that you were much more prevalent than when i was going to school   yeah i think actually in any there are some places where some teachers are just afraid to teach you know are they going to or they go to work where theyre just baby sitters i think rather than teachers you know theyre job is to make sure that no kids get killed in their classroom for that day and   yeah   nobody else gets out so its hard to imagine a you know i mean i i i cant imagine teaching in a situation like that and actually trying to get anything across to a student   yeah   id be more concerned about getting myself out alive at the end of the day and just being happy so i i sit back that the thats one of the main things that sort of happens to be sure up you know in or educational system maybe i do that means you have to have a metal detector and and uh outside the school or something   yeah   im not sure   and uh also you know this is purely my my thoughts because i am im a Christian and i think when they took prayer out of school that uh uh i think it hurt   well possibly i think it does um im not sure i think it does some uh it it it it may sort of lead to some uh it it it may just be another form of sort of regimenting you know in kids which i which i think is good actually to have some kids sort of sit together and you know just say things and sort of do things together so possibly   yeah   possibly i think that um uh im im im actually Jewish so i suspect that i would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of prayer   yeah   in school but i think some things might be a a wise idea just to give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view   yeah   i think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today i would would i would agree with you and uh     and   i think somewhat although i do understand the issue of separation of church and state somewhat so i   yeah yeah i do too but uh   so i dont know how you resolve that you know i also i mean i think that our i think that our schools look a lot worse nowadays   yeah   relative to schools sort of in other countries as well like compared to the Japanese school system i was in a panel that would that addressed the issue of you know science and how our kids theyre just very very far behind of science because a lot of them just arent going into it because they just dont know anything about it and how its got to be upgraded now is all   well i i believe in freedom of but not freedom from if you understand what i mean   i think so you i i i read a little bit on that that that sounds interesting   right but uh weve like i say weve been redistricting here in Dallas has been a a major issue for i guess the last year   oh well hopefully theyll resolve it soon   yeah they uh they the voters voted one way and it and then uh some federal judge said no that was unconstitutional and they have had two or three votes and the city council is divided over what the district should be because they divide it one way and the minorities say were losing representation  representation and uh it its just a big battle   well i hope it all works out   but uh   yeah i i i have i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and ive yet to have any so   yeah yeah     so  im not quite at home with the issues yet   yeah   but im sure ill it will hit me a little harder in a couple of years   yeah and also the cost of it you know not not not great not uh public school but i cant imagine having to raise a kid now and and have to look to college   oh i cant even i cant imagine it   uh in the next you know fifteen years or so later they go its going up     my only hope is that uh is that whatever im going to wined of being college faculty somewhere i think   yeah   and my and my only hope is that um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach   yeah   because that typically is very otherwise i cant imagine it   yeah i i just dont see how a person could   it would   could put enough away enough money out of their paychecks to pay for our kids schooling within fifteen years   no i i i dont i it completely beyond me i went to my under graduate uh education   yeah   um on a lot of financial aid and where i am now im im only in graduate school because they waive tuition and   yeah   they pay for school a little bit otherwise i would never   yeah most kids is probably just going to have to do what i did   be comfortable again   either course the service im at i dont think gives a education uh after service   well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for   yeah but uh thats how i got my my education such as it was was going into it is service and then coming back coming out in three years and getting uh two years paid for   thats thats actually a great way i think i know i have lots of friends who are doing things like that   yeah   i think its a great way i couldnt im actually deaf in one ear so they wouldnt take me   yeah yeah   um but that is a real a real i mean thats a real good way to do it i think i think that you know these people are sort of getting the money and doing something for it so   yeah   i think its real good anyway its its been it was nice meeting you   okay and im im glad to have met you oh are are work with Texas Instruments   and no im not im just like you a person on the uh phone   oh okay i was wondering   thing   i guess this is not just Texas Instruments wide cause i worked for Texas Texas Instruments that thats   oh no
