                    Background        The dihydropyridine receptor DHPR of skeletal muscle        consists of          S                      a and           subunits     The           subunit is a large fourrepeat        transmembrane protein of  KDa that contains the basic        functional elements of the Ltype Ca channel including        the Ca selective pore and S voltagesensing        transmembrane segments in each of the four internal repeats             subunits are  kDa cytosolic proteins essential        for membrane trafficking modulation of channel kinetics        and for excitationcontraction EC coupling      The                  subunit is a highly glycosylated         kDa protein formed by two disulfidelinked peptides            whereas the           subunit is a  kDa skeletal        musclespecific protein of four presumptive transmembrane        domains with almost unknown function             Skeletal muscle cells utilize the voltage sensors formed        by the S segments to trigger a rapid elevation of        cytosolic Ca  thus coupling membrane excitation to        muscle cell contraction Subsequent to charge movements in        the voltage sensors a conformational change in the DHPR is        transmitted to the ryanodine receptor RyR presumably        via proteinprotein interactions     Ultimately there        is a brief opening of the RyR channel resulting in the        release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum SR        Numerous observations have lent support to this view and        especially significant are the functional expression        studies in dysgenic myotubes lacking          S  The dysgenic myotube is devoid of        Ltype Ca current charge movements and EC coupling All        three are restored in the dysgenic myotube by expression of                 S       These results        corroborated the essential role of          S in the mechanism of EC coupling of        skeletal muscle cells        The mechanism by which the DHPR signals the RyR is        poorly understood      Domains in the cytoplasmic        linker between repeats II and III have been clearly        implicated          and some regions such as        ThrLue were suggested to trigger RyR opening by        binding to RyR     However extensive deletions        within the IIIII linker that eliminate the RyR binding        region and other suggested signaling regions in the IIIII        loop     do not entirely eliminate EC coupling             Hence additional domains of          S andor other DHPR subunits appear to        be engaged by the voltage sensor and contribute to an EC        coupling signal In this respect the contribution of the        a subunit of the DHPR to EC coupling in skeletal muscle        cells has been extensively documented               In the present report we characterized a frameshift        mutant of          S that expresses two complementary        fragments of          S  Complementation between the two          S fragments produced recovery of EC        coupling in dysgenic muscle cells lacking          S  The results suggest the EC coupling        voltage sensor of skeletal muscle is modular in function        and can be assembled from separate hemiCa channel        fragments                    Results and Discussion                  Expression of a frameshift mutation of  Sin          dysgenic myotubes          Primers for the frameshift mutant fs           S  were originally designed to          delete the mer ThrLeu in the cytosolic loop          between repeats II and III of            S and to generate a fulllength            S carrying this internal deletion A          proofreading error during a PCR reaction resulted in an          amplified DNA with the desired deletion but also          containing an additional thymidine following the TTG          codon for Leu Fig A The onebase shift in reading          frame introduced a serine at position  followed          immediately by a stop codon Fig B This frameshift          mutation was religated into an otherwise fulllength            S  subcloned into the mammalian          expression vector pSG and transfected into dysgenic            S null myotubes Fs           S was abundantly expressed in primary          dysgenic myotubes in culture Fig C and produced the          expected truncated            S protein Fig D Western blots          using Nterminus Ttagged fs           S and Ttagged fulllength            S showed that the expressed          fulllength            S protein migrated with an apparent          molecular weight of approximately  KDa under reducing          conditions This result is consistent with the mobility          of the native purified skeletal muscle            S subunit     The fs           S migrated with a molecular weight of          approximately  KDa which is entirely consistent with          the theoretical molecular weight of the expressed          fragment which was  KDa Furthermore fold          overloading of the SDSPAGE gel failed to detect any          fragment of a size comparable to fulllength            S not shown                          Recovery of EC coupling by the frameshift a          ScDNA          EC coupling was investigated in voltageclamped          myotubes with simultaneous monitoring of intracellular Ca          using confocal fluorescence of fluo     Controls          shown in Fig Aindicated that the overwhelming majority          of nontransfected dysgenic muotubes  of  cells did          not produce detectable Ca transients  FFo or          Ca currents  pAcell in response to          depolarization under voltageclamp This is shown in the          linescan images of fluo fluorescence in Fig Aand the          corresponding traces of ICa during a ms          depolarization to  mV and  mV delivered at the          start of the line scan in the same cell However in two          cells  of  cells we observed Idys the lowdensity          endogenous Ca current previously described in dysgenic          myotubes      The reason for the low abundance of          this current in these cultured myotubes is unknown Ca          currents and stimulated fluorescence for one of the          cells expressing Idys is shown in Fig B We observed a          peak ICa density of approximately  pApF and a          barely detectable fluorescence signal which in Fig Bis          indicated by the arrow in the trace of integrated          fluorescence at  mV This small fluorescence signal          disappeared entirely at  mV suggesting it might be          contributed directly by Idys or might be due to SR Ca          release induced by Idys The voltage dependence of the          fluorescence signal and ICa are compared in Fig Cfor          the two cells expressing Idys and for the vast majority          of cells which altogether did not express intracellular          Ca transients or ICa  The maximum fluorescence          signal contributed by Idys when Idys was present was           FFo units Furthermore the shape of the          fluorescence vs voltage relationship was bellshaped and          a mirror image of the ICa vs voltage curve These          controls indicated that nontransfected dysgenic myotubes          are lowbackground cells that do not express          voltageactivated Ca signals of major consequence for          the present studies          Fig shows that fs           S recovered a significant fraction of          the voltageactivated Ca transient compared to that          express by fulllength wt           S  The magnitude of the fluorescence          signal expressed by fs           S was approximately fold larger          than the largest Ca transient detected in          nontransfected myotubes expressing Idys fold          larger than the average Ca transient detectable in          nontransfected cells and about  of the maximum SR Ca          release expressed by the control wt           S construct Thus we are confident          that the voltageevoked Ca transient in cells          transfected by fs           S cells was a direct consequence of          the expressed protein Also shown in Fig is ICa          activated by the ms depolarization used to activate          the Ca transient fs           S did not express Ltype Ca current          even though it was consistently able to activate the Ca          transient in  of  cells Absence of ICa was          further verified using longer ms depolarizing pulses          not shown The skeletal nature of the EC coupling          expressed by fs           S is shown in Fig A The peak Ca          vs voltage relationship expressed by fs           S  like that of wt           S  was sigmoidal in shape reaching a          maximum at large positive potentials  mV a range          in which ICa is progressively small The line scans of          Fig Bfurther confirmed that a Ca transient of similar          shape and magnitude was observed in a fs           S transfected myotube in the absence          of external Ca  Hence the signaling mechanism like          that reported in normal myotubes and dysgenic myotubes          expressing wt           S  was Ca entry independent              We also expressed fs           S in cultured myotubes from two          available gene knockout KO mice lacking the          endogenous a isoform of the skeletal muscle DHPR             and lacking RyR     As shown in Fig B we failed          to detect EC coupling in these KO cells transfected with          fs           S  In summary the EC coupling          expressed by fs           S is strictly skeletaltype and          requires RyR and DHPR a                          fs Sexpresses two complementary protein          fragments          The EC coupling recovered by fs           S could be due either to the activity          of the Nterminal half of            S alone or to proteinprotein          complementation between the Nterminal half and a          fragment expressing the Cterminal half of            S  The Cterminal half of            S could have been translated by the          fs           S expression vector if the ATG codon          Met which is downstream from the TGA termination          codon and is inframe with the wildtype message Fig B          served as open reading frame for translation of the          second half of the wt message Although this would be          unusual the fact that the codon for Met is only           bases downstream from the termination codon could have          substantially increased the possibility of a restart of          the translation of the second half of the message at          Met This phenomenon has been described in eukaryotic          cells and in viralinfected mammalian cells and is known          as translation by leaky ribosomal scanning      To          test this explanation the presumptive restart condon          Met was mutated to Ile in the fs           S template If fs           S recovered EC coupling by virtue of          expressing a single protein fragment then fs           S MI should also recover EC          coupling since the mutation was introduced downstream          from the stop codon Fig shows that this was not the          case Fs           S MI did not recover Ca          transients in  of  tested cells consistent with          leaky ribosomal scanning As a positive control we          coexpressed fs           S MI and the Cterminus half of            S  namely            S  cloned into a separate pSG          vector The results in Fig indicated that            S  alone was inactive However          when myotubes were cotransfected with fs           S MI and            S  each in a separate pSG          vector there was a robust recovery of Ca transients in           of  cells Fig Ashows fluorescence vs voltage          relationships for the fs           S MI mutant and for this mutant          coexpressed with            S  The combined expression of          the two complementary fragments of            S resulted in a robust recovery of EC          coupling with sigmoidal Ca release vs voltage          characteristics A summary of the maximum fluorescence          during the Ca transient in response to a depolarization          to  mV is shown in Fig B The magnitude of the Ca          transient expressed by fs           S MI             S  was indistinguishable from          that of wt           S ttest significance p   see          figure legend To confirm expression of the Cterminus          half of            S in cells transfected with fs           S  we used the IIIII loop          polyclonal antibody SKI    directed against epitope          AlaIle which is downstream from Met Fig          Cshows that the IIIII loop antibody recognized the          Cterminus half when cells were transfected with fs           S but not when myotubes were          transfected with fs           S MI The Cterminal protein          migrated with a molecular weight of approximately  KDa          which is consistent with the theoretical molecular weight          of  KDa Finally Fig Dshows that fs           S MI was abundantly expressed in          myotubes in the absence or presence of the Cterminal          fragment This indicated that the absence of EC coupling          observed in myotubes expressing fs           S MI was not due the production of          a labile protein In summary the recovery of EC coupling          by coexpression of two functionally inactive proteins          Fig  taken together with the immunoblots Fig C          favor the explanation that  fs           S recovers DHPR function by virtue of          expressing two complementary fragments of            S and  the expression of the          Cterminal half of            S by fs           S is likely to occur by leaky          ribosomal scanning                          Implications for EC coupling in skeletal          myotubes          Except for the magnitude the SR Ca release signal          expressed by fs           S was entirely typical of skeletal          myotubes with sigmoidal voltagedependence proceeding in          the absence of external Ca and requiring RyR A          comparison of the maximum fluorescence FFo max at           mV Fig B shows that the signal generated by fs           S was significantly smaller than that          generated by the control construct wt           S vs fs           S ttest significance p   and          smaller than that generated by the two coexpressed          fragments fs           S vs fs           S MI             S  ttest significance p            These observation suggests that the magnitude of          the Ca release appears to be limited by the low yield          of expression of the Cterminal fragment achieved by          leaky ribosomal scanning of the second half of the fs           S message To test this explanation          further we coexpressed fs           S and the Cterminal half of            S each in a separate pSG vector We          found that fs           S and             S together expressed Ca          transients with a FFo max similar to wt           S control not shown Thus we are          certain that the EC coupling expressed by fs           S is mechanistically similar to          control skeletaltype EC coupling but limited in          magnitude by a comparatively lower density of functional          DHPRs that are assembled in cells expressing fs           S  It is conceivable that the          functional integrity of the fragmented            S protein is maintained in part by          the  subunit of the DHPR which spans both halves of the           pore subunit by binding to the III loop and the          Cterminus      Consistent with this explanation          we failed to detect EC coupling recovery when fs           S was expressed in null          myotubes          Earlier studies in the voltagegated Na channel had          shown that pore function was not compromised when the          IIIII linker or IIIIV linker was cut and the two          fragments were coexpressed each in a separate vector              We would thus conclude that in the case of the Ca          channel an intact IIIII loop is essential for this          function since neither fs           S nor the combined expression of the          two truncated fragments not shown was able to rescue Ca          current This result is entirely consistent with the          identification of the IIIII loop as critical for          enhancement of Ltype Ca current expression by the RyR              However EC coupling per se can clearly proceed          with a cut in the IIIII loop This was shown here by the          behavior of the fs           S construct and elsewhere by          expressing the Nterminal half            S  and the Cterminal half            S  each with entirely wt          sequence and each in a separate expression vector              The fact that ThrLeu region known as Peptide A             is missing in fs           S suggests this mer domain is not          critical for the conformation change transmitted from the          DHPR to the RyR To test this further we generated an          inframe deletion of this region as originally intended          that showed normal function     Another domain          critical for EC coupling is Csk downstream from Peptide          A LeuGln This region was identified using          chimeras of            S and            C     Since Csk is present in                     S  and was detected by the          IIIII loop antibody which is directed against the center          portion of Csk     the participation of this          domain in the EC cannot be ruledout          In eukaryotic cells translation starts at the AUG          codon nearest to the  end of the mRNA and this          initiator site is found by sequential ribosomal scanning          in the  to  direction     However translation          initiation at internal AUGs due to leaky ribosomal          scanning has been documented especially for mRNAs          consisting of a short leader ORF upstream from the main          ORF In some cases reassembly of a new ribosomal          initiation complex after the terminator codon of the          leader ORF serves to reinitiate translation at the          initiator AUG codon for the main ORF and thus two          proteins are generated     In other cases leaky          scanning by the ribosomal initiation complex bypasses the          located leader ORF entirely and only the internal          ORF is translated     In the case of fs           S  we are not entirely certain which          mechanism best applies A bypass of the ORF at the  end          of the            S mRNA in favor of a presumed ORF at          Met is unlikely because a Cterminal fragment of the          size expressed by            S  has not been detected in          skeletal muscle with the SKI antibody    or other          antibodies     Thus Met is not an internal          initiation site under normal circumstances Entry of a          new ribosomal complex at Met seems a more likely          explanation However reinitiation after a stop has only          been described for cases in which the leader ORF is no          longer than  codons because initiation factors fall off          shortly after recognition of the initiator AUG              In the case of fs           S  what can be considered the          leader ORF encodes for a protein of  residues Hence          we are not certain if reinitiation of translation after          a stop signal as currently described in the literature          would apply here At the same time it is important to          point out that in the present studies fs           S expression is under the control of          a viral promoter and that in this hybrid viralmammalian          expression system the rules pertaining to leaky          ribosomal scanning may be different The mechanism of          translation of the fs           S clearly deserves closer scrutiny in          the future                            Conclusions        The present studies show EC coupling recovery by a        frameshift mutant of          S due to proteinprotein        complementation of the Nterminal and Cterminal halves of                 S  The Nterminal half houses repeats        I and II with the adjoining cytosolic loop and the        Cterminal half houses most of the IIIII loop along with        repeats III and IV with the adjoining loop Proteinprotein        complementation between the Nterminal and Cterminal        fragments produced a DHPR capable of functioning as EC        coupling voltage sensor thus suggesting the presence of at        least two functional modules within          S  Recent evidence suggests that the        four internal repeats of the voltagegated Na channel        which is closely related to the Ltype Ca channel encoded        by the DHPR have nonequivalent functional roles because        the S segments of repeats I and II move much faster than        those of repeats III and IV     By analogy the        fastmoving module of the DHPR would be represented by        the Nterminal fragment and the slowermoving module by        the Cterminal fragment Interactions between these two        modules are likely to be critical for intramembrane charge        movements in the assembled fourrepeat channel and for        coupling the movement of the S gating charges to the        opening of the RyR channel Future studies of gating        currents in each hemiCa channel fragment should provide        valuable information on how the fast and slow gating        modules interact during EC coupling in skeletal muscle        The Cterminal fragment was generated by an unusual        restart of translation of the fs         S message at M presumably by leaky        ribosomal scanning and was eliminated by a MI mutation        Hence a premature stop codon in the IIIII loop upstream        of M may not necessarily cause a loss of DHPR function        because in these cases function would be recovered by        complementation between protein fragments expressed by the        same cDNA From a methodological perspective leaky        scanning could be further used as a means to control        protein expression to desired levels since restart of        translation after a premature stop codon is sensitive to        the number of nucleotides separating the stop and restart        codons     By changing the position of the restart        methionine relative to the premature stop codon it might        be possible to significantly change the level of expression        of the distal
