                    Background        The G proteincoupled receptors constitute a large        family of receptors widely distributed in the mammalian        central nervous system CNS Classical neurotransmitter        receptors such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors        mAChR adrenergic dopaminergic serotoninergic as well        as neuropeptide receptors belong to this family           In vitro studies in transfected cells        show that following receptor activation by an agonist that        induces signal transduction G proteincoupled receptor        undergoes phosphorylation endocytosis and dissociation        from their ligand in the endosome and finally the        receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane            The deltaopioid receptor is a member of the seven        transmembrane superfamily of Gprotein coupled receptors                   In vitro studies carried out on        NG neurohybrid cells which express large numbers of        opioid receptors show that these receptors undergo a        rapid agonistinduced desensitization that occurs within        minutes and downregulation that occurs more slowly over        several hours    The internalization of        receptoragonist ligand complex has been detected with        similar kinetics to those of downregulation    These        findings raise two related questions  can opioid        receptors be internalized         in vivo by the same agonistinduced        endocytosis observed         in vitro  and if this is the case         does the internalization process have the same kinetics        reported from         in vitro studies        We examined the effect of dermenkephalin a specific        opioid agonist in order to mimic the effect of a strong        and constant activation by an agonist on the distribution        of the opioid receptors in the dorsal horn of the rat        spinal cord We used a monoclonal antiidiotypic antibody        antiId mAb raised against the opioid receptors          and detected by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry        In the present work we demonstrate that opioid receptor        undergo rapid agonistinduced endocytosis in the CNS                    Results        Light microscopy revealed that the regional distribution        of antiId mAb immunoreactivity in control rats receiving        saline solution was comparable to previous studies using        unoperated rats      A high concentration of        immunoreactivity was localized in the superficial layers of        the dorsal horn Fig a In addition labelling was found        around the central canal layer X Fig b and in the        ventral horn Ultrastructural study of lamina I and II        showed that immunoreactivity was mainly localized at        appositions between two neurites axodendritic Fig a        and axoaxonic appositions Fig b were noted Some        neurites displayed multiple labelling sites at appositions        with dendrite andor axon as shown in Fig  We never        observed staining directly at the level of a synaptic        differentiation However synaptic differentiations were        occasionally near or in continuity with sites of        axodendritic labelling Fig a Occasionally the        labelling was at the interface between a neurite and a        glial process in laminae I and II of the spinal cord In        all cases it was not possible to associate the membrane        labelling with one or the other profile due to the        localization of the labelling strictly in the extracellular        space A few intracellular labellings were also found        mainly associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum RER        and Golgi apparatus in the soma of labelled cells not        shown see         For rats receiving the cocktail of peptidase inhibitors        at the ultrastructural level we observed a pattern of        labelling comparable to that described in rats receiving a        saline solution not shown No visible redistribution of        antiid mAb immunoreactivity was observed in response to        kelatorphan and thiorphan        Fifteen minutes after dermenkephalin administration the        ultrastructural analysis showed a pattern of labelling        quite different from that observed in the control rats in        lamina I At the level of labelling the plasma membrane        was noticeably invaginated Fig a and b Most of the        labelling was associated with axon terminals Fig a        Dendritic labelling was also found Fig b but was less        abundant The rest of the labelling was associated with        unidentifiable profiles In lamina II labelling was        associated with both invaginated and flat plasma        membrane        In sections from the four animals studied after         minutes of stimulation immunoreactivity was observed        intracellularly In lamina I large vesicles  nm        nm were labelled in the cytoplasm close to the plasma        membrane Fig c Labelled microtubules were also found        Fig d No extracellular labelling associated with the        plasma membrane was found in this lamina In lamina II        cytoplasmic labellings mainly labelled vesicles as well        as membrane labellings not restricted to the invaginated        area were found                    Discussion        In this study we provide morphological evidence that        opioid receptors are endocytosed in response to        dermenkephalin         in vivo  The choice of        dermenkephalin as agonist in this study was determined by        the intrinsic quality of this ligand Isolated from the        skin of the frog         Phyllomedusa sauvagei   this        natural peptide shows the highest affinity for the opioid        receptor  nM and a selectivity of fold greater        for the  than the opioid receptors even when compared        to the other very potent deltorphin I isolated from the        frog         Phyllomedusa bicolor   which has        an affinity of  nM and a selectivity of  fold        greater  Both peptides along with the dermorphin and        the deltorphin II also isolated from amphibian skin        possess an unique feature among peptides synthesized by        animal cells in having a Damino acid residue providing a        very strong resistance to enzymatic degradation to these        ligands Considering our experimental conditions        particularly using a single         in vivo injection the dermenkephalin        seemed the most suitable agonist ligand to specifically        stimulate the opioid receptor and provoke a possible        internalization of the receptor due to its affinity as well        as to its strong resistance to degradation        The selectivity of the rat monoclonal antiidiotypic        antibody used as primary antibody to recognize the opioid        receptor antiId mAb in the present report has been        thoroughly investigated in previous studies            First the antiId mAb raised against an anti DADLE           totally inhibited the agonist ligandantiligand        interaction showing a good antiidiotypic activity        Second it was able to label the opioid receptor        expressed by the NG  cell line and inhibited HDADLE        binding to this same cell line The antiId mAb was also        able to precipitate a  Da molecule in the NG         cells Third in rat spinal cord   we found that        preincubation of fixed tissue with specific opioid        ligands DADLE Metenkephalin dermenkephalin and        naltrindole at  M totally prevented the antibody        labeling showing a good competition between ligands and        the antiId mAb Fourth we also found previously in rat        spinal cord that antiId mAb has an hundredfold greater        affinity for opioid receptors than opioid receptors          Taken together these data show that antiId mAb is a        reliable tool to specifically detect the opioid receptor        using immunocytochemical techniques        In the present study we found in our control group the        same pattern of labelling seen by earlier studies in        unoperated rats     suggesting that saline        injection at the level of the spinal cord does not        provoke a visible redistribution of the opioid sites at        the plasma membrane No labelling associated with an        invaginated plasma membrane was found in our experimental        control rats        In rats receiving the cocktail of peptidase inhibitor        ie without dermenkephalin no modification of the        opioid receptor distribution was noted compared with our        control rats receiving only NaCl A previous study showed        that kelatorphan in addition to blocking the degradation of        the exogenous peptide by suppressing the aminopeptidase        activity markedly increased the spontaneous release of        endogenous Metenkephalin         in vivo and         in vitro   Thiorphan is a potent        enkephalinase inhibitor   Nevertheless it seems that        under our experimental conditions even if more enkephalin        was released by the kelatorphan and this enkephalin was        selectively protected from degradation by thiorphan no        receptor endocytosis was observed in response to endogenous        enkephalin However no nociceptive stimulation was applied        in our protocol and we therefore can not exclude the        possibility that insufficient enkephalin was released to        provoke the internalization of the opioid receptor        Another hypothesis poses the question of whether the        internalization process is agonistselective In a study        carried out         in vivo on guinea pig ileum          the authors showed a rapid endocytosis of the opioid        receptor in neurons in response to etorphine stimulation        but not after morphine administration This shows that        using a highaffinity agonist such as morphine it is not        possible to trigger the endocytosis process The authors        suggest that morphine has low intrinsic activity at        opioid receptor compared for instance to the lower        affinity  agonist DAla NMePhe Gly olenkephaline        DAMGO which is able to trigger an internalization        process This differential agonistselective response for        the same receptor could participate in mechanisms        regulating cellular adaptation to ligands We do not know        if endogenous enkephalins are able to induce the        endocytosis of opioid receptors         in vivo  A recent study carried out        on organotypic cultures and neuromuscular preparations        demonstrated a possible internalization process of opioid        receptor by endogenously released enkephalins after        electrical stimulation   Our data presented here show        clearly that without any kind of stimulation the        endogenously released enkephalins even protected by        enkephalinase inhibitors were not able to induced an        internalization of the opioid receptors in the rat spinal        cord Nevertheless a more specific study should be        conducted in order to answer this question        By contrast application of dermenkephalin induced an        internalization of the opioid receptor within  minutes        Dermenkephalin is markedly increased in potency in the        presence of peptidase inhibition more than one hundred        fold with a cocktail of bacitracin bestatin and        captopril as in Kramers study   and to a greater        extent with kelatorphan and thiorphan as used in the        present study This suggests that the effect observed after        dermenkephalin application associated with the peptidase        inhibition is probably stronger than the potency of        dermenkephalin alone It seems that the opioid receptor        was internalized to a greater extent in the lamina I than        in the deeper layers This could be due to a gradient of        diffusion in the tissues of dermenkephalin        Our results show a majority of labelling associated with        axons confirming the reports that opioid receptors        mainly have a presynaptic localization in the dorsal horn        of the rat spinal cord      On the other        hand association of labelling with a dendrite is        consistent with the existence of a postsynaptic receptor        population in lamina I and II This is in agreement with        data obtained after unilateral dorsal rhizotomy which        showed residual and presumably postsynaptic  sites                 We cannot exclude the possibility that labelled vesicles        found in the cytoplasm after  minutes of stimulation may        correspond to receptors in the process of expression to the        plasma membrane Studies using direct antibodies raised        against the opioid sites has shown immunoreactivity        mostly associated with large dense core vesicles in the        normal rat dorsal horn    Intracellular labelling        was also found in our control rats but the association of        labelling was mainly with RER and Golgi apparatus in soma        probably corresponding to receptors in the process of        synthesis or recycling This observation confirms findings        described in our recent study where somatic labelling was        detected   Also a few labelled vesicles have been        outlined in our previous study   but the frequency of        this association was slight and not comparable with those        described in the present study after stimulation by        dermenkephalin The differences found in the distribution        of the labelling membrane labelling versus intracellular        labelling between our study and the direct antibody study          may be due to the intrinsic characteristic between an        antiidiotypic antibody raised against the binding site of        the receptor and a direct antibody recognizing a fragment        of the receptor Taken together the data suggest that        immunoreactive vesicles found in our study are the result        of an internalization of the opioid receptors in response        to the stimulation by dermenkephalin        Our results indicate that opioid receptors undergo        rapid agonistregulated endocytosis which is similar to        that exhibited by a variety of peptide hormones and growth        factors    as well as certain G proteincoupled        receptors like adrenergic receptors   neurotensin        receptors   or substance P receptors   In        adrenergic receptors which have been characterized in        detail rapid endocytosis appears to be required for        resensitization of receptors following agonistinduced        phosphorylation   For opioid receptors the fate of        the internalized receptors is still uncertain         In vivo studies have shown that  H        lofentanyl a mu agonist is internalized in axon terminals        of rat vagus nerve and transported retrogradely in the        nodose ganglion   A more recent study carried out in        rat spinal cord slices found a possible internalization of        opioid receptor after stimulation by DAMGO           In vitro studies carried out on        NG a neurohybrid cell expressing opioid receptors        showed internalization after the application of opioid        agonists in bath medium like DADLE or etorphin           The internalized receptors are then compartmentalized in        particular into lysosomes and Golgi apparatus   More        recently         in vitro studies carried out on        opioid receptors showed that following a rapid        internalization in response to an agonist stimulation the        endocytosed receptors were recycled back to the plasma        membrane   It seems that the internalizationrecycling        process is a necessary step in the resensitization of the        receptor         In vivo  due to the current        experimental conditions the fate of internalized receptors        remains to be examined        Our findings demonstrate that dermenkephalin after         in vivo administration can induce an        internalization of the opioid receptor at the level of        the spinal cord The effect of the reduction of receptor        number at the plasma membrane might be a rapid decrease of        the physiological response to the stimulus These results        bring an important confirmation that data obtained in an         in vitro system for G proteincoupled        receptor internalization   are relevant to the CNS         in vivo  The consequences on        receptor expression recycling andor degradation remain        to be established                    Materials and methods        Experiments were performed on twelve male  gm        Wistar rats housed in controlled environmental conditions          C  h alternate lightdark cycles food and water                ad libitum  for at least one week        before being used for the experiments Three groups of four        animals were used two groups received dermenkephalin and        one control group received  NaCl Two additional rats        received a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors ie without        dermenkephalin in NaCl for  and  minutes to check if        the endogenous enkephalins protected by kelatorphan and        thiorphan could by themselves induce receptor        internalization        Under deep urethane anesthesia  g kg body weight        the cisterna magna was opened A catheter was inserted        intrathecally in the subarachnoid space to the level of the        fourth or fifth cervical segment The two experimental        groups received intrathecally  l of a mixture containing         M of thiorphan and  M of kelatorphan to delay the        degradation of the peptide ligand and  M of        dermenkephalin TyrDMetPheHisLeuMetAspNH           Sigma a selective  agonist           in  NaCl Control rats received  l  NaCl        A few minutes after injection the catheter was gently        removed Fifteen or  minutes after the intrathecal        injection the rats were perfused with  ml of  NaCl        containing  sodium nitrite as washing solution followed        by about  ml of fixative containing   paraformaldehyde        in Srensen buffer  M pH  The procedure for the        ultrastructural localization of opioid receptors was        carried out as previously described   Briefly        transverse sections of cervical and thoracic cord  m        were cut with a vibratome A rat monoclonal antiidiotypic        antibody antiId mAb  mgml generated against an        anti DAla DLeu Enkephalin DADLE antibody and        displaying affinity for opioid receptors    was        used as the primary antibody The sections were incubated        with the antiId mAb at  dilution in Srensen buffer        containing  normal sheep serum overnight at C followed        by an incubation with biotinylated antirat IgG         dilution for  hour Vector Laboratories and then with        avidinbiotinhorseradish peroxidase complex ABCHRP        Vector Laboratories for  hour After rinsing the        peroxidase activity was revealed with diaminobenzidine        Sigma  mg ml TrisHCl in the presence of         hydrogen peroxide Finally the sections were postfixed        with  osmium tetroxide dehydrated and flat embedded in        araldite Semithin and ultrathin sections were cut and        contrasted with lead citrate and examined with a JEOL X        electron microscope
