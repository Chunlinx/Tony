                    Background        In  the National Institutes of Health Consensus        Development Conference    concluded that breast        conserving surgery BCS followed by radiation is an        appropriate method of primary treatment for the majority of        women with early stage breast cancer AJCC stages    I        IIA and IIB Numerous clinical studies have shown that        survival after BCS followed by radiation therapy is        equivalent to survival following mastectomy for women in        these stages       Some absolute indicators for        mastectomy remain      in particular widespread        malignanttype microcalcifications previous radiotherapy        and a relation of tumor size to breast size that would not        allow a cosmetically satisfactory result Although there        has been an increase in the use of BCS since the early        s an apparent underutilization of BCS among women for        whom such treatment was not contraindicated has been        documented     Geographic location type of hospital        and health plan and personal preferences have been        investigated as possible factors to explain the continued        use of mastectomy        Comorbidity    has        been found to be an important predictor among older        women        The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER        cancer registries do not collect sufficient detail to        examine some of these issues and medical records reviews        are time consuming Insurance claims data are a        costeffective alternative they have already been        collected and put into an electronic format by the        insurance carriers They cover large segments of the        population allow followup use standardized codes             and do not rely on subject recall In cancer research        insurance claims data have been used to estimate the        effectiveness of cervical cancer screening     to        assess the role of screening practices in the incidence of        prostate cancer     and to estimate mammography        participation     Medicare enrollees in Seattle and        San Francisco who received care from a Health Maintenance        Organization HMO were found to receive more BCS than        women in FeeForService FFS plans     Whereas a        MedicareSEER registry linked data set has been used        extensively to examine treatment and screening issues in        individuals  years and older     linking of        insurance claims data from private health plans in younger        populations has been more difficult because of the large        number of health plans in most geographic areas However        Hawaii provides unique opportunities for insurance claims        research because the majority of medical care is received        within the state and more than  of the population           are covered by a limited number of health plans As a pilot        project we were able to link data from the Hawaii Tumor        Registry and from a health plan in Hawaii The objectives        of this analysis were to describe breast cancer treatment        and comorbid conditions using the insurance claims data and        to examine possible determinants of BCS         vs mastectomy for breast cancer        patients with stage I and II disease                    Methods                  Data Sources          The HTR has maintained a database of all cases of          cancer diagnosed in the State of Hawaii since  and          became part of the SEER program in  The HTR record          contains demographic characteristics such as age          ethnicity marital status island of residence as well          as information on tumor size extent of disease lymph          node involvement and tumor grade From medical records          in hospitals and physicians offices information is          collected on the initial course six months in the Hawaii          Tumor Registry of cancerdirected treatment following          diagnosis Quality control reviews have shown that          caseascertainment through HTR has been virtually          complete     Over  of cancer cases reported to          the registry are histologically confirmed The HTR also          maintains a link with Hawaii Department of Health which          allows for death information to be captured in the HTR          database                          Linking          The insurance claims for this study were obtained from          a local insurer who was a party to the memorandum of          agreement The linked data set contained cancer cases          diagnosed from  through  During the linking          process a list of health plan members who had at least          two cancer diagnostic codes in their claims history were          matched against the HTR using a probabilistic method For          each matched record the health plan furnished all claims          data for that period They also indicated whether the          individual was enrolled in a FeeForService FFS or a          capitated HMO plan a choice provided by the insurer          However the majority of linked cancer cases belonged to          the FFS plan and the HMO plan provided by this insurer          differs considerably from a typical HMO Individuals aged           years and older were included only if they were still          working and had primary coverage through the health plan          or if they were covered under Medicare but also had          secondary coverage through the health plan The dataset          furnished by the health insurer contained all claims          processed for cancer patients in this study The data          elements included date of service International          Classification of Disease version  ICD diagnosis          codes     Current Procedural Terminology CPT codes              and the provider specialty code The dataset          contained claims for services from physicians          laboratories freestanding facilities as well as          outpatient services provided by hospital facilities                          Data set          Breast cancer cases accounted for  of all cancer          cases recorded in the HTR during the period from  to           In the linked dataset  of the cases were          breast cancer cases Using the ICDCM code range             for breast cancer  to  we identified           female breast cancer cases We then excluded  cases          diagnosed after June   because we would not have a          complete history of claims data covering at least six          months of treatment We also identified  women who had          been recorded twice in the linked dataset because breast          cancer was diagnosed in both breasts as identified by          the laterality codes For  women the diagnosis date          was identical in which case we considered the two          diagnoses as one case For the six cases with different          diagnoses dates we retained both records because there          was a separate completed course of treatment for the          cancer in each breast We eliminated one case that was in          the linked dataset and had inpatient data but no          outpatient data resulting in a dataset containing           breast cancer cases                          Staging          We used the HTR information in the Extent of Disease          EOD field    to determine the American Joint          Committee on Cancer AJCC TNM stage     where T          represents the primary tumor size N refers to lymph node          involvement and M refers to presence of metastases In          cases where the tumor size was unknown we assigned a          stage only if the size was not a determinant in the TNM          grouping If the extension was unknown we equated it to          extension  confinement to breast tissue and fat For          the small number of cases N   for whom lymph node          involvement code was unknown we considered this the same          as no lymph node involvement because the tumor size was          so small for these cases that a lymph node dissection was          not considered necessary at the time of this study The          results of the TNM staging agreed well with the SEER          summary stage codes                          Cancer treatment          We used the CPT codes    in the claims dataset to          identify the type of surgery performed For mastectomies          we included codes for simple and subcutaneous          mastectomies  and  radical mastectomies           and  and modified radical mastectomy           BCS was identified by the CPT codes for partial          mastectomies   We also included codes for          excision of breast cysts or lesions  and  as          these codes meet the definition of a lumpectomy although          we recognize that some surgeons may have billed these          codes for excisional biopsies as a diagnostic procedure          If BCS was initially performed but followed by a          subsequent mastectomy the subject was classified in the          mastectomy group This situation would have occurred when          the BCS code was actually used for a diagnostic biopsy          and the subsequent surgical treatment was a mastectomy or          in situations where a lumpectomy was first selected but          a mastectomy became necessary because pathological          examination revealed cancerous cells in the margins of          the excised tissue CPT codes  to  were          selected to determine whether radiation therapy was          received Several CPT codes and also a number of other          codes used by the health plan for billing were considered          evidence of chemotherapy treatment                          Comorbidities          Information on the existence of comorbidities was          extracted from the claims data using the occurrence of          ICD codes associated with comorbid conditions included          in the Charlson Index     We also analyzed data for          conditions that were not included in that index but          occurred at a high enough frequency to warrant          examination as possible comorbidities in particular          hypertension and lipid disorders We included the          following twelve comorbid conditions into our index          diabetes with complications diabetes wo complications          hypertension heart disease cerebrovascular disease          chronic pulmonary disease peripheral vascular disease          kidney disease liver disease rheumatological diseases          hypothyroidism and lipid metabolism disorders          Comorbidities were based on physicians claims with the          respective ICD code    during the months period          preceding the month in which the cancer was diagnosed          The month of diagnosis was excluded to avoid identifying          as comorbidities any complications or conditions directly          resulting from cancer treatment Laboratory radiology          and other diagnostic services were excluded from the          comorbidity identification process because tests may have          been done to rule out the condition Each subject was          assigned a comorbidity score of  no condition  one          condition or  two or more conditions                          Other variables          In addition to stage at diagnosis and size of tumor          we examined several other variables that were possible          determinants in the utilization of BCS           vs mastectomy in early stage          breast cancer including age at diagnosis ethnicity          island of residence and marital status For ethnicity          we used the five major groups in Hawaii Japanese          Caucasian Hawaiian Filipino and Chinese All other          ethnicities were grouped into an Other category The          specific island of residence was coded in the HTR but          since close to  of the population resides on Oahu              we classified residence as either Oahu or nonOahu          For marital status we grouped all women who were          identified as single separate divorced or widowed in          the unmarried category Women under age  were          considered premenopausal and women  years and older          were classified as postmenopausal Tumor grade          information from the HTR record was grouped into grade I          welldifferentiated cells           vs all other grades II III IV          and unknown                          Statistical analysis          All analyses were performed with SAS version  for          Windows SAS Institute Cary NC Simple Kappa          statistics  was calculated to validate the treatment          information from the insurance claims and the HTR               BCS was used as reference group throughout the          analysis It was defined as the dependent outcome          variable and coded as a dichotomous variable with           indicating BCS received and  indicating mastectomy          received Age was entered in units of ten years and tumor          size was grouped into units of ten millimeters one          centimeter For analyses of ethnicity as a predictor of          treatment selection Caucasian was used as the control          group and indicator variables for all other ethnic groups          were created Logistic regression    was used to          explore the influence of each variable on the use of BCS           vs mastectomy First we          considered each independent variable by itself in a model          and then we entered all variables simultaneously in a          logistic regression model Odds Ratios OR    with          corresponding  Confidence Intervals CI were          calculated to measure the degree of influence of          variables on the utilization of BCS           vs mastectomy                            Results        Based on the TNM stages we identified  women who had        stage I IIA or IIB breast cancer  of the         breast cancer cases in the linked data set These         cases represented   of  cases of all early        stage breast cancer cases recorded in the HTR during the        study period Approximately twothirds of the women in the        study population Table  were diagnosed in stage I of the        disease and only  and  in stage IIA and IIB        respectively Approximately  of the study subjects were        aged less than  years close to half were  to  years        old and  were  years and older Three out of four        women resided on the island of Oahu Overall  of the        women had received BCS Of the cases diagnosed at stage I         of the women had received BCS and  a mastectomy        This decreased to  for stage IIA and to  for stage        IIB Among women  years and older  had BCS compared        to  of those under  years of age and  of the         year old women While  of women on Oahu underwent BCS        only  of the women residing on the outer islands        received BCS We observed no statistically significant        differences between the BCS and mastectomy group in terms        of ethnicity comorbidity count menopausal status marital        status and insurance plan We found very high agreement        between HTR data and claims data in identifying BCS            CI   only  women were        misclassified For the majority of women who received BCS         the lumpectomy was followed by radiation therapy        Additional chemotherapy was given to  and  of the        women who had a lumpectomy or a mastectomy        respectively        In the univariate models Table  we found that tumor        size and grade island of residence age and stage at        diagnosis were predictors of breast cancer treatment Women        residing on Oahu were considerably more likely to have BCS        than women living on all other islands in the state For        each onecentimeter increase in tumor size there was a         lesser chance of undergoing BCS Since size of tumor        correlates to breast cancer stage this also decreased the        likelihood for women in stage IIA and IIB to receive BCS        Women with welldifferentiated tumor grades were  more        likely to undergo BCS as compared to women with all other        grades We found that for each tenyear increment in age        the chances of having BCS increased by  We also observed        that average tumor size was inversely related to age Mean        tumor sizes in cm with standard deviations were                 for women younger than         years  to  years and  years and older        respectively Therefore the smaller tumor sizes may        account for the greater likelihood of BCS among older        women        In a combined model with all independent variables in a        logistic regression island of residence remained the only        significant predictor of BCS in this population Women        living on Oahu were  more likely to have BCS than women        on the outer islands Although all other variables lost        their statistical significance associations for age TNM        stage tumor size and tumor grade remained similar in        magnitude as in the univariate models Although none of the        ethnicity variables was significant it appeared that        Filipino women were less likely to receive BCS than women        from all other groups Residence on outer islands did not        explain this observation Women with a TNM stage of IIB        were still  less likely to receive BCS than women        diagnosed at stage I but the relation lost its statistical        significance due to the small number of cases Menopausal        or marital status type of health plan or the number of        comorbidities were not related to the type of surgery                    Discussion        The place of residence at the time of diagnosis was the        most important predictor for receiving BCS in this dataset        of health plan members Women with early stage breast        cancer living on Oahu were  more likely to have BCS than        women living on outer islands Age at diagnosis and tumor        size were also related to breast cancer treatment although        they were not statistically significant in the combined        model Contrary to our expectation and a previous        publication     the number of comorbid conditions did        not effect treatment in this analysis The importance of        geographic location can be explained by the availability of        radiation facilities on the different Hawaiian Islands        Whereas on Oahu treatment facilities can be reached within        one hour distances on the outer islands are much farther        Only the Island of Hawaii and Maui have a radiation        facility but they are hard to reach from many parts of the        islands Women residing on Kauai Molokai and Lanai have        to fly to Honolulu daily to receive the course of treatment        or they have to remain there temporarily Because this may        be not be economically feasible for some women as well as        physically and psychologically challenging it is possible        that many women choose to undergo a mastectomy instead        Alternatively patients and physicians in rural areas may        favor mastectomy because of differences in education or        cultural attitudes toward medical advances We do not have        information to explain why a small proportion of women who        underwent BCS  did not receive radiation However        compared to other reports       the proportion of        women who received radiation is very high An interview        study with cancer patients    showed that some patients        decide against their physicians recommendation for        radiation because they fear the treatment or hold certain        beliefs about cancer For other patients radiation may        have been contraindicated due to comorbid conditions        In  a national BCS rate of  was reported           with a rate of  for the Pacific region Hawaii        California Alaska Washington and Oregon Our results        for  to  indicate a slightly higher rate for Hawaii         Geographic differences in BCS use have repeatedly        been described in the literature In western Washington            women residing outside the Seattle area were less        likely to have BCS than women residing inside the county        in particular if radiation therapy facilities were not        available in their county Comparing rates across the        country showed that BCS was much more common in the        Northeast than in the South     Low BCS rates were        also found in rural areas such as North and South Carolina            Minnesota     and the Southwest     An        analysis of  SEER data    demonstrated a        strong association between BCS and distance to the next        radiotherapy facility The likelihood of undergoing BCS was         lower among women living more than  miles from the        next radiotherapy facility        In contrast to our results a number of studies have        shown that the likelihood of BCS decreases with increasing        age       possibly due to less concern about        cosmetic results Because of the relatively small        proportion  of women  years and older and the fact        that the women  years and older in our study had a health        plan other than Medicare they were not directly comparable        to the populations in the published literature Therefore        our ability to observe an effect among older women was        limited In particular we were not able to examine the        treatment of women  years and older who have been        described as receiving more BCS than women age  to         years     Our findings of lower BCS in smaller and        well differentiated tumors agree with previous studies            but the absence of an effect of comorbid conditions        disagrees with a study in older women    that showed a        higher rate of BCS in women with comorbidities Type of        health plan did not predict type of treatment in our study        probably because the majority of women in this data set had        a FFS plan In previous analyses with a larger variety of        health plans HMO members were considerably more likely to        receive BCS in San Francisco and in Seattle            Medicare and Medicaid patients received more BCS in a North        Carolina hospital     However a study using        administrative data    described lower BCS use among        Medicaid patients and treatment was similar by health plan           in Northern California        Our study had several limitations including the        possibility of incomplete claims histories if patients        changed health plans during the course of treatment but        the high agreement with HTR information indicates that the        validity of insurance claims information was high        Continuing efforts by the health plan through feedback        loops has improved diagnostic coding    in Hawaii but        as documented for Medicare claims problems remain            As discussed above our study sample of breast cancer        patients does not represent the population of the state        excluding in particular Medicare and Medicaid recipients        members of a typical HMO and the relatively small number        of uninsured patients The exclusion of Medicare claims        lead to a younger population whereas the lack of Medicaid        claims biased the cases toward a higher socioeconomic        status On the other hand the study population represented        the population quite well in terms of ethnicity Hawaii        Department of Business   id Because our data set        included  of all breast cancer cases under  years        diagnosed during the study period the results represents        this population much better than the population of older        women Also we were unable to measure some factors that        have been found to be important in other reports in        particular influence of physician age     physician        specialty     type of hospital teaching hospitals and        hospitals with radiation facilities private county and        public        socioeconomic status and        education     tumorbreast ratio and the expected        cosmetic results      physicianpatient interactions        before surgery     and psychological factors such as        fear of radiation or cancer     The strengths of using        of insurance claims data for this analysis were twofold        First we had more detailed treatment information available        than collected by the tumor registry Second the        diagnostic codes in the claims data allowed us to estimate        the number of comorbid conditions before the cancer        diagnosis        The results of this pilot study combining tumor registry        and insurance claims data raises an important issue for        cancer practice in the State of Hawaii and elsewhere        Health care providers and insurance plans need to work with        other agencies to develop viable solutions to facilitate        access to radiation facilities for women residing in remote        locations such as islands with no radiation facility        Attitudes of patients and physicians living in rural areas        may be important in the choice of treatment but could not        be investigated in this project Future research that        includes interviews with patients and physicians may        investigate attitudes toward certain types of treatment and        identify additional barriers to BCS such as psychological        problems In order to understand how treatment decisions        were made in practice qualitative information from        physicians and breast cancer patients should be collected        and examined in detail Further validation of treatment and        comorbidity from insurance claims data would strengthen        this type of research in the future The inclusion of a        larger proportion of breast cancer cases is needed to        establish the validity of our findings for the population        atlarge                    Competing interests        None declared
