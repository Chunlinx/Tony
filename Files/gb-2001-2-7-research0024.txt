                    Background        Movement of eukaryotic cells intracellular transport        signaling cell division and cell shape are functions of        the cytoskeleton      The cytoskeleton is made up        of three types of filaments actin filaments intermediate        filaments and microtubules Three groups of proteins called        molecular motors utilize energy from the hydrolysis of ATP        to move in association with the cytoskeleton kinesins        dyneins and myosins     Kinesins and dyneins move        along microtubules    and actin is utilized by myosin        for motility           Molecular motors in nonplant systems have been        extensively characterized but less is known about the        presence and functions of these motors in plant cells        Using antibodies to mouse dynein two  kDa proteins were        identified in tobacco pollen during pollen germination          suggesting the presence of dynein in pollen tubes To        date no report has been published on the presence of        dynein at the molecular level Using animal dynein        sequences to search the         Arabidopsis database TAIR The         Arabidopsis Information Resource          no sequences similar to heavy or intermediate chains        were found However some sequences showing similarity to        light chains are present in the database Kinesins have        been identified in         Arabidopsis and other plant systems              and their movement along microtubules        has been analyzed      Kinesins are a        superfamily of molecular motors containing at least nine        subfamilies    Plant kinesins are represented in all        but two of the families Using the aminoacid sequence of        the motor domain of a plant kinesin a search of the         Arabidopsis genome yielded         kinesinlike proteins   This is the largest number of        kinesins in an organism per thousand genes compared to        yeast         Drosophila melanogaster and         Caenorhabditis elegans         Phylogenetic analysis of known myosins in various        organisms has resulted in the classification of myosins        into several groups The Myosin Home Page MHP   has a        phylogenetic tree with  myosins classified into         classes However an analysis of the myosin superfamily in         Drosophila concluded that two new        mammalian myosins and a         Drosophila myosin make up a new class        of myosins class XVIII   These myosins have a unique        aminoterminal PDZ domain The classes have been named        according to the order in which each class was first        discovered except for myosins I and II Myosin II is the        conventional myosin which was discovered  years ago          The next myosin identified was myosin I and then in        order of class name Myosins have three domains in common        a motor domain that interacts with actin and binds ATP a        neck domain that binds light chains or calmodulin and a        tail domain The tail domain varies by class Phylogenetic        analysis is often based on the motor domain of the myosins        However using the fulllength sequence results in nearly        the same grouping indicating that the heads and tails have        evolved together      A study using the head        motor domain neck and tail domains separately for        phylogenetic analysis or the head and necktail showed that        this is generally true   The neck domain consists of        one or more helical sequences termed the IQ motif which        has the consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR   The IQ motif        binds the conventional myosin II light chains and        calmodulin or calmodulinlike proteins in other myosins          Unlike most calmodulinbinding proteins myosins bind        calmodulin in the absence of Ca         As actin is utilized by myosin for motility the        possible functions of myosin in plants are closely linked        to the functions of actin The actin cytoskeleton has been        shown to be involved in many processes in plants including        transportation signaling cell division cytoplasmic        streaming and morphogenesis    Much of the        cytoplasmic streaming work has been done in algal cells and        the direct involvement of actin and myosin has been shown           Genetic biochemical and cell biological studies        with trichomes during the past four years have provided        interesting insights into the role of the cytoskeleton in        trichome morphogenesis These studies indicate that actin        and the microtubule cytoskeleton play a pivotal role in        cell expansion and branching during trichome development                 Localization studies and visualization of the actin        cytoskeleton in live cells with an actinbinding protein        tagged with green fluorescent protein GFP indicate that        the organization of Factin changes during trichome        morphogenesis    Chemicals that promote        depolymerization or stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton        did not effect branching but produced distorted trichomes        The morphology of these trichomes is similar to that        observed in a distorted class of mutants suggesting that        at least some of the affected genes are likely to code for        proteins involved in actin organizationdynamics for        example myosins actindepolymerizing factors        actinbinding proteins There is also evidence that the        actin cytoskeleton is involved in mitosis and during        separation of daughter cells after the successful        segregation of chromosomes into daughter nuclei   The        actin cytoskeleton is also involved in pollen tube growth        and calcium regulation has also been shown to be involved                  Myosins have been identified in plants both        biochemically      and at the molecular level            Immunological detection of myosins using        antibodies against animal myosin identified proteins of        various sizes from different plants            Immunofluorescence studies localized myosin to the surface        of organelles the vegetative nuclei and generative cells        in pollen grains and tubes   to the active streaming        lanes and cortical surface in pollen tubes   and more        recently to plasmodesmata in root tissues           Motility assays   and ATPase assays     using        myosinlike proteins isolated from plants have also        demonstrated the presence of myosins in plants        Since  five partial or fulllength myosins from         Arabidopsis have been characterized        at the molecular level Using PCRbased approaches Knight        and KendrickJones   cloned a myosin they called ATM          Arabidopsis thaliana myosin Kinkema        and Schiefelbein   cloned the myosin MYA and Kinkema         et al   cloned another        fulllength myosin ATM and two partial length myosins        MYA and MYA Kinekema         et al   also identified three        PCR products that coded for unique myosin motor domain        sequence Phylogenetic analysis using these myosins        indicated that the ATM myosins were a unique class and they        were named class VIII The MYA myosins are somewhat related        to class V myosins but as other analyses have been done        these myosins were also assigned to a new class class XI                  Myosins have been identified in         Zea mays two of which belonged to        class XI and one to class VIII   PCR fragments for        fern myosins have been reported    and sequences are        available for myosins from         Helianthus annuus  Vugrek and D        Menzel unpublished data Two fern          Anemia phyllitidis  PCR products and        the         H annuus myosins also fall either        into class VIII or class XI myosins    Two algal        myosins are also members of the class XI myosins one from         Chara corallina and one from         Chlamydomonas reinhardtii           A third class of myosins XIII is composed of two algal        myosins from         Acetabularia cliftonii No animal        myosins are in any of these classes and no plant myosins        are in any other myosin class However the cellular slime        mold         Dictyostelium discoideum has one        myosin Dd MyoJ which is alternatively grouped with class        V or class XI          Other organisms have myosins from more than two classes        The yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae has five        myosins in three different classes         Caenorhabditis elegans has myosins in        seven classes and         Drosophila melanogaster in nine Do        plants have only two classes of myosins How many myosins        are in a plant genome What are the similarities and        differences between plant and nonplant myosins that might        help establish a function for the myosins Until the recent        completion of the sequencing of the         Arabidopsis genome   answers to        these questions were not known It is now possible to        determine how many myosins are in the         Arabidopsis genome and to see if any        plant myosins fall into other myosin classes As the myosin        motor domain is highly conserved the sequence from one        myosin motor can be used to search a database for all other        myosins We used the motor domain from MYA to search the         Arabidopsis database   for        sequences with similarity to this domain We identified          Arabidopsis myosins including the         reported myosins in the         Arabidopsis genome Phylogenetic        analysis using nonplant and plant myosins showed that all         fall into either myosin class VIII or XI Only  are in        class VIII and  in class XI An analysis of their        exonintron junctions and sequence similarities indicates        that all myosins are highly conserved and some may        represent gene duplication events                    Results                  Identification of Arabidopsismyosins          Using the aminoacid sequence of the conserved motor          domain of the plant myosin MYA   databases were          searched using BLASTP and TBLASTN at TAIR   Other          searches using the aminoacid sequence of motor domains          from representatives of other classes of myosins were          also done but they did not reveal any other myosin          sequences Sixteen unique sequences were obtained that          contain a myosin motor domain as identified by the SMART          Smart Modular Architecture Research Tool program            The sequences obtained in this search were compared to          the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences          MIPS   list of myosin domains in           Arabidopsis MIPS lists            Arabidopsis sequences showing          myosin domains A check of these showed that  of the          sequences were myosins identified in our search and one          was a myosin not available in the NCBI National Center          for Biotechnology Information protein database            Two are not fulllength myosins One is a putative          helicase Atg with no myosin motor domain and one          is a possible pseudogene Atg with only  amino          acids that have some similarity to the myosin motor          domain MIPS does not list three myosins identified in          our search At XIG At XIF and At XII Table lists the          myosins by names as given in the phylogenetic tree          constructed by Hodge and Cope   and as assigned by          us There are a total of  myosin genes in           Arabidopsis In comparison           S cerevisiae Schizosaccharomyces          pombe C elegans and           D melanogaster have    and           myosins respectively Figure               Arabidopsis has the lowest          percentage  of myosin genes out of the total          number of genes as compared to           S cerevisiae and           S pombe with  and           respectively           C elegans with  and           D melanogaster with  see          Figure           Only  of the            Arabidopsis myosins have been          reported in the literature     The other           are sequences obtained from the           Arabidopsis database sequenced as          part of the Arabidopsis Genome Sequencing Project These          sequences are therefore predicted sequences that have          not been verified by complete cDNAs The average sequence          length of the           Arabidopsis myosins is           residues with the shortest sequence prediction being           At VIIIA amino acids and the longest  At          XIA Some of the intronexon predictions may not be          correct which could reduce or increase the size of the          predicted proteins and so the sizes may change as more          characterization is done for each myosin A case in point          is the cDNA that was isolated by Kinkema and Schiefelbein            for At MYA At MYA which codes for  amino          acids whereas the predicted protein has  because of          differences in intron prediction          Using the           Arabidopsis Sequence Map Overview          of TAIR   the location of each myosin was determined          Figure  The myosin genes are distributed throughout          the           Arabidopsis genome The chromosome          lengths are based on the centimorgan cM scale as shown          on the TAIR Map Overview   The maps reported with          the announcement of the Arabidopsis genome sequence show          somewhat different lengths than the TAIR maps                            Phylogenetic analysis          All           Arabidopsis myosins and a selection          of myosins from other organisms representing each of the          myosin classes were aligned using the motor domain          sequence as determined by the SMART program   The          alignment was done in Megalign by the CLUSTAL method and          a phylogenetic tree was generated using the Bootstrap           replicates method with a heuristic search of the          PAUP b program Figure  The           Arabidopsis myosins all group into          two classes along with other plant myosins  class VIII          and class XI No animal myosins group with the plant          myosins and no plant myosins group into any of the animal          myosins An algal            Chara corallina  myosin Cc ccm          does group with the plant class XI myosins but is on a          separate branch from any other class XI myosin Figure           The           D discoideum myosin Dd myoJ did          not fall into a class with any of the plant myosins In          fact three           D discoideum myosins Dd myoI Dd          myoJ and Dd myoM did not fall into any of the classes          Figure  The phylogenetic trees of Hodge and Cope and          the tree on the myosin home page    show the Dd          myoI branching from class VII myosins A heuristic search          without bootstrapping also showed the Dd myoI myosin as a          branch from class VII and domain analysis shows that Dd          myoI has the MyTH domain found in other class VII          myosins Other phylogenetic anaylses have placed Dd myoJ          as a branch off class XI myosins from plants             However the phylogenetic tree generated from fulllength          sequences of plant myosins and Dd myoJ see below also          shows that Dd myoJ is separate from the plant          myosins          Myosins from another alga           Acetabularia cliftonii are          classified into a separate group XIII and one myosin          each from the fungi           Emericella nidulans and           Pyricularia grisea are also          assigned to a separate class XVII A second alignment          was done using the fulllength sequences for all           Arabidopsis and other known          fulllength plant myosins with a human heavychain myosin          Hs Ib as an outgroup The two classes of plant myosins          are clearly seen Figure  Among the class XI myosins          the similarity ranges from  full length and           motor domain The similarity between the class          VIII myosins ranges from  full length and           motor domain When class VIII myosins are compared to          class XI myosins the similarity only ranges from           fulllength and  motor domain Thirteen           Arabidopsis myosins group into          class XI Two subgroups branch off in this class with          three outliers Figure  One subgroup consists of two          pairs of           Arabidopsis myosins At XIBAt MYA          and At XIGAt XIH which are most similar to the          sunflower myosin Hahamy and then another pair of           Arabidopsis myosins At XIDAt XIA          The other subgroup consists of the           Arabidopsis myosin pair At XICAt          XIE and two unpaired           Arabidopsis myosins At XIK and At          MYA that are most closely related to sunflower myosins          Hahamy and Hahamy and to the maize myosin ZmMYO At          XIJ AT XIF and At XII are on separate branches that          group with the other class XI myosins but not within the          two subgroups There are four class VIII           Arabidopsis myosins that form two          pairs At ATMAt VIIIA and At VIIIBAt ATM The first          pair group with class VIII myosins from           Z mays and           H annuus whereas the second pair          are on a separate branch                          Characterization of the Arabidopsismyosins          Figure shows schematic diagrams of each myosin The          motor domain in all cases is in the aminoterminal          region The motor domain starts at about  residues          for the class XI myosins whereas the class VIII myosins          have a longer aminoterminal region before the motor          domain  residues The IQ domains usually follow          right after the motor domain but are separated slightly          from the motor domain in At XID At XII and At XIK          There are three or four IQ domains in class VIII myosins          and five or six in class XI except for At XIK which has          only four There are coiledcoil domains that differ in          length and number in all the myosins They often follow          directly after the IQ domains but in some cases there is          intervening sequence Based on the presence of the          coiledcoil domains the           Arabidopsis myosins are probably          dimeric   The class XI myosins are much longer than          the class VIII myosins with the difference being in the          length of the carboxyterminal region following the          conserved domains found in myosins          Besides the motor IQ and coiledcoil domains other          domains have been identified in myosins from classes          other than the plant classes VIII and XI These include          SH domains Src homology  domains that bind to target          proteins MYTH a domain of unknown function found in a          few classes of myosins a zincbinding domain a          pleckstrin homology domain FERMtalin band          ezrinradixinmoesin GPArich domains and a protein          kinase domain     These domains are involved in          protein interactions and presumably give specificity to          the action of the myosin Except for the IQ and          coiledcoil domains the SMART program used to identify          the motor domain of the myosin sequences did not identify          any domains other than a few with scores less significant          than the required threshold          Myosins have  highly conserved residues spread          throughout the motor domain that define a core consensus          sequence   Comparison of an alignment of           Arabidopsis myosin motor domains to          these conserved sequences shows a great deal of          conservation among them data not shown One example is          the ATPbinding site which consists of GESGAGKT           in           Dictyostelium myosin II DmyoII          and NxNSSRFGK  DmyoII With the exception of          only one residue these are conserved in all            Arabidopsis myosins The          conformational state of myosin changes with ATP          hydrolysis and a very conserved region implicated in this          process has the conserved sequence          LDIxGFExFxxNSGFLEQxxINxxNExLQQxF  DmyoII            The plant sequences are very conserved through          this region The sequence in this region is          LDIYGFExFxxNSFEQxCINEKRLQQHF the first x is S in all          but one myosin the fourth x is F in all but one myosin          Cope           et al   suggest that release          of the phosphate of ATP may be through a hole in the          structure centered around an absolutely conserved          arginine residue residue  DmyoII which is also          absolutely conserved in all           Arabidopsis myosins The presence          of these highly conserved residues in plant myosins          suggests that they are capable of motor function In          fact           in vitro motility studies with a          purified myosin from           Chara myosin XI Cc ccm in Figure           have confirmed that it is indeed an actinbased motor            A loop present in the motor domain called the HCM          mutations in this loop cause hypertrophic          cardiomyopathy is the location of a phosphorylatable          serine S or threonine T in certain amoeboid myosin I          molecules and myosin VI molecules This S or T residue is           residues upstream from the conserved DALAK sequence          The enzyme activity of the amoeboid myosins depends on          phosphorylation of this site but although          phosphorylation of the myosin VI T residue has been          demonstrated the regulation of enzyme activity has not             Most other myosins have a constitutively          negatively charged amino acid either aspartic acid D          or glutamic acid E at this site This site has been          named the TEDS rule site on the basis of these amino          acids   The           Arabidopsis and other plant myosins          all have aspartic acid glutamic acid or glycine residue          at this site suggesting that they are not regulated by          phosphorylation at this site However three residues          upstream  from DALAK all the class XI myosins have a          threonine residue          The site for each predicted or actual intron was          located and is shown schematically in Figure  The          intron locations were determined from the information at          MIPS   The length of each exon and the domains          they code for are shown in Tables and for class VIII          and class XI myosins respectively The exons vary in          length from  to greater than  nucleotides the          length of the beginning and last exons for each gene are          not known as the predicted sizes include only the          proteincoding nucleotides with an average of           nucleotides The four class VIII myosins have seven exons          of the same length in the same order within the myosin          motor domain Table  The motor domain starts in the          third exon of each class VIII myosin The start of the IQ          domains and the coiledcoil domains is more variable          except for the At ATMAt VIIIB pair The class XI          myosins also have many exons that are of the same length          and in the same order but that differ from the class VIII          pattern Table  The exons coding for the motor domain          sequence are most conserved in length Most class XI          myosins motor domains start in the third exon and end in          the twentieth Six of the class XI myosins have an intron          after the start codon Most differences in exon length          are in the carboxyterminal regions Figure and Table           However even in the carboxyterminal region there          are some exon lengths conserved between some or all of          the myosins The two XI myosins with the closest          similarity are At XIB and At MYA A Clustal alignment at          Pole BioInformatique Lyonnais   showed           identity  strong similarity and  weak          similarity between these two myosins Their motor domains          are  identical Twentythree of their introns are at          the same location in the motor domain area and then          following a few different size exons there are similar          sized exons again They are located on chromosomes I and          V respectively It is possible that this pair is a          result of gene duplication Class VIII myosins At ATM and          At VIIIA have  exons of the same length Their          fulllength sequences are  identical with another           strongly similar and  weakly similar Their          motor domains have  similarity At ATM is on          chromosome III whereas At VIIIA is on chromosome I This          again may have resulted from a gene duplication Analysis          of the total           Arabidopsis genome revealed that a          whole genome duplication occurred followed by subsequent          gene loss and extensive local gene duplications            The duplicated segments represent  of the           Arabidopsis genome The           S cerevisiae genome has also had a          complete ancient genome duplication and  of the genes          form duplicate pairs Duplicated genes account for  of          the total genes of           C elegans and           Drosophila            If the gene pairs are the result of duplication it is          interesting to note that while exon lengths have been          conserved intron lengths have not The intron lengths          are shown in Table  No pattern can be seen in intron          lengths between any of the myosins The average intron          length is  nucleotides with the shortest intron at           nucleotides and the longest at  At XII has the          highest average  nucleotides It contains the          nucleotide intron and three others that are over           nucleotides In a study of  introns only  of the          introns were longer than  nucleotides with sizes          ranging from  to  nucleotides   This makes At          XII unusual in having four out of  introns           longer than  nucleotides Only two other myosins had          an intron over  nucleotides Of the total  splice          sites that were identified in the           Arabidopsis myosins only six a          little more than  were over  nucleotides with four          out of the six being in one myosin Hunt           et al found that a SV smallt          intron only  nucleotides in length was spliced          efficiently in tobacco cells   Several of the          introns in the myosins are between  and  nucleotides          and so may be long enough to be spliced Only one is in a          cloned myosin known to be spliced at that site At XIJ          There is also a predicted intron of only  nucleotides          in length At XID which is thought to be too short for          efficient splicing Brown           et al   found three introns          less than  nucleotides in length in known expressed          proteins but none of them was less than  nucleotides          Until the expression of At XID is studied no conclusion          can be made as to the validity of this intron prediction          The significance of the range and variability of intron          length is not known In           Arabidopsis in general the range          is even greater             The consensus nucleotide sequences for the  and           splice sites are A            G            G            T            A            A            G            T            and T            G            C            A            G                      G            T             respectively   The most          conserved sequences are the  consensus G  T           at the   positions respectively and the  A          G at the   positions respectively The splice          sites in the reported myosins and the predicted myosins          Table  all contain the  GT and  AG sequences The          sequences in the           Arabidopsis myosins upstream and          downstream of these two very conserved sites varied as a          reflection of the less conserved nature of these          nucleotides Table  However these predicted sites at          the  and  splice sites need to be confirmed          experimentally                            Discussion        Only two classes of myosins are present in         Arabidopsis A study of myosins in        lily and tobacco pollen tubes using antibodies to three        animaltype myosins IA and IB II and V suggested the        presence of three types of myosins in these plants          However no type I II or V myosins have been found in any        plant and only two types VIII and XI have been        identified Class XI are somewhat similar to class V        myosins   and this may explain the reaction with the        type V antibody Possibly the other reactions were due to        similarities in the myosin motor domain Phylogenetic        analysis of         Arabidopsis myosins along with other        plant myosins suggests that most class XI myosins except        three fall into two subgroups Figure         The         Arabidopsis myosins have anywhere        from three to six IQ domains The IQ domain in nonplant        myosins has been shown to bind to calmodulin in a        calciumindependent manner The regulation of myosin action        is thought to be due to calmodulin interaction In plants        two myosin heavy chains have been shown to associate with        calmodulin    A myosincontaining protein fraction        from tobacco BY cells was used in motility assays with        Factin Concentrations of Ca higher than  M caused a        significant reduction in Factin sliding   Another        study with myosin isolated from lily pollen also        demonstrated a coprecipitation of myosin and calmodulin        and a similar effect of Ca concentration   Not only        did concentrations above  M cause inhibition of myosin        activity but the effects of concentrations higher than         M were not reversible upon Ca removal These studies        provide evidence that plant myosins bind calmodulin in the        absence of Ca and are active when calmodulin is bound and        inactivated when the Ca concentration is increased They        also found that when the myosin fraction was pretreated        with CaCl          calmodulin did not bind the myosin        suggesting that calmodulin dissociates from myosin at high        concentrations of Ca  The myosins in the above studies        have not been cloned and binding to specific IQ domains        has not been established However the presence of IQ        domains in         Arabidopsis and other plant myosins        suggests that these are the sites of Ca regulation It        would be interesting to investigate the possible        phosphorylation of the threonine residue which is three        residues upstream from the TEDS rule site in class XI        myosins and to see if enzyme activity is regulated by        phosphorylation of this residue        Myosins are involved in a wide range of cellular        functions They have been shown to be involved in movement        translocation cell division organelle transport        Gproteinlinked signal cascade and maintenance of        structure within cells   Insight into the function of        plant myosins has been gained by studies in algae        Cytoplasmic streaming is responsible for movement of        organelles and vesicles and of generative cells and        vegetative nuclei in pollen tubes Physiological studies in                Chara have shown that an increase in        Ca concentration causes cytoplasmic streaming to stop          A myosin isolated from the alga         Chara corallina was shown to be        responsible for cytoplasmic streaming     The        myosin was cloned and characterized and found to be a class        XI myosin related to the         Arabidopsis MYA myosins          Myosins in plants have also been shown to be involved in        cytoplasmic streaming Using immunofluorescence myosin was        localized to vesicles organelles and generative cells and        vegetative nuclei in grass pollen tubes   A myosin        isolated from lily pollen has been shown to be responsible        for cytoplasmic streaming in pollen tubes and two myosins        were identified in tobacco cell cultures that are also        thought to participate in cytoplasmic streaming           Antibodies to the myosins recognized a protein in        vegetative cells as well as pollen tubes Liu         et al   suggest that class XI        myosins are likely candidates for transport of large        vesicles because of the number of IQ domains         Previous studies showed that translocational step size        produced by a myosin motor is proportional to the number of        IQ domains and the larger the step the faster or more        efficiently they are able to transport vesicles          However the kinetic properties of the motor domain are        also involved in speed and there is a wide range of        movement speeds for myosin II molecules            An antibody specific to a         Z mays class XI myosin was used to        localize this myosin in fractions of maize proteins and        maize root tip cells   The nuclearcell wall fraction        and the plastid fraction contained relatively small amounts        of antigen while the mitochondrial fraction and the low        density membrane fraction had most of the antigen The root        tip cells showed particulate staining in the cytoplasm but        neither the vacuole membrane nor plasma membrane were        stained although in some cells the staining was too bright        to distinguish if the plasma membrane was stained or not        There are  class XI myosins in         Arabidopsis that could be involved in        vesicle and organelle transport The large number could        reflect redundancy of function or differential expression        Patterns of expression were different for the cloned         Z mays and         Arabidopsis myosins that have been        analyzed           Immunolocalization studies have also detected myosin        associated with plasmodesmata Plasmodesmata are        interconnections between contiguous plant cells that allow        direct celltocell transport of ions and proteins A        recent study using an antibody to a cloned class VIII         Arabidopsis myosin ATM At ATM        localized this myosin to the plasmodesmata and the plasma        membrane regions involved in the assembly of new cell walls          Earlier work suggested that actin was involved in        regulation of plasmodesmal transport   Other studies        using antibodies to animal myosins in root tissues of         Allium cepa Z mays and         Hordeum vulagare have also indicated        the presence of myosin in the plasmodesmata   However        immunolocalization studies with antibodies to animal        myosins need to be interpreted with caution as there are no        plant myosins that group with animal myosins        The recent work by Reichelt         et al   is more convincing        because they used antibody to plant myosin The myosin was        localized mainly to the transverse walls with some punctate        labeling of the longitudinal walls During cell division        the anticlassVIII myosin staining remains confined to the        transverse cell walls and is strongest in the newly formed        cell wall Immunogold electron microscopy showed labeling        of class VIII myosin associated with the plasma membrane        and plasmodesmata These studies suggest that class VIII        myosins may be involved in new cell wall formation and        transport in the plasmodesmata Reichelt         et al   suggest that myosin VIII        could act to bring islands of membrane plate material        together or could trigger exocytosis of new cell wall        material or alternatively as an anchor for actin along the        transverse walls The role of myosin in the plasmodesmata        was studied further by pretreating tissue with        butanedione moxoxime BDM an inhibitor of        actinmyosin motility The pretreatment resulted in a        strong constriction of the neck region of plasmodesmata          Myosin VIII in the plasmodesmata could be a part of a        gating complex that is thought to control the opening of        the plasmodesma neck   There are four class VIII        myosins in         Arabidopsis that could be involved in        these types of functions        A recent study of the effect of BDM on the distribution        of myosins Factin microtubules and cortical endoplasmic        reticulum ER suggests that myosins may link together        microtubules and actin filaments involved in structural        interactions   This study used antibody to myosin II        from animals and         Arabidopsis myosin VIII for        immunofluorescence studies BDM treatment disrupted normal        cellular distributions of maize myosins and the        characteristic distribution of Factin was also affected        Myosin may participate in the intracellular distribution of        actin filaments as was proposed for myosin XV          Microtubule arrangements in cortical root cells were        altered as was the normal ER network Postmitotic cell        growth was inhibited by BDM specifically in the transition        zone and the apical parts of the elongation region The        study suggested that actin fibers and microtubules interact        together via myosins and that myosinbased contractility of        the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the developmental        progression of root cells   However BDM has only been        shown to inhibit a few myosins         in vitro   and is known to be a        nonspecific inhibitor so these results must be viewed with        caution                    Conclusions        As the classification system of myosins now stands        plant myosins fall only into two classes  class VIII and        class XI All animal cells examined contain at least one        myosin II gene and usually multiple myosin I genes          but this is not true for         Arabidopsis specifically and possibly        for all plants Also no animal myosins of type VIII or XI        have been identified Plant and animal cells have some        common tasks such as vesicular and organelle movement but        plant cells are unique in many ways and the presence of        specific plant myosins is probably a reflection of that        uniqueness        There are  class VIII and  class XI         Arabidopsis myosins The large number        of myosins in class XI could be the result of gene        duplication or specialization of function in different        tissues or different life cycle times This work identifies        the         Arabidopsis myosins their domains        and gene intronexon structure The task ahead is to        analyze the protein products biochemically and try to        establish the function of each myosin                    Materials and methods        Using the conserved motor domain of the plant myosin At        MYA   database searches were performed using BLASTP        and TBLASTN at TAIR   The sequences were evaluated for        the presence of a myosin motor domain using the SMART        program   All sequences with a myosin domain had        BLASTP scores greater than  and E values less than          The motor domains of representative myosins from other        groups were also used to search the         Arabidopsis domain but the searches        did not reveal any new myosin genes The SMART program also        identified the IQ and coiledcoil domains and the location        of the domains The sequences found at TAIR were checked        against the MIPS database   Sequences identified at        MIPS as myosins but not at TAIR were evaluated as above        The sizes of the exonsintrons were determined using the        exonintron data for each myosin sequence using the MIPS        predictions for myosins not previously cloned Two        sequences At XIF At XIH were edited by comparing the        upstream genome sequence translation to conserved sequences        present in the other myosins but missing in the predicted        sequences        Sequences of myosins other than the         Arabidopsis myosins for phylogenetic        analysis were obtained from MHP   or NCBI   The        names are as in the tree of Hodge and Cope   The motor        domain sequences were determined using the SMART program          The motor domain sequences were used for alignment of        the plant and nonplant myosins using the Megalign program        The alignment was saved as a PAUP file and the phylogenetic        analysis was done using PAUP ba PPC We performed a        bootstrap analysis with  replicates using the heuristic        method Fulllength sequences were used for analysis of the        plant myosins using the same methods as above
