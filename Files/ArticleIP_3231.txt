                                 Hush Hush Sweet City                           Stop                reading Put this review on hold until after youve seen LA Confidential  Nowait Stick around until the end of this paragraph Its not that Im planningto give away plot twistsas in She has a penis Its simply that I dontwant to orient you I want you to see the film as I did with no expectationsand no idea whos the hero whos the villain or even whats at stake LAConfidential is that rare mainstream cop thriller that refuses to telegraphits outcome in the first  minutes or for much of its running time to tellyou how to feel about its protagonists So log off see the movie and comeback            Are youback My hunch is that Curtis Hanson once a craftily offbeat writerdirectorwho found the beat in a big way and made those thumpingly predictableblockbusters The Hand That Rocks the                Cradle  and TheRiver Wild  consciously set out to liberate himself from Hollywoodhackery He discovered the perfect project in James Ellroys punchylabyrinthine crime novel one of the few from the last decade that doesnt feelas if it was written expressly to be filmed The story isnt entirely freshIts the old load of subterranean conspiracies and climactic ratatatwith anew postRodney King acknowledgment that white cops who rough up minoritysuspects are the rule not the exception But Hansons way of telling the storycatches you offguard He makes the familiar unfamiliar            In part he does it with casting Of the triptych ofleading men not one is traditional moviehero material The closest to aname of the three is Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes also known as HollywoodJack Vincennes works Narcotics and also serves as technical adviser for aDragnet like TV show called Badge of Honor  He isnt a monsterbut he has almost no scruples hes an unabashed fame whore            Jackroutinely pockets cash from Sid Hudgens Danny DeVito the films occasionalnarrator a reporter for HushHush magazine and a fiendish imp out ofFrank Giffords nightmares Hudgens sets up public figures with drugs orprostitutes then calls in Vincennes to make the bust and pose for picturesSpacey is disconcertingly breezy The actor has been chewing the scenery for solongbrilliantlythat I wasnt sure he had this kind of jaunty star turn inhim Better yet he brings off the burgeoning of Jacks conscience withexceptional subtlety beginning with the mans embarrassment at shaking handsat a party with a dupe he once collared and ending with his horror at a slayinghe has inadvertently abetted Still hes too opaque to serve as a moralcenter and besides I havent forgiven him yet for decapitating GwynethPaltrow in Seven             The other two leads Russell Crowe and GuyPearce are even tougher to get a handle on although both actors bothAustralian which youd never guess will be overnight stars As Detective BudWhite Crowe is a beefy thug with a compulsion to rough up wifebeaters Oddlytender he nonetheless takes his Galahad act to the point of psychosis dashingoff with gun cocked the instant he hears of a damsel in distress He doesntthink twice about blasting a crater in an ostensibly guilty suspect planting aweapon on the man and claiming selfdefense            Whitesnemesis Ed Exley Pearce is everything we admire in a copin theory Hetakes no bribes vows never to plant evidence or to shoot hardened criminalsinstead of arresting them and singlehandedly dynamites the blue wall ofsilence when police are caught beating the hell out of a group of Latinosuspects But Pearce makes Exley a stuckup repressed little prig who issuesorders wearing an allpurpose smirk on his rigidly chiseled face Worse hissnooty righteousness is tinged with opportunism Hes willing to make dealswith superiors in return for promotions            The plotwhich turns on the arrest of a mobster kingpinPaul Guilfoyle a massacre at a diner and a group of call girls surgicallyaltered to resemble movie starsis almost too diffuse to synopsize Much ofthe fun comes from finally learning which piece fits where            Lacking heroes villains anda moral compass the first twothirds of the film leaves you adrift whichmeans that Hanson and his cowriter Brian Helgeland  Conspiracy Theory have to absorb you with the force of their storytelling The film opens withDeVito delivering a sardonic ode to LA that captures both the gleamingsurface and the underlying rancidity As filmed by Dante Spinotti LAConfidential conjures up those racy old Avon or Pocket Books pulpcoversfilm noir but with colors that are lurid and deepand comments onthem too The detectives pose for flashbulb pictures beside handcuffedsuspects or scenes of carnage their hats rakishly tilted In this LA menand women dreaming of fame arrive on the bus to be instantly victimized by theones who got there first            Perhaps Whites relationshipwith Lynn Bracken Kim Basinger a prostitute whos dyed and coifed toresemble Veronica Lake is a tad moist but the actors physical rapport issensational You can believe that White would open himself up to thisbedraggled blond princess admitting Im just the guy they bring in to scarethe other guys And Basinger a cool customer has never looked morecomfortable with another actor not even Alec Baldwin As her millionaire pimpan operator called Pierce Patchett David Strathairn does a classicdetectivemovie turn sleek unruffled every motion cagily deliberate The manhas purged himself of all surface emotion            Hanson cowrote theunderrated White Dog  with Sam Fuller and theres a touch ofFuller in this films lugubrious trashiness At twoandaquarter hours thepicture is too long and not exactly winged But just when you start to getimpatient with the plodding onethingafteranother style of narrationtheres a shocker that blows you into the movies last act and then a scene inwhich a couple of former antagonists figure out what stinks and join forces inan abandoned motel to stave off an army of bad guys Its a virtuoso shootouta riot of anglesthe villains depicted in whispers scudding shadows flashesof body parts Bullets explode in shards of glass and light bringing death inchiaroscuro And LA Confidential  with its divergent plot strandsrockets to copmovie heaven                           Cop fight Bud WhiteCrowe and Ed Exley Pearce almost mix it up  seconds
