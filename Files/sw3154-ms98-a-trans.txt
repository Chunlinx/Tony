              okay well lets see well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and glass and uh plastics and uh we make the dump over to the WalMart bins there as soon as theyre full i guess we collect milk milk cartons and whatever plastics other plastics are acceptable   are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling   no no i didnt think that anybody had those at all yet   well maybe they dont i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldnt tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were   right well no i havent seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and im   yeah the   kind of anxious to see them   thats going to be interesting because its uh  weve gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage so that i dont have any odors but its clearly a place where uh   oh right   uh itll be interesting to see how well that works and i am im glad the community is doing it uh its one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people uh i dont know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery   right   would candle them and package them is that uh in the fifties uh you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now   right   which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them   oh oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house   oh   in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house   uhhuh   you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there so uh   yeah yeah   yeah   so uh you know i look back at at uh my childhood and id say you know  they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesnt bother me at all that were were uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies   right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean its just   yeah   to see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing so uh you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like theres a pretty well theres a pretty pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics   uhhuh   so thats kind of encouraging i didnt know you know i i didnt know if we started to do that i didnt know what to expect   yeah well ill have to say im im the only one im good at at this point is the newspaper uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans   right   uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh i dont have any habits there yet and im guess im waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but   well i guess they will shortly i guess   but it just seems like on the larger scale that you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so   oh right   outside my little town       we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something   yeah right do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles   yeah   and i dont know if theres a deposit on those or not   i well thats interesting because theyre back to glass youre saying   they were glass they were the glass uh well lets see theyd be i dont know maybe ten ounce or   uhhuh   six ounce or ten ounce   yeah   sort of a small size sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didnt stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down you know uh sort of of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right right so i just hadnt seen that in a long time   uhhuh the carton the paper carton yeah well i mean the you you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and and uh uh im not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now   yeah yeah well   well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass im i know your husband uh doesnt really like the paper sacks   no he doesnt like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesnt doesnt just   yeah im the im the same way because otherwise uh oh im i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh Neals a person who says i like to pick it up but i dont believe in throwing it into the uh the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us dont have the uh sufficient lot size to uh       to do that   right right   uh so im glad the citys willing to take that on   thats nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place   well theres someplace you know if its because really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but its its certainly usable material   yeah yeah well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in they have this day now that its you know  separate from the other trash pick up   uhhuh right   um   but i the thing i dont understand about that is like when its one thing to send grass there but ive trimmed trees and other things which uh end up being something that clearly wont decompose nearly as rapidly but its still natural and i just dont know   no
