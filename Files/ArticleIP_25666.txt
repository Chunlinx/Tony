                                  Kosovo Con Games            Forweeks critics of the war in Yugoslavia have pronounced it unwinnable Theatrocities continue unabated  they say Air power alone will never getthe job done Its another Vietnam President Clinton has blown it Everythingwe do makes the situation worse Whether Clinton and his allies can win thewar remains to be seen But one thing is certain They cant win thedebate over the war as long as critics are allowed to rig it with thefollowing hidden premises                           A SelectiveScrutiny                                        Policies Critics observe thatmany things have gone badly since the air war began Ethnic Albanians have beenkilled and expelled from Kosovo and antiAmerican nationalism has grown inRussia Its easy to associate bad outcomes with the current policy Butcritics seldom apply the same kind of scrutiny to alternative policies If NATOhad forsworn the use of force against the Serbs what would the Serbsultimately have done to the Kosovar Albanians If NATO had launched a groundwar what would Russia be doing now If as critics observe the Serbs havemanaged to cleanse Kosovo in less than four weeks what difference could NATOhave made by beginning a ground force buildup which takes considerable time amonth ago                            Policymakers Americanreporters think their job is to examine US policymakers not foreignpolicymakers So they discount Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevicsbehavior as an objective consequence of Clintons subjective decisions WhenSerbian ethnic cleansing follows NATO bombing reporters treat the Serbianaction not as the product of free will but as a reaction determined by NATOsaction So while journalists on the ground report on Serbian atrocitiesjournalists in the studios and the newsrooms in effect pass the blame to NATOand Clinton            This bias has produced a bizarreblameAmericafirst spin on the right We have ignited the very human rightscatastrophe the war was started to avoid declared Pat Buchanan on Face theNation  Columnist Arianna Huffington compared Kosovo to Waco arguing thatjust as Clintons actions six years ago precipitated the murdersuicides bythe Branch Davidian cult in Waco Texas his intervention in Kosovo hasunwittingly produced one of the great humanitarian catastrophes of the th century While some conservatives allege that Clintonsunnecessary belligerence provoked the Serbs to ethnic cleansing others say histimidity about using ground troops emboldened the Serbs to the same effectClinton even gets the blame for Russian hostility On Meet the Press Sen Judd Gregg RNH accused Clinton of pushing Russia into a corner andputting them in a position where theyre no longer able to do anything but toreact in an aggressive way towards our action                            Moralactors When the Serbs butcher another  Kosovar Albanians or driveanother  out of Kosovo its a dogbitesman story When NATO bombs whatit thought was a military convoy and instead hits a caravan of civilianrefugees killing scores its a manbitesdog story For several days themedia treated the casualties caused by NATO as the lead story from Kosovoovershadowing far greater casualties caused during that time by the SerbsThis may have cost NATO the moral high ground declared John McLaughlininvoking the moralequivalence formula usually despised by conservativesMeanwhile the Serbs role in pushing the refugees onto the road in the middleof a war zone was scarcely mentioned                           B SleightofHandInferences                                        Unachieved to unachievableTodays media report news instantaneously and expect it to be madeinstantaneously as well In less than two weeks their verdict on the bombingof Yugoslavia leapt from unfulfilled objectives to failure to impossibilitySince air power hasnt brought the Serbs to their knees in four weeks themedia conclude that it never will Congressional Republicans have decided itsdoomed to failure according to Fred Barnes Never mind that under NATOsplan the bombing will become more severe each week                            Vietnam to Kosovo Criticsconstantly compare Kosovo to Vietnam They infer two lessons from Vietnam thatgradual escalation never works and that bombing cant break an enemyswill The trick in invoking such analogies is to ignore the differences thatthe war in Kosovo is being waged by  countries against one that nosuperpower is willing to prop up the targeted country and that todays airpower and surveillance are vastly more precise than the bombing technologyused in Vietnam                            Sinner tosin Critics on the right argue that because Clinton is untrustworthyso is the war As George Will put it last week the contempt of court citationagainst Clinton for falsely denying his affair with Monica Lewinsky is atimely reminder of the mendacity that drenches his presidency including hisBalkan policy Meanwhile critics on the left argue that because the UnitedStates failed to intervene in Rwanda its intervention in Kosovo is morallysuspect and probably racist                           C HiddenDichotomies                                        Empiricalmoral Centuries agoscientific philosophers invented a strict separation between talking about theway the world is and talking about the way it ought to be Todays mediafollowing this premise separate editorial from news judgments The onlystandard by which news organizations feel comfortable evaluating a policy issuccess or failure not right or wrong So the medias consensus about Kosovois that NATOs policy is not working As Tim Russert put it to DeputySecretary of State Strobe Talbott on Meet the Press  The atrocitiescontinue What success can you point to that any of your strategy has workedThe alternative perspective goes overlooked that the question is what NATOmust do that atrocities are a challenge rather than a verdict and thatNATO should persevere precisely because they continue                            Politicalmilitary Critics sayClinton should have destroyed Serbian TV networks by now and never should havesworn off ground troops They deride these as political decisions and mockNATO for refusing to bomb Milosevics palace because it contains culturaltreasures including a Rembrandt The idea that Italy and Greece object toground troops and therefore we shouldnt do what is necessary to win this waris in my view ridiculous protested Bill Kristol on This Week  Butwhats the definition of winning Clinton and other NATO leaders say theyrenot just seeking a onetime victory over Milosevic Theyre trying to developwhat is essentially an international policing consortium This is a politicalas well as military project It entails compromising with allies who are morecautious about applying force and authorizing targets Otherwise the UnitedStates would have to police the world alone which is unsustainable politicallythanks in part to vociferous opposition from many of these same critics notto mention militarily                            Harmhelp Skeptics maintainthat the bombing isnt helping the Kosovars I dont care about dropping anymore bridges into the Danube River Buchanan fumed on Face the Nation I dont know how that helps those people in Kosovo The question he arguedshould be What is the best way to help these people and save these lives Nothow we can bomb another oil plant or oil refinery Minutes later host BobSchieffer ended the show by noting that the Kosovars were still being purgedand asking whether what we are doing is doing any good            This dichotomy rules outthe fallback strategy that NATO and US officials have articulated from theoutset to make the cost of Milosevics victory outweigh the rewardsConservatives used to defend this concept which they called deterrence whenit was preached and practiced by President Reagan If the punishment youadminister to the current troublemaker fails to stop him the theory goes atleast it will make the next troublemaker think twice                           D SelfFulfillingDoubts                                        Practical futility Thepundits verdict is in The war is doomed and already lost On LateEdition  Wolf Blitzer observed that Milosevic doesnt give after a monthof this any impression that he is backing down Quoting a report that USmilitary leaders see no sign that Milosevic is changing his strategy or aboutto break Russert asked Talbott Are we losing this war Other talking headsasserted that NATO is not united and wont be able to stand up as theconflict wears on Time is not on our side warned former National SecurityAdviser Brent Scowcroft on Late Edition  It is going to be verydifficult to keep the alliance together            Of course the best way to assure that Milosevicdoesnt break that NATO comes apart and that the United States loses the waris to predict that Milosevic wont break that NATO will come apart and thatthe United States will lose the war These predictions bolster the Serbsmorale while undermining NATOs As Sen Chris Dodd DConn observed onFace the Nation  Patience and resolve are as important a weapon todayas actually the airstrikes are                            Moral authority Rather thancall Clinton a liar many pundits pass this off as a widespread perception byothers They call it a moral authority and public relations problem askinghow it will impact his ability to lead Americans and NATO in war There isa common drum beat on the airwaves a reporter asked Clinton on April that you personally lack the moral authority to be commander in chiefNew York Times columnist Maureen Dowd warned that Clinton does notinspire great loyalty adding He may have a conflict of interest if hesends in ground troops It would be hard to save his skin and their skin at thesame time By questioning Clintons moral authority in this pseudoobjectiveway journalists destroy whats left of his moral authority                            NATO credibility Selfstyledhawks fret that NATO will lose the war and thereby expose its impotence Thislumbering and clumsy alliance incapable of managing such brush fires asKosovo could lose the Kosovo war in a month against the ruin of a rumpstate warned columnist Charles Krauthammer If the perception is that for days tiny little Yugoslavia  has withstood NATO and the United Statesasked Russert will NATO and the United States be exposed as a paper tigerRusserts guest Sen Richard Lugar RInd grimly intoned Many arepredicting that this will be the funeral of NATO And all because inKrauthammers words Clinton staked the survival of the most successfulalliance in history on bright new academic ideas cooked up far from thebattlefields on which they now flounder            Having defined anythingless than the total recapture of Kosovo and the restoration of its refugees asa failure Clintons critics are ensuring that such failure will be interpretedas catastrophically as possible As for their suggestion that NATOscredibility is too precious to be risked in war you can understand theirreluctance Even tough guys have their Rembrandt
