                                 Bathroom Beauty            The Museumof Modern Art has buried its Pierre Bonnard retrospective in windowlessbasement galleries The puzzling decision to relegate the painter ofsundrenched tablecloths and rainbow gardens to the underground makes somesense given the direction and drift of the show the third MoMA retrospectiveof Bonnards work since his death just shy of age  in  John Elderfieldthe curator in charge has banished some of Bonnards most popular andbeguiling worksProvenal landscapes with redroofed houses windows lookingout from laden breakfast tables flowering treesto the periphery of the showHe asks us to focus our attention instead on three major clusters of Bonnardswork bathroom scenes of Bonnards wife Marthe undressing primping ortoweling herself off scenes of Marthe submerged fulllength in a bathtub andselfportraits of Bonnard peering at himself in the bathroom mirror You couldcall the show after Ingmar Bergman Scenes From a Marriage since Bonnardincludes his very clean wife in some  paintings Then again you could callit with equal justice Scenes From a Bathroom            Elderfieldthinks these bathroom pictures raise most insistently the problems ofperceptionperipheral vision scanning rhythms and so onthat for him are atthe heart of Bonnards art Elderfields ponderous and mechanistic catalogessay is filled with such insights as the following While the global rhythmshave a pulsatile aspect owing to the regular bounce provided by the edge whichrebounds the gaze the chasing rhythms have a more spasmodic aspect owing tothe more extended and irregular scanpaths they follow If youre hungry formore the shows Web site adds explanatory diagrams Bonnard is indeed avisually complex artist whose constant experimenting with peculiarcompositional schemesespecially his habit of concealing figures on themargins of his paintingsrequires patient and prolonged viewing Picassospaintings grab you by the throat Bonnards paintings dawn on you But allthese adventures of the optic nerve as Bonnard calls them were meansnotas Elderfield believesends Were not taking a course in optics in thesepaintings were looking at a couple and a mighty strange one            Like Edgar Degas and douard Manet in the previousgeneration of French painters Bonnard  was born into the highbourgeoisie his father served in the upper echelons of the War Ministry andlike those painters he had a taste for the demimonde He attended the poshLyce LouisleGrand Degas alma mater and like Degas seemed destined for alaw career Two nearly simultaneous events sealed his fate He flunked thecivil service exam and won a contest in  to design a poster for a champagnefirm In his winning design a waitress tips a champagne glass forward and thecascading foam obscures pretty much everything but her cleavage            Bonnardsearly influences were the work of Paul Gauguin and Japanese prints both ofwhich confirmed his interest in bold colors and strongly delineated design Hewas a member of the Nabis Hebrew for Prophets a looseknit brotherhood ofpainters who worshiped Gauguin and as Bonnard later recalled envisaged apopular art that was of everyday application The MoMA exhibition composedentirely of oil paintings ignores Bonnards dazzling drawings lithographsdecorated screens book illustrations set designs for Alfred Jarrys UbuRoi  for Nijinsky ballets puppets and masks thus obscuring both thebreadth and the nature of his career The decorative panel called gives a taste of this improvisatory and populist side of Bonnards work withits hidden animalsa peacock and a monkey for example in the tree above thestrangely modernlooking Adams head            During the s when Bonnard was first making a name forhimself as an artist his effervescent brilliance in one medium spilled likechampagne into others His salmonpink illustrations for Paul Verlainessoftporn poems I want you almost nude not nude  through a cloud of lacethe glimpse of your flesh which my delirious mouth races across became thebasis for a suite of paintings of models in black stockings Perhaps to givesuch pictures a classical sanction he often borrowed the poses from wellknownantique sculptures  is based on the marble Hermaphrodite in theLouvre Such erudite allusion could also add to the kinky mixing of high andlow as when Bonnard put high heels on a model posed as the Medici Venus  The American painter Eric Fischl as reported in Timothy Hymansexcellent new study of Bonnard has identified the partially concealed hands ofBonnard jutting into this painting offering up a redstained sanitary clothto the yellow nude            Bonnard had met the highheeled diminutive model for manyof these paintings of nudes around  She introduced herself as Marthe deMlingythe sort of mocknoble name that demimondaines such as Prousts Odettede Crcy liked to assumeand claimed to be a teenager Her real name wasMaria Boursin and she was  though Bonnard didnt find out these detailsuntil like Prousts Swann he married her The marriage kept secret fromBonnards family was the result of a traumatic development in Bonnards lifeHe had had affairs with other models before but seven years earlier he hadfallen in love with a statuesque blondea woman physically the opposite ofMarthecalled Rene Monchat Chaty to her intimates In several paintingsincluding  two womenin this case the brunette leaning over the tableto the right and the peripheral blonde to the extreme leftseem to vie for theviewers attention The optical mechanisms arising from such tensions betweencentral figures and partially hidden peripheral figures are a major subject ofElderfields essay            Bonnardfound himself unable to leave Marthe his lifelong companion and Rene killedherself in despair By some reports she shot herself others perhapsinfluenced by the obsession of Bonnards late paintings say she drownedherself in her bathtub In any case it was in  the year of his marriagethat Bonnard first painted his wife fulllength in the bathtub where sheretreated for hours at a time every day The usual line is that Martheparanoid and neurotic had a mania for cleanliness Sarah Whitfield whoinstalled the show for its previous run at Londons Tate Gallery while notdenying the compulsive nature of Marthes bathing has suggested thathydropathy was a popular treatment for such ailments as tubercular laryngitiswhich Marthe suffered from and eventually in  died of All three latepaintings of Marthe in the bathconsidered by many to be Bonnards

a standin for Bonnard An alarm clock on the washstand is setforever at  oclock as though to mark this epiphany when the white lightstruck the womans breast just so Then in the enigmatic selfportraitsgrouped in the final room of the MoMA show Bonnard is suddenly fully therethough backlit and shadowed in the bathroom mirror Two of the very lateselfportraits have the wartime blackout

youd bet on His face looks bruised andbattered and his small sunken eyes show the marks where glasses were justremoved But he holds up his hands gamely as though to say that with thesehands bloodied and unprotected he painted some of the most extraordinarypaintings of his quickly ending century
