                                 Steven Jobs Totalitarian Vision            We started out to get acomputer in the hands of everyday people Steven Jobs cofounder and putativesavior of Apple Computer tells us in Time this week What Jobs left outof that sentence though is a word that has wrecked Apple in the past andcould wreck it in the future The word is our or to be more accurate myas in We started out to get my computer in the hands of everydaypeople            Jobs wasnever interested in having everyone own personal computers He was interestedonly in having everyone own Apples And this is of course the great ironybehind Apples apparently imperishable image as the corporation of thecounterculture an image that has been the source of some of Americanjournalisms more preposterous pronouncements It was all about freedomsurethe freedom to have a Macintosh on your desk            As everyone knows by now Jobs always portrayed Apple ingeneral and the Mac in particular as avatars of a new populist revolution astools of democratization In this sense the  Super Bowl ad featuring anathletic woman hurling a hammer and destroying Big Brother was not so much someinvention of ChiatDays imagination as it was the visual expression ofeverything Jobs had been saying since Apple began What you couldnt tell fromthe ad though was that in Jobs imagination what would replace Big Brotherwas not the anarchic space of the market with people buying computers from or  different manufacturers It was instead the comforting spectacle ofmillions upon millions of Mac users all imagining they were pursuing personalcreativity and individual selfexpressionand all buying that creativity onlyfrom Apple            Whatsreally interesting about Jobs imperial ambition though is that the veryimmensity of its scope doomed Apple to marginality The problem was not thatJobs wanted Apple to have a hand in every corner of the personalcomputingmarket Thats what Bill Gates has always wanted after all and that desirehas made Microsoft into one of the worlds most profitable companies Theproblem rather was that Jobs wanted Apple to be every corner of thepersonalcomputing market He wanted to make the computers and thesystems that ran themand to be the only company that did so And that meantthat almost from the beginning Apple was confused about its mission In thesimplest terms it was a hardware company that thought it was a softwarecompanyor vice versa            The difference between making hardware andmaking software is analogous to the difference between making razors and makingrazor blades You may make more money on each razorbut your margins will be alot higher on the blades and you will sell a lot more of them Now itspossible to make razors profitably Compaq is an billion company and DellComputer is Wall Streets new darling and all they make is razors But its atougher business Price pressures are constant Its hard to distinguishyourself from the crowd though Apples name would have helped its case Andmost important of all theres no romance in it No one really talks about howmuch better a Compaq is than a Gateway Computers that cost about the same seemto run about the same            Microsoft on the other hand sells only blades Word Money Excel evenWindows All these are blades And Microsoft sells those blades to whoeverwants them Gates doesnt care what kind of machine you run his software on Hejust wants you to run his software            This of course is the other path Apple could have takenIt was actually the path Gates recommended in a nowfamous  memo thatsuggested that Apple license the Macintosh operating systemwith its graphicalinterface and windowsto three to five other manufacturers who would buildcompatible computers In  the Mac OS was dramatically superior to DOSwhich was the operating system for all IBM compatibles Going strongly intosoftware then would have capitalized on what people really loved about Applewhich was not the Mac itself but the interface Had Apple allowed CompaqHewlettPackard perhaps even IBM to build hardware running the Mac OS itmight very well have seen its software become the industry standard            InsteadApple chose to go it alonein part because it would have been hard to watchother companies selling  clones of the Macs that Apple imagined it couldhave been selling instead That was a mistake of shortterm thinking though itwas an understandable one The preposterously high margins Apple was able toearn in the earlytomid s when it was selling Apple IIs to dealersfor three times cost and earning percent gross profits on Macs undoubtedlyblinded the company to the fact that consumers would not ignore price foreverThose shortterm considerations might have been overridden though except forone thing Jobs insistence that Apple be the sole standardbearer of thedigital revolution Jobs didnt want to make just blades Jobs wanted to makethe razor the blades and the packaging And if hed had his way Apple wouldhave forged the stainless steel too According to one account Jobs oncefantasized about a factory in which the raw materials that came in would benot semiconductors but sand Insert the appropriate castles built on metaphor here            Jobs quest for complete control also meantthat he didnt want his machines to be able to talk to other companiesmachines In fact this hostility to compatibility permeated even the companysattitude toward itself When the Mac was introduced hundreds of thousands ofpeople owned Apple IIs But the Mac was incompatible with its predecessor Youcouldnt upgrade you had to abandon Apple made it hard even for Macintosh andLisa its entry into the business market to work together though both weredesigned at the same time Its as if for Jobs the basic criterion for aninsanely great product was its radical difference which is to say itsisolation from everything else            Whats truly strikingthough is that Jobs has never really let this idea go After he left Apple hefounded NeXT and tried to go the hardwaresoftware route again until he had tosell the hardware unit to Canon and the software to yes Apple Upon returningto Apple he began criticizing almost immediately the companys  decisionto finally allow a limited number of companies to manufacture Mac clonescalling these firms leeches Somehow I doubt that Bill Gates thinks of Dellas parasitic because its computers run only on Windows In this respectbringing Steve Jobs back to save Apple is like bringing Gen George McClellanout of retirement to save the Union Army            The remarkable fact is thatat this very moment Apple Computer is a larger company than Microsoft Thedifference is that Microsoft earned  billion more last year than Apple didEvery computer Apple makes costs a lot to make Every additional copy ofWindows  costs Microsoft  oh just about nothing That could have beenApples world and it isnt because the company imagined it could be allthings If only Apple had decided to be The Way and let someone else be TheLight
