        uh well  uh having sort of recently gone through the school system i seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing im im just graduating college graduating from college uh i didnt really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system however when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and again you can compare just about everything thing to Japan and we look like we we dont have anything um it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough um however i if it werent for our needless uh  competition with Japan i id id think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace   i dont know um i havent its been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um   umhum   ive seen things change i dont know if ive seen things change enough that i can actually because i wasnt really like listening to the world go by back then so its hard to compare you know what i mean   right   but um it seems like  when i lived i lived in Chicago ive ive lived down here i hear the dropout rates from the schools and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year   yeah   and i begin to wonder if im really getting my moneys worth   hm   i mean i ive seen so many different things so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean somebodys getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people   right       but um i dont i dont understand the um i dont understand i guess why the schools dont seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities   uh well i i dont pretend to understand that either uh but im not quite sure that its the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again im not quite sure where the blame ought to be put um because the the dropout rate is in those areas its its high in those areas where also theres poverty and and crime and they all seem to go together and it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle whether wherever you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better so uh and the other two all oh theyre all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to to fix but its just like i i dont expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like i dont know its its a complicated issue i i still dont think i would directly blame it directly on the school   i dont know if i blame it on the school i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things i think i blame it on the school system um   well thats what i meant when i said the school   yeah  i dont blame it on the teachers in the school i although i think that i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than well  they do quite well for themselves   hm well that thats odd because i dont think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid   no not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid i mean i know one family thats got theyre both teachers and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons they both work all summer fulltime and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each   umhum yeah well it it   i mean that family is making over a hundred grand and im i mean okay okay yes i agree that teaching our kids is important   right   however these people who only work eight hours a day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between and thats my tax dollars that im spending on that and i dont even have kids   yeah well well well thats true but that theres you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong but when youre talk  and theres really not much you can directly do about that i think that that if if there is a problem with the school system uh from my its been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved uh where you have other professional jobs and this this is a profession and as a matter of fact its a pretty big influence on on
