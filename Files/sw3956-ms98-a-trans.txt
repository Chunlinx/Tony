        okay       well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody i think they should i know i had a job until lets see a year ago this past December i was working for PIE and they closed and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance but um for me to try to get it now uh it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at at pie   good grief thats just almost unaffordable isnt it   right it really is and i think you know i think the God the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high   well i wonder if they couldnt just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that that might be a step in the right direction i dont know   well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know and then what you can get out here in anyhow in the valley where i live at now they dont wanna pay anything for health insurance at all   uhhuh     no benefits you know um yes i mean you get a job now and   you mean the uh the employers uhhuh   the wages are really low and uh   because everybodys competing for jobs   yeah and they dont want uh to pay any benefits       so you just you know pray to God that you dont get sick   well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do i I have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually hes Canadian   umhum   and uh he told me that therere a lot of uh lot of counts against the Canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here i dont understand the arguments exactly he says it restricts your choice   umhum   of doctors and and so forth im not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does   no i dont understand that either   i mean were on a private insurance plan right now uh actually uh i have my own business and and we uh our health insurance is through my wifes employer   umhum umhum   and uh and every year we get another list of what doctors we can go to and where we can buy or medicine and and uh it changes every year its always so confusing so uh   yeah well i know the plan that i had with PIE i could go to any doctor and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then i just sent cards in and then   umhum   they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know   well yeah of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation but of course that is restricted choice so   umhum umhum umhum   i dont think that the restricted choice really uh has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance i think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost doesnt it and uh everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way so   uh yeah thats true thats true there   well um i guess the most sensible thing ive heard about this is they they say people are trying you you you have to recognize that if youre going to   well   have the very best health care possible and uh available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then its gonna be expensive   yeah right   and if you wanna pay less then youre gonna have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish   umhum   and uh   but theres just so many people that cant afford to pay anything you know that people thats on unemployment   yeah well what happened to Reagans safety net anyway did he take that back to California with him   i dont know     using it for a trampoline now   yeah probably so i dont know but it is it does seem to be a big problem you know i dont know what theyre gonna come up with but um i sure wish they would come up with with something and uh like i say and and im at the age too where the ill be fifty seven in June and the people dont wanna hire people this age any more and i worked for my previous company for twenty six years you know so its kind of hard you know so   yeah theyll be needing you in a couple of years because theyre running out of kids down there at the other end and uh     yeah theyll be calling at my door huh  but any how     well if theyre smart   yeah now i I do think the government though is gonna have to do something uh with this problem because it you you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks   uhhuh   you know just for the visit and then he then thats not counting what medicine youre gonna buy and everything else you know and he might tell you well you know now youre gonna have to come back in a week and then thats another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you   right
