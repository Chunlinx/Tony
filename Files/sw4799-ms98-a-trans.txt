        okay um i havent been in this situation yet       you know my my parents are not quite at that age yet so i havent   thats not quite elderly huh   no so i havent uh really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother but um     uhhuh   thats really about it how about you have you been in that situation where youve had to   um not for my parents but i i was around uh two sets of grandparents um quite a bit we we put one i put one grandfather in a rest home   uhhuh   and that killed him  well yeah kind of well there was some other things involved but it before he was really active and   did it really   the there was some you know he lost lost his drivers license and uh couldnt get around and wasnt able to do some things and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home   yeah   and he just kind of became a vegetable and died   oh no thats sad   so but that was a long time ago that was uh back in like seventy three   yeah oh okay   so um i think the way they did things were a lot different back then   are sure they were   and uh my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home she was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didnt really need to be there   yeah uhhuh   and uh had a physical had a good physical therapist at that place   oh   and they worked with her and got her walking and got her taking kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home   yeah oh   and then she had to go back in a couple of times but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up   huh   and they got her going again   yeah   so i guess as far as looking and i said the as what youre looking for i think you need to look for an active uh interactive staff   uhhuh   somebody whos willing to work with uh you know work with a patients and do do things with them and treat them treat them like that   yeah and im sure its its expensive   it it is   yeah   yeah   it is expensive   yeah my my grandmother is not in a nursing home but shes in a  oh theyre like um theyre apartments for senior citizens   what uhhuh oh uhhuh   and she loves that because it it they arrange activities for them all day long and then they have um where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go   umhum   and she she she really does love that but shes just concerned about in in the future you know she she knows its not gonna be like that all the time and shes just wondering well whats gonna happen to me and and i you know its i guess its so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesnt need that but   uhhuh when she cant take care of herself umhum now that   you know shes kind of asking questions about what well whats gonna happen you know this cant last forever and   uhhuh   so   does she have a is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to or she can go down to the cafeteria   yeah it yeah she can but i i think it is also cafeteria style because i i really i i i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself   uhhuh   so uh   fact i   because i i remember her in her letters telling me she shell go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so im assuming its something like that too so   uhhuh   so   yeah i i really like that concept theyve they have a few of those well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah and uh you know i   umhum   couples can you know husband and wife can can live there too or or whatever i and and and then and yet they have their their friendships and relationships the you know of getting together and eating together and all of that   yeah yeah   i i think it really takes um you you know looking more at the people than even really the facilities   umhum and she lives by herself too she seems to like it and um my husbands grandmother is   uhhuh   well she lives she lives in a house on her own and she doesnt really need the care or anything like that but she has her own home and she and shes doing really well im really proud of her shes doing really well   umhum   so we havent had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support so i mean shes got her mother in town too and things like that so hopefully we wont need to go that route   yeah yeah well i i think that thats the thing thats a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is its its almost like that you know they say putting them out to pasture and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active they they wanted to do things they didnt you know they didnt wanna go down and play bingo or um   yeah   you know play with the yarn
