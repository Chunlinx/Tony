                                 The Unkindest Cut            With surprisingly littlefanfare four states recently passed laws calling for castrationeitherchemical or surgicalof sex offenders Last month prompted by two prisonerswho actually wanted the treatment Texas Gov George Bush signed a lawletting judges offer castration as an option for perpetrators of sex crimesFlorida California and Montana have all enacted more stringent laws to orderinvoluntary chemical or surgical castration of these criminals            Thetechnology for castration has evolved considerably and there is evidence thatin some circumstances it can dramatically reduce the likelihood a sex offenderwill strike again Nonetheless there are strong reasons that courtorderedcastration is a bad idea            Americans remain frustrated with the inability of thejustice system to control rape and child molestation Dozens of states haveenacted socalled Megans Laws requiring that the public be notified whenreleased sex offenders move in nearby but people complain that it doesnt helpmuch to know that your neighbor is a pedophile if you cant do anything aboutit More states are turning to doctors to solve the problem for them            Compulsorycastration has been used as a punishment for crimes in all cultures dating backthousands of years In Europe in the Middle Ages the eye for an eyephilosophy of jus talionis included castration as punishment foradultery or rape In the  th century castration has been practicedin the Netherlands Germany Estonia Iceland Switzerland and Scandinavia forrape pedophilia and homosexuality After World War II its use in Europe wasdramatically scaled back probably because of the increased awareness ofhumanitarian concerns prompted by the Holocaust            More recently research has produced powerfuldrugs such as cyproproterone and medroxyprogesterone which reversibly blocktestosterone production The drugs primary use in men is to control prostatecancer but when injected daily or weekly they reduce testosterone tocastration levels Side effects include serious allergic reactions and theformation of blood clots that can kill patients The drugs also appear to alterthinking enough to increase suicide rates The Czech Republic and Germany havereintroduced castration in this modern seemingly humane form although onlyamong sex offenders who volunteer for treatment            Surgical castration is lessmutilating than it once was Orchiectomy as it is called is a daysurgeryprocedure done under local anesthesia Each testicle is removed through a smallscrotal incision similar to the kind made during a vasectomy            Three ofthe four new state laws call for sentencing rapists to be castrated but withsome variations Florida requires judges to impose either injections ororchiectomy for repeat rapists California does the same but only for repeatchild molesters Montana allows but does not require judges to imposechemical castration on offenders who commit rape or incest after even oneoffense if it is particularly heinous            Legislators argue that castration is justified andappropriate and that by controlling sex offenders irresistible urges to rapeor molest again the operation allows them to be released without endangeringthe public Studies of the European experience suggest they could be right Ofmore than  Danish sex offenders castrated after multiple convictionsrelapse rates dropped from between  percent and  percent to just  percentA Norwegian study showed the same for selected male and female sex offendersthe women had their ovaries removed In smaller studies of cyproproterone inScandinavia and Italy chemical castration was equally effective in some groupsof volunteer prisoners with the most dramatic reductions among pedophiles            These studies suggest thecommon argumentthat rape is all about power not sex and thereforecastration wont workis wrong Interestingly a German study found that up tohalf of the castrated men still could have erections and sex but their desirewas weakened or even extinguished Over  percent no longer masturbated percent gave up sex As Fred Berlin a Johns Hopkins University psychiatristand expert on treating sex offenders points out castration works mainly inthose who are sexually aroused by their crime  sadists and pedophilesCastration takes the impulse away from those with an aberrant sexualorientation often to their relief            So what objection could therebe to castration of sex offenders Well none if it is carefully applied tothe narrow group of repeat sadistic or pedophiliac rapists who accept thetreatment But the courtmandated castration proposed in Florida Californiaand Montana raises serious problems                                         The laws are wrong to apply castrationindiscriminately The studies show that castration is effective incriminals with multiple offenses especially if they are motivated by sex Butproponents are wrongly using the data to justify mandatory application acrossthe board In Florida and Montana all rapists are targeted even thoughsadists and pedophiles are only a small percentage of the total Most rapistsappear to be motivated by hatred or anger not sex Montana lets judges ordercastration after just one offense Dr Berlin argues that the laws impose amedical intervention in the absence of evidence that forced treatment is likely to be effective and make no effort to medically assess whethercastration is appropriate for an individual                            Forced castration is difficult to administer Firstthe state must find doctors willing to do the job Heavens Gate members hadto go to Mexico for the operation because no California doctor would perform iton them Californias law suggests letting state workers give the injectionswithout medical supervision but the serious side effects and the need toensure that appropriate doses are given make this approach foolhardy It alsoraises the question of what to do with people who cant take the drug becauseof the side effects Would they have to go back to jail Bringing in releasedconvicts for injections is even more difficult The longestlasting drugmedroxyprogesterone still must be given weekly Making sure that rapists andpedophiles turn up week after week for an unwanted potentially lifelongtreatment may prove impossible                            Forced castration is immoral In  the SupremeCourt recognized this when it ruled that involuntary surgical castrationconstituted cruel and unusual punishment The court may be persuaded to letchemical castration stand because it is theoretically reversible If this lineis crossed politicians would have little to stop them from seeking forcedtreatments to control other behaviors such as adultery for which castrationhas historically been a punishment prostitution or the consumption ofpornography As medicines arsenal expands we already have drugs to limitlibido hunger and depression it is conceivable that laws could mandate evenwider uses of medicines to control the population            Many people see rapists as a special case though havingno objections to extreme measures to stop them from raping again The crime isso repugnant they say that it is hard to treat rapists as people deserving ofany concern Prisoners after all give up their rights for having committedsuch crimes But as bioethicist Arthur Caplan points out while prisoners areexcluded from moral life losing the right to vote Americans have notreduced them to nonhuman status Unlike Iran Turkey or Nazi Germany theUnited States accepts prisoners rights to free speech legal representationand health care We still reject using prisoners for organ transplants or slavelabor Requiring castration for rape means we have decided it is acceptable totreat prisoners as less than human            While the laws elsewhere failto counter these fundamental objections the narrower castration law in Texasseems more appropriate It does not mandate castration instead reserving itfor repeat offenders who seek the treatment Larry Don McQuay could be thefirst to whom it is applied He admits to molesting children at least times Having completed his sentence for his one conviction he is set forrelease Fearing his urges he wants orchiectomy It should be done
