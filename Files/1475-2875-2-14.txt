                    Background        Mefloquine is a prophylactic antimalarial drug that is        also used for malaria chemotherapy Adverse central nervous        system CNS events have been associated with its use             Severe CNS events requiring hospitalization occur in         and  patients taking mefloquine for        chemoprophylaxis or treatment respectively             Milder CNS events eg dizziness headache and insomnia        are a more frequent occurrence being experienced by up to         of patients receiving chemoprophylactic doses and         of those receiving therapeutic doses      Higher blood        levels of mefloquine are reached under therapeutic regimens         M compared with those for prophylaxis  M             The relative incidence of adverse effects is        therefore probably doserelated although the concomitant        effect of malaria during treatment cannot be dismissed It        is likely then that the adverse neurological events        associated with mefloquine have a biochemical basis        To date no satisfactory biochemical explanation of the        neurotoxicity of mefloquine has been proposed However two        lines of evidence suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum        might be a neuronal target of mefloquine Go and others            showed that mefloquine affects calcium flux into and        out of isolated mammalian microsomes obtained from skeletal        muscle and neuronal tissue These observations suggest that        mefloquine might disrupt ER calcium homeostasis but are        difficult to interpret since the experiments were not        conducted in an intact cell system In an unrelated study        we investigated the effects of mefloquine on global        transcription in rat neuroblastoma NG cells using        microarrays     Mefloquine caused a striking        upregulation of growth arrest and development protein         GADD a transcription factor selectively modulated        under conditions of ER stress     Taken together these        observations suggest that mefloquine might perturb the        function of the ER via a disruption of calcium homeostasis        Most ERactive agents eg thapsigargin and ryanodine        deplete the ER calcium pool either by i inhibiting the ER        calcium pump and thereby preventing the replenishment of        the ER calcium pool or ii triggering ER ryanodine or        inositol trisphosphate IP           activated calcium release channels            These phenomena can be visualized by fluorescence        microscopy as a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium        concentrations for example see     Nominally        calciumfree media are used so that the effect can be        distinguished from calcium influx mediated via plasma        membrane channels If the test agent can be shown to        antagonize the release of calcium by a known ER agonist it        can then be concluded that the ER calcium pool is a target        of the compound        ER function is critical if protein synthesis and folding        is to successfully occur in eukaryotic cells      ER        stress induced by cellular events as diverse as disrupted        calcium homeostasis elevated levels of reactive oxygen        species and viral infection leads to accumulation of        dysfunctional ER chaperones and misfolded proteins            Cells respond by one or both of two conserved stress        response pathways The first the ER overload response        triggers the activation of the transcription factor NFkB        and the subsequent upregulation of inflammatory proteins            The second the unfolded protein response UPR        induces three divergent cellular events i the activation        of transcription factor ATF leading to the upregulation of        ER chaperones such as protein disulfide isomerase ii        upregulation of the proapoptotic transcription factor        GADD and iii suppression of protein synthesis via        phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor         eIF by pancreatic eIF kinase PEKPERK             Upregulation of the ER chaperones GADD and PERK in        response to a toxic insult would constitute direct evidence        of an ER stress response        In the present study using laser scanning confocal        microscopy we show that the ER calcium pool is a target of        mefloquine in rat neurons as under calcium free        conditions the drug induces elevations in intracellular        calcium concentrations and antagonizes the pharmacological        effect of thapsigargin a known inhibitor of the ER calcium        pump Further we show that in the presence of        extraneuronal calcium mefloquine induces a sustained        elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels via an unknown        mechanism The disruption of calcium homeostasis by        mefloquine appears to be related in terms of doseeffect        and kinetics of action to the acute neurotoxicity of the        drug In a microarray study we also show that mefloquine        induces the transcription of key ER stress response genes        Collectively the data suggest that mefloquine may inhibit        neuronal ER function and disrupt neuronal calcium        homeostasis at physiologically relevant concentrations         in vitro                     Methods                  Materials          Racemic            erythro  mefloquine was obtained          from the WRAIR chemical inventory system The          calciumsensitive dye Fluo was purchased from Molecular          Probes Eugene OR Reagents used in cell culture and          neurotoxicityneuroprotection assays were obtained from          Sigma St Louis MO Biosource International Rockville          MD and GIBCOLife Technologies Grand Island NY                          Preparation of primary neuronal cell          cultures          Primary neuronal cultures of feotal rat forebrains          were prepared as described previously     Briefly          the forebrains of feotal rat pups embryonic day  were          isolated and the cells were dispersed by repeated          mechanical trituration in neuronal culture medium NCM           Hams F Basal Medium Eagle  supplemented with          dextrose  gl glutamine  and PenStrep           Following centrifugation   g  min and          resuspension in fresh NCM the cells were counted and          plated onto polyLlysinecoated  well plates at a          density of    cellswell For imaging experiments          the neurons were transferred to chamber cover glass          slides that had been previously coated with polyLlysine          followed by collagen Each chamber contained             cells For the array studies the neurons             neurons per flask were transferred to  cm flasks To          suppress glial growth cultures were treated with          cytosine Darabinofuranoside  M after  days           in vitro  All cultures were          maintained in an incubator  CO             C for at least  days and no          more than  days prior to use                          Confocal microscopy          The approach utilized for confocal microscopy          experiments is similar to that employed in an earlier          study     Neurons on chamber slides were treated          with  M FluoAM for  h After  h in an incubator          the cells were rinsed with fresh Mg free Lockes          solution NaCl  mM KCl  mM NaHCO              mM CaCl              mM glucose  mM HEPES           mM pH  and returned to the incubator for an          additional  minutes prior to initiating the imaging          experiments Changes in neuronal calcium homeostasis were          monitored using a BioRad Radiance  confocal imaging          system Changes in cytoplasmic calcium were recorded as          fluctuations in the emitted fluorescence of          Fluocomplexed calcium at  nm excitation was           nm Sequential image scans of fields containing           neurons were used to construct temporal profiles of the          effects of the different agonists Typically scans were          made at  or  s intervals To compare the fluorescence          levels in different neurons which were often in slightly          different focal planes on different days the          fluorescence readings at each time point were normalized          to the first one taken for each neuron                          Effects of mefloquine on ER calcium          homeostasis          In the first series of experiments mefloquines          effects on mobilization of ER calcium stores were          investigated The neurons chamber slides were rinsed          twice with fresh low calcium Lockes buffer NaCl           mM KCl  mM NaHCO              mM CaCl              mM glucose  mM HEPES           mM EGTA  mM pH  and immersed in the same solution           l per chamber Neurons were scanned at  s          intervals Mefloquine final concentration of  M or          DMSO  thapsigargin  M glutamate  M and          CaCl             mM were added after scans             and  respectively All drugs were prepared in          calciumfree Lockes solution containing no EGTA Data          analysis was conducted only for neurons in which an          increase in cytoplasmic calcium was observed after the          addition of calcium chloride                          Effects of lower mefloquine doses on ER calcium          homeostasis          In a second series of experiments the effects of          lower mefloquine doses on ER calcium homeostasis were          investigated The neurons chamber slides were rinsed          twice with fresh low calcium Lockes buffer containing          DMSO NaCl  mM KCl  mM NaHCO              mM CaCl              mM glucose  mM HEPES           mM EGTA  mM DMSO  pH  and immersed in the          same solution  l per chamber Neurons were scanned          at  s intervals Mefloquine      or           M thapsigargin  M glutamate  M and CaCl             mM final concentration were          added sequentially as outlined earlier except that for          the lowest mefloquine dose experiment  and  M          mefloquine were added to the same well after scans  and           respectively Selection of neurons for data analysis          was conducted as described above For each mefloquine          concentration in each experiment the maximum increase in          the cytoplasmic calcium concentration relative to the          baseline was determined at least four replicate          experiments were conducted for each mefloquine          concentration For example the maximum relative          increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration induced by          mefloquine at  M in one of the experiments was           as illustrated in Figure  Concentrationresponse          effects were then expressed as a percentage change in          terms of the mean relative increase in cytoplasmic          calcium observed at the highest mefloquine concentration          The highest mefloquine concentration used was  M          since this was the lowest concentration tested that          induced almost  loss of viability after five minutes          exposure Figure                           Effect of mefloquine on cytoplasmic calcium          homeostasis and its antagonisation by thapsigargin          The effect of mefloquine on whole cell calcium          homeostasis was also investigated The neurons chamber          slides were rinsed twice with fresh Lockes buffer          containing physiological levels of calcium NaCl  mM          KCl  mM NaHCO              mM CaCl              mM glucose  mM HEPES           mM pH  and immersed in the same solution  l per          chamber Neurons were scanned at  s intervals          Mefloquine  M thapsigargin  M or DMSO           were added after scan  and DMSO  or mefloquine           M after scan                           Detection of transcriptional changes in key ER          stress response genes using microarrays          Neurons  cm culture flasks were treated with           DMSO controls   or  M mefloquine in Lockes          buffer containing calcium for five minutes This          treatment time was chosen because the depletion of the ER          calcium store by mefloquine occurs within this time          period After  min the media were replaced with MEM          containing  DMSO for the control  and  M          mefloquine treatment groups or  M mefloquine for a          further  h Therefore neurons were exposed to the          lowest mefloquine concentration for  h A recovery          period of  h is required following an insult with an          ERagonist to induce a maximal ER stress response              After  h total RNA was extracted from the flasks using          RNASTAT  as previously described     The          experiment was repeated five times on independent          occasions          Detailed procedures for preparation of cDNA and          fluorescently labeled cRNA hybridization staining and          scanning of gene chips and assay monitoring are outlined          in earlier literature     The platform chosen for          global expression profile was the Rat Genome U Array          Affymetrix Santa Clara California which contains          probes for a total of  expressed sequence tag EST          clusters and genes including controls RNA  g          extracted from each individual flask was hybridized to a          single gene chip ie a total of  chips were used          Affymetrix analysis software version  was used to          generate average difference AD values for each gene for          each treatment Affymetrix Santa Clara California AD          values represent the difference in mean fluorescence          between positive and mismatch probe cells for each gene          and are hereafter referred to as expression values          The Affymetrix website httpwwwaffymetrixcomwas          searched using the terms PEKPERK GADD and the          gene names for ER chaperones previously identified as          being upregulated during an ER stress response              and where they were represented by probesets on the U          arrays corresponding accession numbers were identified          The expression values for these accession numbers were          imported directly into Parteck Pro  No additional          data normalization or scaling methods were employed as          these procedures were performed previously by the          Affymetrix software Oneway ANOVAs were performed to          compare the mean expression levels of each of the genes          amongst the different treatment groups A significant          change in mean expression level was assumed to have          occurred where ANOVA           P values were   A less          conservative significance threshold was considered          appropriate since the total number of hypotheses ie          tests of significance conducted was small For a          particular treatment group a gene was considered to have          differentially modulated expression where the foldchange          in expression exceeded  Foldchanges FC in          expression were defined as  mean mefloquine expression          levelmean DMSO

  Viability measurements          Neuronal viability was assessed using the colorimetric          MTT assay as described previously     All          experiments were conducted in Mg free Lockes solution          unless otherwise indicated Neurons were exposed to          graded concentrations of mefloquine for  or  min and           h After treatment mefloquine dilutions were removed          and replaced with MEM Gibco The neurons were incubated          for a further  h The next day MTT was added to each          well such that the final concentration of the dye was           gml Plates were then returned to the incubator for  h          at which time unincorporated MTT was removed and the          plates were allowed to air dry The purple formazan          product indicative of viable cells was then dissolved by          adding  l acidified isopropanol  isopropanol           N HCl and  l aliquots were collected The          absorbance of these aliquots was measured on an ELISA          plate reader at  nm The effects of mefloquine were          compared to appropriate DMSO controls          The acute toxicity of the low calcium Lockes solution          was also investigated Neurons were exposed to the buffer          at  minute intervals over a  min time period          Effects of the various treatments were compared to          appropriate controls Lockes solution with and without          calcium andor  mM EGTA for  minutes Viability was          assessed as above except that the neurons were not          incubated overnight in MEM prior to performing the MTT          assay                          Neuroprotective effect of thapsigargin          The effect of mefloquine  or  M for  min          before and after pretreatment with thapsigargin  M for           min on the viability of rat neurons was assessed as          described above The degree of neuroprotection afforded          by thapsigargin was basically the extent to which the          drug reversed the decline in absorbance viability          induced by mefloquine and was calculated as previously          described                              Statistical analyses data analysis and          presentation          For the confocal experiments the data are presented as          mean normalized Fluo fluorescence  the standard error          of the mean SEM and are representative of at least          three replicate experiments Toxicity and neuroprotection          data are presented as mean  viability or raw A            values  SEM and represent the          results of at least three experiments in every case          Samples sizes are outlined in the table or figure          legends For the toxicity experiments the significance          of multiple treatments was assessed using oneway ANOVA          and Dunnetts ttest For the neuroprotection experiment          the data were analyzed using a twoway ANOVA with a           P value   for the          interaction between mefloquine and thapsigargin taken to          represent an antagonistic effect of the two compounds          Statistical procedures for the analysis of microarray          data are discussed above Fifty percent inhibitory or          effective concentrations and  confidence intervals IC                     or ED             for the effects of mefloquine on          neuronal viability and calcium homeostasis were          calculated using Prism software                            Results                  Effects of  M mefloquine on ER calcium          homeostasis          As can be seen from examination of the first peak in          Figure  mefloquine caused a transient increase in          intracellular calcium levels whereas DMSO did not          Mefloquine also antagonized the subsequent transient          elevation of cytoplasmic calcium induced by the addition          of thapsigargin as can be seen from examination of the          second series of peaks in Figure  A subsequent addition          of glutamate failed to elicit a calcium response whereas          addition of calcium chloride to the medium did The          antagonisation by mefloquine of the ER calcium release          induced by thapsigargin a specific inhibitor of the ER          calcium pump suggests that mefloquine mobilizes ER          calcium stores Glutamate induces the activation of          plasma membrane influx channels therefore its failure to          illicit a calcium response shows that the external media          contained low levels of free calcium Therefore the          elevation of intracellular calcium cannot be attributed          to influx from an external source The subsequent ability          of the neurons to elicit a response after restoration of          normal levels of extracellular calcium shows that the          neurons selected for the confocal microscopy experiments          remained viable for the duration of these          experiments                          Lowcalcium Lockes buffer does not substantially          reduce neuronal viability          The neurotoxicity of the low calcium Lockes buffer          was investigated over time As can be seen from Figure           substitution of normal Lockes buffer for one containing          no added calcium results in a loss of neuronal viability           reduction Welchs test           P   n   This solution          was not used for the mefloquine studies because control          experiments showed that glutamate elicited a calcium          response in neurons exposed to this buffer data not          shown presumably because the rinsing procedure did not          remove all residual free calcium We utilized a low          calcium  M Lockes buffer supplemented with EGTA           mM for the confocal microscopy experiments As can be          seen from Figure  exposure to this buffer for           minutes was required to reduce the viability of the          neurons below that induced by treatment of neurons with          Lockes containing no added calcium one way ANOVA and          Dunnetts test           P   n   All          mefloquine calcium response experiments were conducted          within this time frame and care was taken to analyze          data only from neurons that were shown to be viable at          the termination of the experiment as indicated by the          CaCl            induced calcium response                          Effect of lower mefloquine concentrations on ER          calcium homeostasis and relationship to timedependent          neurotoxicity          We next investigated the effects of lower mefloquine          doses on neuronal ER calcium homeostasis ie in          lowcalcium Lockes buffer At concentrations of at          least  M mefloquine induced a transient increase in          cytosolic calcium levels Table  oneway ANOVA          Dunnetts ttest           P             n   The effect was          doserelated with an ED            of  M  confidence interval             M The IC            of mefloquines effect on neuronal          viability after  min exposure was   M and          the dose response curves of the two effects are          superimposable Figure  These data suggest that the          two effects may be related The IC            s of mefloquines effect on          neuronal viability were   and   M for          exposure times  min and  h respectively The          concentrationeffect curves are superimposable Also at          a concentration of  M mefloquine exhibited a greater          neurotoxic effect after  min or  h exposure as          compared to a  minute exposure one way ANOVA and          Dunnetts ttest           P   n   Therefore          it appears that most of mefloquines neurotoxic effects          occur within  min of exposure but cannot be accounted          for solely by the disruptive effect of mefloquine on ER          calcium homeostasis Consequently we investigated the          effect of mefloquine on neuronal calcium homeostasis in          calciumcontaining media                          Effect of mefloquine on whole cell calcium          homeostasis          The effects of mefloquine on neuronal calcium          homeostasis in calciumcontaining medium were          investigated As shown in Figure  mefloquine  M          caused an immediate and sustained rise in cytoplasmic          calcium levels In some experiments this sustained          elevation of cytoplasmic calcium was preceded by a          transient rise as observed

possibility that a biochemical explanation may        lie behind the neurotoxicity of mefloquine However        previous literature suggested that mefloquine might disrupt        ER calcium homeostasis Firstly Go and others            showed that mefloquine alters calcium flux into and out of        isolated mammalian microsomes obtained from skeletal muscle        and neuronal tissue Secondly mefloquine has been shown to        cause a striking upregulation of GADD a transcription        factor selectively modulated under conditions of ER stress            However the depletion of the ER calcium pool on        the one hand and a consequent induction of an ER stress        response have not been shown to occur simultaneously in        intact primary neurons In the present study utilizing        confocal microscopy and Affymetrix arrays we have shown        that at least one component of the neurotoxicity of        mefloquine can be attributed to an effect on the ER calcium        store and that the drug activates a UPR similar to that        induced by agents known to disrupt ER function        We employed confocal microscopy as a tool to investigate        the effects of mefloquine on calcium homeostasis This        approach has an advantage over that employed by Go et al            in that calcium homeostasis can be assessed in        realtime in live intact neurons Our data show that in        nominally calcium free medium mefloquine induces a        transitory elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels and        antagonizes a similar effect induced by thapsigargin The        most reasonable interpretation of these data is that        mefloquine mobilizes a thapsigarginsensitive calcium pool        and since thapsigargin is known to mobilize the ER calcium        pool that this is also the case for mefloquine The ER        calcium pool can be mobilized in two ways Firstly an        inhibitory effect of an ERactive agent eg thapsigargin        on the ER Ca ATPase results in a decrease in the rate of        calcium influx across the ER membrane As a consequence of        a passive leak of calcium ions across the ER membrane into        the cytoplasm the store becomes depleted and a transient        elevation in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration occurs        Alternatively some ERactive agents eg ryanodine        deplete the calcium store by activating calcium release        channels Either of these effects could account for our        observations        Compromised ER function induced by numerous stressors        including depletion of ER calcium stores may lead to the        accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER     These        events may trigger the UPR in which the transcription of        genes encoding ERresident chaperones is upregulated The        ability of mefloquine to upregulate the transcription of        PDI GRP GRP and calreticulin is consistent with this        hypothesis Triggering of the UPR also results in the        suppression of global protein synthesis as PERK is        activated and phosphorylates EIK which can only interact        with the appropriate ribosomal binding sites in an        unphosphorylated state      While the upregulated        transcription of PERK is not required for its activation        its over expression can lead to the enhanced        phosphorylation and therefore inactivity of EIK            Therefore its upregulation by mefloquine supports the        hypothesis that the drug triggers an UPR The third        component to the UPR cascade is an induction of the ER        transcription factor GADD      an effect also        observed after mefloquine treatment Thus it appears that        mefloquine induces an UPR similar to that induced by agents        eg thapsigargin known to cause ER stress            The effects of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis have        been examined previously      In experiments with        isolated rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes mefloquine was        found to inhibit the uptake of calcium with an IC          of approximately  M     This        effect was exacerbated by treatment with thapsigargin a        specific inhibitor of the ER calcium pump     Further        the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the ER Ca ATPase was        reduced in the presence of mefloquine Ki of   M        These authors concluded that the ER calcium pump might be a        target of mefloquine As discussed above our own data are        also consistent with such a mechanism The observation by        Go et al     that the effects of mefloquine and        thapsigargin on microsomal calcium uptake are synergistic        might seem at first to contradict ours However it should        be pointed out that in our study we treated neurons with        these two agents sequentially so that in effect one of        the agents was acting on a depleted ER calcium pool Under        the conditions employed in our study it is not surprising        that mefloquine antagonized the effect of thapsigargin        Li et al    also found that mefloquine inhibited        calcium uptake into isolated microsomes from dog brain        neurons  presumably via the same mechanism  although the        drug was much less potent IC          of  M than we are reporting it        to be We observed an approximately fourfold more potent        effect of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis in rat        neurons IC          of  M It would be tempting to        speculate that because mefloquines effects on rat        neuronal ER calcium homeostasis were more potent than that        for dogbrain microsomes there might exist a species        difference in sensitivity to the drug However this would        be premature since the two studies have employed markedly        different experimental systems to observe similar        phenomena Li et al also observed that mefloquine        inhibited IP          induced calcium release from isolated        dog brain microsomes     Our results do not preclude        such a role for mefloquine in neuronal cells although it        would not have been possible to observe such an effect in        the present study since we investigated only the        spontaneous action of mefloquine on ER calcium        homeostasis        Mefloquines disruption of ER calcium homeostasis may        contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of the drug since        the concentrationresponse for these effects are        superimposable over the same time frame  minutes        However the toxicity of the drug is somewhat        timedependent since the magnitude of its effect is        greater after twenty minutes exposure as compared to five        minutes We also investigated mefloquines effects in        calciumcontaining medium and found that the drug induces a        sustained secondary rise in cytoplasmic calcium originating        from an external source Thapsigargin blocked both the        initial and secondary rises in cytoplasmic calcium induced        by mefloquine and partially reversed the neurotoxicity of        the drug These observations are suggestive of two things        Firstly the trigger for the sustained elevation in        cytoplasmic calcium may occur at the level of the ER and        secondly this effect may also contribute substantially to        the neurotoxicity of mefloquine However the molecular        basis for these two events is unclear It is possible that        mefloquine induces storemediated capacitative calcium        entry see reference     However it is unclear why        thapsigargin which also depletes the ER calcium store        would not produce a similar effect Our laboratory is        currently investigating the possibility that known        inhibitors of storemediated calcium entry eg non        hydrolysable GTP analogs and SKF might also block the        effects of mefloquine        Mefloquine use has been associated with two broad        classes of neurological disorders i central and        peripheral nervous system disorders including headache        dizziness vertigo and seizures and ii psychiatric events        including insomnia anxiety affective and major disorders            It is well known and has been accepted for some        time that prolonged disruptions in Ca homeostasis can        result in impairment of neuronal function and cell death             Impairment or loss of neurons in specific regions        of the brain might be manifested in symptoms reported to        have occurred in patients treated with mefloquine For        example the vertigo reported by some patients might be        attributable to neuronal death in the inferior cerebellum            whereas symptoms of fearanxiety might arise as a        consequence of the death of neurons in the amygdala            Mefloquineinduced neurotoxicity in the limbic system        might be responsible for reported disturbances in emotion                   Mefloquine accumulates to plasma concentrations of         and  M after administration at prophylactic dose and        therapeutic dosing respectively      Therefore only        at the time of peak plasma concentrations in a few        patients do mefloquine plasma concentrations approach the        threshold necessary   M to induce any of the        effects observed in the present study However in human        postmortem cases mefloquine has been found to accumulate        in the brain relative to plasma by as much as fold with        absolute equivalent concentrations exceeding  M Table         These observations have been confirmed in rats where        the accumulation was found to be fold with absolute        equivalent concentrations exceeding  M Table  Thus        mefloquine apparently crosses the bloodbrain barrier and        accumulates to sufficient levels to include those        concentrations found to disrupt neuronal calcium        homeostasis and ER function         in vitro  The possibility that a        disruption of neuronal calcium homeostasis or ER function        may be responsible at least in part for the clinical        neurotoxicity of mefloquine is worthy of further        investigation                    Conclusion        Mefloquine was found to disrupt calcium homeostasis in        rat neurons by mobilizing the ER calcium pool and inducing        a sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium originating        from an external source Mefloquine also induced a        characteristic ER stress response The effects were        observed at physiologically relevant concentrations and may        contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of the drug         in vitro
