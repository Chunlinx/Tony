I The Presidents Approach  Building on SuccessThe Presidents Energy Plan includes a number of conservationadvanced research and development and other efforts that willreduce electricity usage Reducing the amount of electricity we useand the amount of fuel needed to produce it are part of the answersto the challenge of providing energy in an environmentallyresponsible wayThe Presidents Energy Plan goes even further The President hasdirected me to develop proposed legislation that wouldsignificantly reduce and cap NOx SO and mercury emissions frompower generation Such a program with appropriate measures toaddress local concerns would provide significant health benefitseven as we increase electricity supplies The proposed legislationwillestablish reduction targets for emissions of SO NOx andmercuryphase in reductions over a reasonable time periodsimilar to the successful Acid Rain Program established by the amendments to the Clean Air Act and to state programsprovide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to makemodifications to their plants without fear of new litigationandprovide marketbased incentives such as emissionstrading to help achieve the required reductionsNationwide reductions of the three emissions SO NOx andmercury in an integrated approach would result in key benefitsincluding thousands of avoided premature deaths and aggravation ofrespiratory and cardiovascular illness due to fine particlesreduced hospitalization and emergency room visits due to fineparticles and continued exposure to groundlevel ozone It wouldalso address interstate transport issues as they relate to meetingthe new particulate matter and ozone air quality standardsVisibility improvement would be anticipated over large areasincluding national parks and wilderness areas and recovery of manyfreshwater and coastal ecosystems would be likely Public healthrisks associated with mercury particularly those posed to childrenand women of child bearing age may be reduced This includes risksof neurotoxic effects such as mental retardation cerebral palsydifficulty speaking and hearing others and other learningdisabilities Currently current forty plus states have fishadvisories that number would be reducedThe Presidents approach builds on the Acid Rain Program whichprovides a wonderful model for future programs It has not only metexpectations but exceeded them Administering the Acid RainProgram has been a costeffective experience The program willachieve about  of the total emission reductions required underthe  Clean Air Act Amendments at a low cost to industry and tothe government The program is administered with a relatively smallstaff relying on strong and stateoftheart data tracking andreporting capabilitiesWhen President George HW Bush signed the Clean Air ActAmendments of  it revolutionized clean air policy regardingregional and national air pollution issues and drove environmentalprotection in new directions First the President and Congressdesigned the Acid Rain Program to focus on reducing the SOemissions that cause acid deposition and translated the emissionreduction goal into a nationwide cap on emissions from electricgenerating sources Second Congress provided EPA with a tool toachieve this reduction   an innovative marketbased allowancetrading program This cap and trade approach provided greatercertainty that the emissions reductions would be achieved andsustained while at the same time allowing industry unprecedentedflexibility in how to achieve the needed emission reductions Inreturn for this flexibility sources were to provide a fullaccounting of their emissions through continuous monitoring andreporting and there would be consequences for failing to complyThe objective was for sources to find the most costeffective meansfor limiting SO emissions and to be responsible for achievingthose emission reductions There would be no government secondguessing and lengthy permit reviewsCompliance with the Acid Rain Program began in  and is nowin its seventh year It has been a resounding success with SOemissions from power generation dropping  million tons from levels and NOx emissions down  million tons from  levelsabout  million tons lower than projected growth In additionduring the first Phase of the program  SO emissionswere between  to  percent below their allowable levelsFurthermore environmental monitoring networks tracked importantenvironmental improvements   acid deposition was reduced by up to percent in certain areas of the countryAnd these environmental improvements cost less than predictedbecause of the builtin market based incentives In  EPAprojected the cost of full implementation of the SO emissionsreduction with trading at  billion per year  dollars In GAO projected the cost at  billion per year dollars Recent estimates of annualized cost of compliance are inthe range of  to  billion per year at fullimplementationPresident Bush has not only promised to take the SO tradingprogram to the next level but he has experience to lend to thematter In  thenGovernor Bush signed legislation thatpermanently caps NOx and SO emissions from older power plants inTexas starting in  and requires utilities to install a certainquantity of renewable and clean energy capacity by Environmental Defense hailed this legislation as a model for thecountry The Emission Banking and Trading of Allowances Program isexpected to achieve substantial reductions when it is fully phasedin by  It is estimated that this program will reduce NOx by tons per year and SO by  tons per year It isdesigned to give the utilities flexibility in determining how andwhere to achieve the reductions Allowances are allocated to eachpower plant based on  emissions using a formula that does notpenalize the clean plants that already have a low NOx or SOemission rate Permitted power generating plants may opt into thetrading programII Regulating Emissions from Power GenerationThe Presidents legislative approach stands in sharp contrast tothe complex web of existing regulations which currently confrontthe industry Over the years Congress EPA and the States haveresponded to specific environmental and public health problems bydeveloping separate regulatory programs for utilities to addressthe specific problems Each individual program uses its ownapproach to serve its own purpose As I describe the differentregulatory programs I think you will understand why we believe itis time to simplify If we have a new legislation thatsignificantly reduces emissions of SO NOx and mercury we caneliminate many of the individual programs that apply to the powergeneration sector and replace them with a system that will reducethe administrative burden on industry and governments usemarketbased incentives to keep compliance costs low and providethe industry with more certainty about its future regulatoryobligationsThere are many regulatory initiatives in place that will lead toreductions in air emissions from electric power generation Theseregulations include both federal and State requirements thataddress a variety of emissions including SO NOx CO PM and anumber of hazardous air pollutants The requirements also varydepending on the characteristics of the generating facilityincluding its boiler type size age and location These programsinclude the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulatematter and ozone the section  and the NOx SIP Call rules newsource review and new source performance standards the regionalhaze rule and mercury regulation as a hazardous air pollutantamong othersEPA has set national ambient air quality standards NAAQS forsix pollutants ozone carbon monoxide CO particulate matterPM SO NO and lead Pb The Clean Air Act calls upon Statesto adopt emissions control requirements in the form of StateImplementation Plans SIPs to bring nonattainment areas intocompliance with the NAAQS Historically most States strategies toattain the SO and PM NAAQS included power plant controlsEPA has taken two actions to address the contribution ofinterstate transport of NOx emissions to downwind ozonenonattainment problems and both of these actions affect the powersector In  EPA finalized the NOx SIP call which now requires states and the District of Columbia whose emissionssignificantly contribute to downwind ozone nonattainment problemsto revise their SIPs to control summertime NOx emissions Inresponse all of these States are choosing control strategies thatfocus on reducing power plant emissions In a separate action aimedat the same interstate NOx transport problem in January  EPAfinalized a rule which was issued in response to petitions fromseveral northeastern states under section  of the CAA In thisrule EPA found that emissions from large electric generating unitsand large industrial boilers and turbines in  States and theDistrict of Columbia are significantly contributing to downwindstates ozone nonattainment problems The rule requires thesesources to control their summertime NOx emissions under the FederalNOx Budget Trading Program beginning May  The electric power generation sector is also regulated through avariety of traditional and innovative programs Consistent with theClean Air Act many States have adopted NOx reasonably availablecontrol technology requirements for combustion facilities Inaddition several States have adopted marketbased approaches TheSouth Coast Air Quality Management District in Southern Californiafor example adopted a NOx and SO emissions trading programcalled RECLAIM The Northeast and midAtlantic States thatcomprise the Ozone Transport Region have developed a regionwideNOx emissions trading program the Ozone Transport Commission NOxBudget Program The revised ozone NAAQS and new PM NAAQS couldlead to further regulation of power plant SO emissions aprecursor to ambient PM and NOx emissions both for PM andozone attainment strategiesThe Act also requires State Implementation Plans to include apreconstruction permit program for new or modified major stationarysources referred to as new source review NSR This programensures that when large new facilities are built  or majormodifications to existing facilities are made that result in a netemissions increase  they include stateoftheart air pollutioncontrol equipment It also assures citizens who live near new majorsources of air pollution that the facilities will be as clean aspossible The requirements are different for  the part of theprogram called the Prevention of Significant Deterioration programthat applies to construction projects in areas where the air isalready clean and  the part of the program called thenonattainment NSR program that applies to construction projects inareas where the air is unhealthy to breathe For attainment areasto prevent significant deterioration of our nations air qualitynew major sources and major modifications to existing sources mustapply the best available control technology and ensure that the newpollution introduced into the environment does not adversely impactthe air quality such as in pristine areas like national parks Fornonattainment areas in addition to applying control technologythat represents the lowest achievable emission rates new majorsources and major modifications must offset their emissionsincreases This can be done by getting reductions from othersources in the general area to compensate for the increasesresulting from the new air pollution sourcesThe Act also requires EPA to establish new source performancestandards NSPS that all new or modified sources must meetregardless of their location The NSPS are technologybasednumerical performance standards that apply to all sources in aparticular source category such as electric utility steamgenerating units or stationary gas turbines These standards areintended to level the playing field so that all new facilitiesinstall a minimum amount of air pollution control equipmentThe recently finalized regional haze rule will also requirepower generators to reduce SO and NOx emissions either through theimplementation of best available retrofit technology BART or atrading program yet to be developed States must show reasonableprogress in their state implementation plans toward thecongressionally mandated goal of returning to natural conditions innational parks and wilderness areasEPA is developing a rule to limit mercury emissions fromutilities The  CAA Amendments required EPA to study andprepare a report to Congress on the hazards to human health thatcan reasonably be expected to occur as a result of emissions ofhazardous air pollutants air toxics or HAPs from fossilfuelfired electric power plants Based on the Report to Congressand on other available information EPA found in December  thatair toxics control is appropriate for coalfired and oilfiredutility boilers As a result of that regulatory determination EPAis scheduled to propose Maximum Achievable Control TechnologyMACT standards for these source categories by  Given theconclusions of the Report the regulation is likely to focus onmercury emissionsThe utility industry is also required to reduce SO emissionsthrough the Acid Rain Trading Program described above In additionto address acid rain the Clean Air Act requires utilities toreduce their emissions through emissions limits which EPAestablished based on unit typeIII Health and Environmental Benefits of the PresidentsEnergy PlanThe Presidents Energy Plan recognizes that by conserving energyand limiting NOx SO and mercury emissions we can provide thecountry with significant public health and environmental benefitsThe problems we would address include fine particle pollutionvisibility degradation ozone pollution mercury deposition acidrain nitrate deposition and climate change In turn this willavoid incidences of premature mortality aggravation of respiratoryand cardiopulmonary illnesses and diminished lung function whichresults in lost work days school absences and increasedhospitalizations and emergency room visits and will also avoiddamage to ecosystems fish and other wildlife To understand thetremendous benefits of the Presidents plan we need to understandthe public health and environmental issuesEmissions from Power GenerationPower generators are a significant source of three keyemissions sulfur dioxide SO nitrogen oxide NOx and mercuryHg The Clean Air Act has been and will continue to be asuccessful tool in reducing these emissions However while we areobserving significant environmental improvement power generationstill contributes  of SO  of NOx and  of manmademercury Power generation has other emissions such as carbonmonoxide and coarse particles but the level of these emissionsposes smaller risks for public health and the environmentOne of the reasons power generation accounts for such a largeshare of these key emissions is that significant emissionsreductions have already been required from other sources Forexample a new car today is more than  cleaner than it wasbefore federal laws limiting emissions of CO NOx and volatileorganic compounds  and they are subject to further reductionsstarting in  as are heavy duty trucks in  In contrastsome older power plants built before certain Federal performancestandards were put into place are still operating without modernpollution control equipment for some emissionsAir Quality EffectsFINE PARTICLE POLLUTIONThe Presidents Energy Plan will reduce fine particle pollutionSO and NOx emissions from power generation react in the atmosphereto form nitrates and sulfates which are a substantial fraction offine particle PM pollution Some PM comes from directemissions from a variety of sources A source emitting NOx and SOcan cause PM many miles away A substantial body of publishedscientific literature recognizes a correlation between elevatedfine particulate matter and increased incidence of illness andpremature mortality The health impacts include aggravation ofchronic bronchitis hospitalizations due to cardiorespiratorysymptoms emergency room visits due to aggravated asthma symptomsand acute respiratory symptoms Based on these findings EPA andothers estimate that attaining the fine particle standards wouldavoid thousands and up to tens of thousands of premature deathsannuallyThe significant expansion in scientific research in recent yearshas enhanced our understanding of the effects of particles onhealth EPA is summarizing all new information in the ongoingreview of the particulate matter standard in a criteria documentthat will undergo extensive peer and public review VISIBILITY AND REGIONAL HAZE IMPACTSThe Presidents Energy Plan will improve visibility by reducingSO and NOx emissions Sulfates and nitrates that form in theatmosphere from SO and NOx emissions are significant contributorsto visibility impairment in many national parks and wildernessareas as well as urban areas across the country Sulfates are akey factor in all areas of the United States particularly in theEast where high humidity increases the light extinction efficiencyof sulfates Sulfates are responsible for  of total lightextinction in the East based on data collected during the sin eastern national parks such as Acadia Everglades Great SmokyMountains Shenandoah and in Washington DCIn the West sulfates account for approximately  ofvisibility impairment Nitrates can play a larger role invisibility problems in some portions of the West than in the EastFor example nitrates account for  of visibility impairmentin national parks and wilderness areas in Southern California Inmany urban areas NOx emissions from cars trucks and power plantscontribute to winter time brown cloud situationsC OZONEThe Presidents Energy Plan will reduce ozone by reducing NOx akey contributor to the formation of groundlevel ozone In thepresence of sunlight NOx and volatile organic compounds reactphotochemically to produce ozone NOx can be transported longdistances and contribute to ozone many hundreds of miles from itssource More than  million people live in areas that do not yetmeet the healthbased hour ozone standard based on data The number would be even higher for the new hour ozonestandard Reducing ozone levels will result in fewerhospitalizations emergency room and doctors visits for asthmaticssignificantly fewer incidents of lung inflamation for atriskpopulations and significantly fewer incidents of moderate tosevere respiratory symptoms in childrenNot only will reducing ozone provide public health benefits butit will avoid damage to ecosystems and vegetation Ozone causesdecreased agricultural and commercial forest yields increasedmortality and reduced growth of tree seedlings and increased plantsusceptibility to disease pests and environmental stresses egharsh weather Since NOx emissions result in formation ofgroundlevel ozone reducing NOx emissions will reduce ozone levelsand thus reduce the deleterious effects of ozone on human healthand ecosystemsDeposition EffectsC MERCURYThe Presidents Energy Plan will benefit public health byreducing mercury air emissions Mercury is highly toxic in smallquantities and Americans with diets with high levels of mercury areat risk for adverse health effects Mercury is a naturallyoccurring element but human activity mobilizes mercury in theenvironment making it more bioavailable After mercury is emittedto the air it can be transported through the atmosphere for daysto years before being deposited into water bodiesOnce mercury is deposited in lakes rivers and oceans itbioaccumulates in the food chain resulting in high concentrationsin predatory fish In the US most human exposure to mercury isthe result of consumption of fish contaminated with methylmercuryA recent report of the National Academy of Sciences NAS concludedthat while most Americans face a very low risk from methylmercurychildren of women who consume large amounts of fish duringpregnancy face a much higher risk Fetuses are particularlyvulnerable to methylmercury because of their rapidly developingnervous systems These effects include cognitive sensory andmotor deficits The NAS study estimates as many as  childrenannually may develop neurological problems because of lowlevelmethylmercury exposure through their mother prior to birthFortyone states have advisories warning the public to restricteating fish from local waters due to methylmercury EPA estimatesthat  million acres of lakes estuaries and wetlands and miles of streams rivers and coasts are impaired by mercuryemissionsACID RAINThe Presidents Energy Plan will reduce acid rain by reducingSO and NOx Acidic deposition or acid rain occurs when SO andNOx in the atmosphere react with water oxygen and oxidants toform acidic compounds These compounds fall to the Earth in eitherdry form gas and particles or wet form rain snow and fogSome are carried by the wind sometimes hundreds of miles acrossstate and national borders In the United States about  percentof annual SO emissions and  percent of NOx emissions areproduced by electric utility plants that burn fossil fuelsAlthough we have made progress as a result of the  Acid RainProgram we have not fully addressed the problem Indicators ofrecovery of lakes and streams do not show consistent change inresponse to reduced SO emissions In sensitive areas such as theAdirondacks for example the majority of lakes have remainedfairly constant in terms of acidification levels while the mostsensitive lakes continue to acidify Overall acid depositioncontinues to impair the water quality of lakes and streams in theNortheast  percent of lakes in the Adirondack region of New Yorkand  percent of lakes in New England exhibit signs of chronicandor episodic acidification Although sulfur deposition hasdeclined nitrogen emissions have not changed substantiallyregionwide Moreover recent findings also suggest that nitrogenis quantitatively as important or in some areas possibly moreimportant than sulfur as a cause of episodic acidification becauseof shortterm acidic pulses occurring during the most biologicallysensitive time of the year when fish reproduce Reductions of NOxparticularly during winter and spring are critical for addressingthese concerns NITROGEN DEPOSITIONThe Presidents Energy Plan will improve ecosystems and waterbodies by reducing NOx emissions Some air emissions of NOx frompower generation result in deposition of nitrogen in soils andwater While nitrogen is an essential nutrient its availability isnaturally limited making it an important factor in regulating thestructure and functioning of both terrestrial and aquaticecological systems Human activity has greatly altered theterrestrial and atmospheric nitrogen cycle doubling the annualamount of nitrogen available in forms that are useful to livingorganisms Nitrogen saturation of watersheds contributes toenvironmental problems such as reduced drinking water qualitynitrateinduced toxic effects on freshwater organisms increasedsoil acidification and aluminum mobility increased emissions fromsoil of nitrogenous greenhouse trace gases reduction of methaneconsumption in soil and forest decline and reducedproductivityCoastal water and marine environment are also impacted byatmospheric deposition of nitrogen Depending upon the locationfrom  to more than  percent of new nitrogen inputs to coastalwaters along the East Coast and Gulf Coast of the United Statescome from air pollution One of the best documented and understoodimpacts of increased nitrogen is the eutrophication of estuariesand coastal waters Eutrophication refers to the increase in therate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem and its manyundesirable consequences Symptoms of eutrophication are found inmany of our nations coastal ecosystems They include algal bloomsthat are potentially hazardous to human health low dissolvedoxygen concentrations declines in the health of fish and shellfishpopulations loss of seagrass beds and coral reefs and ecologicalchanges in food websSummary of Health and Environmental EffectsAdopting a unified approach to reduce SO NOx and mercury isbetter than looking at each pollutant separately because ofsynergistic effects Beyond their impacts as separate emissionsSO NOx and mercury together contribute to many airpollutionrelated problems affecting human health and theenvironment In certain cases synergies exist between emissionsand among the various reduction approaches available making itimperative that efforts to reduce risk address all three emissionsaccommodate these synergies In the case of fine particlesatmospheric chemical relationships suggest that when only reducingsulfate for example it is replaced in the atmosphere by nitrateThus simultaneous NOx and SO emission reductions are critical Inthe case of acid rain significant reductions in sulfur dioxidehave not corresponded to ecological changes due to continuing highlevels of nitrogen Continuing levels of sulfur deposition albeitsmaller than before also work to prevent recovery due to extremelylarge sulfur loadings over the years Both emissions count inachieving the goal of recovery Additionally some synergies havebeen observed between methylmercury and lake acidity  the moreacidic the greater the mercury concentrationAs more environmental data become available and scienceimproves we are observing some environmental improvementaccompanying the downward trend in emissions However there arepersistent and growing concerns regarding recovery of ecosystemsand the risks that air pollution pose to human health Forinstance nitrate levels in surface waters are not significantlyimproving and at best are constant Logically if emissionscontinue at the same level or increase pollution problems willmirror that trend Visibility impairment in national parkswilderness areas and urban areas also continues to be a problemMany people continue to be exposed to unacceptable levels of smogOf particular significance the American public has become acutelyaware of the hazards to their health including the risk ofmortality posed by inhalation of fine particles and exposure tomercury through fish consumptionIV Climate ChangeThe Presidents Energy Plan and the climate change strategythat is under development will provide benefits by addressingclimate change Energyrelated activities are the primary source ofUS manmade greenhouse gas emissions Power generators whichemit CO contribute abut  of the total emissions of all USmanmade greenhouse gases Scientists continue to learn more aboutglobal climate change its causes potential impacts and possiblesolution We recently held Cabinetlevel working group meetings toreview the most recent most accurate and most comprehensivescience During those meetings we heard from scientists offering awide spectrum of views We have reviewed the facts and listened tomany theories and suppositions The working group asked the highlyrespected National Academy of Sciences to provide us the mostuptodate information about what is known and about what is notknown on the science of climate changeWe know the surface temperature of the Earth is warming It hasrisen by  degrees Celsius over the past  years There was awarming trend from the s to the s cooling from the sto the s and then sharply rising temperatures from the sto today There is a natural greenhouse effect that contributes towarming Greenhouse gases trap heat and thus warm the Earth becausethey prevent a significant portion of infrared radiation fromescaping into space Concentration of greenhouse gases especiallyCO have increased substantially since the beginning of theindustrial revolution And the National Academy of Sciencesindicates that the increase is due in large part to human activityThe Academys report also tells us that there are many unansweredquestions about climate change which makes it difficult todetermine what levels of greenhouse gas emissions need to beavoidedTo address global climate change and greenhouse gas emissionswe are pursuing a broad array of conservation and energy efficiencygoals under the Administrations National Energy Policy as well asthe development of a comprehensive policy under the ongoingcabinetlevel review for this issue On June  President Bushannounced the establishment of two major initiatives to address themajor scientific and technological challenges presented by thisserious longterm issue the US Climate Research Initiative andthe National Climate Change Technology Initiative In addition hecommitted the United States to increasing cooperative efforts inthe Western Hemisphere and with our allies globally toaggressively pursue joint research and actions These efforts haverecently borne fruit particularly recent agreements with Japan andItaly to collaborate on climate modeling efforts and with ElSalvador in a forest for debt swap that will preserve tropicalforests there that sequester carbon The complex challenge ofglobal climate change requires a global response that will draw onthe power of global markets and the promise of technology toachieve emissions reductions most flexibly and costeffectively inthe coming century The Administration intends to address thischallenge in that context and will leverage our national resourcesto enhance our scientific understanding of global climate changeand develop the advanced energy technologies that the world willneed in coming decades to meet its energy and environmentalneedsV ConclusionOur country has made great progress in reducing air pollutionover the last several decades but pollution from power generationneeds to be further controlled We can draw no other conclusiongiven the significant contribution that power generation makes tothe emissions that cause such serious public health andenvironmental problemsBut our current regulatory programs are not the most efficientway to achieve the goal of ensuring a reliable energy supply in anenvironmentally responsible manner Rather than take apollutantbypollutant problembyproblem approach we have theopportunity to examine the sector as a whole Doing so provides uswith the opportunity for costeffective reductions and significantpublic health and environmental gains That is why thisAdministration supports the development of new legislation thatbuilds on the success of the marketbased Acid Rain Program toreduce significantly the SO NOx and mercury emissions from powergeneration Mandatory controls are not the only way to solve publichealth and environmental problems President Bushs National EnergyPlan also includes measures to increase conservation of energyincrease energy efficiency and encourage technological advancessuch as clean coal technology fuel cells and combined heat andpower facilities  all of which will contribute to addressing theenergy and environmental challenges ofthis industryI have already spent time with representatives of the powergeneration sector and have heard from a number of them who areinterested in legislation that will provide the public health andenvironmental benefits we discussed today I applaud their concernand their willingness to help craft a workable solution I havealso heard from environmentalists who are interested in these sameissues I know that many of you are interested in addressing theseissues through legislation I hope that our common interests willlead us to a consensus  one that will provide the country withsignificant benefits I look forward to working with you on theseissues
