                    Background        The enzyme chorismate mutase performs the initial        catalytic step of divergence to Lphenylalanine and        Ltyrosine in aromatic biosynthesis This reaction has long        intrigued biochemists as the sole example of an        enzymecatalyzed pericyclic Claisen rearrangement          The existence of two or maybe three different homology        groups of chorismate mutases Table  points to separate        evolutionary origins Such independent evolutionary origins        of analogous enzymes that mediate the same function are        becoming increasingly apparent          Assigning a name to an enzyme would be vastly more        simple if all homologs belonging to a given protein family        possessed identical substrate specificities At one        extreme however completely independent homology groups        can possess the same substrate specificity that is a        given function may have evolved more than once At the        other extreme a single protein family may possess member        enzymes that have different substrate specificities In        fact distinct and dispersed subsets of proteins having the        same substrate specificity may exist within a single        protein family whose members possess an admixture of        different substrate specificities The latter case is        exemplified by the   and  subfamilies of aromatic        aminotransferases within the aminotransferases of family I          Nevertheless the differing substrate specificities        within the catalytic repertoire of a particular protein        family are generally a reflection of similar reaction        mechanisms Therefore it should usually be feasible to        name a protein family or superfamily at a hierarchical        level that encompasses all substrate specificities of its        member proteins Chorismate mutase isochorismate mutase          and amino deoxychorismate mutase   which all        catalyze similar reactions are common members of a group        that we have called cyclohexadienyl mutase Table  In        this vein class I cyclohexadienyl mutases possess        chorismate mutase members that belong to either family I        AroQ or family I AroR A third group of chorismate        mutases AroH so far constitute the sole members of a        separate homology group the class II cyclohexadienyl        mutases        Chorismate mutases encoded by both         aroQ and         aroH are represented among        prokaryotes The distribution of AroH is quite limited        known at this time to be present only in some         Bacillus species          B subtilis B halodurans and         B stearothermophilus         cyanobacteria          Synechocystis sp         Synechococcus sp         Nostoc punctiforme Anabaena sp and                Prochlorococcus marinus          Streptomyces coelicolor and         Thermomonospora fusca On the other        hand AroQ is widely distributed Multiple paralogs of         aroQ are commonly present in a single        organism Genes encoding AroQ and AroH coexist in some        representatives of         Bacillus The AroQ proteins are        allhelixbundle domains   whereas the AroH proteins        possess a trimeric pseudo barrel structure   The        AroR proteins known only in eukaryotes are structurally        similar to AroQ deploying a fourhelixbundle structure        around the active site The AroR and AroQ proteins also        share a colinear arrangement of amphiphilic patterns as        well as conserved spacing between patches of closely        neighboring patterns in the primary sequence Thus AroR        can be viewed as a version of AroQ that has inserted loops        related to allosteric regulation The latter rationale is        the basis for classification of AroQ and AroR into the same        homology group   and references therein even though        homology is barely detectable at the sequence level Both        AroQ and AroH are small  kDa proteins AroR is much        larger and exhibits complex allostery being activated by        Ltryptophan and inhibited by Ltyrosine in the case of        yeast   or being activated by Ltryptophan and inhibited        by both Ltyrosine and Lphenylalanine in the case of        higher plants          The         aroQ gene has been an extremely        popular partner for fusion with other aromaticpathway        genes as illustrated in Table  In         Archaeoglobus aroQ encodes the        central domain of a tripartite fusion protein which is        flanked at the amino end by TyrA and at the carboxyl end by        PheA The most widely distributed         aroQ fusion is with         pheA being present in most of the        gamma and beta proteobacteria The         aroQpheA fusion also exists in         Thermotoga maritima and         Clostridium difficile apparently        having arisen as independent fusion events GX and        RAJ unpublished data All enteric bacteria and their        nearest phylogenetic neighbors possess an         aroQtyrA fusion         Clostridium acetobutylicum possesses        a sofar unique fusion of         aroQ with         aroD the gene encoding shikimate        dehydrogenase Many years ago         B subtilis was shown to have fused        domains specifying chorismate mutase          aroQ  and        deoxyDarabinoheptulosonate P DAHP synthase          aroA  The AroQ domain was shown to        function not only as a catalytic domain for chorismate        mutase but also as the allosteric domain for the fused        AroA domain This fusion thus provided a physical basis for        the allosteric pattern of control called sequential        feedback inhibition   This         aroQaroA fusion also occurs in         Staphylococcus and in         Deinococcus Although         Porphyromonas gingivalis also        possesses fused domains of         aroQ and         aroA the fusion joint is at the         end of         aroQ instead of at the  end        Among the monofunctional chorismate mutases that        present in         Erwinia herbicola possesses a        cleavable signal peptide and accordingly is translocated        into the periplasm         E herbicola chorismate mutase was        shown   to be not only periplasmic but also located at        the poles of the cells similar to cyclohexadienyl        dehydratase of         Pseudomonas aeruginosa   In this        study we have examined the extent to which monofunctional        chorismate mutases are periplasmic or cytoplasmic A        chorismate mutase of         Salmonella typhimurium is shown to be        periplasmic A periplasmic chorismate mutase in         P aeruginosa is shown to be part of        an complete threestep pathway for periplasmic conversion        of chorismate to phenylalanine        Figure shows the biochemical pathway context of        chorismate mutase with respect to phenylalanine and        tyrosine biosynthesis and provides an overview of        differences between         S typhimurium and         P aeruginosa It also shows the        nomenclature used In this era of comparative genomics it        is no longer tenable to use acronyms for genes and their        gene products that differ from organism to organism The        commonpathway enzymes through chorismate synthase are        named in order that is AroA catalyzes the first pathway        reaction AroB the second and so on In cases where        different homolog classes are known to exist these analog        groups are designated with Roman numerals for example        AroA         I or AroA         II  Different subgroups within a        homology class are usually distinguished with   and         designations Three of the commonpathway steps are        represented by independently evolved analog classes of        enzyme         S typhimurium has three paralogs of        DAHP synthase belonging to the AroA         I family whereas         P aeruginosa possesses two paralogs        of AroA         I enzyme and two paralogs of class II        DAHP synthase AroA         II            S typhimurium utilizes a single        dehydroquinase that belongs to class I AroC         I  whereas         P aeruginosa deploys two paralogs of        class II AroC         II  Both         S typhimurium and         P aeruginosa utilize class I        shikimate kinase AroE         I  as do all bacteria   However         S typhimurium possesses two paralogs        that are characteristic of         E coli and its closest relatives and        encoded by genes labeled as         aroK and         aroL in the literature        Chorismate mutase is the focal point of this paper and        Figure illustrates that the cytoplasm of         S typhimurium has two paralogs of        the I family of chorismate mutases denoted AroQ One is        fused to TyrA and the other to PheA as indicated by the        pegandhole depiction in the figure A third AroQ paralog        of the I group is present in the periplasm AroQ         P aeruginosa is similar to         S typhimurium in having an AroQPheA        fusion in the cytoplasm as well as the periplasmic AroQ        species AroQ but differs in lacking the AroQTyrA        fusion Multidomain proteins whose domains have separable        counterparts elsewhere must be appropriately named to        facilitate comparisons see Table                     Results                  Chorismatetophenylalanine pathway in the P          aeruginosaperiplasm          A modified magnesium shock procedure was used to          separate periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions of           P aeruginosa cultures grown in          minimal medium The established periplasmic enzyme PheC             was used as a periplasmic protein marker and          shikimate dehydrogenase was used as a cytoplasmic protein          marker It was preferable to use prephenate rather than          Larogenate as a substrate in the assay of PheC          activity not only because the assay for Larogenate          dehydratase is tedious   but also because prephenate          is much less expensive However PheC cannot be          monitored as prephenate dehydratase in the presence of          cytoplasmic Pprotein because the PheA domain of that          protein is prephenate dehydratase To avoid this problem          the           aroQ            pheA deficient mutant PAT was          used All the prephenate dehydratase activity in PAT          is derived from PheC which thus can be used as a          convenient marker for the quality of the separation of          the cellular compartments          PheC can also be selectively assayed without          interference from PheA in wildtype PAO In the          wildtype the prephenate dehydratase activity of the          Pprotein is completely inhibited by phenylalanine          whereas PheC is completely insensitive Thus one can          calculate the fraction of total activity contributed by          each of the two enzymes by comparing activities measured          in the presence and absence of Lphenylalanine From          Table  a calculated  of PheC was found in the          periplasmic fraction of PAT compared to  of PheC          from PAO          AroQ was found in the periplasm in           P aeruginosa PAO None of the          periplasmic chorismate mutase activity was attributed to          AroQPheA because no PheAdomain activity was detected          Table  Hence the chorismate mutase activity in the          periplasm must be exclusively AroQ Identification of          this activity as AroQ and not AroQPheA was verified          by elution of a single peak of chorismate mutase in the          wash fraction recovered after Mono Q chromatography of          the periplasmic fraction This is the established elution          behavior of AroQ   Of the total aromatic          aminotransferase activity  was found in the          periplasm                          Purification of AroQ and Aat Ifrom P          aeruginosaperiplasm          AroQ was purified from the periplasmic fraction of          PAO Ninetyseven percent of shikimate dehydrogenase was          in the cytoplasm of PAO compared to  from PAT          These data affirm a technically good separation of the          periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions The purification          steps are summarized in Table  After the last          purification step one distinctive band with a relative          molecular mass            M           r  of around  was revealed by          SDSPAGE after staining with Coomassie blue The           M           r estimated by gel filtration was          around  suggesting a native homodimer structure          Aminoterminal aminoacid sequencing gave a sequence          QPLSPALQQL in the singleletter aminoacid notation          which corresponds to a sequence beginning at residue           of gene PA of the completed           P aeruginosa genome            Aromatic aminotransferase Aat           I  was purified from the periplasmic          fraction of PAO The protein fractions with enzymatic          activity that eluted from the gradient of a          hydroxylapatite column were chromatographed on a mono Q          column and recovered as single peaks The leading peak          fractions yielded one major band and several minor bands          after SDSPAGE Aminoterminal aminoacid sequencing of          the major band gave GSGATSAAGK which corresponds to the          sequence beginning with residue  of the deduced protein          encoded by PA in the completed           P aeruginosa genome   In          addition one of the minor bands exhibited the sequence          AGKPQETFLD which corresponds to the sequence of the          protein encoded by gene PA beginning at residue           Thus a favored and a minor cleavage site seem to exist          for the signal peptide The           M           r estimated by SDSPAGE staining with          Coomassie blue was about  The           M           r estimated by gel filtration was           indicating the presence of a homodimer                          Isolation of S typhimuriumAroQ                    E coli BLpJB containing            aroQ from           S typhimurium was grown to          lateexponential growth in  liter of LB medium          containing kanamycin After cell harvest by          centrifugation  g of wet cells were subjected to          osmotic shock   After centrifugation the          supernatant was collected and designated as the shocked          periplasmic fraction An equal portion of wet cells          treated identically but not subjected to osmotic shock          was designated as the nonshock periplasmic fraction          Crude extracts were also prepared from each cellpellet          fraction          The shocked periplasmic fraction contained           units  unit   nmol of prephenate produced per minute          of chorismate mutase activity As the prephenate          dehydratase and prephenate dehydrogenase activities          associated with the cytoplasmic AroQPheA and AroQTyrA          proteins were not detected in this fraction          contamination with cytoplasmic species of AroQ was less          than  The additional assay for shikimate dehydrogenase          as a marker for cytoplasmic contamination also showed          less than  of total activity to be in the shocked          periplasmic fraction On the other hand  of the total          alkaline phosphatase periplasmic marker was recovered          in the shocked periplasmic fraction Although          crossreactivity was relatively poor the presence of           S typhimurium AroQ in periplasmic          fractions and its absence in cytoplasmic fractions was          demonstrated by western blotting using antibody obtained          against           E herbicola AroQ            The           S typhimurium AroQ was purified          using the protocol of Xia           et al   to give a final          preparation

         m and k           cat were similar to one another as          well as to other chorismate mutases characterized in the          literature Table also shows a comparison of isoelectric          points and molecular masses for all of the periplasmic          chorismate mutases                            Discussion                  New periplasmic subgroup of AroQ          When the periplasmic chorismate mutase from           E herbicola was initially cloned          and sequenced it was a unique case of an AroQ protein          having a cleavable signal peptide and a carboxyterminal          extension The current repertoire of additional AroQ          proteins that can be gleaned from the contemporary          databases on the criterion of these two features numbers          eight One of them has been located in the esophageal          glands of the phytoparasitic nematode           Meloidogyne javanica Presumably          this AroQ protein is secreted into plant cells as part of          the parasitic process   The erratic phylogenetic          distribution of AroQ may have a variety of explanations          that include massive gene loss horizontal transfer or          independent evolution of a signal peptide and          carboxyterminal extension          Figure shows a multiple sequence alignment which          highlights conserved aminoacid residues in the AroQ          subfamily in relationship to the homologous residues that          have been shown by Xray crystallography   to be          located in the active site of the AroQ domain of           E coli AroQPheA AroQ proteins          are twice the size of the basic AroQ catalytic domain          The carboxyterminal half of each AroQ protein is of          similar length but not highly conserved and it has no          known catalytic or regulatory function When used as a          query sequence it returns no significant hits One          reasonable speculation is that as AroQ maybe localized          at the polar caps of the cell this region might          accomplish some sort of proteinprotein or          proteinmembrane interaction that might facilitate its          spatial location at the polar regions of the periplasmic          milieu                          Substrate specificities of AroQ proteins          Chorismate mutase catalyzes a facile rearrangement          reaction that can progress to a significant extent under          nonenzymatic conditions The           aroQ genes are easily missed during          genome annotation because they are small and do not show          strong sequence conservation We have identified many          initially dubious AroQ hits to BLAST queries by alignment          of aminoacid residues known to be critical for          catalysis          Figure illustrates several chemical rearrangements          that closely parallel the chorismate mutase reaction          Zamir           et al   have demonstrated the          isochorismate mutase reaction in higher plants and Xie           et al   presented a rationale          in support of the possibility that PchB from           P aeruginosa catalyzes the          isochorismate mutase reaction as a step in salicylate          biosynthesis   Amino deoxychorismate mutase          catalyzes a step in antibiotic pristinamycin          biosynthesis            There is precedent for the finding that within a          homolog grouping whose members have differing substrate          specificities proteins sharing a substrate specificity          do not necessarily cluster together for example           B subtilis AroA and close          relatives are clustered more specifically with KdsA          sequences than with           E coli AroA and its close          relatives   The phylogram tree at the left in Figure          illustrates this for the AroQ protein family The          current limitations of homology detection are such that          the monofunctional AroQ proteins from           Aeropyrum pernix Enterococcus          faecalis Helicobacter pylori and           Methanococcus jannaschii cannot be          shown to be closer to one another or to any other AroQ          proteinsdomains than they are to PapB or PchB This is          because bootstrap values only support the branching nodes          to the level shown in bold Thus even though the          computational program used placed           A pernix AroQ with the valid          grouping of           Streptomyces coelicolor AroQ           C difficile AroQ and           Mycobacterium tuberculosis AroQ          the           A pernix AroQ sequence could in          fact be closer to any other group Thus one can          recognize distinct and valid groupings for example the          AroQ periplasmic chorismate mutases but not          necessarily the exact relationship of these groupings          with one another                          The AroQ family of chorismate mutases          Figure shows a phylogram tree of the entire set of          AroQ protein or AroQ domain sequences available from          Bacteria and Archaea A number of cohesive clusters are          evident One of these is the periplasmic group of          monofunctional AroQ proteins The cytoplasmic          monofunctional AroQ proteins include fivemember          threemember and twomember groups in addition to four          other sequences isolated so far AroQ domains that are          fused with TyrA form a cohesive homology grouping within          enteric bacteria and their closest relatives These same          organisms also possess AroQPheA bifunctional proteins          whose AroQ domains also form a cohesive homology          grouping Other AroQPheA fusions are widespread and the          sequences of their AroQ domains are highly divergent          Only the AroQPheA proteins from           P aeruginosa P stutzeri from           Neisseria gonorrhoeaeN          meningitidis and from           Archaeoglobus fulgidusThermotoga          maritima possess AroQ domains that cluster with          bootstrap values greater than  Analysis of          interdomain linker regions and codon usage suggests that          the           aroQ and           pheA genes have fused independently          on many occasions GX and RAJ manuscript in          preparation The three cases of AroQAroA fusions fall          into a single cluster supported by a bootstrap value of                    In the fivemember group labeled PchB in Figure  the                    P aeruginosa protein has been          shown to participate in salicylate synthesis and the          proposed reaction catalyzed by isochorismate mutase has          been discussed in the previous section The           P fluorescens protein undoubtedly          has the same role This substrate specificity does not          necessarily apply to the remaining members In           P aeruginosa pchA isochorismate          synthase and           pchB are translationally coupled          and           cis expression is obligatory for          activity   In           Vibrio vulnificus pchB is closely          linked to           venB isochorismatase             V cholerae does not exhibit a           pchB homolog upstream of the gene          encoding isochorismatase           vibF   Perhaps the          clustering of PchB proteins together reflects their          interaction with proteins able to bind isochorismate                          The periplasmic pathway of phenylalanine          biosynthesis          It has been known for some time that          phenylalaninepathway redundancy exists in           P aeruginosa The enzymological          basis for this became apparent with the recognition of          the presence of an extra species of chorismate mutase          CMF and cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in addition to the                    E coli like enzymes   This          redundancy explained the reluctant auxotrophy of           P aeruginosa   as well as the          hidden overflow pathway to phenylalanine   The          latter phenomenon is one whereby earlypathway regulatory          mutations that increase intracellular chorismate          concentrations result in exclusive metabolite flow toward          Lphenylalanine because cyclohexadienyl dehydratase is          insensitive to allosteric control In the periplasmic          system a mixture of flow routes chorismate  prephenate           phenylpyruvate  phenylalanine or chorismate           prephenate  arogenate  phenylalanine exist because of          the ability of cyclohexadienyl dehydratase to accept          either prephenate or arogenate and because of the ability          of periplasmic aminotransferase whose detailed          characterization is not within the scope of this paper          to transaminate either phenylpyruvate or prephenate          The spatial location of the overflow pathway in the          periplasmic compartment was first indicated by the          demonstration that cyclohexadienyl dehydratase had a          cleavable amino terminus and was translocated to the          periplasm Indirect evidence favoring a periplasmic          location for chorismate mutase as well in           P aeruginosa was the demonstration          of a periplasmic chorismate mutase in           E herbicola   The possible          periplasmic location of an aromatic aminotransferase has          been anticipated but not directly examined until now          This paper demonstrates the identity and presence of all          three enzymes constituting the overflow pathway in a          single organism          On the basis of broad comparative enzymological          surveys    a similar intact overflow pathway can          be anticipated to be present in           Serratia and           Erwinia The application of queries          to the finished and unfinished genomes at the National          Center for Biotechnological Information   returned          hits for periplasmic cyclohexadienyl dehydratase and          periplasmic chorismate mutase in           Yersinia pestis Although no          aminotransferase gene has yet been found in           Y pestis that has a predicted          signal peptide one is present that is predicted by          PSort to be an innermembrane protein                          Periplasmic pathway remnants          Before the recognition of their periplasmic location          it was known   that some organisms might have AroQ          but not PheC            Salmonella  or PheC but not AroQ                     Klebsiella  It was pointed out          that appropriate mutants are better producers of          prephenate in           Salmonella than in           Escherichia because of the presence          of AroQ in the former but not in the latter Detailed          comparative enzymological work in enteric bacteria              indicates that many additional            aroQ genes will be identified          Within Enterocluster           Enterobacter cloacae resembles           S typhimurium in lacking            pheC but having            aroQ whereas           Enterobacter aerogenes resembles           K pneumoniae in its possession of                     pheC but its absence of            aroQ Other Enterocluster members                     Escherichia Shigella Enterobacter          agglomerans ATCC  and           Citrobacter  lack both          periplasmic enzymes On the other hand all members of          Enterocluster possess both            aroQ and            pheC except for           Erwinia carotovora which lacks            pheC These include           Serratia marcescens Serratia rubidae          Enterobacter agglomerans ATCC            Erwinia herbicola E milletiae E          ananas E tracheiphila E chrysanthemi and           E amylovora Members of          Enterocluster species of           Cedecea Kluyvera Edwardsiella          Hafnia Yersinia Proteus Providencia and           Morganella  lack both            aroQ and            pheC           All four species of           Mycobacterium in the finished          genomes resemble           Salmonella in having            aroQ but lacking            pheC The physiological function of          a partial pathway is unknown perhaps AroQ interfaces          with a different pathway In fact it must be conceded          that even the function of the intact periplasmic pathway          to phenylalanine is unknown An important clue presumably          is the spatial location at the poles of the cell The          polar periplasmic location of a number of protein          systems is receiving increasing attention                            Aromatic aminotransferases          Most aminotransferases that are capable of functioning          as aromatic aminotransferases are members of family I          within the aminotransferase protein superfamily            These can usually be assigned to one of three          subfamilies Subfamily I partitions into          narrowspecificity aspartate aminotransferases and          broadspecificity aspartate aminotransferases that can          accommodate the aromatic ring Likewise subfamily I          partitions into narrowspecificity imidazole acetol          phosphate IAP aminotransferases and broadspecificity          IAP aminotransferases that utilize aromatic aminoketo          acids Subfamily I partitions into subgroups having a          variety of substrate specificities with aspartate          aminotransferases being the most prominent subcluster          Among these are broadspecificity aspartate          aminotransferases with ability to function with aromatic          amino acids          The periplasmic aminotransferase of           P aeruginosa belongs to the I          subfamily and exhibits catalytic activity as IAP          aminotransferase           in vitro assayed as described by Gu                    et al   It exhibits signature          motifs corresponding to the regions of the activesite          lysine and the interdomain interface   Like its close          relative HisH of           Bacillus subtilis it has the          potential to function in both histidine and aromatic          aminoacid biosynthesis Of course the spatial location          of Aat           I in the periplasm would seem to rule          out           in vivo function in histidine          biosynthesis This expectation is accommodated by the          observation that           P aeruginosa possesses a paralog          encoded by gene PA   that must function           in vivo as IAP aminotransferase as          it is closely linked with other genes of histidine          biosynthesis Yet another paralog is encoded by gene          PA and carries out aromatic aminoacid biosynthesis          in the cytoplasm Thus three subfamily I paralogs of          aminotransferase are expressed in           P aeruginosa  one for aromatic          biosynthesis in the cytoplasm one for histidine          biosynthesis in the cytoplasm and one for phenylalanine          synthesis in the periplasm Previous enzymological work          had demonstrated the existence of five aminotransferases          in           P aeruginosa that were capable of          functioning as aromatic aminotransferases           in vitro                              Materials and methods                  Bacterial strains plasmids and media          All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study          are listed in Table            S typhimurium tyrA was grown on

        P aeruginosa cells were grown at          C with vigorous shaking in LB or minimal medium          supplemented with appropriate antibiotics Cells were          harvested in the lateexponential phase of growth by          centrifugation and resuspended in  mM potassium          phosphate buffer pH  containing  mM dithiothreitol          DTT The cells were disrupted by sonication using an          Ultratip Labsonic System LabLine Instruments and then          centrifuged at             g for  min at C The          supernatant fraction was collected and passed

typhimurium were suspended into           mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH  containing           mM DTT Extracts were sonicated using three pulses to          maintain cooling The extract was ultracentrifuged          Beckman at             g and C Crude extracts to be          used for enzyme assays were desalted on DG columns          BioRad                          Enzyme assays          For routine assays with unpurified protein          preparations chorismate mutase and prephenate          dehydratase were assayed spectrophotometrically by the          method of Cotton and Gibson   as modified by Ahmad          and Jensen   using  mM chorismate and  mM          prephenate respectively Arogenate dehydratase was          assayed by measuring the formation of Lphenylalanine          using highperformance liquid chromatography HPLC            Aromatic aminotransferase was assayed as described          before   and phenylalanine and ketoglutarate were          used as the substrates unless indicated otherwise          Shikimate dehydrogenase was assayed by monitoring the          reduction of NADP at  nm   Alkaline phosphatase          was assayed as detailed by Brickman and Beckwith                     For kinetic determinations made with purified          preparations of chorismate mutase initial rates were          followed as disappearance of chorismate This was          monitored spectrophotometrically at  nm using an          extinction coefficient of  Mcm Steadystate          parameters of K           m and k           cat were calculated from initial rates          using a series of substrate concentrations over a fold          range below and above K           m  Protein concentrations were          estimated by the Bradford assay   with bovine serum          albumin as the protein standard                          Separation of periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions          of P aeruginosa          A modified magnesium shock procedure   was used to          fractionate cytoplasmic and periplasmic enzymes in           P aeruginosa Cultures were grown          to lateexponential phase in  ml of M saltsglucose          medium The culture was divided into two ml parts and          harvested by centrifugation at             g at C for  min One part was          resuspended in  ml of  mM potassium phosphate buffer          pH  and broken by sonication to make crude extract          The other part was resuspended in  ml of concentrated          magnesium solution  M MgCl              M TrisHCl pH  incubated          on ice for  min then centrifuged at   g at C          for  min The resulting supernatant was dialyzed          against  mM pH  potassium phosphate buffer          overnight using at least ten times

pellet          was resuspended in  ml of  mM phosphate buffer pH           and sonicated to yield the cytoplasmic fraction          PheC   activity assayed as prephenate          dehydratase was the marker protein for the periplasmic          fraction   and shikimate dehydrogenase activity was          the marker protein for the cytoplasmic fraction                          Purification of AroQ and a periplasmic aromatic          aminotransferase from P aeruginosa          Twentyliter cultures of           P aeruginosa strain PAO  l per           flask were grown to lateexponential phase in M          saltsglucose medium and the periplasmic fraction was          separated from the rest of the cells as described above          but with a scaledup protocol All the buffers contained           mM DTT          A    cm BioGel HTP column previously          equilibrated with  mM phosphate buffer pH           containing  mM DTT was loaded with a mg amount of          protein washed with  ml

mutase          and aromatic aminotransferase activities were          assayed          Fractions with high chorismate mutase activity were          pooled and concentrated by means of an Amicon YM          membrane The concentrated preparation was dialyzed          overnight against  mM phosphate buffer pH           containing  mM DTT An FPLCconnected Mono Q HR           anionexchange column Pharmacia Biotech equilibrated          with  mM phosphate buffer pH  containing  mM DTT          was loaded with the concentrated AroQ fraction The          column was washed with  ml of the starting buffer and          bound proteins were gradienteluted with  ml of          phosphate buffer KCl gradient between  to  M          Fractions of  ml were collected and those showing          high chorismate mutase activity were pooled and          concentrated by means of an Amicon YM membrane The          concentrated preparation was dialyzed against  mM          TrisHCl buffer pH  containing  mM DTT overnight          loaded onto the same Mono Q column that had been          equilibrated with the same TrisHCl buffer The same          elution regimen was used except that the KCl gradient          was from  to  mM Fractions showing high chorismate          mutase activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight          against the above phosphate buffer containing  mM DTT          and  mM NaCl The fractions were concentrated by an          Ultrafree centrifugal filter device Millipore          Corporation and loaded onto an FPLCconnected Superdex           HR  Pharmacia Biotech column which had been          equilibrated with  mM phosphate buffer pH           containing  mM DTT and  mM NaCl The same buffer was          used for protein elution and fractions of  ml were          collected The fractions showing high chorismate mutase          activity were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal          filtration          Two peaks with aromatic aminotransferase activity          eluted from the hydroxylapatite column mentioned above          When the major fractions with highest levels of activity          were pooled and subjected to Mono Q chromatography as          described above two peaks of activity were again          resolved one in the wash fraction minor and one in the          gradient fraction major This heterogeneity might be          explained by the apparent existence of a second minor          cleavage site for the signal peptide see Results The          major peak of aromatic aminotransferase was pooled and          subjected to Superdex gel filtration as described above          The fractions showing high aromatic aminotransferase          activity were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal          filtration

           The            aroQ gene was amplified by PCR          using genomic DNA from           S typhimurium as template The          forward primer GTTATT           CATATG ATTCGTCATATCGCCATT was          designed to introduce an           Nde I restriction site            CATATG  overlapping the start codon          The reverse primer GATAAA           CTCGAG TTAACGCGCGTGTCGCACCA was          designed to introduce an           Xho I site            CTCGAG  downstream of the stop          codon The PCR products were gelpurified using low          melting temperature agarose and subjected to

AY          AF and AF respectively                          Analysis by SDSPAGE and western blot          SDSPAGE was performed with a MiniPROTEIN II cell          BioRad using the method of Laemmli   Samples from          pellets of centrifuged cells were used to make crude          extracts or were treated for wholecell lysis Crude          extracts were usually diluted  vv with          solubilization buffer and heated to C for  min          Wholecell lysis was performed by resuspending the pellet          in   SDS sample buffer vortexing vigorously to shear          the chromosomal DNA and heating to C for about  min          Samples from  to  l were loaded onto SDS          polyacrylamide gels MultiMark Novex multicolored          standards were used as protein markers in order to          estimate the efficiency of protein transfer and to          determine the molecular mass of proteins of interest          A TransBlot SD SemiDry Transfer Cell BioRad          which transfers in a horizontal apparatus with a          platinumcoated titanium plate as anode and a stainless          steel plate as cathode was used to transfer the protein          from the minigels to nitrocellulose membranes sandwiched          between Extra Thick Blot Absorbent Filter Paper BioRad          in about  to  min          Antigens were detected with a chemiluminescence          detection system femtoLUCENT GENO TECH Membranes were          blocked in  BLOTQuickBlocker PBST buffer plus           Tween washed three times with PBST buffer plus           Tween incubated in primary antibody diluted in          femtoTBST buffer in a tray for  min at room          temperature or overnight at C washed five times as          above incubated in secondary antibodyHRP horseradish          peroxidaseconjugate goat antirabbit as above washed          four times with femtoTBST buffer followed by transfer to          detection buffer and detection reagent The blotted          membranes were placed protein sides up into the film          cassette with the film Kodak Xray full speed blue on          top and exposed for  to  sec
