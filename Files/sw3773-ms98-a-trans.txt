        did you hear our topic and its in regards to discussing homes     homes yes sir umhum what are are you settled in a place   yeah im settled in a place ive been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight in its in Richardson Texas which is North Texas or North Dallas   right umhum   and weve lived in two houses in Richardson we moved here in seventy four  and uh changed locations in seventy eight   okay   how about yourself   well we uh left here in seventy six uh we were here for a few years then we uh have come back just this summer right now were looking for housing uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area are you familiar that   yes nice area   yeah it is the kids are in school here in Duncanville were in a temporary place right now and uh so theyve enjoyed the school so were kind of trying to stay here but   are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or   well what the problem we got is that weve got five children   oh boy   and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh      right right   we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having having finished   sure no were settled and uh were uh im probably older than you im fifty two but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college so i can board up their rooms and  look forward to retirement maybe   oh great   that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess   oh gosh so were looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer closer to our families     great okay okay you are you from Florida originally   no im from West Virginia but everyones uh my wifes parents are from the New York New Jersey area   yeah   so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area seems like a nice place to go   oh yeah yeah yeah weve got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think theyre gonna be uh with us forever       i dont know if thats true but its sure you know were were not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size were were trying to find the   oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five   oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom  and there   as far right its tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isnt it   oh i dont think its possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that yeah   oh i know seems like when you get in that category youre in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and its thats an awful lot you know   oh yeah yeah it is yeah were um were having actually       if we find something for uh id say less than a hundred and twenty thousand well be doing all right you know thats uh but i think the things out there its just a matter of uh   right   you know looking you know finding the right place uh     matter of looking right lot of people will will buy a four in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had uh there were seven kids in her family   wow   and they converted the dining room and and did this and that they always seemed to get along fine you know     oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place itll be just fine but um you know its until then its uh   oh sure   oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing thats all   oh i know and its  theres nothing harder than that i always just sort of a assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then id go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do   oh yeah maybe thats the case at least shes got more opinions you know theres uh seems like theres more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know   yes why certainly i understand that   so what what kind of business are you in   im in the uh sporting goods business im a manufacturers rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies   oh yeah great   who who are you with   uh were with an organization called uh Wycliffe Bible Translators its a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing   uhhuh well great   uh its got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so   how how was the uh you say you say you lived in the Denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing housing prices   it right uh we were uh really surprised to find that theyre higher here uh   no kidding   when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as wed expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and theyre not i guess um really prices for housing are just
