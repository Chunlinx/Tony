Pachuco CrossA design in the form of a small cross that is tattooed on the left hand between the thumb and forefinger with lines or dashes radiating out from it George Carpenter Barker states that it must be seven rays or lines that radiate from the cross It is a wellknown symbol among Chicanos and has been traced to the era of the pachucos s urban youth hence its name It is also known as the cruz del barrio cross from the neighborhood and has been found throughout major cities of the Southwest Tattoos of Christian images have always been popular among Chicanos and the custom of tattooing images of Jesus Christ crucifixes La Virgen de Guadalupe and other Madonnas has a long history In the Middle Ages the Crusaders cut a cross into Christian converts on the hand a little above the wrist Some social scientists believe that the pachuco cross was meant to symbolize violence and membership in a gang But it is known that it was used as an initiation ritual among friends and peers to show solidarity and allegiance to a particular barrio In describing the tattooed cross Haldeen Braddy is of the opinion that each ray jetting out from the cross represented a sixmonth stay in jail In his view pachucos liked to stay in the jaula cage jail so that they could accumulate these rays as souvenirs of their imprisonment   There is no evidence to support this speculationReferences Barker  Braddy  Chicano Pinto Research Project  Coltharp  Demello  Govenar Pachucos as s Urban YouthA name adopted by Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture detached from US culture and from Mexican American urban life also The first appearance of pachucos was in the El PasoJurez area during the s and early s It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco Haldeen Braddy discusses the origin of the word pachuco providing several theories One is that the pachucos of the s came from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo Mexico He also presents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos stating that pachuca is a fivecard poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits or in other words a poker hand with no value a losing hand Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso  The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl word pachtli which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on treesPachucos were identifiable by their clothing hairstyles and a distinct language with its own vocabulary The men wore zoot suits that is pegged pants long coats with padded shoulders and pancake hats Their hair was worn long and slicked back with a ducktail effect Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants well displayed and connected to a belt Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos but they also had a dress style all their own They wore short very tight skirts with their hair high and long Makeup was heavy especially around the eyes Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco boyfriendsLarge numbers of young men from El Paso speaking the pachuco argot settled in Los Angeles during the early s and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable group and considered to be gang members Young men who relocated and settled in Los Angeles even for short periods of time upon returning home to the small towns of the Southwest would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their communities In this way pachuquesmo a Mexican subculture became known throughout the SouthwestThe pachuco speech a combination of English and Spanish also called cal was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources Cal was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon These sources were southwestern Spanish the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico Mexican slang standard Spanish from Mexico City and also words invented by the pachucos themselves The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated from the X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resourcesExpressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today come from the pachuco argot of the s For example such words as rale whats happening or OK bato guy as in bato loco califas California hay te wuacho Ill be seeing you and la pinta jailprison have been used for generations The film Zoot Suit written and directed by Luis Valdez in  depicts the dress language and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the sDuring the s a caricature of the pachuco was created for the Mexican media in the person of Tin Tan whose real name was Germn Valdz  He was an actor and performer who dressed as a stereotypical pachuco and zootsuiter Tin Tan made several Mexican films portraying the Mexican American pocho who codeswitches between English and Spanish and speaks calThe pachuco was disdained in the US by both the Mexican American and Anglo communities and likewise in Mexico by the media and the intellectuals Octavio Paz much quoted disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book The Labyrinth of Solitude published in English in  Although almost any urban Chicano who was young in the s was affected by the style and language of the pachuco the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy The zootsuit riots of  are held up as the epitome of the pachuco experience totally disregarding previous and later experiences According to Alfredo Mirand The pachuco has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and resistance His distinctive dress demeanor mannerism and language not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society To be a chuco is to be proud dignified and to uphold ones personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the group It is at once an affirmation of ones manhood and ones culture   The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco the cholo and the low rider of more contemporary timesThe pachuca was the counterpart of the pachuco of the s but also the homegirl archetype that comes together in the young Chicana growing up in an urban ghettoized environment During the s pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with pachucos They developed their own style of dress wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style Their behavior was loud and brash they smoked cigarettes in public wore lots of eye makeup and supposedly were quick to fight Pachucas knew the vernacular of the times speaking pachuco and scandalizing their families They were not necessarily gang members but they can be considered the precursors of presentday cholasSee also Cal Cholos Low Rider Pocho Tin Tan Zoot SuitReferences Barker

anthropology at the University of Texas Austin His classic work With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero first published in  has become a standard work in Chicano studies and American folklore A whole generation of Chicano scholars regard Paredes as their intellectual role model and mentor and his original research on Chicano folklore engendered a new wave of scholarship and academic achievementsAs a young man Paredes was always interested in music corridos ballads and singing His early published scholarship focused on ballads and ballad heroes of the TexasMexican border and through this research he developed a theory about the formation of Chicano folklore The resistance to an encroaching foreign culture the loss of political and economic power feelings of social marginality and the resulting conflict of cultures all contributed to the creation of folklore in the form of legends jokes and songs by the Chicano people His research and publications encompass various disciplines from anthropology to literature to social historyAmrico Paredes was born in Brownsville Texas on September   He attended Brownsville Junior College in the early s earning an AA degree in  In  he joined the army wrote for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes and worked in Japan for a couple of years Returning to Texas in  he earned a BA degree from the University of Texas in  an MA in  and a PhD in The distinguishing feature of Paredess scholarship has been his humanistic approach to conducting research Besides knowing and studying his own culture and ethnic community he was able to bring another consciousness to the study of folklore in general and to TexasMexican folklore in particular He taught that the examination of a cultural or folkloric phenomenon cannot be divorced from the social context in which it is performed or expressed Before the publication of Paredess work most of the Hispanic and Chicano folklore collected was classified published and placed on a library shelf Paredess research emphasized the importance of the informants culture and the social setting and history of the community of the informant It was in his book With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero that Paredes proposed his theory of the development of Chicano folklore through a process of cultural conflict generated by the invasion of Anglo culture and values into south Texas in the s Many writers have dedicated their books to him and the journal Aztln devoted a doubleissue volume to him in  Besides publishing over sixty articles in academic journals he

Pastorela the complete title of this folk drama is El Coloquio de los Pastores and it is written in verse and performed on Christmas Eve It is an ancient mystery play brought to the New World by the Spanish Franciscan priests and is performed throughout the Southwest As a folk production it is performed for entertainment but it is also a religious presentation that is maintaining a long tradition The full title means the dialogue of the shepherds and it is an interpretation of the dialogue and reaction the shepherds may have had when they learned of the birth of Jesus Christ It narrates the story of the shepherds who are visited by Michael the Archangel who informs them of the birth of the infant Jesus and urges them to go to Beln Bethlehem Before the shepherds decide what to do they are visited by Lucifer who is angry about the birth of the Christ child to the Virgin Mary Lucifer tries to challenge the shepherds but Michael the Archangel returns just in time to defeat him The shepherds then continue on their journey to Bethlehem bringing gifts for the infant Jesus The structure of the play is formulaic and so the sequence of acts can be rearranged into many different patterns with jokes songs speeches and other events added at different points The underlying story of the drama is the universal battle between good and evil It has evolved from the literature of sixteenthcentury Spain and the indigenous traditions of Mexico and for this reason the play has provided a political format for the poor masses throughout the last  yearsBecause of its ancient history there are many variants of Los Pastores and several versions have developed a comic dialogue between Lucifer and Cucharn Bartolo and the other characters One character is named Bato as in bato loco crazy guy a phrase of contemporary usage among Chicanos today Variants of this play have been collected in Texas New Mexico and California and it has been performed in Mexico since the sixteenth century In San Antonio the performance of Los Pastores at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church as been ongoing since  Richard Flores both as an ethnographer and as a performer presents a thorough analysis of the historical conditions that continue to provide an environment for the performance of Los Pastores as both ritual and drama In  El Teatro Campesino produced a video film of their production of Los

states Pedro de Urdemalas is a shadowy even elusive figure in the oral tradition of Spanish folktales Because these tales were notas far as we knowcollected in the Renaissance and because like ballads and songs they must have been subject to endless variation and mutual interference we cannot now know the Pedro de Urdemalas who endeared himself to the folk  But it is clear that Pedro de Urdemalas

created a dialect of his own a diction which abounds in ordinary words but he gives these words a new meaning His terminology abounds in sexual allusion   Many carpas tent theaters featured pelado or peladito characters and the agringado anglicized and the pocho half Mexican were special targets of his comic wit and satire Beloved by workingclass audiences the peladito using cal Spanish slang and pochismos Americanisms particularly poked fun at the acculturation of Mexicans who couldnt speak Spanish and pointed out to them American discrimination against Mexicans Similar to Charlie Chaplin and later developed by the Mexican actor Cantinflas el pelado was a homeless type who in dialogue could state the unthinkable and mock everything and everybody Many Chicanos who may not have known the appellation pelado nonetheless became familiar with the comic vagabond through Mexican films El Teatro Campesino the Farmworkers Theater effectively used this character type in skits and actos dramas

Penitentes This lay religious society related to the Roman Catholic Church is still found in rural northern New Mexico and southern Colorado Originally it was organized for religious observances and practices including pious prayer and bodily penance but the society eventually became very important in providing mutual aid to the local communities Los Penitentes cared for the sick arranged funerals and conducted the religious rituals associated with wakes Their social role in contemporary New Mexico is not as pronounced but some moradas still remain activeTheir primary religious ceremonies commemorated the passion and death of Jesus Christ during the celebrations of Semana Santa Holy Week It is speculated that the starting date of the brotherhood is somewhere between  and  The origins of Los Penitentes have been debated for years but it is likely they were heavily influenced by the Franciscan Third Order who were the friars in New Mexico until Mexico separated from Spain in  Los Penitentes became a strong institution in rural New Mexico because there were too few Catholic priests to oversee the religious life of the people during the early nineteenth century The village chapters governed themselves without benefit of the few priests in the colony Consequently Los Penitentes had strong influences in conserving the language and culture of the Spanish Americans of New Mexico Membership consisted of between thirty and fifty adult men per chapter called moradas and were divided into two groups common members called hermanos disciplantes brothers who discipline and officers called hermanos de luz brothers of light By the early twentieth century the various chapters had become secret societies with restricted membershipJournalism about Los Hermanos Penitentes has been sensationalistic with lengthy descriptions of their Semana Santa rituals especially when Anglo Americans migrated to New Mexico during the late nineteenth century Their custom of selfpunishment in the form of flagellation during the Holy Week ceremonies aroused much interest and was reported widely in many East Coast publications The most sensitive and nonjudgmental writing

it occurs of giving a little extra when making a transaction or closing a bargain For instance when buying candy the vendor may add one extra piece de piln to surprise and make a child happy John

total number of beans reached sixteen or eighteen the customer was given six cents in money or goods This was the piln a type of dividend given to the client for purchasing from the same merchantThe phrase de piln is used when referring to the occurrence of an unplanned episode or accident In narrating a personal story with an unhappy ending an individual might add Y de piln me ca and to top it off I fell down Although it is not found in common usage among contemporary Chicanos many will remember how their parents used this expression The word has several meanings including a heap of stuff such as a heap of grapes a heap of mortar a heap of something but it also means a lump of sugar In her personal memoir A Place in El Paso Gloria LopezStoppard has a delightful description of the use of piln during her childhood Thus de piln may express something positive or something unexpectedly negativeReferences Bourke  De Leon  LopezStoppard PiatasA colorfully decorated clay pot or papiermch figure filled with toys and candies confetti or party favors that is brought to celebrations such as birthdays Christmas festivities and other parties Often it is decorated as a star or an animal such as a burro or elephant but it can also be a fruit or a puppet The size varies from small to very large Piatas have traditionally been a part of birthday and Christmas celebrations but are now also brought out for other holidays In Mexico a piata was always broken on Christmas Eve especially among the poorer classes so that children would receive small inexpensive gifts from the piata The real Christmas gifts were not presented until Da de los Reyes on January  also known as Epiphany in the Catholic calendarA game is made of breaking the piata and a song accompanies the game The piata is hung from a tree with a long rope that is manipulated by an adult who is able to move the piata up and down so it wont be broken too quickly A child is blindfolded twirled around three times handed a bat and led to the piata Everyone will usually have a turn or two and finally the manipulator allows someone to break it The candy and prizes fall to the ground and everyone jumps to grab someThe custom of breaking a piata during the Christmas Mass celebrations was introduced by the Augustine priests in the seventeenth century Later the custom of celebrating many Christmas Masses evolved into Las Posadas Christmas pageant The piata was considered to be a symbol of evil with the clay pot representing Satan or his spirit and the colorful decorations serving to tempt humanity The candies and goodies inside the piata were the unknown pleasures that Satan held out to attract man The blindfolded child was supposed to represent innocence and faith which must be blind to combat the evil spirit The breaking of the piata symbolized the struggle that man must sustain to destroy evil and receive the gifts and pleasures of God the candyThe word piata derives from the verb apiar which means to cram tie or join together In Italy pignattas were hung from the ceilings during masquerade balls It is accepted that there is an oriental influence since piatas are always decorated with colorful

prison is believed to come from the word penitenciaria or penitentiary Other common words for prison are bote meaning can and corre which is short for correctional institution referring specifically to one in Texas Joint is another word frequently used to mean prisonThere has been a lot of sociological literature written about the formation of gangs in prisons as a means of surviving incarceration in the United States The media including  Minutes has done stories about the activities of the Mexican mafia and La Familia Often ignored is the subculture of the pinto experience that is exhibited in behavior art expression and published poetry In the early s several Chicano magazines devoted whole issues to literature and art by pintos always referring to it as pinto art and pinto poetry A combination of Mexican and prison cultural values dictates the behavior of pintos inside prison and out on the street Chicano prisoners have a strong sense of family and community and feel they are constantly being watched by their barrio family women and their homeboys peer group Most Chicano convicts have little education speak primarily in Spanish and have a strong sense of Mexican

They are usually extremely clean and well groomed have very short hair wear wellpressed pants and are in excellent physical shape Within the prison world pintos have established a welldefined and structured social environment which they carry to the outside world when released In discussing the film American Me Rosa Linda Fregoso states that Edward James Olmos depicts extremely well the expressive behavior of pintos both in prison and outside In her words Besides rendering a Chicano pinto presence in the rhythms of speech Santana the movie character represents it in the stylized walk and prose of a pinto a stance honed in the corridors behind prison walls or in the barrios of East LA  The pinto experience is a subculture of the Chicano experience Because of the low socioeconomic status of a large percentage of Chicanos in the United States and the lack of equal opportunities in education and employment many Chicano families have been inadvertently introduced to this subculture A special issue of the Chicano magazine De Colores vol  no  was devoted to Los Pintos de America and the issue was published as a separate monograph in  by Pajarito Publications Female

United States it also means the license plates of a car But within cholo and youth gang culture it refers to the sign and name of a gang or club as it appears on the walls of buildings in the barrios of Chicano communities What may appear as graffiti is actually the placa of a person or of a gang Where the placa appears signifies that territory as belonging to that gang and it may also serve as a challenge to other gangs The use of public walls for asserting a fraternal identity is really an ancient tradition and within Chicano culture it can be traced back to at least the s Chicano street culture uses plaqueasos as a system for conveying information about territory and youth socialization customs If one placa is written over by the placa of another gang it is accepted as a challenge to a confrontationA placa also refers to the individual name of a gang member Nicknames are very common among Chicanos but a placa is specifically a gangrelated name and often very well describes the person as perceived by friends or other gang members Names such as Sad Girl Diablo devil Joker and Malo bad could be names used within a gang and may signify sadness wildness or craziness Sometimes the writing of names on walls is referred to as plaqueasos or in contemporary terms barrio calligraphy In more recent times the individual who writes on walls has been called a tagger and the art of writing is tagging Many Chicano taggers use a stylized medieval writing such as Old English and German Gothic formsSanchezTranquilino has analyzed the displacement of graffiti by murals in Chicano

born and raised in the United States It is meant to describe a person who may not be fully fluent in Spanish or Mexican enough culturally and linguistically The word can also mean discolored truncated or small It has been adopted by some Chicanos to describe and ridicule themselves as they survive within an antagonistic and discriminatory environment The word became more nationally known in  with

pocho ridiculing their sometimes poor Spanish and their lack of knowledge about Mexico and Mexican customs Mexicans who have spent time in the United States and have acquired the mannerisms values and the English language may be considered pochos because theyve become agringados anglicized In the s and s the Mexican cinema produced several films depicting the lives of pochos from both sides of the

autobiography Barrio Boy Ernesto Galarza writes about the pochos he found in Sacramento California in the second decade of the twentieth century They had learned to speak English of sorts and could still speak Spanish also of sorts Concerning the pochos the chicanos suspected that they considered themselves too good for the barrio but were not for some reason good enough for the Americans  In

Christmas season with the dramatization of the search for lodging in Bethlehem by Joseph and Mary It always includes a procession with singing and music and starts nine days before Christmas The story in the form of a novena Catholic ninedays devotion is based on the gospel of St Luke For nine consecutive nights before Christmas Eve la Noche Buena the good night los peregrinos the pilgrims representing Joseph and Mary visit a different home each night reenacting the search for an inn by Joseph and Mary Los mesoneros those who portray the innkeepers keep refusing them lodging Los peregrinos form a procession and children and angels handcarry the small figures of the Holy Family When they arrive at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols Las Posadas occurs from December  through December  Nine different homes are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging Most homes will have a nativity scene a nacimiento set up for the prayers and singers An important tradition of these festivities is the piata that is brought out and broken by the children There is evidence that piatas originated from this Christmas celebrationPosadas are still held today in many Mexican communities in the United States Some are organized by church groups but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city entities The reenactment of Las Posadas is an ancient tradition that can be traced back to the early conquest in Mexico and to the christianization of the Aztecs by the Augustine priests They originated in the small village of San Augustin Acolman located near the pyramids in Teotihuacn The Aztecs celebrated the birth of their god Huitzilopochtli for one night and celebrations were held all of the following day in every home This occurred about the same time of the year that the Catholic Church celebrated the birth of Christ The Augustine priests saw the similarity between these Aztec celebrations and the Christmas festivities and chose this opportunity to teach the new religion to the Aztecs While the Aztecs were celebrating the birth of Huitzilopochtli the priests reenacted the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph The nine nightly journeys symbolize the nine months of pregnancy for Mary These Christmas Masses as they were called were celebrated in the convents and churches but eventually were moved to the haciendas farms and ranches and finally to the neighborhoods The celebrations ended with firecrackers and the breaking of a piata Today many cities in the Southwest reenact this pilgrimage for one night with a procession winding through city streets In Monterey California the whole city comes out for Las Posadas and in San Antonio Texas a posada is held during the Fiesta de las Luminarias Festival of the Bonfires that includes a procession on the Paso del Rio river passSee also Nacimiento PiataReferences Campa  Chabran and Chabran  Espinosa  Heisley and
