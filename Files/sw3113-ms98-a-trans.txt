        okay   okay well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers im not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that im not sure and i i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh they can find guilt or innocence   right   uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that   right i agree too i dont think the jury should be the ones that that put the sensings sentencings down i think the judges should or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point might be better apt than just regular civil people   uhhuh   not knowing you know exactly what things are  from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know   yeah because i find that uh ive been on a few juries and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases because ive been an expert witness some and uh many matters are so complicated that its so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime   right   uh that uh when i only do something one two or three times im hardly an expert on it and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three   yeah and   and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty five   right thats yeah and and and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if theyre that lucky sometimes  or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea   umhum   of what what the standard punishment would be for it and it they may have some different idea i mean it might be more important for them to put a sentencing sentencing sentencing down that was uh   yes   longer you know that didnt fit the punishment didnt fit the crime   umhum   or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be   yeah   i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and you know sometimes might have have more pull which that does happen i mean we we cant say it doesnt because it does happen i mean not everybody is is you know   umhum   has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or   umhum   whatever the case may be and sometimes thats not real fair either though so   well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper i i tend to hear two things well that go on one is you often see in the headlines the big numbers   umhum   uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed   right   by a judge or an Appeals Court and that never makes the the press and so when uh you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of whats what because we see the headlines uh and we dont have uh again a lot of knowledge so we dont know what is really going on what is uh really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied   right right well well also what i dont think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in and and his attorney gets his sentences sentencing reduced because hes gone to a lesser charge like i dont know what assault or something or   umhum   but which that doesnt make any sense to me either i know its hard to prove rape and whatnot and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesnt i mean its embarrassing and all this other stuff and they theyre put on like   umhum   they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldnt be able to go on the lesser charge i dont i dont think thats right because alls thats going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know   yeah   have the same thing happen thats thats not right   well thats where uh uh the role of juries is is restricted and uh im not sure id want to change that aspect of it one is its restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if its first degree rape second degree degree rape or whatever   right   they only get to decide on that well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh and you can decide guilt or innocence on that uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether its uh premeditated or   umhum   one or two of the lesser degrees and the other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you usually dont get to hear all the information its what information is presented and   yeah   uh i dont know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence   and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you dont have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because theyve got it there   umhum   so the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information dont they   yeah and the truth thats brought out is uh as i say when ive heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want uh they dont want uh the whole truth i mean you can say yeah the because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth   they only put part of it yeah right well thats just like that old witness game well its a game kids play too but um somebody did it just ah just for your train of thought where they they showed something and they asked there there there were uh like four people
