            all right   okay well um we lived i grew up in San Antonio and i was used to the heat and i was used to what couldnt grow   uhhuh   down there and uh we had a small um farm house out in Castroville which is just uh to the west of San Antonio   uhhuh   and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil nice   yeah   because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate and when we came up here uh to California uh were in the Monterrey area and its very uh nice sandy soil rich soil and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow   how fine   so weve been out here well really in the house since December and weve been uh planting flowers that we could never plant in San Antonio uh       because the heat would just dry them up after you know about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started   um   and here they are supposed to last year around so we have some really pretty flowers growing and uh were at the edge of a forest area so theres a lot of pine mulch   oh boy uhhuh   uh  just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us you know       we got here at the end of about a four year drought uh weve had a whole lot of rain uh its been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month   oh really   so yeah were getting replenished and so there is uh when i first came here everything was yellow the grass was dead everywhere       and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer   hm wow   but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and thats about the extent of what weve done just a little bit on the patio and uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can  mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend       but um were just so happy to see green its just so nice we havent really done too much else other than that   hum well we um we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so   uhhuh   we didnt have any lawn and garden type duties so were just learning the ropes here and   uhhuh   but when we moved in um our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that there just there wasnt even a blade of grass in the backyard   oh uhhuh   so were you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass we trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me that when i grew up in Missouri and you didnt have to worry about growing grass there it just happened automatically   uhhuh so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass is that what youre   so yes we are we tried we planted some fescue last um fall     uhhuh   and its its really really pretty and um  green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter and uh and its pretty good its not as thick and as nice it doesnt look like it can withstand too much you know   oh okay does that last through the summer too   its supposed to die off like in August and then you replant it in September   um oh   and uh so but we dont the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasnt like i say there really wasnt even one blade of grass in the backyard   uhhuh   and um so mostly you know were not even to the point where were getting into flowers and flower beds or even gardens that     uhhuh   were just saying lets get some grass   just get grass to grow i know   lets get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know   uhhuh well when we had our house um out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre and   uhhuh   trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive   oh yeah   to water it and uh and eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now uh it was so hot that year that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in February   oh no   um we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said were going to have to let the back yard die its going to have to do whatever its going to do because we cant really afford the front yard     on its own uhhuh   and so when we left you know the back yard had and the Saint um i think it was Saint Augustine that we had um it it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the weeds start in the back yeah we were just you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again   uhhuh hum   but i dont know thats the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive that was the only thing i didnt like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you dont have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out     yes and   so   its pretty remarkable because growing up weve always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri i mean it just happened   uhhuh    uhhuh   and um so its been real fun here to see theres a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a  lot of people um we live in north of Dallas and um   uhhuh Arlington area   Plano   okay Plano uhhuh   uhhuh up north and um and so theres a lot of market up here since its kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for   uhhuh   for yards yard work   yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular especially in the Dallas area there theres so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and   uhhuh   another thing ive noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice   uhhuh   yes they do i noticed that theyre really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind   uhhuh   and so that really cuts into your backyard space and   yeah   but we dont do our work here out of enjoyment so much just right now were just this is we just moved in in September so were just still at the point where were talking about the   uhhuh   the necessity   right i know oh its its awful the first house well the our house in Castroville was the first one too and we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening  would run into   uhhuh   and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water   uhhuh   and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in   yeah   that was that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didnt have to worry about it at all   um   and that was so nice but we didnt have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh       so i hope you can find uh i dont know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas i remember the guy that was on the radio um they had a gardener and he i dont know i had this one well ive still got the book its um i think its just called Texas Gardening and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas   uhhuh hm we   and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i dont remember what it is but its got like a boot on the front of the book   uhhuh   its just a real fancy decorated boot its like Texas Gardening and it talks about you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about the grass and there being the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used   grass oh um   but i dont remember i dont remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or or what but i do remember they had used a blend   or what it was well were going to have to do that because we have the shade the trees this is an established and older home that we moved into and um   uhhuh   the trees are just so tall and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining you can  go out in our back yard and not get wet   oh but thats so neat because so many homes dont have that so youll be cool all year around in the summer thats great   well thats what were looking forward to and thats what they say the payoff is but   uhhuh it makes the biggest difference        when you have the big old trees and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new little trees They didnt have any shade  they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day       too hot yes   so oh thats great that you have them are they oaks that around there   well there are all different kinds there   oh thats even better   you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees   oh   there are some big big tall oak trees one across   uhhuh
