                    Background        In the past animal models in the study of disc        degeneration have most commonly involved dogs monkeys and        sheep but in recent years the sand rat          Psammomys obesus  has been used        because of the economic advantages of rodent models The        spontaneous agerelated degeneration of the sand rat spine        avoids the need for chemonucleolysis or surgical injury to        induce disc degeneration The agerelated disc degeneration        in the sand rat has been shown to be reliable and        predictable and has been well characterized in previous        radiologic studies             The present work        extends the previous radiological studies in    to        develop an automated computerassisted procedure that        analyses digitized lateral xrays of the sand rat        spine        To create such a system the task of locating the        vertebrae in the image is vital For this task previous        works in xray analysis were consulted and several        possibilities were initially considered The main        techniques in previous research used active shape models        both customized and deformable Extensive research has been        done by Long      to automatically identify and        classify spinal vertebrae Others whose work includes the        use of active shape models for vertebrae analysis are Smyth           and Zamor     Although the adaptability of        active shape models is important bspline techniques are        also valuable     These techniques which are adequate        in the analysis of human spines were not selected in the        present study because they still require user intervention        and our objective was to develop a completely automated        approach to the study of lateral films        The specific goal of this study was to create an        efficient automated method of identifying the overall angle        of curvature of the spine the angles between individual        vertebrae the distance between vertebrae and a scoring        index for sclerosis present in the vertebral end plates        which may be a major factor in reducing the nutrition        available to the aging disc Resultant representative data        are presented both graphically and numerically to        illustrate the computer methods which are utilized The        major emphasis of this pilot study was to accurately        identify each of the vertebrae and then to obtain selected        measurements The techniques presented here may have        potential to produce quantitative algorithms that create        more accurate and informative studies and measurements in a        time efficient manner                    Methods                  Finding the Location of the Spine in the          Image          In order to analyse the vertebrae first the location          of the spine in the image must be found In each of the          images the location and angle of the spine can be          clearly detected by finding the welldefined softtissue          boundary of the body itself The first step in finding          this boundary was to denoise the image using an adaptive          Wiener filter       The goal was to minimize the          amount of noise in the black area corresponding to the          area outside the body Next Canny edge detection             was applied to obtain a binary image representing the          edges in the Xray The reason the Canny edge detector          was chosen over other edge detectors is because it is          still a basic filter but also applies a Gaussian          smoothing filter before its edge detection algorithm The          strength of the edges detected is also controlled with          this detection system which helps to enhance precision          The Canny edge detector can be briefly described using          Equation  developed to detect the local maxima in the          direction perpendicular to the edge                    In Equation   represents the image           G is a D Gaussian filleting          operation and the second directional derivative is taken          along the normal vector           n  Using this edgedetected image          the boundary was traced and the angles of its curvature          recorded as shown in Figure           The process to this point generated two important sets          of information First a set of points along the bodys          boundary was obtained which gives a good estimate for          locating the vertebrae Second a set of angles that          gives an estimate of how the underlying vertebrae are          oriented was obtained                          Segmenting the Image          Next with the data that provided the position and          orientation of the spine it was necessary to segment the          image based on orientation The purpose of this          segmentation was twofold First the image must be          broken into smaller portions for histogram equalization          and contrast adjustment Because the image varies in          quality and clarity in different portions of the image          details visible in one portion of the image may not be          clearly identifiable in other portions The second          purpose segmentation served was to limit the search space          for line segments see below          The boundary points from the previous step were used          to determine where the image was to be segmented The          locations of these points for segmentation and their          angles of curvature are shown in Table           Figure shows the results of Canny edge detection             before the image was segmented The edges of the end          plates were not clearly visible because different          threshold values needed to be used for separate portions          of the image A threshold value applied to the entire          image can neglect needed information and may detect more          noise than the true edges          The image was segmented in locations where the change          in orientation of the detected boundary became greater          than twenty degrees Figure  A tenpixel overlap          between segments was used to avoid accidentally missing          features that lie near segment boundaries From this          point each segment was processed independently Figure                                    Reductions or Elimination of Segment          Background          In order to obtain an image where the vertebrae were          clearly defined it was necessary to eliminate as much of          the background noise and other objects in the image as          possible Highboost filters as well as histogram          equalization    were both tested for this process          While both techniques required some logic to determine          the best values for filtering the image histogram          equalization appeared to be the stronger of the two          techniques as it allowed an analysis of the distribution          of intensities in the image and adjusted the histogram          accordingly Histogram equalization can be briefly          described using Equation                     where           g is the original grey level            g  is the equalized           G                       m            is the maximum grey level           A            is the area of the image and           H            u  is the histogram          Figure shows the effects of the histogram          equalization The equalization highlighted the          distinction of vertebrae vs the surrounding tissues          making the vertebrae more visible and the boundaries more          identifiable This step also normalized the images          reducing the variance among the images for the measuring          of sclerosis and helped increase the accuracy of the          edge detection Hough transform    discussed          below                          Locating Vertebral End Plates          The image was segmented such that each segment          contained vertebrae of similar orientation Each          segments histogram was also manipulated such that the          vertebrae were well defined The remaining processing          steps can be described as follows           First Canny edge detection    was performed on          the image segment This time threshold values that          specifically eliminated the false edges were used The          false edges were a result of noise and other edges in the          image that were not part of the spine These threshold          values were based on the segments histogram from the          previous step The objective was to preserve the edges of          the end plates while at the same time eliminating as many          of the other extraneous edges as possible           Once the edge image was produced it underwent a          Radon transform     The Radon transform of a binary          image is essentially a Hough transform     The Hough          transform Figure  gives an idea of where lines are          located in an image by counting consecutive points in          each direction The Hough transform was used because it          was originally designed to detect straight lines with no          prior knowledge of the region being necessary The theory          behind the Hough transform is as follows     All          lines going through a given point can be represented by          one equation                    y                       kx                       q           Equation            for some values of           k and           q  Meaning that Eq  can be taken          as an equation in the parameter space           k q  thus all the lines through a          given point A can be represented by                    q             x                      k            y                      Equation            and all the lines passing through a given point B can          be represented by                    q             x                      k            y                      Equation            Then the only common point on both lines in the           k q parameter space is the point          in the image that represents the only existing line          between points A and B The goal is to determine all          possible line pixels and transform the lines that go          through the pixels into points in           k q space and to detect the          points            a            b  that result from the Hough          transform of lines           y            ax            b in the image          The directions searched in the Hough transform were          constrained by using the angles that provided the basis          for segmentation This eliminated many of the false line          detections by limiting the orientations allowed           The best line candidates of all those produced by          the Hough transform were selected Figure  These lines          matched the location and orientation of each of the          vertebral end plates The line candidates located near          each selected candidate intersect near or at the midpoint          of the end plate edge This allowed accurate estimation          of the midpoint of each end plate These midpoints were          then used for accurately finding the orientation and          location of individual vertebrae           A new index of sclerosis to describe the amount of          calcification on each vertebra was introduced as                    This index is a relation between the intensity of the          vertebra at an end plate and the intensity of the          vertebra at the center In the image the higher the          intensity value the more bony sclerosis is present          ie the degree of sclerosis is greater As a note          this index is only a measurement no interpretations are          made at this point                            Results                  Overall Curvature          Overall curvature was determined as the difference          between the orientations of the beginning and ending          vertebra and is shown in Table  This measurement could          have also been modelled with circle detection where the          spine represents a segment of the circle                          Angles of Individual Vertebra          An estimation of this measurement was obtained by          using the output of the line detection method described          in section  and shown in Figure  This gives an          indication of the midpoints of the end plates as well as          the orientation of those end plates This information          resulted to the slope from the midpoint of one end plate          to the midpoint of the other The angles of the vertebrae          are given by the Orientation Angle column in Table           Since not every end plate could be found with the line          detection method the shape detection methods provide a          more reliable basis for this measurement                          Distances Between Vertebras          The distance between the vertebrae was determined by          finding the pixel length of the vertebrae and the pixel          length of the gap between their left neighbouring          vertebrae In Table  the vertebral length and the pixel          space between vertebrae are given by the Vertebra          Length and Space respectively                          Index of Sclerosis at End Plates          This measurement of sclerosis was a ratio between the          average pixel intensity near the center of a vertebra and          the pixel intensity at each end plate Figure           calculated by Equation  The histogram equalization was          essential for these calculations so there will not be a          high degree of variance between subsequent images The          index value for the left end cap compared to the center          is the Sclerosis Upper Index column and the index          value for the right end cap compared to the center is the          Sclerosis Lower Index column in Table                             Discussion        The results generated from this new application of        computer analysis applied to a small group of        representative xrays indicate that the computeraided        method developed here is practical for automated        calculation and analysis of the overall curvature of the        spine individual vertebra angles vertebral spacing and        sclerosis measurement The computational techniques can        also provide quantitative means that can then be used to        explore the relation between age and conformation of the        vertebrae The two most important steps in the process        reported here are the location of the edges of the        vertebrae and the location of the midpoints of the end        plates Future applications of the techniques developed        here could potentially be applied to either human or large        animal radiographs The proposed method can be applied to        further our methods of analysis in animal models of        important features of spine aging such as sclerosis of the        vertebral end plates        Bernick and Cailliet have suggested that sclerosis of        the end plate may act to impede nutrient flow into the disc            and that progressive end plate sclerosis with        aging contributed to disc degeneration Concomitantly        however disc degeneration by changing stress patterns on        end plate bone may also cause increases in bone density in        parts of the end plate subjected to greater stress               Modic et al have provided the major clinical        study of end plates in degenerating discs     They        reported that discs which showed in an MRI a decrease in        signal intensity on Tweighted spinecho images and        increased signal intensity on Tweighted images Modic        type  exhibited disruption and fissuring of the end        plates Endplates showed woven bone thick trabeculae with        active bone remodeling and fibrous marrow Modic type         MRI changes characterized by increased signal intensity on        Tweighted images and isointense or slightly increased        signal intensity on Tweighted images showed a        progression to disrupted end plates and reactive bone        tissue and the presence of fatty marrow                    Conclusions        Performing accurate analysis of vertebrae based on        radiographic images is a challenging image processing task        The automated system presented here applies robust image        processing techniques to find important measures of        degeneration in the aging spine such as separation and        angle between vertebrae measurement of sclerosis and        orientation of vertebrae The main advantages of this        method are that unlike humans the computer can make exact        quantitative measurements the computer is not subjective        does not depend on the investigator it provides faster        analysis and the image quality can be improved before        analysis to allow more accurate measurements The main        disadvantages are that the Xray must be digitized        producing extra costs and complexity and humans might use        certain heuristics that cannot be directly translated into        mathematical methods for the computer to imitate        Some limitations to the method include that the overall        accuracy is dependant on the quality of data used the        orientation of the spine in the image must be within a        certain degree to be analyzed and a large data set is        necessary to be able to usefully interpret the measurements        generated The main sources of error that were identified        are the fact that the lower the quality of the input image        the higher the chance for missmeasurements because the        identification of the landmark features may be incorrect        and that the overall orientation measurements can be        incorrect due to the orientation and location of the spine        in the images In addition the method can be used to        quantitatively study the relation between the age and        vertebral changes This automated system can greatly        enhance the research on spine and disc degeneration in sand        rats and other rodent models that provide an economically        attractive alternative to large animal studies                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors Contributions        CW and DB developed and
