                                 Worse Than Drudge            Clinterngate entered itsbaroque phase Sunday when Joseph diGenova a prominent Washington lawyer whohas been one of the most incontinent television commentators on the scandalappeared on Meet The Press  In a tone of quivering outrage diGenovaannounced that he had received a tip from a reporter that diGenova and hiswife Victoria Toensing who is also his law partner were the targets of aprivate investigator connected to the Clinton White House            There isno evidence for this But it has now been widely reportedas an allegation bydiGenova Sunday and Monday White House spokesman Mike McCurry denied itTuesday Clintons lawyers David Kendall and Robert Bennett issued a statementsaying that while Terry Lenzner a professional investigator was working withthem We have not investigated and are not investigating the personal livesof Ms Toensing Mr diGenova prosecutors investigators or members of thepress DiGenova interprets the phrase personal life as Clintonian fancyfootwork and thus as confirmation of his charge The White House lied about iton Sunday they lied about it Monday and they lied about it yesterdaydiGenova said in a telephone interview Mike McCurry lied and he did it wellThats his job But the rest of us dont have to believe this crap            Why would the White House be investigating Joe diGenova andVictoria Toensing DiGenova says he is at a loss to explain since he and hiswife have been very fair to the president in their scores of recentappearances on programs including Rivera Live and Crossfire  TVbookers love diGenova because he is a former prosecutor who goes for the soundbite and also because he is a former independent counsel himself Between and  he looked into charges that Bush administration officials instigatedan improper search of Bill Clintons passport files during the  campaignAnd largely exonerated the accused Imagine how Republicans would howl if aDemocratic independent counsel let a Democratic administration off the hookThough both diGenova and Toensing are Republicans who are hostile to Clintonand supportive of Kenneth Starr they usually argue against theindependentcounsel law in general            ButdiGenova is being disingenuous in pretending he has no idea why anyone would beinterested in him If the Clinton team has investigated diGenova and Toensingit might be because the couple seems to act as a conduit for leaks from Starrsoffice Starr is using his subpoena power to investigate antiStarr leaks fromthe Clinton camp What would be so terrible if the Clintonites wereinvestigating Starrs antiClinton leaks Those leaks may be illegal andviolate the presidents rights Clintons lawyers have every justification fortrying to track them down            If Starr wanted to use an intermediarydiGenova would be a good bet He is a friend of several members of Starrsstaff and is especially close to Starrs chief deputy Hickman Ewing with whomhe served as a US attorney during the Reagan administration DiGenova haslongstanding relationships with reporters dating from his days as USattorney for the District of Columbia One could legitimately describe eitherdiGenova or Toensing as a Washington lawyer knowledgeable about theinvestigation newspapers favorite leaker ID There is no proof that eitherhas served as a cutout for Starr But if they havent why do they qualify as asource about anything In fact the unreliable gossip they sometimes pass onmakes the notorious Matt Drudge look discreet            One gets a glimpse of Joeand Vickys peculiar role in the fiasco that occurred in late January when theDallas Morning News reported then retracted then semireasserted thata Secret Service witness to a ClintonLewinsky encounter was prepared totestify To recap On the evening of Monday Jan  the paper published areport on its Web site It quoted a lawyer familiar with the negotiations assaying there was a Secret Service agent who had seen Clinton and Lewinsky in acompromising situation and that he had become a government witness Hourslater the paper recanted the source for the story a longtime Washingtonlawyer familiar with the case later said the information provided forTuesdays report was inaccurate The paper further noted that The source isnot affiliated with Mr Starrs office But the following day the paperreissued a version of the story An intermediary for a witness or witnesses whomight or might not be a Secret Service agent or agents had told Starrs officeabout seeing Clinton and Lewinsky in what was now described as an ambiguoussituation Inexplicably the story quoted former US Attorney JosephdiGenova who is not directly involved in the case as saying that theintermediary had made contact for the witness or witnesses with Mr Starrsoffice In essence your story is correct diGenova told the paper            Was theoriginal source also diGenova or Toensing I think it must have been Click tofind out why            Whether diGenova was the source or not we do knowthat diGenova spoke to the Dallas Morning News on the record confirmingthat a witness of some sort did indirectly pass information to Starrs officeAnd we know that Toensing spoke off the record contradicting the originallypublished version Since diGenova says they werent representing anyoneinvolved on what basis did they know This is a small Southern town saysdiGenova People talk to a lot of people Reporters talk to people Lawyerstalk You hear things and you pass them on to reporters so that they mightinvestigate Sometimes people dont investigate the way they should Thissounds almost like an admission and suggests that Starrs office may beindirectly using journalists to try to substantiate rumors it has heard In anyevent the fact that the Dallas Morning News considered diGenova alegitimate source would suggest that the papers reporter thought he wasntjust relating thirdhand gossip but had real information from Starrsoffice            All thismischief is made much weirder by the fact that diGenova and Toensing aresupposed to be presiding over a big investigation themselves Rep PeterHoekstra RMich the chairman of the House Committee on Education and theWorkforce formally Education and Labor Committee subcommittee oninvestigations hired the pair in October to investigate corruption in theTeamsters election including allegations of involvement by the DemocraticNational Committee In October they signed a contract that pays them at therate of  a year for  hours of work a month each Committee Democratsobjected to this arrangement from the outset DiGenova and Toensing arelobbyists registered on behalf of several clients including the AmericanHospital Association They may be called upon to lobby legislators for whomthey also work as committee lawyers DiGenova says the problem is theoreticaland that he and his wife have agreed not to lobby members of the committeetheyre working for            And theres more DiGenova also representsanother House committee chairman Dan Burton the goofish Indiana RepublicanBurton too is both investigator and investigatee He has been looking intothe  campaignfinance scandals Meanwhile he is being looked into forallegedly putting the arm on a Pakistani lobbyist for campaigncontributions            Democrats complain thatgiven the amount of time they spend with Geraldo diGenova and Toensing cantpossibly be doing their government job A Nexis search turns up  hits forthe two in the first month after the scandal broke As of a few weeks ago thecommittee had issued no subpoenas interviewed no witnesses and held nohearings DiGenova says it has since issued five subpoenas and has a hearingscheduled for late next month Democrats have demanded to see time sheets thelawyers have refused to show them We dont work for the Democrats diGenovasays We work for the majority He says that they do their congressional workduring the day and do media in the evening            But thereal problem with diGenova and Toensing isnt their pundit addiction or theirneglect of an investigation that Democrats would just as soon they neglectanyhow Its that their myriad dubious and overlapping roles keep piling upwithout ever being properly explained Its like one of those Westerns wherethe town barber is also the postmaster and the saloonkeeper In the next sceneit turns out hes the sheriff too                           If youmissed the demonstration that either diGenova or Toensing was the
