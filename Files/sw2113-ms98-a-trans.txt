                uh the last movie that i saw i i dont go to that many so ill just have to talk about the ones that i went to see but uh it was Awakenings with uh Robin Williams and uh Peter DeNiro   okay yes uhhuh   have you seen it   no unfortunately i havent i heard its really good but   it is i just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro he is one of the best actors ive ever seen its   uhhuh   theres a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less   uhhuh   but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he cant you know control his movements at all   umhum   and it was just so realistic the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that hes an actor   uhhuh   though   what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is   no it was very serious very serious   oh how does he do serious stuff   hes good hes hes talented boy he is   yes yes ive only seen him in funny stuff and so   i know me too but uh well what was that show um   Garfield uh Garfield i want to say Garfield but that wasnt   yeah uh Garp The World of Garp     yeah The World According to Garp he wasnt always funny in that show was he   i didnt read see the the movie i read the book but i     i did too  and thats why i was thinking it couldnt be just a totally funny part but   yeah yeah yeah in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so   yeah right   yeah   well what have you seen   i think the last movie that we went out to see was Dances With Wolves   oh i saw it   uh well good weve both seen one  did you cry through much of     yes the whole way     i was telling a friend i i said i only cried twice but each was about half an hour long so           where did you cry   um lets see when i each time that i thought that the Indians were going to get killed i cried um i cried the first time when the um   umhum   the wagon man got killed when they attacked him   uhhuh yeah yeah   and um i think from there on   through the movie lets see what else did it       um what other parts i cant remember any of the other parts right yeah   i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed   well i dont remember when the horse got killed   oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him   oh yeah yeah   and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know  and that horse has been such a pal to him   umhum yeah     when he was  alone you can tell im an animal lover you can hear my dog     uh unfortunately we dont have any animals so um   yeah   but   it was a beautiful story it really was   it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie what did you think about the buffalo scenes   umhum um oh i thought it was awful   that was   and so graphic i mean i hadnt even imagined it you know i think weve all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo   yeah umhum   um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie of course they raise them now you know to eat   oh oh uhhuh yeah thats not   but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that   umhum   yeah well at least you know that it wasnt same situation that the buffalo died in   no it wasnt   um i thought the scenes when the buffaloes running though were beautiful like that was great and there were so many of them i didnt know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place   oh yeah yeah really   so that was pretty   really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path   umhum yeah   and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing   i wonder how they kept up with them though it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast i guess they graze though that wouldnt have been a problem   i know yeah yeah it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie   no huhuh   it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real   umhum   i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uhhuh thats the part they had trouble finding was wolves   oh i guess theyre just not domesticated or or   yeah right they just dont howl that much anymore   huh   i could they could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and thats all theyd have to do     thatll teach them with a couple minutes huh     yeah     well thats funny   well i think weve made it   yeah oh is that five minutes is that   i dont know is it five or three   okay oh im not sure   im not either   okay well i think were were weve done okay though well thank you for calling   okay me too well thank you     hope you enjoy some more good movies
