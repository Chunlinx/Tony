                so what do you think about uh employers screening you know job candidates for drug drug usage   well i can kind of see it both ways because um you dont want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldnt want to have employees that are on drugs   right   that could cause all kind of problems id would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening   right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening   right i think that we ought to be  employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that and then if they say well im on drugs then they say well we would like rather have somebody that isnt on drugs   but a lot of times people who are on drugs dont admit it   thats right especially when theyre trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if theyre trying to get a job that if they put down that theyre on drugs theyre not gonna get it   right yeah i dont really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um if its gonna effect their job performance uh i think its reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh   right i guess depends on the job some jobs that depend on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains um things like that but i dont think SEPTA actually  does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea ive see a couple that look like they might be on drugs   right yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um   right but other well i dont know every job right i guess i dont know id would obviously an employer doesnt wanna have a person on drugs but if somebodys on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them out there on the street mugging people   thats true thats true you there has to be thats the thats the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just thats when you have to be careful you know you just cant   thats right   fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people   thats right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasnt that a person just didnt get a job that   right they can go and   if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then theyd if that were the case then theyd be always unemployed   right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance   so well some perhaps a program but i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and thats in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support   umhum   but on the other side hand its they need to be around people that have their lives together and arent on drugs they need to be you know people wouldnt be getting into trouble as much if they   true   especially young people here in Philadelphia   right   if they had  if they were so busy during the day that when they went um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep   right   so but if people are not working and theyre just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them into trouble   right yeah thats true yeah i dont know im thinking if from my perspective lets say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company     umhum   and if you put yourself in that situation you dont want to hire someone whos on cocaine   right are you in business   no but i i could its something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can id see the need for drug testing   uhhuh right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them   umhum   so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South Carolina and hiring people and you know even at fast food restaurants and um field work its the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who   right   i guess its kind of the old boy network maybe that isnt as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia   well uh right yeah you cant really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very   right   well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems   umhum yeah they can
