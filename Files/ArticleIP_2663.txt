                                 The Hunger            Food isnot the boss in my life I am stronger than the temptation of any food                           fromthe Richard Simmons home page                        Then again maybe notAmericans spend  billion a year on weightloss programs but obesity resiststreatment more tenaciously than do viruses percent to  percent of peoplewho lose weight eventually regain it            Why isthat Weve learned much in the last few years about the role that hunger playsin obesity Drug companies have capitalized on that knowledge to createpowerful new appetite suppressants But these cures come with serious risksResearchers linked the popular dietdrug combination fenphen to a rare heartdisease a year ago But doctors continued to prescribe it to millions arguingthat the health risks associated with obesity justified fenphens wide useNow reports of new heart abnormalities in women on fenphen raise freshquestions about using pills for obesity before all the facts are in            Scientists didnt always view appetite as a cause ofobesity The dominant thinking for more than two decades was that the obesegained weight because they burned fewer calories In experiments overfed orunderfed volunteers always returned to their original weightthesetpointwhen they ceased their diets Also when obese dieters lost weighttheir metabolism slowed conserving calories and driving their weight back tothe setpoint It seemed that obese peoples only option was a combination ofstarvation and exercise while skinny people got to feast and watch televisionIn the late s amphetamine which increases metabolism became the rage fordieters But it didnt keep the weight off and proved to be addictive            As itturned out thin people didnt have higher metabolic rates On highcaloriediets they gained weight just as easily as obese people In fact obesepeople had to eat more to put on a given amount of weight Themetabolism of obese dieters never slowed enough to explain how quickly theirweight bounced back They were also eating more Put simply even at theirbaseline weight obese people eat more than thin people            Swedish studies of pregnant women demonstratethis observation Women weighed about a pound more one year after delivery thanat the start of pregnancy Some gained more than a pound and many returned totheir old weight How were the gainers different from the nongainers Mainlythey ate more total calories especially in the form of snacks Althoughgainers ate lunch less often their snacking increased to three or more timesper day            The studyalso demonstrated another frustrating fact about setpointstheyre easier toincrease than decrease Experts believe that once youve put on extra weightfor six months to a year the setpoint resets as it does after pregnancy Topermanently lower the setpoint you must keep weight off for about three yearsperhaps longer Until recently nothing short of has kept the seriously obesefrom eating as much as they want to            The big breakthrough in understanding obesity came in when experiments on lab mice revealed that the hormone leptin controls thesetpoint by controlling satiety When your weight falls leptin decreaseshunger increases and you eat moreuntil you return to your weight setpointThis year researchers in Cambridge England found an inbred family whosemembers all lacked the gene for producing leptin Without leptin to signalsatiety the children in this family eat ravenously The yearold weighs pounds and the yearold  pounds            Theseleptin findings imply that hormones and neurotransmitters control theinstinctual desire to eat overwhelming willpower in the process Inevolutionary terms this makes sense The drive to find and eat food wasintegral to the survival of our early ancestors People who gorged themselvessurvived winter famines and reproduced more than others But this behaviorbecame maladaptive when access to roundtheclock hamburgers and ice creambecame the norm Now as we gain weight and push our setpoints upward we arereprogrammed to eat even more            The leptin breakthrough spurred efforts tomanipulate the brains hunger centers In  a combination of two drugsfenfluramine and phenterminefenphenwas shown to suppress appetite enoughto help the severely obese lose an average of  pounds after two yearsFenfluramine increases the brains serotonin levels Prozac does too but notas dramatically to produce a sense of satiety Phentermine is a relative ofamphetamine that reduces hunger and increases metabolism Not surprisinglywhen the obese patients stopped taking these drugs their weights returned tobaseline levels But fenphen was the first drug therapy proven to reduceweight over the long haul            Otherdrugs for the hyperhungry are on the way Dexfenfluramine tradenamed Redux acousin of fenfluramine was just released Sibutramine with fenphens effectsin one pill and orlistat which prevents fat absorption from the intestinesare undergoing Food and Drug Administration approval testing Leptin analogueschemical cousins are also being developed Effective hunger control willprobably require lifelong therapy with multiple drugs like these            The first warning that these drugs could pose health riskscame a year ago when the New England Journal of Medicine published anarticle by French researchers linking fenphen to a deadly cardiac diseasecalled primary pulmonary hypertension The study suggested that between  and of every  million patients taking fenphen would die from the conditioneach year At my hospital a young woman died from it after taking fenphenfor  days to lose weight for her wedding Yet the New England Journal ofMedicine downplayed the risks at the time It simultaneously published aneditorial speculating that fenphen would save more lives by reducing obesitythan the associated heart disease would kill            The Frenchfindings were basically ignored Eighteen million prescriptions were filled forfenphen in the United States last year Physicians opened offices and Internetsites to do nothing but prescribe fenphen and weightloss operations likeJenny Craig and NutriSystem placed fenphen prescriptionwriting doctors atthe center of their programs            Fenphen consumption began to fall only thismonth when the New England Journal of Medicine essentially withdrew itsearlier costbenefit argument with the emergency release of startling newfenphen findings Researchers in Minnesota and Nebraska documented  cases ofunusual heartvalve abnormalities in women taking fenphen The average age ofthe patients was  and five required valvereplacement surgery This weekthe FDA reported  new cases of abnormal heart valves in patients on fenphenand the Journal of the American Medical Association reported animalevidence linking both dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine to toxic braineffects            There are three reasons whynobody should have bought the obesityisdeadlier argument  Obesitys riskscome from high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes and heart diseaseeach of which can be controlled with safe medicines  The mildly overweightdont run these health risks yet drug companies are using results from pounders to sell drugs to  pounders who want to look good at the beach Even in the seriously obese we dont know that these drugs really will savemore than they kill because no studies have been done Meanwhile the druglobby is blocking the FDA from monitoring for bad outcomes after it approvesdrugs            Fenphen isnt our firstgoround with a miracle cure for obesity and it isnt likely to be our lastIn the late s doctors inflated a balloon device in obese patientsstomachs Because patients couldnt eat nearly as much they lost weight andkept it off But some of the balloons deflated and got stuck in the intestinesOnly after several people died was the device pulled off the market Thedieters craving for something to quiet their hunger is almost as great astheir craving for food
