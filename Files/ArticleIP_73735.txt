                                 Online Voter Registration A Big Little Ideanbsp            Onlinevoting is the killer app of Net politics The prospect of evoting isenthralling journalists including                   Slate                writers and  causinggovernments to fret about digital signatures and inspiring endless speculationabout how online ballots will eventually revolutionize politics It is the bigidea that will change voting a huge amount someday            But astartup called Newvotercom has a littleidea that could change voting a small amount now Its online voter registrationapplication could boost voter turnout and save grassroots organizations andcandidates money and effort            Onlinevoter registration at this point isnt quite what it sounds like You cannotregister to vote online The concern about digital signature verification thatis delaying online voting prevents online registration as well What you can donow however is register to register online If you are a Florida residentfor example you can go to a state Web site and complete the Florida voterregistration application  After you complete the online applicationFlorida mails you a voter registration form with your information alreadyfilled in You sign the form and return it to your county election supervisorIts not quite pointandclick registration but it does save voters a trip tothe library post office or department of motor vehicles Several companiesincluding Onlinedemocracycom and Electioncom want to sell such onlineregistration services to states            Ultimately online voter registration even in its current form is mostpromising not because it saves time and money for voters and governmentsthough it does Online registration really serves those who conduct voterregistration drives Grassroots organizations political parties andcandidates routinely spend enormous sums of money and time on voterregistration drives without any guarantee that they are helping their causeOrganizations that sign up voters cant stay in touch with them cant remindthe newly registered to vote and cant ensure that the new voters willremember their cause if they do vote A voter registration drive ishighmaintenance its laborintensive its higheffort says Mark Stramacofounder and CEO of Newvotercom And typically after you register someoneto vote in the field you lose touch with them            Newvotercom proposes to change that The company offers itself as a kind ofonline registration middleman Instead of conducting its own voter registrationcampaign a candidate or organizationlets say for conveniences sakeGreenpeacebuys Newvotercoms application and puts it up on its own home pageAny person who visits the Greenpeace Web site will be encouraged to register tovote            Thecompanys application which is currently available at the Rock the Votesite for what Strama calls atest run follows the Florida model described above except thatNewvotercoms online application form can be used for  states and theDistrict of Columbia Mississippi New Hampshire North Dakota and Wyomingare the exceptions After completing Newvotercoms online form voters aremailed a printed registration form and an envelope addressed to their localelection office They proofread it sign it add a stamp and drop it in themail            Newvotercoms innovation is to keep track of registrants When Greenpeaceregisters a voter at a concert or on a campus it loses touch with herimmediately But if she registers on Greenpeaces Web site Newvotercom andGreenpeace can stay in contact with her Five days after Newvotercom mails theofficial registration form to the voter she receives an email reminding herto look for the form and noting that she is not registered to vote until it issigned and returned Six weeks before the election an email arrives askingher if she plans to be in town for the election and providing instructions foracquiring an absentee ballot One week before the election she receives acustomized getoutthevote email Newvotercom will also allow voters to joina mailing list sponsored by the organization or candidatethe reminder emailsare sent directly by Newvotercomallowing Greenpeace to mail her too            Newvotercom hasnt brought its service to the market yet or even settled onits exact business planStrama says a big announcement is coming soonbut thecompany plans to sell its service to grassroots political organizations andcandidates across the political spectrum            Strama who was Rock the Votes director of programs thinks Newvotercom ismore likely to boost voter turnout than either traditional voter drives ormotorvoter registration People who register to vote when they are engaged bya political Web site are more likely to turn out than folks who register whilewaiting in line at the DMV And people are more likely to vote if they arereminded close to Election Day about the issue that made them register in thefirst place Its not going to revolutionize politics but it may send a fewmore people to the polls to cast a ballot for a cause they care about
