marriageA person is either married or not like being pregnant While the father can befriendly and caring to his daughters livein boyfriend he is not a soninlawand shouldnt be treated as such Call me oldfashioned but I believecommitment means marriage Anything less is just dating                                       Happily Married                                       MsDuffy Lewis

together does not equal marriage Commitmenthowever need not involve marriage Prudie knows committed couples whoserelationships have all the ingredients of a really good marriage and allthats missing are recognition from the state and contractual obligationPrudie in fact can speak of this with firsthand knowledge            The ageand experience of the couple may be a factor A committed relationship betweentwentysomethings would of course have different underpinnings than onebetween middleaged people who have had perhaps a marriage or two under theirbelts

would like to suggest a differentsolution for Dorothy S on the subject of bad breath TicTacs                                       Keepsome on your person and when confronting the foul offender produce them popa few into your mouth and offer them to the coworker It may not work butIve always gone by the rule If someone offers you a TicTac take itTheyre also nice because they are not quite as blatant as breath mints but getthe job done                                       Hopefully Helpfully                                       RKriger                                       BrooklineMass                        DearHope            Prudiethanks you for your diplomatic ideaand guesses the TicTac people do too Asthe Brits might say your approach is brilliant It being only polite to offera companion what one is oneself ingesting you will have spared the offenderembarrassment and with any luck caused the smellable breath to be suckedaway            Prudie refreshingly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I ammarried to a very nice man   years older than I The problem is I dont lovehim Ive tried to explain this to him but he just keeps apologizing forthings I feel like Im living with my brother By the way Hubby is  andIm  He makes me feel old before my time and embarrasses me often inpublic He also lost a very good paying job shortly after marriage and nowwere in debt up to our eyeballs How can I make him understand I wantout                                       Please Help                        DearPlea            With thisannouncement I am filing for divorce If its really a nohoper you must beassertive and spare both of you more years of unhappiness If Prudie soundslenient regarding divorcing it is because she herself has lost more than onehusband  in divorce court Life is too short my dear to continue with ahusband who feels like a brother makes you feel old embarrasses you and hasput you both in debt            Prudieexperientially                                             Prudie                                                      I was recently at arestaurant and when the bill came the waitress had written at the bottomSuggested tip  percent Then when the credit card slip came thesuggested tip had been written in I was appalled for so many reasons that she had to put a suggested tip as if I didnt know and that she put ithigher than normal the service certainly was not above and beyond the call ofduty and that she further did not give the option of a lower tip                                       Whatdoes Prudie suggest in such a situation I have no problem with the extra percent above the norm but to have it forced on me in such a forward mannerseemed extremely rude                                       Peeved in Palo AltoCalif                        DearPeev            Everyone knows that arestaurant waitstaff has many jobs but giving instructions for the amount ofthe tip is not one of them Prudie would give anything to know what you didcaught off guard as you were She hopes that you thought fast and lined throughthe notation and wrote in what you wanted to leave            You wouldnot have been out of line to have brought this aggressive and offputtingaction to the attention of the owner or manager whichever one was present thatnight For future reference should a serving person deliver substandardservice the diner is perfectly within his or her rights to specify no tipThis way it is clear that the lack of a tip is neither an oversight normiserliness but a reminder that a tip is a voluntary thankyou for goodservice            Prudie gratuitously
