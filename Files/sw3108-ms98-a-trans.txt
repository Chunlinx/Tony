        well what movie have you seen recently Valerie     lets see the last one we saw was Thelma and Louise   oh we havent seen that one yet   well dont bother  well oh from a womans point of view and it was very uh   oh it wasnt that good hey   chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i dont think the general audience would would go for it   oh well the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the City Slicker   how was that   that was excellent it was just a really   that is one ive been dying to see   a really funny movie at the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion   uhhuh uhhuh and   and but it was just entertaining all around entertaining   how how long did that movie run   uh its still on to the best of my knowledge   but i mean uh time wise how long was it two hour or   oh uh its i think its less than two hours   uhhuh okay okay   i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever   oh that always seems to happen when you rent them you know   yes but this one it was fairly long i im guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe   uhhuh uhhuh and uh it   but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby uh   was it oh good uhhuh   who was the oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy   oh great   so we really enjoyed that   oh well im looking forward to seeing that one that was next on our list so uh   yes i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see   okay okay good deal good deal do you rent movies very often or   yeah uh  we generally rent a couple a week uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend youve got to rent it on Thursday   right right thats exactly right   its so they get they get taken up at the store so   uhhuh uhhuh   we will rent two or three movies on Thursday and uh with luck youll have one or two that are good   better get yeah right right   most of them are a coin flip   oh oh God yeah yeah and we usually have oh we dont get out as much as wed like we have two children so we  occasionally get out to the movies but uh   yeah   its its fun its a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once   yeah well quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and uh well try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and   uhhuh uhhuh and what ages are they have you found trouble finding movies for them or   but uh uh generally we try to stay in the at least PG range the uh   right   the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesnt really pay attention and the five year old doesnt have the attention span either but the   yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh   the nine year old will watch anything thats on TV   uhoh uhoh   yeah so   yeah they have been doing that weve been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see the last one they saw was Home Alone and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so   yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but   uhhuh   we can generally find something at the store for them to watch   yeah yeah well thats a good deal   the uh oh we saw this movie Presumed Innocent was the one we rented uh last weekend Harrison Ford   okay let me think if i have rented that one Harrison Ford and how does the story line go   its uh he is a prosecuting attorney and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered   oh okay we havent seen that one   and hes trying to find it and its of course its one of these with a twist where it looks like hes the one that wound up killing her so its and its an extremely long movie its over two hours long   uhhuh uhhuh oh gosh oh gosh   which uh my wife enjoy she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree   uhhuh i think thats the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasnt going to be able to watch it with me so i thought i better save that one for another day   because its save that for another day   yeah because i think hed like that one you enjoyed that one then   yeah yeah i think you its uh its something i think you would enjoy yes its   uhhuh okay well thats a good one to put on the list   it its like most suspense movies what was it was on TV recently um Fatal Attraction   uhhuh   its one that once youve seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really cant see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so   right okay uhhuh uhhuh okay   once once you seen one thats a suspenseful type movie like that then its its not good for a second watching particularly   uhhuh uhhuh   at least i dont think so   yeah well yeah i dont think too many of them are anymore its its a shame but uh yeah   i dont know weve watched Weekend at Bernies any number of times  its just slapstick comedy   oh no  oh no  oh     sit there and laugh and my one grandson and i my wife cant understand it but we like Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure   oh gosh you know it yeah weve heard about that one but we havent seen that one either  so well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies   which is another funny one yeah we like to laugh   oh God     oh i i have a theory  i like movies for entertainment i dont want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie   right right right i agree i agree   lifes depressing enough   thats for sure     well ive certainly enjoyed talking with you okay bye   well you too Jim thanks for punching in and uh i hope you see a good movie soon   have have a nice weekend okay bye   okay byebye
