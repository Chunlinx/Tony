                child care or   uh no actually im still single   are you   yeah but my mom uh she teaches at a uh child care center   oh does she what   yeah uh youve heard of Kinder Care   yeah i have   yeah its a big chain she uh she teaches up in uh up in the Washington area   uhhuh   matter of fact its a pretty big business   yeah it is my wife teaches is teaches at this uh little small family owned one here in Utah but uh   uhhuh   i dont know what do you think about it     do they have a lot of those up in Utah     uh they do actually theres quite a few and getting more and more seems like   yeah theyre theyre growing really really fast i remember uh i i worked with a bunch of people uh uh for the summer and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her daughter in child care and it was the the competition is pretty fierce you know   umhum yeah   uh some places uh charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities   umhum   some places are like really cheap but uh you know they like have a its like a home or something an old home they just hire a bunch of people and have a big yard and let the kids play back there   yeah uhhuh play all day   yeah and   so what was she looking for when she was out around     well she was um she was looking for something cheap obviously uh someone to take care of her kid but that at the same time she didnt want you know some people that were like a bunch of teenagers you know   yeah yeah   just out there working because some people do that theyll just go to high school or something get some kids who work for five dollars an hour and get them out there and thats all they really care about you know   uhhuh yeah   but uh some places like uh they have uh they set up a gym you know like a jungle gym and uh they they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and its really for the yuppies   yeah yeah yeah well my wife i mean they they have a prepared you know little school school type lessons for them and stuff but   umhum   but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesnt go over too well she       shes not too set on the whole thing i mean its a job for her she has to take it but   yeah   uh shes not too shed rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her kids   hum yeah my uh thats thats what uh what my mom you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone uh whos willing to take care of the person whos willing to take care of the kids that that uh you know that you can trust   if she had to umhum yeah   thats probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i i dont know if you saw the thing on uh some news i think on ABC one time they was showing how people the some of the people were just smacking the kids around you know   yeah yeah her yeah well that was and that was what really kind kind of scared us is because well we we have a daughter and she goes with her but shes in a different class and my wife will poke her head downstairs and shell see the lady screaming at the kids and stuff and im just going wait a minute you know i mean   umhum um     shes a year and half you you know eighteen months old   umhum yeah   you cant be screaming at them too much but   yeah really   it seems uh i dont know i was pretty im not i i dont like them i think   how many kids do you have   we just have one just a little daughter eighteen months and   just one yeah   i said i its the only reason you know she the only reason we have my wife working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise its   umhum is it expensive up there   well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think were pretty cheap i heard once that like out in Boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah   yeah it it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in Washington called Intelsat   umhum   and uh the building also house WJLA and they had a it was the child care facility was on one of the floors in the building   umhum umhum   and uh they would charge i think the rate was eight hundred dollars a month for child care but the convenience was that the kid was in the same building as you were and it was a and   gee yeah but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay eight hundred bucks out of your income   oh yeah  oh yeah oh yeah but uh the the child care facility was really top notch they had uh the where the kids were was i mean the right above it was an executive uh room for the WJLA right below it was an executive room for WJLA and its all glass   yeah uhhuh oh really   so i mean theres really nothing they couldnt do they could do that uh you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under uh you know uh supervision   yeah uhhuh yeah   and since uh the building was built on a park on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and   umhum yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think thats   oh yeah i mean you can go visit your kids during the day you know and see see how theyre doing   yeah go have lunch with them and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool   yeah   but   but anyway well i think we got our three minutes   yeah hey well its been good talking to you     hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye   all right see you later bye bye
