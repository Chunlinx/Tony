        all right you want to start out     well itll be real easy for us because were both my husband and i are vegetarians so yeah so thats the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not     oh are you really oh are you strict vegetarians   were not vegan vegetarians we do were ovolacto we do eat uh eggs and and milk products i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where i didnt eat any animal products at all   uhhuh umhum umhum   but um it was its really difficult in the area if you dont have you know the products that you can get and if you go out to dinner theres virtually you know theres not a whole lot of things you can get   theres very few places that you ill bet that you could uh   yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that   uhhuh umhum   you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something   umhum yeah and you wouldnt have the meat products in that and some   but yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the restaurants here they will you know like you can ask them and theyll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   so but so thats that we dont really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a have we have a healthier diet than the average person   yeah uhhuh how long have you been doing  this   um ive been a vegetarian for uh two years now my husband has been one for oh just over a year now and uh so   uhhuh do you feel that it has improved the way you feel   definitely and it it makes you more aware of what youre eating because you you have to be i mean you you  i think you   you think umhum umhum   you you balance the foods uh you know youre more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals and youre just more aware of food for energy for energy sake   umhum umhum i always thought it would be be hard to figure out what to eat if you were a vegetarian how how   well thats just it you you do have to figure it out and and you know to get proteins and things and when i was a vegan its you know you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you youre not even getting through your milk products your egg products   yeah umhum uhhuh because you dont eat any of those things   if you dont eat any of those but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables i mean there are  there are there are you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products a lot of people dont know that well the thing is that milk products our bodies dont uh   is that right uhhuh   dont uh the the lactose that kind of milk it doesnt our we we tend to uh whats it called we dont synthesize the the calcium the same way   uhhuh we throw more of it off our body out other words   yeah we we slough some of it we we send we send some of it out because it our body doesnt accept some of it   umhum   so were not utilizing were when it when it gets rid of some of that um that we cant use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium   umhum   whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utilize your your body accepts all of the broccoli   umhum all thats in it uhhuh   so its like its like say a person using vitamins as opposed to uh vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food   why uhhuh   your body just doesnt accept vitamins and the minerals in the the vitamins in   uhhuh   uh supplements that it does in regular food you know so but we both we both feel much healthier much healthier and i couldnt consider going back to eating   thats interesting uhhuh after you have been on this     yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my husband   yeah uhhuh   has changed he feels more ethically about it but he he in the beginning began for health reasons   umhum   but um now he he feels like i do that he looks at the things that he eats and he realizes what they are before he eats them and he you know   uhhuh uhhuh he thinks more about them then   yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating   umhum   you know as far as a living creature and now we both think a lot of well what is it were eating in relation to what its going to give to our bodies too so   umhum umhum so you kind of have a combination   umhum yeah   uhhuh now see we i live in a farming community   umhum   so of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area     well we do too i mean i was raised in um were in cattle country and people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer you know and that   umhum umhum oh yeah yeah   thats the way i and i believe you me it wasnt easy to give up to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite foods was was a was a good steak or a hamburger but           uhhuh   you know i suppose if you really believe in something its you you adjust your life because your mind you your you inside yourself you just its not right   you get adjusted to the taste umhum umhum umhum   so but um   umhum so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most   oh yes   most people would   yeah   now we wouldnt have that problem  because were not vegetarians   so what do you look for when you   uh i think the main thing that i look for is uh cleanliness uh you know the in the appearance of the people that work there and the uh quality of the food that they serve   uhhuh do you normally when youre traveling do you look for places thats established that that youve been to before or are you willing to try new places   if oh we try new places but when we a lot of times we do eat where we know     yeah like a chain restaurant or something   what umhum what the quality because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop   umhum   and uh we do do that a lot and i guess im getting old older  also i like to be served  i like to sit down and have my uh order taken   as opposed to like a cafeteria kind of   right   situation yeah   so i suppose youd say i well i i dont know whether its age or what it is but i have   well no i dont think so i think its just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if youre going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole   yeah yeah   i guess because we dont go out that much i feel like its a treat   umhum you should feel have a treat and i like the light meals not all restaurants have light meals on their menu   yeah uhhuh   you know and i   oh light menu you mean like cooked light or   uh L I T E like uh uh things that arent as heavy a meal   oh i see uhhuh   it that you get more uh fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that arent as uh theyre not breaded and theyre not fried and theyre not   not a lot of gravy and things like that you know i i like those too i like those too because uh some seems like sometimes its   yeah uh but not all restaurants uhhuh   you order a meal you order their dinner meal and its like theyre trying to find out how much you can eat or or   i know its too much yes     or or like evidently people go in there and theyre not satisfied that theyd been given enough and they complain and maybe theyre afraid that people are going to complain or something i   umhum i dont know what it is but now for instance we we had a Scout dinner last night we went to and its its they uh well theyll serve you at your seat and usually usually the salad bar is included so you have to get up for that but they have so much food that you not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself you end up eating much more than you need   uhhuh and i think thats a shame i mean i must admit sometimes i do like a buffet but uh but i think that they just tend to make you you say oh well ive have got all i can eat or or you know its one of these situations where   uhhuh uhhuh   nobodys going to restrain what you eat the amount that you eat and i think that people that we just tend to eat overeat yeah   umhum uhhuh yeah you can eat as much as you want and you like the food you know   yeah   uh a lot of times the foods like uh Haass carry a bread bar that is just out of this world  and you know you and soup and uh they just and fruit and vegetables and they they just   yeah   i dont know that you i know i always overeat no matter i go with good intentions       but i somehow along the way when i come back to my seat i have too much  and i eat it  because its so good   yeah well at least its fruit and stuff there maybe its not too bad   yeah   and i like reasonable prices of course too i dont like to you know go to anything thats real expensive   yeah   i think thats a waste of my money   just for food it does seem like it   umhum umhum   yeah but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like cooking we like Indian food and uh i love Italian food and   so do you uhhuh uhhuh   uh Chinese uh   Chinese weve got a good Chinese restaurant in town i i really like eating there and   yeah   and you dont get stuffed on their food it seems   yeah   you know you can eat a whole big plate of their food and you really dont feel like youve eaten too much   yeah   youre full you know youre satisfied but you dont feel stuffed and miserable   yeah yeah thats one thing that i wish we had more of uh because where were from its its pretty limited and its most of the restaurants are oh they tend to be you know American style food and we dont have too many where you have to go all the way to Dallas   umhum um   and so really is a treat because uh you know we dont make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in Dallas it is   so yeah yeah
