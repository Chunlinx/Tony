                                 Songs We Feel With            Once upon a time a man wasin his apartment waiting to go out on a date to which he was looking forwardwith pleasure Unexpectedly it began to rain For a moment this depressed himBut soon these words came tripping through his brain Isnt it a lovely day tobe caught in the rain He could see Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a gazeboin Central Park with the rain pitterpattering around them He was happyagain            Once uponanother time a man perhaps not the same man was expecting someone for whomhe cared to return from a brief trip When he saw her he spontaneously began tosing softly Well hello Dolly Hello Dolly Its so nice to have you backwhere you belong He felt warmth and joy He experienced the joy that shoneout of the face of Louis Armstrong when he sang that in the movie            At an earlier time a man who was lonely used to findrunning through his head a song that went Sometimes I wonder why I spend eachlonely night dreaming of a song Those words consoled him As the song saidhe found his consolation in the stardust of a song The song reminded him thathe was not alone in his loneliness and that made it seem not so bad            One moreexample of a different type There was a man who had frequent occasion todrive north and south along Route  in Virginia At some point he would seethe Blue Ridge Mountains to the west and he would begin to sing to himselfThe mountains the mountains we greet them with a song his college anthemRecalling that song gave him a sweet sad nostalgic feeling of youth goneby            These little stories are all about theassociation of certain songs with certain emotions They raise the samequestion What was causing what To concentrate on the first story did the manin question think of Isnt it a lovely day because he was happy or was hehappy because he thought of that song He didnt have to think of that songwhen the rain began He could have thought of Stormy weather cant go oneverything I had is gone He didnt have to think of any song at all            I dont know which causedwhich I am not Freud But I think the answer is some of each That seems tobe my answer to most questions The man recalled the song because he was happyand he was happy because he recalled the song Many factors led to his beinghappy in the rain One of them was the song He might have been happy withoutit But retrieving that song from his memory bank helped to articulate hishappiness intensify it and prolong it            Ofcourse there was something about this man that led him to store that song inhis memory bank so it could be recalled when appropriate years after he firstencountered it It was something about how this man was in his late teens andhis s before the business of daily life crowded out room for taking in newimpressions from songs But still if that song had not been written or if hehad not heard it at an impressionable age his reaction would have beendifferent when the rain fell            For people of my generation the key years were the s andsthe era of Bing Crosby Ethel Merman Fred and Ginger Irving BerlinCole Porter Ah Wilderness I do not share the songs that are in the memorybanks of my childrenthe Beatles and Bob Dylanalthough I understand them alittle I do not understand the songs of my grandchildren at all            How peoplewill react to particular circumstances is not ordained at birth It is learnedin part by experience and the songs that people absorb are part of theexperience that guides their reactions Not only songs have that effect Amongother things snatches of poetry do too Sometimes when it is very cold I findmyself saying St Agnes EveAh bitter chill it was and I am back in mysophomore year at college with Romantic Poetry of the Early  thCentury  in a very cold college town            Some people insist they dont know what theythink until they hear what they say So there are people who dont know whatthey feel until they listen to the songs or poetry that are in their heart Idont suppose that everyone is like that I suppose that there are people whofeel happiness or sorrow or jealousy or triumph directly without anycombination of words either remembered or made up for the purpose            Knowing your emotions areshaped by songs you heard  years ago is a little troubling It makes youwonder whether your emotions are really yours or whether they are really IrvingBerlins set down with music to make a buck It makes you wonder who is thereal you As my Aunt Gertrude used to say about Oakland theres no therethere and maybe theres no real you in your emotions either            But I dont believe thatWhen I say Ive got the sun in the morning and the moon at night theres abig dose of Ethel Merman but also some of me
