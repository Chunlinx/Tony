                okay Charles uh gun control what are you uh for in favor or no comment   im very much in favor of gun control   oh you are   yes i am   well this should be very interesting because im against it     i dont i dont mind people owning guns i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated   well you know uh now here heres something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons   yes   uh now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons   i believe thats correct uhhuh   and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be have we should have stronger laws and what not   umhum   i dont understand why we dont enforce the laws we have   that would certainly help im sure   now this is not just a state law this is a federal law controlled by the Treasury Department   umhum yep   uh for fully automatic weapons and uh all right now for instance in California where they passed the uh   umhum   uh semi automatic or or uh now what was it they called them   umhum   the military version attack weapons or something   yeah right uhhuh   uh how how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles that are automatic or semi automatic   umhum yep i really dont have any problem Jack with you know uh people using firearms for sporting purposes i dont have any problem the only thing i i am in favor of the seven day waiting period i would like to see that see that happen i   uhhuh well now uh ive got to admit im inclined to agree with you there   umhum   uh even though i am a member of the NRA and they are against they their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon ones going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on   umhum right yeah i understand that   and youve got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way   umhum thats true i i like i say i dont have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think its just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one on on a whim of some sort   uh that thats true uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in Virginia   im not sure i have   uh it its its a little hard to believe but they can uh of course like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law anyone ever convicted of a a felony is cannot purchase a weapon   umhum   and they dont have a waiting period because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons and the uh when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in uh uh Virginia   umhum   the salesman just calls some number and uh punches in your name and if it comes up negative okay fine and you get your gun your gun right then and there   i see   uh but they are the only state that does it   hm thats interesting   and uh according to Virginia it didnt cost all that much   umhum   and frankly i i dont understand why a state doesnt have those records available anyway uh uh at least   yeah yeah you would think they would   uh records of of uh known felons  which are available to local police departments   umhum yeah right yeah im surprised that more states doesnt do that   uh uh uh certainly those those records are available and all they would have to do is expand it   umhum yeah right   to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow   umhum i wouldnt think itd be that difficult to do   well Virginia is not a particularly rich state and they managed to find squeak out a few bucks to do it   yep right   and uh its uh uh one hundred percent successful   hm thats interesting   yeah i just heard about this last week uh they were bragging about it with uh uh   yeah   they should have have pride in this because its its a good system and its working well   absolutely yeah i agree   and they dont need that seven day waiting period   uhhuh   because the whole idea of that waiting period was so that uh it uh the police could check up on you   yep   well you know whats going to happen there those files are going to back up on somebodys desk just a that typical bureaucratic work   umhum   thats another uh uh thorn in my side bureaucratics   uhhuh yeah right i agree yep right   politicians   i was just thinking theres   so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against   yeah i guess thats about right   although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool       uh we but we both   uh yeah im not totally rigid on the subject i just think there should be you know shouldnt be quite so easy to do   well there should be some way of checking now here in in Texas uh all you need is a drivers license   uhhuh right umhum   and uh even felons can still get a drivers license   sure   so i i dont think they are too       well theyre not rigid enough here in Texas   yeah thats true   but dont tell the NRA i said that   i wont i promise i wont  okay i promise   theyre liable to tear up my membership         you say you retired a year ago   yes i did uhhuh   im looking forward to it in about a just just over a year myself   yeah i rea lly enjoy it i stay pretty busy   uh uhhuh   i do quite a not quite a lot i do some uh volunteer work here in Plano i i have a few uh handicapped persons that i you know try to do things for help them do   oh uhhuh well uh i bought a motor home here four four years ago and i have been living in it ever since and im looking forward to just traveling   uhhuh thats uh sure i can understand that   i have four sons scattered all over the country and a few few grandchildren and im looking forward to just traveling around visiting them
