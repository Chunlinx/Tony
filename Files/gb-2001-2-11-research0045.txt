                    Background        The organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic        nucleus has been a subject of great interest as it is        likely to impact on important processes such as        recombination   and epigenetic mechanisms of gene        control   Early observations by Rabl cited by   in        plants suggested a preferential polarization of        chromosomes with their centromeres clustered at one end of        the nuclear envelope the apical side and the telomeres at        the opposite end the basal side More recently evidence        from fluorescence         in situ hybridization FISH studies        in different systems has suggested that various genomic        loci can be found consistently in specific regions of the        nucleus   and that subnuclear location can be        correlated with gene activity   Together with results        from realtime measurements with living cells   these        studies argue for a structured organization of        chromosomes        The present model we have of chromatin organization        within the nucleus is a dynamic one with territories for        each chromosome defined by their relative location to each        other   During the mitotic cycle chromosomes are        duplicated in the S phase and pulled to the two daughter        cells during M phase Chromosome territories are        reestablished after cell division and once the cell is        arrested in a long interphase chromosome movement becomes        restricted again   Some nucleustonucleus variations        in the exact position of each locus relative to the rest of        the genome can be expected   As some random        organization within each territory is possible   there        is also likely to be timedependent positional differences        in the relative coordinates of each locus within a single        nucleus   These predicted nucleustonucleus        variations and the mobility of the established territories        within the nuclei of various cell types in eukaryotes        remain poorly defined in most systems        So far most         in situ studies of gene positioning        and changes in higherorder chromatin architecture have        been carried out using FISH This method can produce        artifacts however because it requires the fixation and        permeabilization of cells and denaturation of chromatin        before hybridization with labeled singlestrand probes          It is also very difficult to perform kinetic studies        with FISH to track the dynamics of chromatin movement in a        single nucleus Recent advances in the application of green        fluorescent protein GFP as an         in vivo tag of specific chromosomal        regions promises to revolutionize our ability to observe        chromatinbased processes in near realtime   This        technique first established by Andrew Belmont and        collaborators   entails the construction of a fusion        protein between GFP and the DNAbinding domain DBD of a        known heterologous transcription factor The binding site        for the DBD is multimerized into a concatameric array which        is then inserted into the genome of animal or yeast cells        Expression of the GFPDBD fusion protein results in        fluorescent tagging of the concatamer         in situ  This provides a beacon        that allows one to track the position of this region in the        genome with high specificity and sensitivity In yeast and        animal cells a single concatamer insert can be visualized        with high resolution and fidelity and the application of        this technique has provided new insights on chromosome        behavior            These findings might however be true only for the few        cell types and yeast strains studied so far and may not be        generally applicable to all eukaryotic cells For example        even though chromosome territories showed only small        movements during an observation period of several hours          they may show larger movements over longer time periods        such as days Also the degree of nuclear order appears to        depend on the particular cell type   Earlier        application of this technology in multicellular organisms        involved extrachromosomal arrays of the         lac operator created in         C elegans by coinjecting plasmids        containing the operator array and GFP sequences along with        other constructs   The samples were fixed for        immunological detection and the sizes as well as stability        of the arrays studied remain undefined Thus application        of that technique to study chromatin behavior may be rather        limited Very recently Vazquez         et al   applied this technology        in dissected         Drosophila spermatocytes from animals        that have integrated the         lac operator arrays at        cytogenetically defined genomic loci Realtime monitoring        of chromosome movement in this specialized cell type        indicated that progression through G dramatically        restricts the slower longrange component of chromatin        movement This study provided the first direct evidence for        cellcycle control of chromatin movement and elegantly        illustrated the power of this technology in transgenic        organisms to facilitate the understanding of chromosome        behavior in a developmental context        The model plant         Arabidopsis offers an excellent        system in which to apply this new technology for the study        of chromatin organization and dynamics Aside from being        easily transformable and having a well characterized genome          it is relatively easy to track cell types and        individual cells One can easily distinguish one cell from        another and individual cells can be tracked for a week or        more   In the present work we have successfully        adapted the GFP beacon approach to create the necessary        tools and transgenic lines for visualizing stably inserted        concatameric sites in the genome in live         Arabidopsis plants This material and        technology should open up new opportunities for        characterizing the physical organization and movement of        chromosomes in the nuclei of         Arabidopsis                     Results and discussion                  Vector construction and molecular characterization          of transgenic Arabidopsis          To control accumulation of           lac repressor LacI proteins in          plant nuclei a glucocorticoidinducible gene expression          system pTA was used for vector construction            A gene encoding a plantoptimized GFP variant           mGFP   was placed in frame          with a           LacI SV nuclear localization          signal fusion            GFPLacINLS    and then          subcloned into the vector pTA under the control of          the glucocorticoid receptor GRresponsive promoter near          the left border The resulting plasmid is designated as          pEL At the other end of the pTA vector we          inserted  copies of the           lac operator sequence            LacOs   kb and designated          this second vector pEL Figure a The entire plasmid          of pEL encompasses about  kilobases kb and the          size of the integrating region flanked by the right and          left borders of the Ti plasmid is about  kb The          plasmid was designed such that the DNA between the right          and left borders can be transferred into plant nuclei via                    Agrobacterium   Thus when          stable transgenic           Arabidopsis plants are treated with          the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone Dex the          expressed fusion proteins would be able to localize to          the integrated loci by association with           LacOs  This inducible expression          system allows controlled expression of a small amount of          GFPLacINLS protein for optimal signaltonoise and to          prevent aggregation of GFP fusion proteins in the nuclei          as a result of high protein concentrations As Belmont          and coworkers    reported that the           LacOs is unstable in a          recombinationcompetent bacterial strain we are          concerned with the stability of           LacOs in the           Agrobacterium strain that is used          to transform           Arabidopsis  Thus we examined the          stability of           LacOs in the           Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain          GVMP by Southern blot analysis after          transformation We found that the           LacOs may be unstable in           Agrobacterium initially as many          colonies examined turned out to contain truncated arrays          that are less than  kb the size of the original           LacOs in pEL Figure b lanes           and  We found however that colonies that do show the          proper size array can be maintained for at least  days          at C in liquid culture without a significant reduction          of the array size Figure b lane  Thus we first          monitored the size of           LacOs in our           Agrobacterium culture before          transforming           Arabidopsis with colonies carrying          fulllength or near fulllength           LacOs           We observed low transformation efficiency of           Arabidopsis with           Agrobacterium carrying pEL under          our transformation conditions  of that with          pEL data not shown We speculate that a large TDNA          region approximately  kb andor the presence of a          large number of tandem repeats of           LacOs in the TDNA region may          contribute to the low efficiency of gene transfer After          we obtained several independent lines that grew on          selection plates containing hygromycin we used Southern          blot analysis to determine the size of the           LacOs and the relative copy number          of the inserted TDNAs in the transformed lines           Pst I digestion of genomic DNA from          the transgenic lines which should release the          fulllength           LacOs  kb from the integrated          TDNA inserts was hybridized with a probe consisting of           copies of the           lac operator sequence Thus in          this analysis each fragment should correspond to the          size of an integrated           lac operator array          We detected several bands of different apparent sizes          on the Southern blot Figure  indicating that arrays          with different numbers of           lac operator sequences were          integrated into the genome in each of the lines examined          Figure shows data from analysis of two independently          transformed lines One line is designated ELC and          showed hybridizing bands with apparent sizes of          approximately   and  kb The second is designated          ELE and DNA from this line showed a single band of          approximately  kb that hybridized with the           lac operator probe Southern          analysis with homozygous plants from the fifthgeneration          progenies of both lines also showed similar signals          data not shown These results indicated that the           LacOs could be truncated before or          during integration into the           Arabidopsis genome but the          integrated genes were subsequently stable in the plant          genome For simplicity we will refer to the integration          site as a tagged locus          The copy numbers of insertions in these lines were          estimated with restriction digests of genomic DNA using           Bgl II and           Hind III in addition to           Pst I followed by Southern blot          analysis using the           LacINLS fragment as a probe          Figures   Using this probe we should detect          fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage upstream of the                    LacINLS sequence in the inserts as          well as restriction sites present at variable distances          in the genomic DNA neighboring the left border of the          insertions Thus each fragment detected in the Southern          blot probably corresponds to a distinct copy of the          transferred DNA that has integrated into the genome          Clustered integrations will however be more difficult          to analyze in cases where a large number of insertions          are present in the particular transgenic line and          digestions with multiple restriction enzymes will be          necessary to ascertain the structure of the insertion          loci Our results from digestions with three different          restriction enzymes suggest that there are three          insertions in the ELC line and a single insertion in          the ELE line per haploid genome consistent with the          data obtained with the           lac operator probe Figure                           Dexamethasoneinducible expression of GFP fusion          protein          Western blot analysis with antiGFP polyclonal          antibodies Clonetech was used to test inducibility of          GFPLacINLS in transgenic plants We analyzed homozygous          transgenic plants from two independent lines ELC and          ELE as well as a line from our control vector          ELS This latter was transformed with pEL which is          identical to pEL except for the absence of           LacOs  As pEL does not contain          the           LacOs  the transgenic line ELS          can be used as a negative control for specific          association of GFPLacINLS with the           LacOs in our experimental system          In this line we expect the accumulation of GFPLacINLS          proteins in the nuclei after induction but specific          binding of the fusion protein to chromatin should be          absent We treated transgenic seedlings with an excess          concentration of Dex  M in  ml water to achieve          uniform induction Samples were collected at                and  hours after the treatment and proteins          were extracted in sodium dodecyl sulfate SDScontaining          buffer for immunological detection of GFP fusion          proteins          We found that boiling the plant material in the          extraction buffer resulted in loss of all GFP signals on          our western blots This appears to be a result of          aggregation of GFPLacINLS fusion proteins with some          insoluble materials in plant cells as we do not encounter          this problem with recombinant GFPLacINLS produced in          bacteria data not shown To circumvent this problem we          omitted the heating step in our protein sample          preparation and antiGFP crossreacting proteins can be          readily detected in our assay Western blot signals were          first detected  hours after the addition of Dex and          increased over time in all three lines Figure  After           hours the detection levels did not change          significantly and comparison between the three lines          revealed that the Dexinducible system in each line          performed similarly with and without truncated           LacOs  and minimal leakiness of          the promoter was observed before induction Although the          predicted size of GFPLacINLS fusion protein is  kDa          we detected several signals between  to  kDa in          addition to a major species of around  kDa on our blots          for all lines over time after  hours The cause of this          size heterogeneity of our GFP fusion protein is unclear          at present                          In situdetection of the tagged loci in transgenic          plants          We then examined nucleus labeling by GFP after Dex          treatment in homozygous transgenic plants from lines          ELC and E with           LacOs  and line ELS without           LacOs  by fluorescence microscopy          Each line was collected at the same time points as for          the western blot analysis and GFP fluorescence was          observed with appropriate filters All lines examined          showed fluorescence in nuclei  hours after the treatment          Figure  rows A The intensities of GFP fluorescence          in nuclei were increased by  hours and stabilized after           hours in all lines These responses were correlated          with the results of the western blot analysis Both          western blot analysis and microscopy studies confirmed          that the           LacOs does not interfere with          glucocorticoidinducible expression          To investigate the response of the tagged loci we          observed each nucleus with threedimensional fluorescence          microscopy If the system functions properly we should          be able to detect the tagged loci as bright spots above          the GFP background signals in nuclei of the lines ELC          and E and should not detect any spot in line ELS          because of the absence of           LacOs  Bright spots were clearly          observed above the diffused GFP fluorescence in nuclei          observed  h after induction in lines ELC and E          whereas significant fluorescence spots above the diffuse          background signals were not observed in ELS Figure           rows B The spots were detected with similar          signaltobackground ratios until the end of the time          course  h after induction for lines ELC and E          whereas line ELS did not show any spots during this          time course The study also revealed that an array of          about  copies of the           lac operator sequence is sufficient          to visualize           LacOs in planta via GFP as the          size of the           LacOs in the single inserted locus          in line ELE is approximately  kb Figure                           Inhibition of chimeric GFPLacINLS protein binding          in situto LacOsby IPTG          To verify if the spots in nuclei correspond to the          tagged loci we examined whether the detected subnuclear          localization of the expressed GFPLacINLS fusion protein          is sensitive to isopropylDthiogalactoside IPTG As          the           lac repressor variant that we used          binds to the operator sites as dimers we should be able          to inhibit its binding to the           LacOs of the tagged loci by adding          IPTG   If the binding is specific to the           LacOs inserted in the genome the          observed fluorescence spots should be suppressed by the          addition of IPTG          We used homozygous plants from line ELC which          carries three copies of the TDNA insert for this          experiment Forty microliters of solution containing           M of Dex and  mM IPTG were dropped on each seedling          on the culture plates Guard cells in the stomata of          cotyledons were observed  hours after induction in the          presence or absence of IPTG and the results from observed          nuclei were tabulated Figure ab Without IPTG we          detected one spot in  two spots in  and three          spots in  of total observed nuclei            n   among three seedlings With          IPTG we detected no spots in  and one spot in  of          total observed nuclei            n   in three seedlings We also          tested protein accumulation levels in the specimens          examined by western blot analysis Similar levels of          signals were detected with and without IPTG Figure c          thus indicating that           lac repressor binding is inhibited          by IPTG without change in protein accumulation levels          This study shows that the observed fluorescence spots in          lines ELC and E indeed correspond to specific binding          of the induced GFPLacINLS fusion protein to the tagged          loci However the relationship between the spot numbers          and tagged loci is unclear at this point For this          purpose we are currently determining the precise genomic          location of the tagged loci and collecting the statistics          of spot numbers for homozygous and heterozygous plants of          line ELC                          Detection and relational mapping of tagged loci          configuration          As plants contain chloroplasts in leaf and stem cells          and many autofluorescent compounds are localized in cell          walls a signaltobackground ratio for GFP detection is          probably lower than in animal systems Thus higher          levels of accumulation of GFPLacINLS may be required to          detect the loci in our system Under this condition we          found that we could obtain spatial information for          subnuclear structures with excess unbound GFPLacINLS          fusion proteins The nuclear contour as well as the shape          of the nucleolus for which GFPLacINLS has relatively          low accessibility and which thus appears as an opaque          object within the nucleus can be captured along with the          tagged loci positions by single channel excitation A          guardcell nucleus from homozygous plants of line ELC          is shown Figure  The data can be converted to a          threedimensional model shown for the detected spots          shown as red objects and the nucleolus shown as a blue          object within the nucleus outline shown in green          wireframe Figure b The distance between the three          spots can also be easily determined with the existing          program of our system Figure c                          Comparison of tagged loci between guard cells and          root epidermal cells          Plant organs are composed of ordered collections of          various cell types that differ in their shape size          function and DNA content The positive correlation          observed in most cells between cell volume and the degree          of polyploidy indicates that the nuclear DNA content may          have a key role in controlling cell growth   In           Arabidopsis  the ploidy level          varies from C guard cells sepal and petal epidermal          cells to C leaf trichomes   However the          mechanism of endocycle control in plants remains poorly          understood As an application of our chromatintagging          system we show here that cellspecific polyploidy can be          observed directly with this technology without measuring          nuclear DNA content          We used the homozygous plants of line ELE which          contain a single tagged locus for this experiment GFP          signals observed in a cotyledon guard cell Figure a          and an elongated root epidermal cell Figure b of a          dayold seedling were compared using threedimensional          projections of their nuclei after Dex induction In the          guard cell where the shape of its nucleus is usually          flat or spherical we often detected one spot which          suggests that the tagged site is frequently paired with          its homolog In contrast in the elongated root epidermal          cells where the nucleus usually elongates at the two          opposite sides we often detected multiple fluorescence          spots five spots for the root nucleus shown in Figure           which indicates the polyploid nature of the observed          nuclei Upon further refinement of this technology one          may be able to study the dynamics and regulation of          endoreduplication in plant cells that contribute to          cellspecific ploidy differences                            Conclusions        We have established transgenic plants that enable us to        observe specific tagged genomic loci together with the        nucleolar location in cells of a living plant without any        fixation Using this system we have visualized GFPtagged        chromatin in different cell types in living         Arabidopsis plants GFPtagged        chromosome observation has been applied in several studies        involving yeast cultured animal cells and more recently        transgenic         Drosophila spermatocytes These        studies have revealed new principles of chromosome dynamics        and organization However the relationship between        chromatin structure and cell types and developmental stages        is an important question that remains unanswered The        intact         Arabidopsis seedlings that were used        for microscopy under our conditions remain viable after        transplanting to soil from the slides Thus it should be        possible to monitor the same plants continuously for up to        several weeks In future by marking individual cells with        visual tags it should be possible to follow changes in        nuclear shape as well as relative subnuclear position of        the nucleolus and specific tagged genomic loci over long        timesscales of the order of weeks These types of studies        may reveal new aspects of chromatin organization in
