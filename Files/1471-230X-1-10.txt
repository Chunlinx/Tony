                    Introduction        Cystic fibrosis CF is an autosomal recessive disease        caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR chloride        channel     CFTR is known to possess multiple cellular        functions beyond its role as an apical membrane chloride        channel     For example regulation of other ion        channels such as the epithelial sodium channel and the        outwardly rectified chloride channel are welldescribed        functions of CFTR      Numerous other functions such        as regulation of intracellular vesicular pH regulation of        membrane recycling and regulation of mucin exocytosis are        less firmly established Phenotypic expression in CF is        variable with multiple organs affected The disease is        commonly but variably expressed in the lungs the exocrine        pancreas and the gastrointestinal mucosa             Significant intestinal malabsorption of various        substrates including bile acids is a consistent finding        in CF patients The total bile acid pool is contracted        unless supplementation with pancreatic enzymes is provided        In children bile acid losses can be so severe that a        deficiency of the amino acid taurine can occur due to        excessive losses of taurineconjugated bile acids                    Bile acid malabsorption in CF has been attributed to an        inhibitory effect of unhydrolyzed intraluminal        triglycerides on the intestinal absorption of bile acids        However in several studies the correlation between fecal        fat excretion and fecal bile acid loss could not be        demonstrated suggesting that additional factors are        responsible for bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis                     In vitro studies using brush border        membrane vesicles or bathed tissue samples from patients        with cystic fibrosis have shown that total ileal bile acid        uptake is diminished             The present study was designed to determine if the        activity and density of the ileal bile acid transporter        IBAT is diminished in heterozygous and homozygous cftr        knockout mice The results indicate that bile acid        malabsorption in CF is not caused by a defect in        sodiumdependent bile acid transport at the brush border        membrane suggesting another mechanism is operative                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          Cftr knockout mice with targeted disruption of the          cftr gene created at the University of North Carolina              were maintained at the University of Washington          Animal Care Facility under the auspices of the UW Cystic          Fibrosis Research Center Thirtyfive postweanling mice          more than

changes were never found        in any jejunal samples and occurred only occasionally as        weak signals in ileal samples from wildtype animals                    Discussion        Untreated children and adults with cystic fibrosis        excrete amounts of fecal bile acids similar to patients        with ileal resections      Based on kinetic studies        this increased fecal loss appears to be secondary to an        interrupted enterohepatic circulation of bile acids             Bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis appears to        be due in part to diminished secretion of pancreatic        enzymes and the presence of unhydrolyzed triglycerides        Supplementation with pancreatic enzymes and a lowfat diet        can markedly reduce the fecal excretion of bile acids               Other evidence however suggests that a        diminished capacity of the ileal mucosa for bile acid        uptake plays a significant role in bile acid malabsorption        associated with cystic fibrosis that is independent of        triglyceride concentrations Findings supporting this        notion include  The absence of a correlation between        fecal fat excretion and fecal bile acid loss  The normal        fecal bile acid losses in patients with liver disease        compared to excessive losses in those without liver disease        despite similar fecal fat excretion and  The finding        that patients with almost normal fat excretion continue to        lose large amounts of bile acids        Based on these findings a defect in ileal bile acid        transport mechanisms in cystic fibrosis has been suspected        Data in support of this hypothesis are contradictory        Fondacaro et al bathed ileal biopsies from CF patients in        taurocholate solutions They found a decrease in total        apical  basolateral bile acid uptake compared to normal        controls    and hypothesized that bile acid        malabsorption in cystic fibrosis was due to a primary        mucosal defect although they had not specifically studied        apical Na dependent absorption De Rooij et al found        significant decreases in active bile acid uptake when        examining ileal brush border membrane vesicles    and        proposed that altered viscosity of the ileal mucus was        likely not a factor in ileal bile acid malabsorption        associated with cystic fibrosis In another study using        marker perfusions with taurocholate and glycocholate in        three infants however the bile acid uptake rates with        cystic fibrosis were similar to control subjects                   The results from our study stand in contrast to these        earlier studies We found a significant increase in bile        acid transport in cftr  and cftr  mice This        increase in IBAT function was paralleled by increases in        IBAT protein concentrations Similar discrepancies between        measurements of solute uptake with brush border membrane        vesicles or tissue biopsies and in vivo experiments have        been observed in studies examining sodiumglucose        cotransport in cystic fibrosis Jejunal glucose absorption        was enhanced in patients with cystic fibrosis when measured        with catheter perfusion techniques     Ussing chamber        studies of intact CF biopsy specimens suggest that glucose        and alanine uptake rates are markedly increased in cystic        fibrosis     Taylor also studied intact jejunal        biopsies and found that the rate of active sodiumglucose        transport approximately doubled in CF compared to normal        jejunum            Contrary to these findings other investigations have        been unable to demonstrate any changes in sodiumglucose        cotransport when examining brush border membrane vesicles            The upregulation of intestinal sodiumlinked        nutrient absorption by cftr may occur via a mechanism that        does not involve changes of the brush border membrane but        rather intracellular components     Intestinal        sodiumlinked nutrient absorption would then be        undetectable in brush border membrane vesicle studies        However a number of studies using biopsies in Ussing        chambers have also been unable to demonstrate enhanced        glucose absorption in cystic fibrosis              Phenotypic expression is variable in patients carrying        homozygous or heterozygous mutations of the CFTR gene The        F mutation is the most common genetic disturbance        affecting the CFTR gene F heterozygotes are affected        to a lesser degree than are homozygotes In heterozygous        infants with the WTF genotype sweat chloride        excretion is elevated fold over normal values compared        to a tenfold increase in homozygous patients with the        FF genotype     Adult heterozygous patients        have fewer problems with respiratory infections compared to        homozygotes     Our findings that bile acid absorption        was moderately increased in heterozygotes and markedly        increased in homozygotes were therefore not unexpected        Heterozygotes are able to produce a limited number of        intact correctly localized CFTR protein molecules        resulting in partial phenotypic expression The correlation        between zygosity and level of IBAT protein expression        suggests a close relationship between the function of the        CFTR chloride channel and the sodiumdependent ileal bile        acid transporter        Our study is the first that correlates changes in        function of another intestinal solute transporter with the        expression level of CFTR Increased bile acid transport in        cftr  mice is associated with an increase in the        abundance of IBAT protein in the brush border membrane        Similar associations exist in normal rodents In hamsters        rats and mice increases and decreases in bile acid        absorption at the brush border membrane are mediated by an        up or downregulation in IBAT gene transcription             In several rodent species including mice regulation of        IBAT is clearly dependent on intraluminal bile acid        concentrations and occurs via a negative feedback mechanism              Feeding of bile acids suppresses        transcription of IBAT mRNA and reduces IBAT protein        abundance feeding of the bile acid binder cholestyramine        has the opposite effect In normal animals this negative        feedback mechanism keeps the enterohepatic bile acid pool        in equilibrium As bile acids are lost increased        absorption by a greater number of transporters in        combination with increased hepatic bile acid synthesis from        cholesterol helps restore normal bile acid levels In        contrast cftr  mice may experience bile acid        malabsorption even though their ileal mucosal cells express        fourfold more IBAT transporters than normal cells This        apparently paradoxical finding would suggest a luminal        factor that prevents bile acids from entering the mucosal        cells in the ileum        Based on this evidence we postulate that the more        viscous mucus layer in the ileal crypts of individuals with        cystic fibrosis limits access of luminal bile acids and        micelles to the ileal crypt cells This may result in an        altered programming of ileal stem cells and transit cells        that give rise to absorptive enterocytes overexpressing        IBAT protein        Further investigations are needed to corroborate this        hypothesis Additional studies should examine changes in        mucus layer thickness mucus viscosity and permeability for        bile acids associated with hetero and homozygosity for        CFTR mutations An alternative mechanism for the        upregulation of IBAT in cystic fibrosis is that CFTR acts        as a negative regulator of IBAT as it does for the        epithelial sodium channel     As IBAT is a        sodiumdependent apical membrane transporter it might be        regulated by CFTR as is the epithelial sodium channel        ENaC present in the apical membrane of the ileal        enterocyte CFTR regulation of ENaC has been described in        the colon in humans    and in cftr knockout mice            Colocalization of CFTR and ENaC suggests that direct        proteinprotein interactions allow CFTR to closely regulate        the activity of this channel      Our results        suggest that knockout of CFTR leads to an analogous        increase in expression and function of IBAT Of course a        more widespread perturbation of ion channel regulation in        the absence of CFTR is also a possibility as CFTR has been        demonstrated to be a master regulator of such diverse        proteins as the NaK pump     the basolateral NaKCl        cotransporter     and the inducible nitric oxide        synthase                        Conclusions        In summary in the widely studied cftr knockout mouse        model which clearly demonstrates intestinal pathology        the apical sodium dependent ileal bile acid transporter is        expressed and functions at higher levels than in wildtype        animals with intermediate levels of IBAT expression and        function in heterozygous cftr  mice The results of        this study open up further avenues of investigation with        respect to the role of the mucus layer in causing a        secondary upregulation of IBAT expression and function In        addition IBAT may be yet another apical membrane transport        protein that is regulated by CFTR                    Competing
