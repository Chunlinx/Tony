                                 Lord What Fools            You need to labor mightily to mess up AMidsummer Nights Dream  which is the only one of Shakespearesmasterpieces to be virtually productionproof It is the most magical ofbedroom farcesthe urbedroom farce so vast in scope that a bedroom cantcontain it Its boudoir is an entire forest symbolizing Nature itself wheremortals and fairies regals and bumpkins make love and war where passionbecomes arbitrary and paramours interchangeable and its last act is ariotously bungled tragedywithinacomedy a celebratory performance by atroupe of rude mechanicals thats an ironic comment on the trivial pursuitsthat have preceded it            Ive seen Midsummer in a dozenproductionswith adolescents at a drama camp with highschool students withMeryl Streep with Kenneth Branagh with contrapuntal Purcell airs and limpidMendelssohn strings in settings romantic and antiromanticand it has nevercome close to not working Until now Michael Hoffman the director andscreenwriter of the allstar movie called William Shakespeares AMidsummer Nights Dream evidently to distinguish it from Stephen KingsA Midsummer Nights Dream  has wedged the play into a weirdly inappositesetting has stupidly cut and even more stupidly embellished it and hasmiscast it almost to a player And yet the damn thing works Shakespearestaggers through mutilated but triumphant            The playwright setMidsummer in an ancient vaguely mythological Greece in whichintercourse between mortals and fairies is meant to be commonplace Titaniaqueen of the fairies has already seduced Theseus duke of Athens and thestruggle between her and her mate Oberon for possession of an orphanedchangeling boy has generated hurricanes floods and contagious fogs Withperverse antiinsight Hoffman has updated the play to a sunny atmosphericallyuntroubled Tuscany in the  th century and has filled his frameswith scampering street urchins and matrons kneading dough The fairies thatswirl around these settings first as Tinkerbellish balls of light and then asconventional storybook sprites belong to a different age and culture Thelines mysteriously continue to refer to Athens and Athenians            Hoffman evidently thinks that he has chosen the lastWestern society in which a young woman Hermia Anna Friel could plausibly bethreatened with death for not obeying her fathers command to marry his choiceof suitors in this case Demetrius Christian Balealthough DavidStrathairns Theseus is such an apologetically lightweight patriarch that thethreat seems incongruous It doesnt help that Theseus own erotic pas de deuxwith Hippolyta Sophie Marceau divested of most of her lines along with herAmazonian spirit is less sexually charged than an average coffeecommercial            Hoffman adds plenty ofmeaningless cinematic bustle then translates Shakespeares own set piecessoggily The illicit lovers Hermia and Lysander Dominic West flee Athens onbicycles which are supposed to symbolize modern liberation But once he getsthe couple into the forest where theyre furiously pursued by Demetrius andhis scorned mistress Helena Calista Flockhart their nocturnal circlingsmight as well be set in a TV studiotheyre stagebound Nearly every piece ofcomic business is campily extraneous to the text while the lines are blithelydisregarded Oberons famous barbed greeting Ill met by moonlight proudTitania makes little sense when Titania Michelle Pfeiffer sits gloweringbehind a curtain Commanded by Oberon Rupert Everett to squeeze the juice ofan aphrodisiac flower into the eye of a man in Athenian garments the impishPuck Stanley Tucci falls on a naked Lysander Weeds of Athens he dothwear says Puck Doth not Hoffman uses nudity for laughs to the point whereTheseus hunting party stumbles on the lovers in their birthday suitsadiscovery that would surely result in their arrest on the spot instead of thegenial interrogation provided by Shakespeare For reasons only Hoffmanunderstands he has saddled Nick Bottom Kevin Kline one of Shakespearesmost delightfully shameless extroverts with a nagging wife and added bits inwhich the braggart is poignantly humiliated by children Idiocy            I cant be sure what Everetts languid barechested Oberonis up toposing for a Calvin Klein ad maybeand his relationship to Tuccisjaded aging fratboy Puck is that of a prissy gamekeeper to a wayward Alvinthe Chipmunk Pfeiffer comes off the worst She can be a great movie actressbut a key to that greatness is how her dryly sardonic voicewith its edge ofneurotic insecurityplays against her ethereal features and brings her down toearth When she speaks Shakespearean verse that nervy edge deserts her Shemakes her face a blank and pipes her lines arrhythmically like a cluelesshighschool thespian Yes she looks like a dream with cascading blond curlsframing those exquisitely suspended cheekbones But every time she opens hermouth she becomes an airhead            The mortals fare betterFriel and West a couple of able Brits actually know how to speak versealthough Bale is more at home in naturalistic parts With her twiglike frameand pinched features Flockhart is a born Hermia Cast as the discombobulatedHelena she does reasonably well As she demonstrates every week on the direAlly McBeal  theres no one more adept at flinging herself intomortifying situations with masochistic relish            Thank heaven for the rustics and for the final act theweddingnight performance of The most Lamentable Comedy and most Cruel Deathof Pyramus and Thisby which even Hoffman cant completely screw up At timeshes in his element He has devised a neat bit of business for the great MaxWright whose speech about impersonating the horned moon is now a hastyimpromptu The tonguetied lion of Bill Irwin is so eloquent in hisinarticulateness that I never wanted him to leave the stage Roger Rees undera heavy barbershop mustache is the sweetest Peter Quince imaginablebothBottoms biggest fan and his most sympathetic critic And even Hoffmanssentimental interpolations cant strangle the comic spirit of Kevin Kline Thebeauty of Klines Bottom is its childlike straightforwardness and simplicityKline understands that whatever happens Bottom remains essentially himselfThe asss head makes him more serenely Bottomlike His Bottoms Dream speechis a joyous discovery of the dreamlike essence of lifea truth unglimpsed byany of the plays other characters Its too bad that Hoffman belabors thepoint by giving Bottom a tender finale in which he stares
