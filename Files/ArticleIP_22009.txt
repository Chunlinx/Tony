s While it is true that films such as Blackboard Jungle  TheWild One  East of Eden  and Rebel Without a Cause tapped intothe baby boom audience the teen demographic was identified at Warner Bros inthe s with the popular films starring the Dead End Kids At MGM Louis BMayer produced the bourgeois counterpart the obscenely successful AndyHardy series starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland later teamed in thearchetypal teen pix Babes in Arms and Babes on Broadway Universal made a likewise profitable series with Deanna Durbin and over at RKOin the s the teenage Shirley Temple starred in movies like TheBachelor                and                The BobbySoxer  It is in  that theecht misunderstood teen film Knock on Any Door was made starringJohn Derek as the misfit who wanted to live fast

sidestepping stands on significant issues But the first primary is ayear away and the general election a year and a half away Its already crazythat candidates have to run shadow campaigns for years and then formexploratory committees before formally announcing their candidacies I supposein the election cycle for  which by my calendar starts in about threeweeks potential candidates will first announce plans to pick a committee todetermine if the potential candidates should form an exploratory committee todetermine if they should run for president            The absurdity here forpotential voters is that we dont want to hear a potential candidatespositions repeated ad nauseum for  or  months Take the spotlightoff of them until the Christmas tree lights come down in January  If TVlights arent there the candidates will be forced to do something practical tobide their time And potential voters wont have to be concerned aboutestablishing committees to determine if they should throw out their televisionsand delete their bookmarks to ezines until a more reasonable time nextyear                           Paul Clark                        OakPark Ill                           A WifesDefense                        There is a curious symmetry between David Plotz andthose government officials who would like to see my husband Jonathan Pollardremain in prison forever In  Plotz presents his own damning opinions on thePollard case as if they were fact in much the same way that these governmentofficials accuse my husband in the media of crimes for which he was neverindicted            Jonathan Pollard did not commit was not chargedwith and was not convicted of the outrageous charges now being hurled at himin the media There is no substance to the latest pack of lies proffered bySeymour Hersh in The New Yorker  nor to the charges invented by DavidPlotz in                   Slate                Moreover no evidence to support any of thesefalse charges was presented  years ago when my husband entered into a pleaagreement with the American government In other words these charges are veryrecent fabrications that have suddenly surfaced in the press to serve politicalends Based on the evidence that the government presented  years agoJonathan was indicted on one count onlypassing classified information to anally Israel He was not charged with intending to harm the United States Hewas not charged with treason            The one count of passing classified information toan ally that Jonathan was charged with usually carries a sentence of  to years No one in the history of the United States has ever received a lifesentence for this offenseno one but Jonathan Pollard As a result of a lastminute secret submission to the sentencing judge by then Secretary of DefenseCasper Weinbergerwhich Jonathan and his attorneys have never in  years beengiven the opportunity to challengethe judge ignored the plea agreement andmeted out a life sentence without parole Who plea bargains for a lifesentence            The new crimes that Jonathan Pollard is now beingaccused of in the media were in fact committed by a host of Soviet spiesincluding Aldrich Ames David Boone and Ronald Pelton But that has notstopped US officials from continuing to publicly blame Jonathan Pollardandby extension Israelfor the damage done by these enemy agents nor has itstopped irresponsible journalists from parroting these unsubstantiated liesWhat Jonathan Pollard did do is warn Israel that Saddam Hussein had amassedAmericanapproved and Americanfinanced weapons of mass destruction which heintended to use to scorch the Jewish state Jonathan deeply regrets that hebroke the law in order to warn Israel about this threat to her existence Hehad tried everything in his power to get the information released to Israelthrough legal channels but was thwarted every step of the way right up to thetop of the Pentagon It would appear that certain US officialsCasperWeinberger Adm Bobby Ray Inman and otherswere more concerned with theworld finding out that America was arming Iraq at that time than they wereabout covertly violating their informationsharing agreement with Israel Itwas in desperation that my husband acted on his fear for the Jewish state andfinally sought out the Israelis to warn them about this betrayal            Contrary to Plotzs contention Jonathan hasexpressed his remorse repeatedlyprivately and publiclyand in variousmediums He deeply regrets not finding a legal means to act on his concerns forIsrael in the face of the Iraqi threat            There is still enormous embarrassment in Washingtontoday over Americas arming of Iraq and the ongoing threat from the Madman ofBaghdad The release of Jonathan Pollard would bring this shameful episode tothe forefront For that reason fearful officials hurl false charges at him inthe medianever in courtto try to keep him in prison forever and to makepeople forget about how he blew the whistle on a secret American proIraqitilt long before it became public knowledge            Today the Clinton administration is doing withChina just what the ReaganBush administration did with Iraq For political andeconomic reasons a blind eye has been turned to Chinese espionage in theUnited States for years As a result China is now armed with nuclear munitionsthat could pose a major threat to the United States This administration justlike its predecessors wants people to look the other way so it can downplaythe story in the media and give implausible explanations for why a top levelspy who provided nuclear munitions information to a hostile country should befired from his job instead of being brought to trial            Interestingly enough journalists like Plotz dontsee fit to utter a peep of protest about the mishandling of the Chinese spycase Mindlessly they swallow whole what they read in the press and continue tofocus their hostility and anger on the wrong target Wen Ho Lee stole Americaninformation on nuclear warheads for China and was fired Jonathan Pollard gaveinformation to an ally Israel about a threat to that countrys survival andhe got life Proportional justice or political vengeance Why is it that thesame officials who are so relentless and vociferous in their condemnation ofJonathan Pollard and Israel are so utterly silent about all the other recentspy cases where the charges were far more serious and the damage wasmeasurable            By mangling the truthand presenting uninformed opinion as if it were fact Plotz and                  Slate                have done a great disservice not only to the case ofJonathan Pollard but to the ongoing battle he is waging to restore theprinciple of equal justice for all Americans                           EstherPollard                        Toronto                                             David Plotzreplies I agree with Esther Pollard on one crucial point The fact thatthe most damning allegations against her husband were never madepubliclythough Pollard himself did see themhas muddied his case No matterhow credible the allegations in the Seymour Hersh piece areand they areextremely crediblethey are unverifiable and irrefutable as long as the UnitedStates damage assessment remains secret This secrecy allows Esther Pollard tomake bold claims about her husbands innocence and to dismiss these damningallegations as the malevolent fabrications of Pollardhaters                                       But observers whoarent married to Pollard are left with a choice Do we trust Jonathan Pollardan admitted unapologetic spy who told lie after lie after lie in the courseof stealing US secrets when he says he didnt take anything serious Or dowe trust the judgment of the secretary of defense the secretary of state thedirector of the CIA the chairmen of the House and Senate IntelligenceCommittees all of whom know exactly what Pollard did and all of whom areadamant he should be kept locked up                                       To Whine OwnSelf                        In  Michael Sandel makes the lovely point thatMonica Lewsinky
