        what do you how what do you think of your news coverage and where do you get most of it     uh usually uh either TV or radio   oh oh   it it seems like   uhhuh   sometime uh we get the weekend paper but uh even then it just seems that sometimes youre so busy you dont wanna take an hour or so to sit down  the paper   umhum   so its so much quicker just to hear you know hear it on the radio or watch TV   yes we dont go to bed at night  usually until weve seen the news at ten so thats probably well we do take a daily paper too   uhhuh oh you do uhhuh   umhum but its out of Ogden and so it its not very you know its not probably as big as yours and sometimes i wonder about the newspaper coverages too anyway   yeah oh yeah   because ive known stories that have happened and then read it in the paper and it hasnt been all that accurate umhum umhum   not quite the same yeah and a lot of times when you have two different um papers you get two different stories   thats true although i think thats the same on TV too you know youll get one you know one day and one the next day on the same thing and so but i   yeah right  oh excuse me   i enjoy i enjoy the news i like to keep up on whatevers happening   oh i do too   so   its just its so much easier just to you know listen to the radio in your car it seems like or just to sit down for a short while and watch the news than it is to sit down and you know i mean ill read periodicals and stuff too but um   umhum   usually those come out after the fact and course they give you more information so if you want that then thats fine   uh yeah well i think sometimes you know youll hear it on TV and you want want to go into it deeper you uh you can get it in a magazine or a paper   right right   a newspaper and then on the radio you know they usually uh give the news every hour   yeah uhhuh   and so i i like that too especially when were traveling   right yeah i know that when im on vacation i am like seems like im totally out of it i dont know whats going on and i dont really care   so well thats true too   its kind of nice to get away from it all   yeah uhhuh but you know if theres a story that youre particularly interested in its good to  to be able to follow up on it  you know so   right yeah     but uh  we have a a news station too that is  uh KSL out of Salt Lake that covers just its a talk show and theres news almost constantly on it   oh uhhuh   and then CNN has news constantly too   right right   so do you have cable   no we dont so we dont watch CNN   oh oh  well we couldnt get TV here if we didnt have cable we live close to the mountain   oh okay   and uh the signal the signal doesnt come because were kind of behind a mountain   right right   so we couldnt get it if we didnt have cable cable in fact weve when we first moved out here for the first probably twenty years we couldnt it was really snowy   oh is that right   our reception and you know wed watch it and the kids would watch it but it wasnt all that good   uhhuh   so   so you figured might as well get the cable huh   yeah well  we were glad when it came but it just keeps going up in price too so thats kind of detriment too   right   but weve thought of getting a satellite so that we could get more stations but uh it wouldnt i dont know   now thatll be nice   yeah but i dont think were gonna to do it because its uh you cant get local stations and thats the news that were mostly interested in   uhhuh right yeah   and back to news flash from our high school today we have one high school in town and they had to evacuate it because the furnace was acting up and was threatening to blow up   oh is that right i bet the kids were happy   yeah they i think they were   yeah well we had uh i dont know if your son told you but we had two papers here in Dallas and now we just have the one   we saw it on TV before he told us   oh okay so thatll probably make a difference in the reporting   yeah does uh how much does your newspapers cost   they are um on the weekends gosh um let me see ive got this on Sunday its a dollar   umhum   and during the week im not really sure how much it is its probably i guess you know seventy five cents or so i would think   umhum ours is eight dollars a month so how would that figure up with what youd do   uhhuh but you get it every day dont you oh so thats thats really good then   yes yes its kind of a  skinny newspaper except when the ads you know like at Christmas time or Thanksgiving or   right   so its uh but we i enjoy it id hate to be without a newspaper and then we get the local you know the little Brigham City one its uh comes once a week   uhhuh yeah that must uh do you have a hard time keeping up with it reading everything   keep no   oh well thats good   no but
