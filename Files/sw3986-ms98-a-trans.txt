        have you recently bought a car Eric or     well well i didnt buy one i just changed jobs changed jobs and got a work car or a company car and uh they bought me a Pontiac Grand Prix and   uhhuh   ive been yeah ive been pretty happy with it i ive been driving just a little little Honda the Honda Civic and stuff so its a bigger car but ive been pretty pleased with it you know i uh   thats a nice car isnt it umhum   it was its you know got a lot of nice gadgets and stuff but i gosh its been nice so far i cant say that its put it through all the loops   can you use it for personal too to   yeah i can use it for personal and   so so you buying a car to you right at this point anyway isnt a a big deal   no not really i although we my other we have a second car and its getting a little bit old its an eighty five Honda Civic and so were thinking in a year or two we might have to but uh   uhhuh   you know i i kind of i just like to keep up i you know dont uh dont plan on buying one like i say for a year or two but sooner or later im going to have to   yeah   but   we we just bought two years ago we just bought a a Plymouth Voyager   uhhuh   and its been great weve got family a a family of five three kids and thats the only way to travel as far as im concerned the   uhhuh oh i bet   the kids can get up and move around and you can get them things   now is that a is that a full size van or   it its not its a its a minivan   minivan   uh and it was the best rating out of the consumer reports and things   oh was it it you do so do you shop the consumer reports when you buy a car then or do you   i do i do and   do you find that works out pretty good for you   yeah weve only bought two new cars i bought a Nissan Sentra   uhhuh   that um and i really liked it too didnt have any problems with it   did you uhhuh   and this one has been been an exceptional vehicle weve really enjoyed it especially for kids   well thats good to hear yeah thats good to hear some good news about some American made cars i   uhhuh   i uh i really believe theyre getting better and you know i i i looked around and seen some of those new Saturns and stuff and they seem to be a really nice car   yes   and   well actually my philosophy about i mean if i was going to buy something for me like a car id drive around  unfortunately id still get a foreign car i think that Honda makes uh like youve got the Accords are very very well built i also really like the Toyota Camrys   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   but theyre just not practical if you have kids   yeah thats true   you cant um well if they get older i guess you can take four or five people but when theyre small you got to get up and crawl over the seat and you know which doesnt work   umhum oh yeah what we found just even going down to our inlaws overnight uh uh this little Honda Civic theres just not enough room we ive just got one daughter by the time you put the car seat and a couple of bags i mean were just   uhhuh   you know we we uh we were having that problem that why theres just not enough room those small cars any more we couldnt go camping because we couldnt put a tent and a cooler in it you know it was so small   yep yeah   but uh   and uh Chryslers started doing some nice things with their with their warranties and things ive got a seven year seventy thousand mile warranty on the drive train   oh really   yeah and a three year thirty six six thousand mile on uh i think its a pretty thats pretty well bumper to bumper   oh really   but the drive train is seven seventy and thats i think thats one of the well i kind of think that the other manufacturers are now uh bumping it up to meet it but Chrysler was the first to do that   yeah thats yeah theyve had that for a while yeah well it says something theyre willing at least put something behind it you know theyre they feel like turning out a good product and theyre at least   yeah   yeah that warranty stuff thats uh i did have to take this company car in and the cassette jammed all of a sudden and it was nice to know that you know that warranty it was still under its warranty and they just took it and took care of it right on the spot but thats definitely something i think id shop for id want as much warranty as i could because   yep   its expensive to get the things fixed anymore   yeah   if its not covered   and im thinking about getting a used car with my next one trying to see if i cant take some of the depreciation off i dont know theyre still danger expensive you know id you know only i only want to buy something like maybe twenty thousand miles on it they they dont go down much you know unless theyre a couple years old or something   to buy it yeah uhhuh no they dont you know they yeah if you get something thats one or two years old uh you can usually knock i i worked at a bank as a loan officer and so i could you know i got into that a little bit you know the dealership financing and stuff but   umhum   you know at two years makes a huge difference you know they say and its pretty much true that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value and the Hondas and some of those they dont depreciate as much but you can still get them a little bit cheaper   yeah yeah   but i tell you what its kind of scary uh we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they they get those things for about half of what they sell them   yes youre kidding me   i couldnt believe it i uh we stickered the car i got this Grand Prix was stickered at uh sixteen thousand it was a ninety one and had uh had ten thousand miles on it but we ended up getting it for about ten and i mean they bought it for ten theyll sell it for sixteen seventeen thousand i could not believe it had just if you know somebody thats the way to go but unfortunately only the dealers can get in  but uh   hum yeah huh   i tell you i ive been real happy with the Hondas actually we had a have a nineteen eighty Honda Accord too
