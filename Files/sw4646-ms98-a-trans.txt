        uh do you know anyone that uh has is in a nursing home or has ever been in one     no but i my grandparents were looking into it before so i know what theyve said   uhhuh   umhum   well im trying to think my uh uh wifes grandmother had Alzheimers and they were going to put her into a a nursing home and uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean she she sort of went you know bananas and they couldnt couldnt deal with her   oh they thought it was too much of a bother   so i guess you need to uh know whether its a you know no deposit no return kind of thing whether   right if theyre equipped too to handle the kind of patients youre gonna have you know to put in there too because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still   yeah right   they wanted someplace they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well   right   have their own room   my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that um there was a retirement hotel and then a uh there was some sort of fulltime care place that was also associated with it so for um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else   umhum   and then um as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to um provide fulltime care and um she didnt have to do anything anymore but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and thats some i dont know whether thats because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the what the reason is but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something   well a lot of thats probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help they need health care so theyre already ill before they go   yeah right   thats probably a large factor   yeah if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are and then you only go there as a last resort   umhum   or people send you there as a last resort   right right thats my grandparents it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them   uhhuh   so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency   right   and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they wouldnt be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess thats a problem too for people wait lists   right   and all that um you cant always get in when you want to and of course you cant just sit around and wait   yeah i guess right when you need it you need it i guess   yeah and the money is also another issue how youre gonna pay for it   right   at that stage of life you only have so much money left and       i guess its not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put in their savings i mean it is kind of fair but its also not fair because they have their own children to raise   yeah sure   so thats another problem   and you probably if it were you you probably wouldnt want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price   right right so its its just so complicated anymore i think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is youre extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and theyre not necessarily enjoying life anymore   yeah well maybe thats the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that its not worth continuing   its just a shame thats the way it has to be i think the retirement home ideas a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and   yeah   because uh like if your spouse died all of a sudden you be all alone itd be nice to go someplace people similar to you and have friends   right i ive known quite a few people that have um gone to retirement communities i dont know if they have them back there but here in California and in Arizona
