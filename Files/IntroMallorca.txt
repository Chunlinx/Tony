                      THE ISLANDS AND THEIR PEOPLE        The Balearic Islands dont have to work too hard to embody        the perfect island vacation Mallorca and Menorca are blessed with the        sort of natural and manmade attributes that entice countless millions        of foreign visitors to descend upon them and to keep returning year        after year the perfect deep blue and transparent turquoise of the        Mediterranean Sea plus days of brilliant annual sunshine hundreds        of miles of coastline secluded coves and wide bays and a vast choice        of cheap flights and accommodations        Since the s Mallorca has shone in its role as Spains        tourism juggernaut defining the extremes of a Mediterranean holiday        the unbridled hedonism of topless beaches and singles bars and the        lethargic point A hotel to point B beach vacation Wealthy        visitors to the island enjoy privileged holidays revolving around        second homes boating and sailing The image was established early and        the cash registers have been ringing ever since        But tourism pulls islanders in opposite directions on the        Balearics Income derived from a wellorchestrated travel industry has        made this region Spains wealthiest per capita but the environmental        and psychological effects of being Europes playground have left locals        a bit desperate Four decades after it exploded tourism on the islands        overheated leaving in its ashes a forest of massive blockbooked        hotels and beachhugging villa communities with few discernible ties to        Spainplaces lined with German bier halls English fish n chips        joints and lowrent bars and discos        At a time when countries are going to new extremes battling        for their share of the world tourism pie Mallorca and Menorca are        reassessing their enduring popularity Fearing that overdevelopment as        well as new trends and tastes in international tourism would leave the        Balearics behind authorities have moved to protect remaining        undeveloped areas as nature preserves proclaiming them offlimits to        all construction and have even blown up some of the more unsightly        hotel blemishes on the coasts        The people and governments of Mallorca and Menorca have        recognized a need to choose between surrendering the natural beauty and        easygoing lifestyle of their islands to the ravenous consumption of        foreign vacationers and homebuyers and protecting whats left of each        Happily theres still a lot that hasnt yet been adulterated on the        two islandsmeaning that visitors also have a choice They can join        hordes of their sundeprived brethren from Great Britain Germany and        other countries and enjoy an island vacation with a cheap place to        stay familiar food glorious beaches and a few day excursions thrown        in for variety The summer season grows longer every year and        significant stretches of both islands are still packed with merrymakers        and families delighting in the traditional Mediterranean island        vacation        Or if that thought is less appealing to you though as it        is to increasing numbers of travelers youll find another side to the        Balearics It is more chic than cheap a place where ecologically        sensitive hotels are built in restored thcentury manor and farm        houses where hiking cycling and golf complement or replace entirely        the long days at the beach It is place to eat fine Mallorcan        Menorcan and Spanish cuisine rather than pizza and French fries        This other Balearics may not be as inexpensive or as        accessible as the one sold by travel operators but if visitors venture        beyond the welltrodden tracks of their packaged predecessors theyll        discover a spectacularly beautiful part of the world If you come        expecting a nightmarish land of charter flights tour buses and        beerstained beach hangouts you may be shocked at how remote and        undeveloped many parts of these small islands remain From medieval        mountain villages and the dramatic lunar landscape of Mallorcas        Formentor promontory to mysterious prehistoric settlements and isolated        beaches accessible only by foot on Menorca the islands abound with        sights that are anything but blandly international        Slowly but surely visitors are graduating from sterile        hotels and apartment blocks to home rentals time shares and casas        ruralescountry house hotels that form part of the governments        agrotourism initiatives No longer the sole habitat of sun worshippers        the islands welcome thousands of cyclists in early spring April and        May bring hikers to exclaim over wildflowers and birdwatchers with        binoculars and zoom lenses record rarities and migrants on their way        north        Previous generations moved inland to get out of range of        marauding pirates Islanders who stayed put and didnt flee to the        coast to work the tourism industry can live almost unmolested by        beachbound modern invaders Against the odds much of the islands        traditional life and values has been preserved and while agriculture        is no longer the dominant income source plenty of people still have        little connection to tourism This is especially true on Menorca where        cold winter winds limit the seasons length        Mallorca the largest of the four Balearics is also the        most geographically varied The dramatic cliffs of the Serra de        Tramuntana mountain range hug the coastline of the entire northwest and        north from Andratx all the way to the Cape of Formentor The north        coast boasts some of Spains most stunning scenery miniscule coves        dizzying drops to the sea picturesque medieval villages and a single        port at Sller The interior of Mallorca is a vast plain of small        industrial towns farmlands and ancient gnarly olive and almond        trees all protected from Mediterranean winds by the rugged mountains        The south is dominated by the cosmopolitan island capital Palma de        Mallorca its handsome bay and the crowded beaches that splay outward        from it The east coast is an enticing mix of bays long sweeps of        beach small coves spectacular caves and myriad tourist villas        Menorca is the second largest of the Balearic archipelago        but its tiny just the same only  km  miles long and  km         miles across at its widest point Predominantly rural and flat        Menorca has always been a quieter place than Mallorca or the craziest        of the Balearics partymad Ibiza Still its hidden coves remarkable        natural harbors and more than  Megalithic monumentsinscrutable        remnants of the islands prehistoric originsare dazzling Menorca        gets bigtime package holidaymakers especially from Great Britain and        beaches and roads get awfully crowded in the height of the summer        season but the island seldom feels frenetic        With all these things going for them including a friendly        easygoing population conversant in several languages its not        surprising that the Balearics continue to reel in short and longterm        visitors by the millions Many northern Europeans especially Germans        have purchased summer and retirement homes here during the months of        July and August Spaniards are flatly outnumbered when the dominant        languages are German and English In parts of Mallorca Germans own        about  percent of all homes along traditionally British vacation        spots on Menorca threequarters of the homes are first or second        residences belonging to the English Understandably locals patience        can get a bit frayed by the end of summer It is being tested further        as more visitors buy into the old towns and villages instead of just        coastal resorts        But foreign invasions are nothing new to these islanders        They were conquered successively by Carthaginians Romans Vandals        Christians and Moors Slightly less possessive but equally curious        visitors arrived including the lovers George Sand and Frdric Chopin        Archduke Louis Salvator of Austria Anas Nin and the poet Robert        Graves The islands are now invaded by modern royalty like Claudia        Schiffer Michael Douglas as well as princes and their paramours who        anchor their yachts in the ports and evade the paparazzi Many        islanders have learned to regard the latest occupations with a sense of        dry humor All the previous occupiers have come and eventually gone        they say and these too will one day leave
