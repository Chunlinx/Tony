                                  The Third Edmund Morris            Even if you havent cracked Dutch  you knowabout Edmund Morris and his semifictional namesake And you probably haventavoided a third Edmund Morris the tireless promoter who dogs yourchannelsurfing Strangely this Edmund Morris on the gabshow circuit begs todiffer with Edmund the Writer Where Edmund the Writer can be cleareyed abouthis subject calling Reagan banal and an airhead Edmund the Promoter fawnslike a Reaganaut constantly trumpeting a great president Whereas Edmund Iclaims he only made up Edmund II Edmund III weaves tales that are flatlycontradicted in Edmund Is book            A striking instance ofinterEdmund strife comes from last Fridays Larry King Live  ThereEdmund the Promoter told how Ronald Reagan almost joined the Communist PartyAnd why didnt he The party elders heard about his desire to join realizedat once that Reagan was not doctrinary material He was too open and toohonest and he couldnt be trusted to keep party secrets So they asked himpolitely to stay the hell away            But Edmund the Writer tells a very different version of thesame story in Dutch  He quotes writer Howard Fast a party stalwartAccording to Fast when Reagan tried to join the local Party leader askedaround and word came back Reagan was a flake  who couldnt be trustedwith any political opinion for more than  minutes            So Edmund I writes thatRonald Reagan was too stupid for the Communists and then Edmund III improvesthe story for television by making him too virtuous Defending thecontradiction Morris says flaky means he couldnt be trusted with secretsOnce you start making stuff up apparently its harder to stop than you thinkBut which Edmund is correct Maybe neither It turns out that even Edmund theWriter may have been embroidering more than his own role            D utch devotes three pages to the CP episodeNearly half of this threepage stretch consists of Morris conversation withFast presented as screenplay dialogue It is a dramatic scene with Fastdishing a shocking piece of information that the obsessed biographer has neverheard before Morris pours on the colorthey are in a reception at the NewYork Public Librarys Astor Hall they shake hands they are wearing tuxedosthe buzz of billionaires is in the background and so on            But these are all Redherrings distracting from the fact that the scene is a silly vehicle forexploring Reagans flirtation with communism Fast never claims to have metReagan or to have had firsthand knowledge of Reagans application to join theparty The Astor Hall reception was the only time he and Morris spoke Fastsays Fast now admits to recycling gossip This was a story told to me at adinner party I cant remember who told it Historian Ronald Radosh notes thatFast has a reputation for inconsistently remembering his time in the partyincluding contradictory recitations in his two memoirs But Morris havingstumbled upon a juicy story never seriously questions Fasts reliability orpokes logical holes in his account            Morris does recount his attempts to nail down Fasts storyHe describes conversations with three Reagan acquaintances including the actorEddie Albert Morris does not say that Albert was a party member but hestrongly hints that Albert and his wife operated on behalf of the CPUSAAlbert confirmed for Morris that Reagan did indeed discuss joining the partyand was ultimately dissuaded But Morris writes that when he tried to questionthe aged actor further Albert caged up as expected            Oddly when I calledAlbert he was anything but cagey In fact he couldnt stop screaming into thephone Reagan was a nice guy but he was stupid He didnt have a clue aboutany Russia business He talked about being a Communist We all did But henever did anything about it One night my wife sat down and told him the partywas a load of crap But was this just a ploy Were Albert and his wifesecretly Communists conspiring to keep Reagan out of the party No DidMorris ask Albert this question Morris is an asshole says Albert Andeven Fast cant confirm what Morris implies I have no idea whether Eddie wasin the party or not            Eddie Albert may be lying of course and corroborating theFast version of events may not be possible But there are gaping holes inMorris reporting that can easily be filled with a few phone calls Forinstance Fast told Morris that Reagan dealt with a local party leader awellknown screenwriter a playwright a historian Fast wouldnt identifythis person to Morris and Morris doesnt mention any attempt to track him downBut only one Hollywood character fits this bill John Howard Lawson the deanof Hollywood Reds who reemerged to become Reagans political foe in the lates And Fast confirmed to me that he was talking about Lawson            Or Morris could have contacted Dorothy Healey whowas the chair of the Southern California Communist Party during the sHealey told me This has to be apocrypha Its nonsense Of course we neverrejected people for being too flaky And if Reagan had been rejected I wouldhave definitely heard about it And in an interview the authorized biographerconcedes that he didnt investigate thoroughly Arthur Schlesinger once toldme that he had dirt on Reagan buried in his filing system But I never wentafter him            Although the Communist Party episode is one ofMorris most oftmentioned scoops he didnt even have it first Howard Fasttold essentially the same story in the New York Observer eight yearsago And probably has been dining out on it for decades Yet Morris didamazingly little to try to nail it down But who has time to dig for facts whenyouve got to make up not one but two different fantasies
