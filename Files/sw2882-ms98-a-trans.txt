                here we go   okay where are you from   im from uh Attleboro Massachusetts   oh is that where youre talking from   yes   oh well yeah can tell from your accent   how how about you   im from Louisville Kentucky but im here in Texas   oh youre down there in Texas oh okay um   uhhuh   so were supposed to be talking about why only half the people vote in national elections   huh   um   do you vote regular   i vote regularly yes i do   okay   in the national elections um some of the local um i dont tend to unless theres a referendums something thats going to affect the town   uhhuh   uh then i uh   well i     then i put my two cents in   uh i need to get into voting ive never voted   you never ever voted   no ive never voted ive never felt comfortable enough with it i dont know enough about politics to know what the right choice is anyway   as far as uh   even local candidates it just  i talked about this the other day on the telephone with its uh so many politicians you know they put up a front to me you know theyre not showing you the real person anyway theyre just show showing what the public wants to see   uh thats true unless you unless you come from i come i come from a fairly small town so i i live in Rhode Island but i work in Massachusetts um   uhhuh   and its fairly small and you and most of the people you tend to know at least the family or you know uh   well that would be nice yeah   its uh its getting away from that now i mean the towns growing bigger as as all towns are and youre right theyre uh uh i think uh most politicians when they first get into politics they want to do a good job and then after theyre theyre in there a while you have to play the good old boy network   right   and its uh uh um they have their own special interests and watch out for the people that are going to do the most for them too to get them reelected i think   right well thats what i mean its just you dont know whats real i guess   yeah how about uh bond issues or referendum that they they put on you dont   i dont know much about that at all what do you mean like when you vote for a certain thing not a person   right yeah whether they they want to build a new school whether they want to put in a new reservoir or or     okay no ive never voted on anything like that either   um       but yet theyre taking your tax money or they would if if some of these bond issues passed   uhhuh   um you still didnt have any feelings one way or the other about whether they they should do it or shouldnt   well see ive never how do you do the do you do that like youre voting just like if youre taking a a presidential election do you just go somewhere and place your ballot or   yeah yes   huh well see ive never heard of that well i know that sounds stupid but i really havent ive never heard of that   um how how long have you lived in in where are you now Texas in Dallas   im no im in Denison Texas up north in on in the north part of Texas   uh okay but you havent lived your your whole life you came from Kentucky did you say   right i moved from Kentucky when i was twenty one   oh okay but you grew up in that town or   right i grew up in Louisville   well Louisville okay thats and but thats and Louisvilles a a large city so   yeah its a fairly big city   yeah you didnt have local real local politics like you know like a small town would how about where you are now is that a fairly large   Denison its uh i wouldnt say its large but it is one of the bigger cities in this part of Texas   yeah so youre in the same boat there   right its about the same   and you dont really know whos who are whats going on or yeah   no i remember once when i was working in Louisville one of the mayor candidates come up to the uh uh place where i was working and he had asked me i dont know i guess it had been about two years since id been eligible to vote and i havent hadnt been voting well he had uh this is one of the things that you know formed my opinion on politician politicians he sat there and promised you know the next day were going to take you up and get you registered to vote and youre going to vote for me and blah blah blah but then he never showed up   ha   you know   yeah   it was one of his aides or whatever but still i thought you know they say what they want to for the time being what sounds good   just just so they can get in   yeah   thats all and its uh they probably should limit the the terms of office to no more than two years i mean two terms that way they dont get in there because some of these guys have been in there like for twenty years and they they kind of run things the way they want to run them whether whether its uh   uhhuh   for the good of the the town or the people in the town or not   uhhuh well thats i think they need to have a a better oh i need to know a lot more about politics and they need to have something in the community well like in high school they should teach politics or the government i mean i think so   yeah um some of them do now um social social sciences and im not sure how far they get into politics and that uh   uhhuh well i want to know about politics in particular you know just you know what the workings of it is   oh the  like uh uh parliamentary procedure and and that sort of thing   everything right in order for me to be able to form a a good opinion opinion on who to vote for or whatever i i need to know about it   yeah   you know   uh   and if i could keep a followup on the candidates running like right now you know i know whose president vice president and i know a couple of the mayors like Koch in New York i dont even know whos mayor down here in Texas off hand   yeah yeah um i dont it its theyve got theyve got rules and regulations they have to follow for for government procedures but theres too many special interest groups now that are in there that that can sway an election one way or another   uhhuh   um i dont even think running to to the running of the government now is done by the the president they say yo u know hes i think hes only really a figurehead he only can do certain amount of things because hes got so many people after him you know an hes hes got to look out   so much well what do you think about i think just you know anybody should be allowed to run for president just even an ordinary guy off the street if he knows the politics   well you can except it costs so much money now that the average person cant do that   right its its thats what i mean its all money and   um plus theyre all you you have to play the people that have been in power now  uh most of them are i think are are crooks   yeah   and you have to play their ball game theyve been in there so long and if you dont then theyll you know theyll find ways to get rid of you   uhhuh   no ones held accountable anymore for things that happen well   what did you think of that whole mess with Ollie North and all that   oh i think that they should have crucified him thats what i think   uh Reagan and Bush and   Reagan too Reagan he knew about it   oh of course he did   and if he didnt know the whole scope of it whoever whoever was directly under him   he should have looked into it right or it should have been looked into more   yeah an now its coming out where there was there was holding the hostages now theyre saying that the hostages were being made political pawns when Carter and Reagan were running i mean you know   yeah well thats the way i felt when uh Carter and Reagan was running i liked Carter as a president   he was a a a nice man im not sure uh he was too probably too moral   yeah but he was a i dont know he was a good Christian and everything though well from what ive seen i was only sixteen then but i when Reagan came in i figured i thought it ran through my head that Carter lost because the hostages you know that whole mess   yeah yeah   wasnt it the day after Reagan was elected that they were brought home   well shortly there after yeah   or yeah shortly after   yeah so there was some collusion in there i guess   i think a lot of people were disappointed because they had been held hostage for so long   and i think thats part of the problem why people dont vote anymore because of of its just out of peoples hands and they say one vote means a lot but   but is a lot enough people   it used to i dont think it one vote means means diddly anymore   no but if enough people think like that then it does you know   yeah but but people get disillusioned too   well well if i knew more about it like i said if they would get some kind of educational program out there where just anybody can learn   um probably one of the local do they have adult ed classes at some of the local schools   oh im sure they do   where they teach uh you know like political science or something   i dont know i could check into that   yeah because you because it might give you uh an insight you know uh you have to vote ive always ive always voted i even though sometimes its hard to choose between whose running   uhhuh right well wasnt it i know i cant remember i think i guess it was when Ferraro Ferraro is that her name when her and uh i cant remember who was running for president with her i just remember she was going to be vice   um oh uh Ferraro yeah Geraldine   yeah who was running with her who was her running mate   uh i dont remember
