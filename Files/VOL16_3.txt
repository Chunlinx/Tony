                              The Past As Prologue            The diary that Samuel Pepys kept from the the firstday of  till he thought he was losing hiseyesight eight and a half years later can tell us a lotabout how the English language has changed or remainedmore or less constant over the last three and ahalf centuries  There may be other sources equallyrich in examples for comparison but there can hardlybe another that is at the same time so much fun to readand accessible  Moreover the Restoration periodwhen Pepys kept his diary is a good time to comparewith ours because by then the basis of modern Englishhad been laid down by the Elizabethans            For a mechanical and therefore objective lexicalcomparison I did a spelling check with my QA softwareon the first two paragraphs of Times August  cover story on anchor woman Diane Sawyerand on the slightly longer first entry in Pepyss Diary dated January    Except for propernames the spelling checker stopped on two wordsin the Time paragraphs that were not in its lexiconshow biz and credentialed   Likewise two words inPepyss entry gave pause to the checker thoughthey are not so much lost words as obsolete forms ofwords hath and doth   I should add that where Pepysphonetically wrote then he meant than and that heused the adjective handsome to describe his financialcondition as we would rarely do today  Neverthelessthe spellingcheck test provides some indicationthat English vocabulary has not discarded asmany words over the past three centuries as onemight expect  Our vocabulary has rather beenswollen by these centuries of technological breakthroughsand social and political revolutions            Though such words as betimes and whither andsuch forms as doth and hath have dropped out ofordinary usage todays Englishspeaking reader ofaverage education can read most of the Diary withoutencountering any word that would send him tohis dictionary  In fact so rapidly does our vocabularycontinue to expand by the addition of such technicalneologisms as AIDS or star wars and such borrowingsas zaftig and ayatollah that a reader of ourday could well be more taxed to know the meaningsof all the words in yesterdays newspaper than tounderstand all of the Diary             Besides the lexicon grammarespecially syntaxhaschanged somewhat too though again notso much as to be incomprehensible to the averagemodern reader  On the one hand Pepyss Englishmay seem slightly stilted or Biblical by modern standardswith frequent absolute constructions and theuse of do as an auxiliary for affirmative verbs whereno emphasis is intended as for example in his entryfor August   where he thanks AlmightyGod who doth most manifestly bless me in my endeavorsto do the duty of my officeI now savingmoney and my expenses being very little  This casualuse of the auxiliary do seems to be creeping backinto English usage especially among waiters forsome reason who are increasingly wont to announceAs the catch of the day we do have redsnapper Ordinarily though in Americanspeech the auxiliary do is reserved for negative orinterrogative statements as in Dont do it or Do youdo it  or for emphasis particularly in rebuttal as inBut I do do it   We have gained a handy distinctionhere  On the other hand Pepyss English while familiarenough to us may sound slightly nonstandardas where pasttense forms and past participles arecoalesced  Pepys writes just as we might say butought not write  running up and downwith their arses bare being beat by the watchOctober              The progressive tense occurs in Pepyss Diary as for example in his entry for February  She was dressing herself by the fireand theretook occasion to show me her leg but he uses itmuch less than we do  For us it has practically replacedthe future tense as when we say Im goingto town tomorrow  Contractions are even rarer inthe Diary but do occur for example in his entry forSeptember   Says that Knepp wont takepains enough            More surprising than evident but relatively insignificantdifferences between the language inPepyss Diary and our everyday language are thewords and expressions that have persisted in Englishfor more than three centuries without having evergained full acceptance  For instance take I whencompounded with another pronoun or a noun in theobjective case as in Between you and I   Eveneducated speakers nowadays often use I in combinationswhere me is prescribed  There is an academiclegend that this solecism is a hypercorrection forcedinto our American English when generations ofschoolmarms pounded into the heads of generationsof schoolchildren that they must not say me in suchcombinations as me and Johnny done it   Not so  SamuelPepys never confused by an American schoolmarminvariably so far as I have found used I insteadof me when the pronoun was combined withanother pronoun or noun as the object of a verb orpreposition  To cite a few examples  did takemy wife and I to the Queenes presenceChamber November    who pleased mywife and I  December    MrsSarah talking with my wife and I October   if God send my wife and I to live May   and This morning up with mightykind words between my poor wife and I November   Pepys does not use they and its inflectedforms as an indefinite singular pronounnearly as commonly as we do in such constructionsas Everyone on their feet but in his entry forMarch   he writes  everybody endeavouringto excuse themselfs  And in his entryfor October   we find  till they sendfor me where the subject is no one in particularSimilarly who in the objective case appears to havebeen on the threshold of acceptance into standardEnglish for more than three hundred years  Pepysrepeatedly uses the pronoun so for instance Burroughs who I took in and drank with August   However in his entry for August   wefind  whom I was pleased with all the dayAs for lay for lie  whose force of usage has by nowalmost won acceptance into the standard languagewe find in Pepyss entry for June   found not a man on board her a ship and herlaying so near them was a main temptation to themto come on  Compare this with Kiplings Wherethe old Flotilla lay where lay is the past tense oflie             There are also in Pepyss Diary words andphrases that have been admitted to our standard languagebut that still sound a bit colloquial  This is mewhich we find in his entry for October   hasfinally been accepted into standard English thoughit took three centuries and Winston Churchills fiatto do it  When Pepys writes mad usually he meansangry just as Americans do today  whichmakes our merchants mad February    Tellingof annoyances on October   he twicewrites  which did make me mad as well asI begun heartily to sweat and be angry  Todaythis meaning of mad is more at home in Americanthan in British English  The same can be said of certainother of Pepyss locutions for example the pastparticiple gotten instead of got  who were bythis time gotten most of them drunk June             In general one tends to find confirmed in thelanguage of the Diary the relative conservatism ofAmerican as contrasted with British standard EnglishSo far as dialects are concerned I know Britishdialects too little to say  But there is in the Diary alocution that I have encountered only there I believein Shakespeare and commonly though lessand less in the speech of West Texas farmers likedto  as in That ol boy like to of killed hisself orin Pepyss entry for April   the purser had like to have been drowned had it not beenfor a rope            In the three hundred years since Pepys the generaldrift of English has been towards a Chinese kindof grammer with loss and confusion of inflection andwith phrases used as words  A carelessness about inflectionin Pepyss day is shown above with the examplesof the objective I and who   Rarer back thenwas the use of whole phrases as single words as forinstance to quickly and efficiently do this job wherethe verb and two adverbs are treated together as asocalled split infinitive marked by to instead of theprescribed to do this job quickly and efficientlywhere only do is the infinitive marked as such by toand modified by two adverbs  So it comes as somethingof a surprise to find a clause in the  Diarythat sounds like wording in a television commercialI saw the so much by me desired picture of myLady Castlemayne October   Pepys alsohas a tendency to omit subject pronouns remindingone of television commercials Had a bowl ofWhamo this morning  Feel great a trim musculartype in a TV commercial might exclaim soundingrather like Pepys when he wrote over three centuriesago Dined with Mr Stephens July  or Lay long in bed July              Pepyss Diary owes its eventual status as a classicto its candor and the authors privileged positionas an observer of Restoration England  But he didhave a style of his own that should be taken intoconsideration in any evaluation of the language ofhis Diary   His English as suits the dairy of so exuberantand impatient a man and a stenographeramong other things strikes us as almost telegraphicin its compression  It is doubtful that in conversationhe would ever remark Up early  or Up betimesthe phrases with which he so often beginshis dairy entries  But allowing that the languageis well adapted to a stenographers very private diaryand of its particular time and place we find littlethat is obscurely archaic in its style  Despite suchinteresting differences as are noted above the languageof Pepyss journal however dated is not genericallyunlike what we might expect to find in asecret journal kept by a yuppie bureaucrat of ourtimes            Reference throughout this essay is to The Diaryof Samuel Pepys  edited by Robert Latham and WilliamMatthews

remember even thesethings                              Stuff and Nonsense            One of the wonders of the English language isthat it contains so many words about wordsthemselves  Among the most colorful and intriguingare those that describe the piffle prattle twaddleand flapdoodle that people in all talks of life tend tospew forth  Here is a small start on a glossary of glossolaliaa demidictionary of drivel that lists the varietiesof verbal obfuscation and explains the etymologiesof these often playful terms                           Applesauce an American variant is apple sass which has come to designate a camouflage of flatteryis excessively sweet mushy pulpy and insubstantialand thrifty boarding houses serve an abundanceof the stuff to divert awareness from thescarcity of more nourishing fare  A similar connectionis made between senseless banter and baloneyeponymously descended from Bologna the Italiancity where workers turned out a type of sausagecrammed with odds and ends from slaughter includingsome say assmeat  It is but a short step from thecheapest ground cold cuts to cheap talk and thesame steps takes up from tripe the walks of the firstand second stomachs of ruminants to worthlessfoolish speech  Adding to the pile of verbal garbageis balderdash which reaches back to the late thcentury and originally meant a hodgepodge of liquorssuch as wine mixed with beer perfect forwashing down a mishmash of pretentious and frivolousblather  Bosh looks as typically British as balderdashyet it actually descends from the Turkishadjective bos empty useless  The word becamepopular in England in the early th centurythrough the oriental romances and memories of JamesMorier who enhanced his exotic tales with Turkishterms            Spook etymology misinforms us that babble is aBiblical reference to Genesis  in which thepeople of Babel Babylon built a tower reaching toheaven and incited God to confound their languageThe less romantic truth is that babble descends fromthe Middle English babelon and is probably of imitativeorigin echoing the ba ba sounds typically madeby infants in their repetitive chatter  Blarney andbunk on the other hand do hail from the names ofactual places  Blarney refers to the Blarney stonelocated in Blarney Castle a few miles north of CorkIreland  Those who kiss the Blarney stone are reputedto be able to charm the pants off everyoneever after  Bunk is a shortening of bunkum itself arespelling for Buncomber County North Carolinawhose congressional representative once remarkedthat he was only talking for Buncombe                           Claptrap turns out to be a show biz metaphorfor highsounding but empty language  The wordwas originally a theatrical term for a showy trick orpatch of highflown grandiose language that actorswould use to attract trap applause claps fromtheir audiences  Another rhyming reduplicationmumbo jumbo is probably borrowed from a word inAfrican Mandingo Mama Dyumbo was a deity whohelped husbands to bewilder wives whom they suspectedof talking too much            The poet William Cowper once wrote philologistswho traceA panting syllable through time andspaceStart it at home and hunt

whence we get decalcomania  decal forshort for the transfers and the adjective cockamamiesome say echoes the sense of florid but superficialembellishment  Hogwash of course is a designationfor language as worthless disgusting and unfitfor human consumption as pig slops            Puffy bureaucratic verbiage if often called gobbledygooka word credited to Texas congressmanMaury Maverick who compared the tortuous andtorturous prose of Washington bureaucrats to thesenseless gobbling of turkeys  Maverick made theword famous with a World War II memorandum denouncingthe bloated language found

as teachers in a churchschool  Call us missionaries to make it simple  Ofthe  different languages in the country welearned two  One was Melanesian Pidgin which besidesEnglish and Hiri Motu is one of the officiallanguages of the country  The second language welearned was Kte pronounced kawtay an area languagespoken by only several thousand people  Livingand working overseas with people of anotherculture and language made us realize how complicatedcommunication can be            Speech is the most obvious form of communicationBut using speech to communicate is more thanI said he said or they said  Sometimes thewords we use are the sounds of the communicatingwhispering cackling prattling chuckling chortlingmumbling grumbling  Other words suggest motivesbehind the speech lying gossiping negotiatingplotting  Speech is certainly more than plugging invocabulary words to express a thought  We had tolearn nuances of meaning which were not found indictionaries            The Pidgin word tok by itself means talk andits synonyms in both verb and noun forms  Whereasin English there are totally different words to expressdifferent aspects of speech the word tok combineswith

further  Using no wordsat all you can express joy sorrow anger disgustskepticism ridicule criticism fear and many otheremotions  Tone of voice facial expressions placementof arms and body stance all contribute to nonverbalcommunication of feelings  In practical termswe had to learn not only to choose our words verycarefully but to be aware of what we said in nonverbalways  We occasionally used in English as a safelanguage for discussion or making decisions whenthere were no English speakers around  We wereaware that they were reading the cues of intonationand body language to get an idea about how the discussionwas going  We only hoped they would notmisread the cues  We too tried to read their nonverbalcues when they spoke too quickly for us tounderstand or when they used an uncommon languagewith which they alone were familiar            There can be however a danger in relying on alanguage for secrecy  One missionary told of thetime his family went home to Germany on furloughTheir children did not realize others spoke Germanbut rather thought it was their familys personal privatelanguage  So one of the children standing in acustoms line in Frankfurt shouted Look Dad seethat great big FAT lady            Even if you become skilled at controlling nonverbalmeans of communication there are still othercultural assumptions and traditions you cannot knowabout without proper briefing  We had heard frommissionaries in other countries that American waysof doing things may be insulting to the nationals  InIndia for example it is a great insult to offer

insult  This sounds easy enough to avoid untilyou consider how many times you cross your legswhen sitting at meetings on a bus or in a restaurant            In Papua New Guinea PNG women hiss andboo at other women who step across rows of foodspread on the ground at the marketplace for womenare unclean and must take proper steps to insurethe purity of the food being handled  Even symboliccontamination is taken very seriously  Boys at one ofthe high schools refused to eat the rice prepared fortheir meal because one of them had seen some girlssitting on the bales of rice stacked in the school pantrythey considered the rice unclean and thereforeinedible            Much of what is appropriate in one country isnot in another and vice versa  In the US the firstquestions we ask small children with whom we areconfronted are Whats your name  and How oldare you  In PNG those two questions are the wrongquestions to ask  The first question is inappropriatebecause names are private  The people believe thatevil spirits can control you if they know your nameMost Papua New Guineans therefore have severalextra names depending on who needs to knowschool government or church  But they have oneprivate hidden name which remains a family secretThe second question How old are you  is onewhich might get you a puzzled look or a blank stareMost adults and nearly all children neither knownor care when they were born  The parent might beable to tell you Now lets seeshe was born theyear we had that big flood  But as a practical considerationage in years has nothing to do with anythingChildren go to school when the parents andvillage elders feel they are ready for it  The passingof each year of ones life is celebrated generally foreveryone as Christmas finishes and the New Yeararrives  The language even reflects this for the Pidginword for birthday is Krismas  Besides theirconcept of time is circular not linear so marking thepassage of time is not as important as celebrating thereturn of seasonal events            The phrase communication gap takes on newmeanings in another culture  Our views about howwell we are communicating are often misleading abetter phrase might be communication ravineThere is a classic case and true we are told of amisunderstanding between a missionary and hiscook  The missionary told the cook what to preparefor dinner Go out and catch that old rooster pluckit and put it in the refrigerator  Well cook it laterSeveral hours later the missionary opened the refrigeratordoor only to find one very angry nakedrooster staring at him he hadnt told the cook to killit first  Meanwhile what do you suppose the cooktold his family that night when they asked why hewas so tattered and scratched Youll never guesswhat that crazy missionary asked me to do today            Symbols are still another form of communicationDrivers use symbols all the time to know howand where to drive  Olympic games participantsmust identify symbols in order to find everythingfrom locker rooms to Telex machines  Despite thegrowing use of internationally recognized symbolseach country has its own unique cultural and artisticsymbols which are baffling to outsiders  ManyPapua New Guineans can look at the face of anotherPapua New Guineanon the street or in a picturebookand tell you which part of the country thatperson is from  They know by style of facepaintingand headdress where a singsing dancer is from andthey can look at designs on carvings or woven stringbags and say where the work originated  Many ofthese designs and symbols tell stories of their peopleand have meanings which are unknown to Westerners            One missionary who for years had lived andworked in a city on the north coast told us of oneenormous mistake made for just that reason  Agroup of expatriate engineers was called in to designand build a high school  The designers decided thatthe local people would like the school better if it haddesigns with which the people were familiar  Sothey chose from a story board an elaborate carvingshowing the history of the people in that area asymbol which wasto themabstract  This symbolbecame the logo for the school and was used oneverything from school letterhead to the sign infront of the building  When the school opened noneof the students came  The designers were baffledand asked for advice from this longtime missionaryHe took the problem back to the local village elderswho explained why the school was being boycottedthe logo chosen was from that part of the villagehistory which described an enemy arriving to rapeall the young women of the tribe  That symbol wasthe most repugnant part of their whole history andit was an embarrassment to have it plastered on signsand papers all over town  To Westerners it was aneat design to the people it was a symbol ofgreat shame            Conversely we saw Tshirts imported boughtand worn by people who had no idea what the symbolsor words meant  One young girl wore a shirtwith MILK MILK printed on it corresponding tothe appropriate part of her anatomy beneath theshirt  A church elder who stood up to read the lessonin the church service wore a shirt that read I doit every night  Even had they known English milkwould seem a tame enough word and it might likelyrefer to something as innocent as brushing onesteeth or going to sleep            Being a native speaker is still not enough in thegame of communication  Because of historical politicaland economic ties between Australia and PapuaNew Guinea there are many Australians living andworking in PNG and many Papua New Guineanswho learn English as Australians speak it  So in shopsand offices all over the country we encounteredEnglish but not as we were accustomed to hearing itspoken  What would you buy if your neighbor gaveyou a shopping list asking for capsicum silver beetmince and jelly  She would expect green peppersSwiss chard hamburger and JellO  Or whatif she offered your child a cordial  All she wouldbe giving him is KoolAid  Or what would you thinkif the gentleman down the street said What alovely baby  May I nurse him  He would only beasking to hold the baby  If you were invited out forsupper your hostess would serve cake and coffeewhile an invitation to tea would be for the eveningmeal            Translating can be a treacherous means of communicationtoo  Although we did not translate morethan our own class notes or study materials for thestudents we could sympathize with people whosesole job was translation  Literal translations havebeen troublesome to missionaries for years  In Chinesethe Biblical phrase Your sins were as scarletthey shall be white as snow simply does not workRed is the color for weddings and celebrationswhite is the color of death and mourning  Interestinglythe word for white person and corpseare nearly identical in the Kte language qangqangand ng ng respectively                        Key words presented some of the worstproblems  Grace is almost impossible to translatebecause their cultural assumptions allow no possibilityfor a truly free gift  There is a basic suspicion thatno kind of gift earthly or heavenly can possiblycome without strings attached  The Kte wordsmang jaung literally care from the heartbelly arenot too bad a translation for love  However thereare only two possibilities for translating love in Pidginneither of which is satisfactory  One is laikim asin I love ie like cucumbers  The other isgivim bel which literally means give the heartbelly but which commonly means to make pregnantBelieve it or not it is the latter phrase whichhas been chosen to translate the word love as foundin the Bible  Those sorts of translation difficultiesleave room for a lot of explaining            While we worked in Papua New Guinea thechances for miscommunication were myriad  Hardwork combined with luck eventually bridged theravines  We derived great pleasure from attemptingto unravel the languages and their cultures and wefound that the desire to understand and to be understoodcomes early in life remains long and seems tobe universal            The difference

       I dont know about you but I tend to get a touchirritated by book titles encountered in the mediaand elsewhere that seem slightly deviant  Deviantthat is from standard English or from whatone is expecting  Some titles are catchy and easy toremember like HG Wells Kipps  or PaulTherouxs The Old Patagonian Express  andsome are less memorable such as Frank MoorhousesTales of Mystery and Romance  orCarlyles On Heroes HeroWorship and the Heroicin History   But at least they are reasonablystraightforward and comprehensible            What I am getting at are titles with skew spellingsrogue punctuation and weird and wonderfulnames and words that are difficult to relate to anythingmeaningful            Why for example does Bruce Chatwins highlyreadable collection of anecdotes and aperus WhatAm I doing Here  have no question mark  Orcome to that why didnt he call it What I Am DoingHere  What is the significance if any of this smalldeviation from the norm  And what was StephenKing up to calling his novel Pet Semetary Even Garrison Keillors lovely Lake Wobegon Days had me worried  Why should I make an extraeffort to remember that the name of the stlake in Minnesota as he describes it is a twistedversion of woebegone  The trouble with such offspellings and punctuations is that you really need toremember two extra things on top of the little itselffirst that the title is deviant and second how it isdeviant            However the fact remains that all through literrarytitles in English there are such irritants and Ithought I might as well tackle the issue head on andsee where the longstanding and popularly perpetratedsnags lay  I offer my findings in the hopes thatfellow readers and media followers will be able tosee some light in this particular thicket as I think Ican myself discern now            Let us take the matter of name spellings firstwhether personal names or place names real namesor fictitious ones  Here are some classics Smollettsnovel is Humphry Clinker  not HumphreyRichardsons is Clarissa Harlowe  not HarlowDefoes is Robinson Crusoe  notCruso Rider Haggards is Allan Quatermain not Quartermain or Quatermaine  Aslap on the wrist here to William Rose Bents TheReaders Encyclopedia and Kenneth McLeishsBloomsbury Good Reading Guide which respectivelygive the latter misspellings  Also in thisgroup I would say are Emily Bronts WutheringHeights  not Weathering Withering orany similar fancy and admittedly more trickily AldousHuxleys Crome Yellow  not Chromealthough of course the pun on this word is intentionalCrome is the name of a house just asWuthering Heights is  And we can convenientlyadd a couple of pausecausing poetic titles here tooThomas Moores Lalla Rookh  and not a jototherwise and Tennysons The Lady of Shalott not Shallot which makes the lady smackstrongly of veganism            It is only one small step from such pitfalls tothose holding punctuational and related snares thelatter often involving the problem of whether a titleis one word or two  The apostrophe has much toanswer for here as it does in everyday English  Solet us note James Joyces novel is Finnegans Wake not Finnegans E M Forsters isHowards End  another house name by theway not Howards and a potential double delusionShakespeares famous play is Loves LaboursLost  with two apostrophes  The first of theseis the possessive the second represents the vowel ofis   The Joyce title is typical of the authors linguisticallyinventive but allusive style and is actually acompound of two proper names that of FinnMaCool the Irish folkhero and Tim Finnegan thehero of a musichall ballad who sprang to life in themiddle of his own wake            Hyphens can cause difficulties too  So Melvillewrote MobyDick  and John Buchans autobiographywas called Memory HoldtheDoor but Robertson Davies wrote Tempest Tost with no hyphen  As for the oneortwowordproblem Walter Scott wrote Redgauntlet  andJohn Buchan again named his novel of Scottish adventureHuntingtower             While were about it we should not overlookColeridges poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner not Rhyme or Byrons Childe HaroldsPilgrimage  not Child or Ruskins Arrowsof the Chace  not Chase  Both Byrons andRuskins wayward words are directly related to theirmodern equivalents but have essentially historicspellings            And there we have another whole river to crosssince some of the bestknown literary works haveretained their historic titles complete with outmodedspellings and punctuations  Spenser is notoriouslytroublesome here with The Shepheardes Calender The Faerie Queene  and MotherHubberds Tale  among the greatest hazardsIn a sense it seems illogical that we have retainedthe historic spellings for Spensers works yet usemodern spellings for the titles of plays by his contemporaryWilliam Shakespeare  But perhaps it isjust as well that we have A Midsummer NightsDream  not A Midsommer nights dream  as itoriginally was when first published and Henry theFifth or Henry V   not Henry the fift   A latertitle but still with oldeworlde spelling is IzaakWaltons The Compleat Angler  which oddlyenough seems to present little problem            What can cause a bout of headscratching is decidingwhether the definite or indefinite article isinvolved  One Shakespeare play that quite oftengoes wrong is The Winters Tale The notAwhile Jerome K Jerome giving no trouble atall with Three Men in a Boat  followed it upby taking the same characters on a tour of Germanyin Three Men on the Bummel   The last wordof this is the name of a river so A is quite out oforder  Kenneth McLeish once again hold yourhand out            A sort of juvenile oneoff here spellingwise isDaisy Ashfords charming novel written when shewas only nine  The Young Visiters   The authoressmay be excused her youthful slip but onceshe has made it we are obliged to preserve itAmong the true deviants the titles that are neitherimmediately nor even sometimes ever really meaningfulalthough they may become so during thereading of the book are the miniminefields of suchas Lisa Althers Kinflicks  Mervyn PeakesGormenghast  and Peter Careys Illywhacker            Of course similar titular problems occur in areasoutside literature too  Vaughan Williamss chillysymphony that developed out of his music for theBritish hero movie Scott of the Antarctic was actually entitled Sinfonia Antartica which seems rather perverse  And John Gays greatestbut much more lighthearted work was calledThe Beggars Opera  singular not pluralEven more obviously in the world of

    Literacy and numeracy have come to the fore inrecent years as major issues not only or even somuch in the Third World as in the industrializednations  Leaving numeracy aside for the momentthose of us who have studied linguistics have usuallybeen told that as language is essentially spoken itswritten form is of lesser or no importance for theanalysis of language  That is patent rubbish ofcourse for it can easily be demonstrated that writtenlanguage cannot be ignored for a variety of reasonsthe more formalized versions of language that arereflected there the relatively complex constructionsthat are accepted as normal to writing but would bedifficult to construct viva voce and difficult to assimilateunless read the preservation of fossilizedformsboth words and grammarmade possibleby written records and so on  These and other featuresof writing have an undeniable effect on languageand it would be foolish to ignore them justbecause language is at bottom an oral means ofcommunication  That is not to say that writing andspeech should be measured by the same yardsticksonly that writing cannot be ignored in a propertreatment of language            Writing has not been ignored entirely by writerson language but its role has been consistentlyunderplayed  Coulmass clear exposition of the historyof writing systems traces the development ofvarious kinds of writing systemsideographic pictographicmorphemic syllabic phonemic and phoneticthroughhistory discussing them individuallydescribing how certain ancient scripts weredeciphered and presenting his cogent arguments forregarding at least some aspects of language throughthe analysis of writing  It is only through their writtenforms that we know anything at all about certainlanguages and the written forms of others serve toconfirm the findings of diachronic linguistics in positingthe pronunciation and sources of longdeadtongues            It is generally conceded that writing was inventedbecause of the need to keep records as civilizationsbecame more complex  Scholars generallyagree that the use of a numerical marking systempreceded attempts at developing methods for transcribinglanguage per se  I find in accepting that factsome interesting implications for theories about howthe mind works and in particular its capacity forabstracting  It must be emphasized of course thatlanguage preceded numeracy but it is interesting tosee how very early in mans acculturation the abilityto deal with the abstract notion of counting manifesteditself and was then transferred into an encodableform  In its most primitive form a record mightconsist of bits of clay similar in shape to those of theitems being counted for identification the quantityof bits being equal to the number of items countedSubsequently the clay bits were replaced by markseven as we make them today  with a picture ofwhat was being counted pots or sheaves of grainincised alongside the count  Much later to savespace the  was to be replaced by a single symbolsay   Meanwhile the picture of the grain sheafwas itself to be replaced by a shorthand version andthat is where things begin to get complicated  I havealready simplified Coulmass description out of allsensible recognition for the sake of brevity butwhile the time compression has been severe I donot think I have distorted the facts            For us who can read and count and take such mattersso much for granted it seems impossible to believethat it took more than  years  BCfor the Sumerians to reduce their cuneiform characterinventory from  to about   As they were overrunand absorbed by the Akkadians by  BC eventhat might be viewed as a bootless economy  While itmust be noted that the cuneiform system based on apattern of wedgelike signs impressed in clay by a speciallycut reed stylus served several Mesopotamiancultures for about  years it was used for writingseveral languages of diverse structures Sumerian wasan agglutinative language in structure of the type ofAmerican Indian languages Hungarian etc Akkadianwas a Semitic language similar in structure to Hebrewthe Elamites spoke a language of which weknow little but it is interesting to note that about BC they changed from the script writing systemthey had been using to cuneiform and in the shorttime of less than  years had reduced the number ofsymbols to   The Hittites who spoke a languagewith some IndoEuropean characteristics also wrotein cuneiform as did the speakers of Old Persian a trueIndoEuropean language  Indeed it was the trilingualOld Persian Elamite and NeoBaby lonianinscription of Darius that provided the key for thedecipherment of several ancient writings  Ugaritic anotherSemitic language was also written in cuneiform            Cuneiform writing thus served different functionsthat is from its original use for pictograms itbecame stylized to the point where the images wereunrecognizable without decoding  As the speakersof various languages applied it to their needs it becamesomewhat more sophisticated the Elamitesfor example were able to economize on the numberof symbols by assigning to most of them syllabicidentity a major step toward the development ofalphabetic writing  In his description of writing systemsCoulmas adopts the designations applied by WHaas namely pleremic to describe the lexemicmorphemiclevel and cenemic to describe the syllabicphoneticphonemic level  Although the author isquick to point out that these classifications are notmutually exclusive even in the oldest extant writingthat has been interpreted they provide a convenientpoint of departure for descriptions of what is goingon in a writing system  Thus we might conclude thatEgyptian hieroglyphics are largely pleremic whileour modern alphabetic system is largely cenemicthough neither is exclusively so            One of the more fascinating subjects dealt within this book is the decipherment of written languagesThose who have read the books by LeonardCottrell and Michael Ventris and know about Champollionsdecipherment of the Rosetta Stone will findthis chapter extremely interesting  It is worth notingthat decipherment of such archaeological materialsdiffers from modern code decipherment because forthe latter we can assume that a modern language wasencoded while in the former there are often noclues to the nature of the language to what extent itis pleremic or cenemic where word breaks occurif indeed the language had words as we knowthem in English and in many instances even theorder in which the symbols were recorded            There is much in this book to inspire the readerThose who advocate spelling reform are referred tothe chapter on the alphabet from which the followingis quotedEtymological SpellingIn many orthographies purely phonemic representationsof words are corrupted for the sake ofgraphically preserving their etymologies  For examplebreakfast continues to be spelled withea although the first vowel of the word is because it is etymologically related to the verb tobreak  The w in acknowledge points to its etymologicalrelation with to know  Silent letterssuch as l in folk k in knife or w in wrestleare etymological remnants rather than representationsof phonological units  Silent e inEnglish occurs in many affixes of Latin andFrench origin such as for instance able ageance ate and ative and is therefore statisticallyassociated with words originating from these languagesEtymological spelling is common in learnedwords especially words of Latin origin  Sign insignal and paradigm in paradigmatic are spelledphonemically but as isolated words they containa letter g which has no counterpart in thephonemic representation  Medicinemedical andrighteousright are similar pairs where the rationalefor the spelling of the first lies in the relationwith the second  In this way the spelling of aword often relates to that of other words belongingto the same paradigm or to its own historyThe hmuet in many French words such ashoneur humeur hpital humide hiver etc isetymological testifying to their Latin origin  InEnglish too the spelling of the correspondingwords can be regarded as etymological with theadded peculiarity that they also exemplify themechanism of spelling pronunciation becausethey were borrowed for English from Frenchrather than from Latin at a time when theh was no longer pronounced in Frenchpp                         There are other arguments for preserving spellingmentioned by Coulmas among them paradigmaticsimilarity eg for preserving the relationshipbetween anxious and anxiety and in German betweenTag tak and Tage tag word representationeg liaison in French homograph avoidancein English eg bearbare hairhare  and in Germaneg Wagen car wagen dare Arm arm armpoor loanword identification eg writing ofwords of Greek origin with ch as in chronologypsychology  rather than k and with ph as inphilosophy sophisticate  rather than f  If spellingreformers had their way and spelling matched pronunciationthen the spelling would have to be differentfor each dialect of English  Such a situationdid prevail in the earliest beginnings of the writingof Greek in which can be seen the truest forerunnerof the modern alphabet as an artifact it is valuableto us as a key to studying ancient Greek dialectsapplied to modern English it would contribute nothingmore than utter confusion  Moreover if such anapproach were adopted could we expect to seespellings change periodically as pronunciationschanged            Today albeit with certain adjustments we canread the writings of Shakespeare and with somewhatmore sophisticated adaptation those of Chaucerthough they are respectively  and years old  We cannot always be sure we understandwhat we are reading but that is another matter  Ifwe were to adopt a phonetic system of spelling it isunlikely that our greatgrandchildren would be ableto read anything written in the th century  Itmight be argued that the writing should be phonemicnot phonetic but phonemes change toothough more slowly  As Coulmas points out the alphabetis far from perfect but were we to institute asimplified spelling system we would be destroyingthe very unity that the written language accordsto the many millions around the globe who can readEnglish            Purists always seem bent on the preservation ofan older stage of the language  Were that undertakenwe should soon find that the traditional formwould become frozen in writing and on the tonguesof purists and pedants while the continuouslychanging language of the marketplace moved onwardThe term applied to this rather unhealthy situationis diglossia  which does exist in Sinhalese spokenin Sri Lanka  Professor CoulmasLiterary Sinhalese obtained its standard in thefourteenth century AD and this standard is respectedby the whole speech community  Thebelief that the Literary language is superiormore beautiful more logical and more correctprevails at every level of the society  This attitudeis typical of diglossia  It implies that in aspeech community where illiteracy is widespreada large part of the population has very little esteemfor the only variety they speak  p The quotation is from one of Coulmass manysources                        There is of course no final word on this subjectbut I should like to add one more brief quotationthat strikes at the heart of the matterWriting is not and never was a means oftranscribing speech sounds but is rather an instrumentof visually representing language bymeans of relating visual signs in various differentways which are more or less faithful to thespeech sounds of a given language at a giventime                        This review is not the place to take up the cudgelagainst purism or spelling reform but I could notresist adducing such apt comments as can be foundin this work            I have seldom seen so clear an exposition of anycomplex subject as that presented by Coulmas  Thetext is punctuated here and there by tables showingthe progressive development of selected symbolsas for example in Sumerian the Devanagari

UnconventionalEnglish            This is an abridgment of the eighth edition of ADictionary of Slang and Unconventional English byEric Partridge edited by Paul Beale and publishedin   Born in  Partridge died in  PaulBeale has picked up the reins in an able manner andcontinues to charge ahead  This edition thoughabridged is said to contain much material not includedin the  edition published in the US byMacmillan  Moreover it contains only termsknown to have arisen in the Twentieth Centuryaccording to the Preface but omits the militaryslang of the earlier th century  I am inclined toquestion the accuracy about the terms known tohave arisen in the th century for I found quite afew of much earlier date but that can scarcely be anadverse criticism            As in the case of most of Partridges books theexception being Catch Phrases which I didnt thinkmuch of this dictionary  CDS  makes good browsingfodder and resembles the earlier books in style sufficientlyto satisfy those familiar with the format  PersonallyI find it irritating to find entries with severaldefinitions in which numbers are given to  and onwardbut not to I a practice I simply cannot understandReaders ought not be put off by the numberof pages for this is a largeformat book with a fairamount of text            The CDS however will not fill the needs ofthose looking for American slang unless they are interestedin those British slang terms that were borrowedfrom America and elsewhere  With experienceone becomes accustomed to the arrogance ofthe British who consider the term English to be proprietarywith the understood meaning British Englishpresumably implying that all other Englishesshould carry a label the only place where  real English is spoken being Britain  As it happens ofcourse there are more distinctive dialects of Englishin Britain than in North America and anyone whohas spent any time listening to them knows thatsome are mutually unintelligible  Linguistic chauvinismmight be understandable were we discussingRP that is the Received Pronunciation of the prestigesouthern British dialect but if that is the casein the present instance we must then be looking at adictionary of RP Slang whatever that might beThe value of the book is not diminished by its beingabout British slang but considering the percentageof the content that is attributable to American Australianand Canadian slang mostly that part of nativeBritish slang that does not emerge as derivativehas an oldfashioned ring to it  It is at worst cruellydeceptive not to make it clear from the title or asubtitle that the books focus is British slang            That having been said let us turn to the contentat which point prudish readers might wish toturn to another page            Without laboring the point nudge nudge thefirst entry one turns to is fuck which in keepingwith the length and depth of the CDS  is what onemight call a quickie entry nudge nudge thoughthat sense appears under the entry quick one   I cannotclaim proficiency in slang but I do know that inaddition to the Scram sense of fuck off  a commonUS sense is goldbrick which is missing thoughcovered here under fucking the dog   Is it missingbecause it is not used in that sense in Britain or becauseit was cut and if the latter because it wentthe way of earlier thcentury military slang  Unfortunatelythere is no way one can determine theanswer without having the  edition to hand  Ifone had the  edition he might well resent havingto buy this book rather than a briefer and lessexpensive Supplement            One gets the strong impression that for thoseentries that are acknowledged as being of US Canadianor other origin the editor has very few if anycitations for most of the words and expressions arenot traced back very far  For example puddlejumperis defined as RAF  slang for a smallcommunications aircraft that might be coincidencebut it surely is of American origin traceable back tothe gear in which Uncle Don was wont to arrive forhis radio program on rainy days in the early sOn the cuff and off the cuff are in with no Americanprovenance mentioned and dated far too late sinces the term

identified the origin of a given expression asAmerican and eschew the information found in someof the secondary sources he resorted to for they areinconsistent in their accuracy  Despite my criticismof the inaccuracies of the US slang source material ifone focuses on the British material and takes theAmerican with a pinch of salt this book is very engagingand can provide anyone with many

                            The Cassell Concise English Dictionary            In September  preceding what has cometo be known as the Waterloo Conference on theOED because its first four annual meetings wereheld at the University of Waterloo Ontario membersof the European Association for LexicographyEURALEX held a symposium on dictionary reviewingBy the time I decided to attend the meetingwas overbooked and I could not get in  Besides TomMcArthur editor of English Today and Robert Ilsoneditor of The Oxford Journal of Lexicography I amnot sure who of those attending were reviewers ofdictionaries but I think that I can probably saywithout fear of contradiction that I have probablywritten and continue to write more reviews of Englishdictionaries and of other reference books andbooks on language than most other people  Quantityof course does not make up for quality yetsomething might be said for experience  I am surethat I would have learnt something and regret havingbeen turned away            As I did not attend I cannot say exactly whatwent on at the symposium but I got the impressionthat one of its results was to be the issuance ofguidelines for reviewers  Ha Well maybe notHa I think that what the symposiasts might havediscussed were criteria for assessing a dictionarywhich they would like to see adopted by the mediaand given to reviewers assigned or invited to writeabout such books  There is no doubt that the qualityof such reviews varies enormously  When assigning abook for review in other subjects editors are usuallyrather careful to try to find someone who knowssomething about the subject of the book it would beunusual to find a book on say archaeology reviewedby a rock musician and one on rock music reviewedby an archaeologist  But when it comes to dictionarieseditors appear to consider them fair game foralmost anyone and they often assign novelists towrite the review            There are novelists and there are novelists  I forone would not object to a dictionary review beingwritten by an Anthony Burgess or a Kurt VonnegutOn the other hand a novelist is presumably anyonewho has had a novel published as we knowsome of the most prolific novelists write as if theyknow little about the language and it would be ridiculouslyunfair to have such a person review a dictionaryDictionaries ought to be reviewed by professionallexicographers  Today many professionallexicographers are seen to have axes to grind becausethey work for competing publishers and editorsare reluctant to select them as reviewers becausefor obvious reasons they are seeking topublish unbiased reviews  Some of the dictionary reviewsthat have been published in the popular presshave been badnot unfavourable just reflective of alack of sufficient linguistic sophistication  It may beassumed that the reason for giving such writers dictionariesto review is that they are regarded as endusers  But the same editors do not select ordinaryreaders to review novels they pick other novelistsor professional literary critics in other words reviewerswho are competent to assess the work becausethey have a broad background in the literatureand are recognized as knowledgeable about thegenre            On the same grounds it is incumbent on editorsto engage as reviewers of dictionaries lexicographerswho are knowledgeable about the genre not amateurswho occasionally look up one word to see howit is spelt or another to find out what it means  Becauseanyone writing a review of any book ought tobe required to delineate the reasons for his approvalor disapproval of its style and content so any editorworth his salt should be able to detect in a properlywritten professional review of a dictionary by a lexicographerany untoward bias and to reject such areview or parts of it out of hand            There are many specialist fields represented in adictionaryphonetics semantics morphologyphonemics diachronic and comparative linguisticssymbology typography etcand the average dictionaryuser whether he be a novelist or not is illequipped academically to pass judgment on how agiven dictionary has dealt with such areas  As I wasnot at the symposium I can only assume that thesymposiasts concerned themselves less if at all withthe problem of trying to urge editors to engage professionallexicographers as reviewers than with theeffort of trying to ensure that editors be providedwith certain guidelines on How To Review A Dictionarywhich they fondly expect would be passedon to the selected amateur reviewers thereby makingthem competent professional reviewers a forlornhope at best            The foregoing is not entirely irrelevant to mycomments on the book at hand for it would be unfairto review it as a dictionary comparing it withother dictionaries  Rather it constitutes what publisherscall a package that is it contains a fairamount of lexicographic material but little or nothingthat is original  Such books are derivatives oflarger dictionaries in a publishers line pared downto make them smaller and not directly competitiveand priced lower  Oxford publishes a slightly smallerversion which they call their Pocket English Dictionarythough one is likely to find himself in deep disagreementwith his tailor if he wanted a pocket largeenough to hold the book  Most major dictionarypublishers put out Concise Compact Pocket VestPocket and other editions grabbing for marketsthat are pricemore than contentoriented  Generallyspeaking the smallest general dictionary inwhich one can expect to find fairly thorough treatmentof etymology pronunciation definitions and agood coverage of the language in a wide assortmentof entires is the socalled College or Desk dictionaryA bigger book usually needs a stand or its ownspot on a desk or table for it is too big and heavy todrag out of a bookcase every time it is needed  Thetwo larger onevolume works available are The RandomHouse Unabridged with  entries andthe MerriamWebstar Unabridged Third Editionwith about  entries  I cannot properlycount the Oxford English Dictionary nd Editionbecause of its cost about  and its size volumes besides it is not a work for everyday usebut for scholarly application being historical innature            In the context of the large number of dictionariesavailable including all their different editionsthe CCE is a serviceable work provided that one issatisfied with brief definitions of no great depthand essentially a dictionary than can be used as aspelling checker  These days spelling checkers areavailable to those who use personal computershence a dictionary for that purpose is of limited usefulnessOne useful function of dictionaries till recentlywas that they showed syllabic breaks enablingletter and novelwriters alike to discoverwhere to hyphenate words  Some word processingprograms now offer such a featurethe one I useFramework III AshtonTate is not bad at allandwriters as well as compositors and publishers seemto care less and less whether a word is hypenated inan acceptable manner  The CCE does have price torecommend it coming in at about half of what a collegeordesksized dictionary would cost            Inevitably there are the inconveniences and theoddities the pronunciation of masochistic or masochistically thus depriving the user of the informationthat the stresses have shifted  To those whomaintain Everybody knows that I reply that ifthat is the case then why bother buying or publishingdictionariesor for that matter anythingelseat all            Among the odder oddities under make appearsthe expression to make water defined as tourinate Naut to leak  These are both quite correctof course but their juxtaposition could create acurious confusion            The general production of the book is poor thepaper has too much seethrough causing the typeon the back of a page to interfere with the legibilitythe type is too gray the definitions are run into oneanother with semicolons in place of definition numbersmaking it difficult to distinguish senses and requiringone to read through a long entry beforecoming to the sense sought it is almost impossible todiscover where a new part of speech begins subentriesof idiomatic phrases and phrasal verbs are giventhe same prominence as headwords making themeasy to find but detracting from the headword treatmentand the substandard typography has createdmany loose lines which poor proofreading has failedto catch            As the explanatory notes are rather thin on

entry golden handcuff               n a payment or benefit given to an employeeas an inducement to continue working forthe same company                        raises the ludicrous  image of such a paymentor benefit being paid by someone other than theemployer            The entry for goldensyrup give a crossreferenceto syrup where it is not mentioned as I understandthe style this means that the

containing the un  words are a compositorsnightmare version of a designers aberration            The etymologies are too brief to be of any use            One wonders what goes on in publishers mindsit seems quite obvious to me that if this were a goodand serviceable inexpensive version of the dictionaryon which it is said to be based Cassells EnglishDictionary  then the publisher might well expectthat after a time the user would feel himself readyfor the larger book and would buy the largerCassells   In the event it seems unlikely that such anevent would take place for this book is a sad

unrelieved by a synonymor circumlocution  The poor overworked nounwas even used where neither it nor any alternatewas needed  Ill be staying at the refectory rectoryat could surely be at the church in

has been sentencedto eight years in prison for an ad campaignin which he premeditatedly employed an archaictense of a verb that appears on the FrenchCultural Ministrys Index of Officially ProscribedFranglaisms  He has also been sentenced to a concurrenteightyear term for using the verb in ananachronistic context            Lucien MatreCrche a yearold copywriterspecializing in fastfood accounts was foundguilty by a jury of eight men and four women ofdeliberately using the imperfect subjunctive tense ofthe franglaism jumbo frankfurter in a series of adsposted in the Paris Metro system  Jumbo Frankfurteris a French corruption of the American expressionjumbo frankfurter  and is used in French as a verbmeaning literally to eat a large hot dog            The expression is one of several hundred thatthe French government has forbidden in all officialcommunications as well as in all public advertisingLegal penalties vary according to the context inwhich the word is used the gender in the case ofnouns and the tense and mood in the case ofverbs  Thus while it is a misdemeanor to employthe expression jumbo frankfurter in public discourseto date only one person has been charged with theoffense a Libyan terrorist who asked for a large hotdog during his arraignment for blowing up an artmuseum in Dijon  MatreCrche on the otherhand was charged with a felony punishable by amaximum prison sentence of  years because theterm was not used in the ephemeral innocuouscontext of speech according to the prosecutor butin the seminonephemeral culturally reverberativecontext of advertising  He will begin servinghis sentence immediately            The cause of MatreCrches legal troubles wasa poster depicting Rabelais famous comic figureGargantua staring forlornly at an empty hotdog rolland sighing Que jeusse bien aim jumbo frankfurtheraujourdhui Boy I could have really gonefor a big hot dog today  Officials at the Ministry forCultural Recidivism alarmed that the proliferationof the posters could create an unfortunate conceptionin the minds of French children that the imperfectsubjunctive tense of the verb jumbo frankfurterdated all the way back to Rabelaisian timesthuslending the expression a certain historical pedigreeimmediatelyordered the copywriters arrest            Ce nest pas une question de jumbo frankfurterou de ne pas jumbo frankfurter  said

the right toteach our schoolchildren that back in the days ofRabelais people ate big hot dogs  No way Jose            Sources say that MatreCrches unusually stiffsentence resulted from a legal ploy that backfiredOnce it became obvious that the case was being lostthe defendants lawyer blamed the whole flap on aprinters error maintaining that his clients originalad copy depicted Gargantua speaking in the futuretense of the verb  Un de ces jours on jumbofrankfurtera dans les coins  One of these daysfolks around here will be eating big hot dogs  Theuse of the future tense carries a  fine but

Polysyllables abound in todays speech andmuch has been written on the subject from euphemismsagenciesthat facilitate instead of givemoneyto downright deceitone knows by nowthat protective reaction strikes are bombings  Aswith so many trends spotted by the linguistic policehowever this is hardly new  Ever since the Normaninvasion people have preferred to use the longerLatinate terms over the blunt AngloSaxon wordsthe general feeling with some small basis is thatsuch diction shows a touch of class  A more puzzlingphenomenon is the use of long forms for which quitesimilar shorter forms already exist  The general ideabehind this trend seems to be that in length there isstrength even at the cost of accuracy  Examples unfortunatelyare all too easy to provide            The usage of these words is easy to spot they allhave an extra syllable or two that adds little but excessbulk for usage  delete and substitute use   Reportersat The New York Times  for example oftenwrite of subsidization programs when subsidywill do just as well  The suffix  ization  which indicatesprocess is often in demand since it makesone think something is actively being done  Othersuffixes such as  tion ate and  ment are equally popularaddons  Thus estimates turn into estimationsand television anchormen these days encapsulate thenews instead of encapsule it  This is a society thatlives beyond its limitations rather than its limitsWhen forced people take preventative measures insteadof preventive ones  In some instances theshorter forms have all but dropped from use  Thephrase he is in my employ  is now considered eitheroldfashioned or British most people would automaticallychange the key word to employment             The adjectival suffix  al is often slapped onwords that already are adjectives  Why must peoplebe ironical instead of ironic  or satirical instead ofsatiric   The  ate suffix originally a harmless suffix todenote causative verbs such as substantiate from substanceis particularly pernicious  Not too long agothe personnel department of a business would orientnew workers the word originally meant to point outwhere the sun rose ie which way was east  Nowadaysof course the overbriefed newcomers are orientated a longer verb that sounds suspiciously like abackformation from orientation   Similarly derivatelooks like an upandcoming contender for derive Proceeding analogously a classmate of mine in juniorhigh school once talked of improvisating butsomehow her neologism never caught on            Often such lengthening leads to subtle errorsMany people no longer form methods  for instancebut instead formulate methodologies   How muchmore comforting to have a methodology behind onethan a mere method  The word methodology  howeverreally refers to the science of method itselfwhile formulate means to reduce to a formularather than to shape  The words are apt for scientifictesting not for dealing with a simple problemthough of course thats precisely the point usingthese words gives a pseudoscientific boost a spuriousexactitude  For this reason perhaps sociologistswill talk of societal needs social may sound too softtoo much like a bridge party  The same goes for specialtywhich has yielded over the years to specialization The curious point is that this trend seems togo against Zipfs Law which notes that syllables gettrimmed off words over the years  Here one mayobserve the opposite happening when people wishto spruce up an old word they add a syllable            Admittedly certain groups have their particularvocabulary  The

incidentally by tearing outeverything in the contract but the place for a signature            In all fairness many drafters of legal documentsare probably just after terms without strongly positiveor negative connotations  The addition of suffixesgenerally makes the word in question more abstractuse can smack of exploitation while usagesounds more neutral  One can speak of part andparty without
