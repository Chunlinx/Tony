                       VeiledThreats                        I linked to Veil ofTears by Anne Hollander because it is always entertaining to read thelatest misconceptions from the media on Muslim issues While I was waiting forthe browser to log me on I thought maybe this once from a publication like                  Slate                I would be not amused but happily impressed by a thoroughreport Silly me            Bemused I went through theillogical conclusions plus the tired rhetoric of veil equals oppression blahblah blah I laughed out loud when I got to the part where the author insistedthat although the girls uh were known as women here in the Islamic worldtoo claimed they werent oppressed by the veil they like really wereQuestion Did the author actually interview any of these girls            One maybe minor point thatI feel compelled to clarify has to do with this statement It seems suitablein Saudi Arabia for example where women cant vote A little research herewould show that no one votes in Saudi Arabia be they men or women becauseits a monarchy and votings not really in            Oh bythe way I happily and quite comfortably wear my veil when I go shoppingdowntown I tie it tight around myelectricalbiomedicalengineeringfromUSCfilled head over myuptotheminute very fashionable mostly European designer clothes sorrydont mean to brag just trying to break that ridiculous stereotype And mycurvaceous legs certainly dont show             HA Dialdin                                       Tabs ofSteele                        Perhaps all the tabloidreading Emily Yoffe has been doing on behalf of                   Slate                has taken atoll on her logical capacities Pay for Say            There is a very simple reasonwhy George Stephanopoulos book contract is less tainting or less obviouslyso anyway than Gennifer Flowers or the Arkansas troopers lining up fortabloidrightwing payouts For the latter the only value in their story is inits salaciousness If they had told their benefactors that Bill Clinton was anupright man who never told a lie or looked twice at a woman they wouldnt havegot a dime            As senior adviser to thepresident during a tempestuous first term however Stephanopoulos can provideinsights and behindthescenes anecdotes that many readers will findinteresting even if he didnt see naked interns running up and down the WestWing As a result Flowers and the troopers and Zercher and McGrath have amuch greater incentive to spice up the truth or to invent a story out of wholecloth            Even Yoffes example of JulieSteele backfires on her After all Steele wasnt paid for what shesaid but for a picture of Willey and Clinton together That photo was worthmoney to the Enquirer even if Steele claimed Willey was secretly theDalai Lama In fact Steele probably could have earned more money if she hadvolunteered some scandalous yarn            If yourwriter had been really incisive she might have raised questions in theopposite direction Do big advances like the one Stephanopoulos receivedincrease the pressure on him to include someperhaps falserevelation thatcan be used in promoting the book Yoffe suggests that truth can be found justas easily in tabloids as in traditional publishing outlets a less determinedlyshallow analyst might wonder if the dominant role of money is suffocating thetruth in both venues             Chris Kelly                                       Microsoft Economics                        In his Soft Microeconomicspiece Paul Krugman tells us he uses WordPerfect and the Netscape browser Thismay well be but Internet Explorer is very likely on his computer and hecertainly paid for it even if he subsequently removed it The idea thatInternet Explorer is free is silly It cost millions to develop and that costis amortized in the price of Windows            This is one way the browserreally is part of the operating system            I doubt that Microsoft caresall that much which browser people use as long as they have to pay for InternetExplorer In the fullness of time there will be enough sites only viewablewith Internet Explorer that Krugman and others will switch Their personalpreferences for Netscape wont be worth the inconvenience            The same is true forMicrosoft Word I wouldnt be surprised if Word is already on Krugmanscomputer so he can read all the Microsoft Word  documents produced byothers which are unreadable with WordPerfect Eventually he will use Wordeven if he doesnt like its equation editorit will be just too inconvenientto indulge his personal preferences Perhaps hell utter a little grumble ofdissatisfaction like all those grumbles coming from Mac users being forced toswitch to Windows to be compatible In the meantime he has probably paid forWord so why should Microsoft care            There is absolutely no needfor this of course Software companies could make their file formats publicenabling easy exchange of documents The computer security expert SimsonGarfinkel has provided a thoughtful discussion and interesting recommendationsfor government action in his column Let My Data Go            One of the biggest mythsabout computer software is that it leads to natural monopolies In fact thesoftware incompatibilities that tend to create monopolies are carefullynurtured precisely because they do create monopolies            It may be natural forbusinesses to create and exploit monopolies whenever they have the opportunitybut that is why we have and need to enforce antitrust legislation Thesoftware industry if anything has a greater need for protection of marketcompetition            Incidentally as an academic Krugman might be interested in a series ofarticles from the Chronicle of Higher Education on how Microsoft isreducing software competition in universities             JohnFranks                        Evanston Ill                           Addressyour
