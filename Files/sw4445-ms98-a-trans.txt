        what kind of pollution do you have in Flagstaff     well we have the the usual automotive pollution that and although its not very visible you dont worry about that uh too much uh but uh   uhhuh   we have a lot of wood smoke uh here now i heat with wood so ah and im one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a is a source a source of pollution but there are people in this community who who think that uh its gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the point of being part of the pollution and and uh were very close to the uh to the Grand Canyon   uhhuh   where air pollution is a very big issue because on of pollution well its debatable as to whether its coming from the Los Angeles area on the jet stream or whether its coming from the Four Corners power plant up near Page Arizona uh   uhhuh   but because its a national park thats a a big issue there uh  here in Flagstaff actually uh it its something thats unique to us the the biggest pollutant that we have in our air is cinder dust   ill be darned   and thats because uh were in a volcanic region and we uh we have dirt roads uh in a lot of areas that are covered with with cinders but what they also cinders on the highways in the winter time   uhhuh   in place of uh using salt or substances like that that they might in the eastern part of the country and when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it we get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air and as of   umhum   you know the largest the largest quantity thats the biggest pollutants that we have to to deal with here   yeah well i im sure that cinder dust is pretty unique  um in the Dallas area of course the the biggest issue of air pollution is just automobiles   yes   uh we dont have much in the way of heavy industry i mean this is a center for electronics and banking and insurance and you know businesses like that   um   which are not typically bad polluters   right   but um so i id think youd have to blame most of it on the automobiles here   does does Dallas sits sit in any kind of uh uh ive been there but i dont remember if you sit in any kind of a trough that uh where you get temperature inversions that that capture air pollutants or anything like that   we have we yes we occasionally have them not if theyre not not not too significant but they do occasionally occasionally occur uh one source of pollution for us is the dust and sand in uh west Texas   sure   in the spring time well have parts of Lubbock coming to Dallas       im serious these enormous clouds of sand or dust or whatever you wanna call it   i laugh because i made the journey once from El Paso to Dallas and then continuing east uh to the Eastern Coast of the United States and uh i joked that uh all of the settlers   uhhuh   settled in Eastern Texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the Mexicans the Mexicans said fine you can have East Texas but as long as long only as long as you take west Texas too   yeah okay       all right i can understand that its interesting though that you mentioned the uh wood stoves     yes   i grew up in New Mexico and but that was long enough ago that uh people didnt really heat that much with wood that was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will   umhum   uh but now in New Mexico heating with with particularly pinon pine is really an issue   right and   not only from the pollution point of view but it takes many many years to grow those trees   yes and   and people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them um and its its such a distinctive smell when it burns i had forgotten it i mean i       it its one of those smells you forget but then when you step outside your mothers house you go oop yep somebodys burning pinon   here in Flagstaff uh juniper is the the very distinctive smelling wood that you can smell in the wood smoke uh and one of the issues here ah it which gets into forest management but has an impact on on air pollution   uhhuh   is that uh were surrounded by the largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world   uhhuh   but people dont wanna burn ponderosa pine they wanna burn oak which is very hard to find in this region or juniper because its the more plentiful hardwood   oh sure   and uh aspen uh it burns very cleanly but doesnt put out a lot of heat uh and and ponderosa we also have pinon but uh it uh it it like ponderosa is very dirty   umhum   and so theyre not preferable woods and so here we have this great abundance of ponderosa pine and the forest service is really saying we really wish that we could find a way to make it uh less of a
