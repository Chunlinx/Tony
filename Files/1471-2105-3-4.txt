                    Background        Expression profiling is an emerging experimental method        whereby RNA accumulation in cells and tissues can be        assayed for many thousands of genes simultaneously in a        single experiment There are two common experimental        platforms for expression profiling redundant        oligonucleotide arrays Affymetrix GeneChips     and        spotted cDNA microarrays       The Affymetrix        GeneChips have the inherent advantages of redundancy        specificity and transportability there are typically         oligonucleotide probes features designed against        each gene tested by the array with paired perfectmatch        and mismatch probes with standardized factory synthesis of        arrays      The uniform nature of the arrays permits        databasing of individual profiles which facilitates        comparison of data generated by different laboratories        Expression profiling has led to dramatic advances in        understanding of yeast biology where homogeneous cultures        can be grown and exposed to timed environmental variables                 Such studies have led to the rapid        assignment of function to a large number of anonymous gene        sequences Largescale expression profiling studies of        tissues from higher vertebrates are more challenging due        to the higher complexity of the genome larger related gene        families and incomplete genomic resources Nevertheless        DNA microarrays have been successfully applied in the        analysis of aging and caloric restriction    and        pulmonary fibrosis     And many publications        particularly on cancer have appeared                 Affymetrix has recently announced the availability of the        U GeneChip series with  wellcharacterized human        genes mined from genomic sequence The nearly complete        ascertainment of genes in the human genome should make        expressionprofiling studies of human tissues particularly        powerful However identification of the sources of        experimental variability and knowledge of the relative        contribution of variation from each source is critical for        appropriate experimental design in expression profiling        experiments        Mills and Gordon recently studied the relative        contribution of experimental variability of probe        production on the reproducibility of microarray results        using mixed murine tissue RNA on Affymetrix MuK GeneChips            In their study the same RNA preparation was used        as a template for distinct cDNAcRNA amplifications and        hybridizations An additional variable studied was the        effect of different laboratories processing the same RNAs        The authors found relatively poor concordance between        duplicate arrays with an average of  increasedecrease        calls between the same RNA processed in parallel and        hybridized to two MuKA microarrays The authors        concluded that there was substantial experimental        variability in the experimental procedure necessitating        extensive filtering and large numbers of arrays to detect        accurate gene expression changes LUT lookup tables            In our laboratory we have processed over         Affymetrix arrays and have found significantly higher        experimental reproducibility R   for new generation        UA version  murine arrays or human U series see        Result and Discussion In addition a recent publication        of a single human patient where RNA was prepared from two        distinct breast tumors and placed on duplicate UA        GeneChips four chips total found a very low degree of        experimental variability between microarrays R          and between the two tumors R       The marked        differences in experimental variability between        laboratories could be due to different quality control        protocols see httpmicroarraycnmcresearchorg newer        more robust Affymetrix arrays now available murine MuK        versus UA version  and new generation human U series        use of more recent algorithms for data interpretation or        due to more consistent processing of RNA cDNA and cRNA in        the same laboratory        The previous studies did not systematically address the        reproducibility of GeneChip hybridization eg the same        biotinylated cRNA on two different microarrays In        addition to lingering questions concerning variability due        to specific experimental procedures there are other        possible sources of variability that have not yet been        investigated specifically tissue heterogeneity and        interindividual variation The latter two sources of        variability are particularly important in human expression        profiling studies The study of human tissues often        involves the use of tissue biopsies where a relatively        limited region of an organ is sampled Tissue heterogeneity        and sampling error might be expected to introduce        significant variability in expression profiles Second        tissues may derive from individuals from different ethnic        backgrounds humans are highly outbred leading to the        potential of significant polymorphic noise herein called        SNP noise between individuals unrelated to the disease        or variable under study SNP noise also exists between        different inbred mouse strains and some experiments have        normalized this effect by breeding the same mutation on        different strains and profiling each individually            Knowledge of the relative effect of each experimental        tissue and patient variable on expression profiling        results in humans is important so that appropriate        experimental designs can be employed        We recently reported the design and production of a        highly redundant oligonucleotide microarray for analysis of        human muscle biopsies Borup et al         submitted  This MuscleChip contains         probe sets corresponding to  distinct genes and        ESTs expressed in human muscle Each probe set contains        between  to  oligonucleotides such that the number of        specific oligonucleotide probes on the array was                Here we utilize this MuscleChip to investigate the        relative significance of variables affecting expression        profiling data and interpretation Specifically we studied        the correlation coefficients of profiles considering the        following variables  variation due to probe production        same RNA  variation due to the microarray itself same        cRNA on different GeneChips  tissue heterogeneity        different regions of the same muscle biopsy         interpatient variability SNP noise  diagnosis        underlying pathological variable and  patient age        We have recently reported generation of expression        profiling results using mixed patient samples     Our        hypothesis was that mixing of RNA samples from multiple        regions of muscle biopsies and from multiple patients        matched for most variables disease age sex would        effectively normalize both intrapatient variability        tissue heterogeneity and interpatient variability SNP        noise eg normal human polymorphic variation unrelated to        the primary defect Here we test this hypothesis        directly and show that sample mixing does indeed result in        relatively high sensitivity and specificity for gene        expression changes that would be detected by many        individual expression profiles Thus sample mixing appears        to be an appropriate firstpass method to obtain the most        significant expression changes while using small numbers        of arrays                    Results and discussion        Fifty six  different RNA samples were prepared from        different regions of muscle biopsies from  individuals         Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD patients  normal        controls The profiles of five of the DMD patients and the        five controls have been previously reported using the        Affymetrix HuFL microarray     however we retested        these same samples on the custom MuscleChip Borup et al         submitted  for comparison to the        other patients here All RNAs were converted to        doublestranded cDNA and then to biotinylated cRNA The        cRNAs were then hybridized to the MuscleChip either singly        in mixed groups or both as described below In total         hybridizations were performed scanned and the data        statistically analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite        and Excel Quality control criteria were as described on        our web site  httpmicroarraycnmcresearchorg link to        programs in genomic applications and included        sufficient cRNA amplification and adequate        posthybridization scaling factors Scaling factors        normalization needed to reach a common target intensity        ranged from  to  Table  All raw image files        processed image files and difference analyses are posted        on a webqueried SQL database interface to our Affymetrix        LIMS Oracle warehouse see        httpmicroarraycnmcresearchorg link to programs in        genomic applications data human        Among the  probe sets on the Affymetrix custom        muscle microarray we found a consistent percentage of        present calls for each of the  cRNA samples tested        Duchenne dystrophy  arrays    controls         arrays    To test for interarray variability        two different hybridization solutions were applied to        duplicate arrays and correlation coefficients determined        A high correlation coefficient was found in this analysis        suggesting that interarray variability of the MuscleChip        used was a relatively minor variable Patient  a and        aduplicate R   and percent shared No Change NC        calls by Microarray Suite software was  Patient b and        bduplicate R   and percent NC was  Table         The high reproducibility of Affymetrix array results is        consistent with other data in our laboratory and from        previously published data        and shows that        experimental variability associated with hybridization and        scanning of highly redundant oligonucleotide GeneChips is        not a major source of experimental variability        Given the previous report suggesting that the conversion        of RNA to biotinylated cRNA probe was a major source of        variability in murine array experiments     we tested        a series of murine RNA from different sources using the        newer generation UAv GeneChips One series of samples        was from murine spleens where spleens from multiple        animals for each variable under study were mixed RNA        isolated RNA samples split and duplicate cDNA cRNA and        hybridizations processed in parallel for each RNA Fig         KNagaraju samples We also compared RNAs processed from        parallel murine myogenic cell cultures Fig  VSM        samples where each profile was from a different cell        culture Finally we used a series of murine muscle tissues        from normal and dystrophindeficient mice where each        profile was from a different series of complete        gastrocnemius muscles Fig  FBooth samples The data        from these  murine UAv profiles were then analyzed by        unsupervised clustering    to determine which profiles        were most closely related to each other Fig  This        analysis shows that the different sources of RNA cluster        together as expected Importantly the same RNA used as a        template for two distinct cDNAcRNA preparations and        hybridizations showed a high correlation coefficient R          for five of the six samples with average R          Fig  The large muscle group profiles FBooth samples        showed excellent correlation both with respect to        diagnosis however here there was no sampling error as the        entire muscle group was used rather than isolated biopsies        Finally the parallel tissue culture experiments VSM        samples showed greater variability between duplicates        suggesting that tissue culture conditions may be more        subject to variability than         in vivo tissues Fig  This murine        data shows that variability from different cDNAcRNA        reactions is very low R          To analyze the impact of intrapatient variability        tissue heterogeneity interpatient variability        polymorphic noise in outbred populations and the effect        of sample mixing on the sensitivity of detection of gene        expression differences between patient groups we conducted        a series of individual and mixed profiling Table         Muscle biopsies from five  yr old DMD patients and five         yr old patients were selected each biopsy split into        two parts and RNA isolated independently from each of the         biopsy fragments For these ten DMD patients the two        different regions of the same biopsy were expression        profiled both individually  profiles and also mixed        into four pools where each pool originated from distinct        RNA samples Table  The resulting profiles were also        compared to previously reported mixed  yr old DMD        patient cRNAs and mixed  yr old control cRNAs            as mentioned above        As an initial statistical analysis we used Affymetrix        software to define genes that showed expression changes        Increased Decreased or Marginal in expression levels        between pairs of profiles difference analyses This        method of data interpretation showed that some muscle        biopsies showed very little variance between different        regions of the same biopsy while other patient biopsies        showed considerable variability see Fig for        representative scatter graphs Expressing this variance as        a percentage of Diff Calls between the two regions of the        same biopsy as determined by Affymetrix default        algorithms we found considerable variability in the        similarity of profiles with values ranging from  to         of the  probe sets studied    This        data suggests that tissue heterogeneity intrapatient        variability can be a major source of variation in        expression profiling experiments even when using        relatively large pieces  mg of relatively homogeneous        tissues such as muscle        The most common strategy for interpreting Affymetrix        microarray data is to use two profile comparisons with an        arbitrary threshold for significant foldchange in        expression levels Typically multiple arrays are compared        with those gene expression changes showing the most        consistent fold changes prioritized although other methods        have been reported        To study interpatient        variability we defined the gene expression changes        surviving four pairwise comparisons with mixed control        samples as we have previously described     Briefly        four comparisons were done by Affymetrix software eg DMD        a versus control a DMD a versus control b DMDb        versus control a DMDb versus control b The four data        sets were then compared with only those gene expression        changes that showed fold change in all four        comparisons four comparison survival method The number        of surviving diff calls by this method ranged from  to            Table  Interestingly those patients        showing considerable variation between different regions of        the same biopsy did not show a corresponding decrease in        the number of gene expression changes surviving the        iterative comparisons to controls Table  This suggests        but does not prove the most significant changes might be        shared independent of tissue variability see below        A different statistical method to determine the effect        of the different variables under study is to perform        hierarchical cluster analysis using nearest neighbor        statistical methods     Here we subjected all        profiles to unsupervised cluster analysis as a means of        determining which variables had the greatest effect eg        intrapatient variability different regions of biopsy        versus diagnosis DMD vs control versus interpatient        variability DMD patients in same age group versus age of        patient For this analysis we used the fluorescence        intensity of each probe set Average difference after        data scrubbing to remove genes that showed expression        levels near background Absent Calls for all profiles        Fig  This analysis shows that duplicate profiles of        the same cRNA hybridization solution are the most highly        related Patient  a and duplicate ad b and duplicate        bd consistent with the high correlation found by the        comparisons using Affymetrix Microarray Suite software        described above Again this reflects the low amount of        combined experimental variability intrinsic to the        laboratory processing of RNA cDNA cRNA and        hybridization        When comparing two different regions of the same biopsy        intrapatient variability we found widely varying        results depending on the patient studied Fig  For        example some individual patients showed very closely        related profiles that approached the similarity of        duplicate arrays on the same cRNA Fig  profiles a b        a b On the other hand some patients showed very        distantly related profiles for two regions of the same        biopsy Fig  profiles a b a b a b        Importantly the variation caused by intrapatient tissue        variation often overshadowed all other variables For        example a profile from DMD patient  a clustered with        the normal controls rather than with the other DMD        patients Fig  The histopathology of this patient was        noted as being unusually variable in severity prior to        expression profiling Also unsupervised clustering was        unable to group patients of similar ages despite DMD        showing a progressive clinical course We conclude that        intrapatient tissue heterogeneity is a major source of        experimental variability in expression profiling and must        be considered in experimental design        The above findings suggested that both intrapatient        variability tissue heterogeneity and interpatient        variability polymorphic noise had major effects on the        expression profiles One method to control for these        sources of noise is to analyze large numbers of profiles        both on multiple patients and on multiple regions of        tissue from each patient This would allow determinations        of p values and statistical significance for a single        controlled variable under study eg DMD vs controls An        alternative method is to experimentally normalize these        variables through mixing of samples from patient groups        such mixing would be expected to average out both intra        and interpatient variation The expectation is that the        most significant and dramatic gene expression changes would        still be identified while using many less profiles and        thus a substantial reduction in cost of the analyses        To test for the relative sensitivity of interpretation        of sample mixing versus individual profiles we mixed        together the  cRNAs for the two different age groups of        DMD patients samples a  b samples a  b For this        analysis we also generated expression profiles for two        additional groups of control individuals One was a second        set of five normal male biopsies ages  yrs controls        a b and the third control set was three normal        agematched female biopsies ages  yrs controls a b        Fig  As with the original male control group control        a b two different regions of each biopsy were        processed independently through the biotinylated cRNA step        and then equimolar amounts of cRNA mixed for hybridization        to the MuscleChip        All  profiles both individual and mixed samples were        again analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering        Fig      As described above we scrubbed the        profiles to eliminate all genes showing expression levels        consistently at or below background hybridization        intensities by requiring each gene to show a Present Call        in one or more of the  profiles        As above duplicate profiles using the same cRNA        hybridization solution on different arrays whether mixed        or individual samples showed very highly correlated        results very low branch on dendrogram Fig  mix         yrs mix  yrs patient aad patient bbd As        above this indicates that experimental variability from        laboratory procedures or different arrays is a relatively        minor factor in interpretation of results Mixed samples        from different regions of the same biopsies showed the        same or only slightly more variation mixed controls c        c and c mixed DMD  yrs This showed that sample        mixing does indeed average out tissue heterogeneity        intrapatient variability as well as interpatient        variability We noted that all of the controls both male        and female clustered in the same branch of the dendrogram        while the four of the six mixed DMD profiles clustered just        one level away from the controls separately from the other        DMD profiles This analysis suggests that there is        considerable variability in the progressive tissue        pathology induced by dystrophin deficiency both within a        patient and between patients        To test the sensitivity and specificity of sample mixing        versus individual profiling we defined differentially        expressed genes using a two group ttest GeneSpring             comparing all  mixed control profiles and the         individual  yr old DMD profiles Genes were retained        that met specific p value thresholds between the two sets        of profiles In parallel we compared the two corresponding        mixed  yr old DMD profiles to the same  mixed control        profiles        Comparison of  individual  yr Duchenne dystrophy        profiles to  mixed controls revealed  genes showing        differential expression with p   Fig         Comparison of the two mixed Duchenne dystrophy profiles to        the  mixed controls showed  genes with p          Fig A Comparison of the two gene lists showed that         of differentially regulated genes detected by the         individual profiles were also detected by the two mixed        profiles This suggests that the sensitivity and        specificity of using mixed samples is approximately half        that of individual profiles However there was a rapid        shift in specificity and sensitivity as stringency of the        analysis was increased Raising the statistical threshold        to p   for individual profiles while keeping the        threshold for mixed profiles at p   as required by        the small number of data points Fig B resulted in a        sensitivity of  for mixed samples  of  genes p          detected In conclusion mixing detected about        two thirds of statistically significant changes p          Mixing was a relatively sensitive method of        detecting the most highly significant changes p           of changes detected however it was not very        specific as many as one third of gene expression changes        showing p   in mixed samples were not confirmed by        individual profiles        Use of ttest measurements is expected to contain        significant amounts of noise due to the very large number        of comparisons involved in array studies a value of p          means that as many as  of gene expression changes        are expected to be identified by chance and thereby not        reflect true differences between samples We have        previously reported a very simple yet potentially more        stringent method for data analysis of small numbers of        expression profiles using duplicate profiles for control        and experimental samples and then identifying those genes        that show consistent changes fold in the four        possible pairwise data comparisons four comparison        survival method     A similar pairwise comparison        method using a less stringent average foldchange        analysis was recently reported for muscle from aging and        calorierestricted mouse muscle            To investigate the validity of this approach we compared        the sensitivity and specificity of ttest detection of        expression changes versus the fourpairwise survival        method Two sample ttest of the  individual Duchenne        dystrophy profiles compared to the  mixed control profiles        revealed  genes showing p   as above In        parallel the mixed DMD duplicate profiles were compared to        a single pair of mixed control sample profiles ca cb        using the pairwise comparison survival method            Briefly four comparisons were done DMD a versus control        a DMDb versus control a DMD a versus control b        DMDb versus control b and only those genes retained        which showed fold change in all four comparisons        This method was indeed considerably more specific in        identifying significant p   gene expression        changes Fig A with  of gene expression changes in        the mixed profiles verified by individual profiles p          The sensitivity of this method depended on the        pvalue threshold for the individual profiles but only        reached a maximum of  sensitivity at p   Fig        B        The results above suggested that analysis of mixed        samples using ttest methods was relatively sensitive but        nonspecific while analysis of the same mixed profiles by        fold survival method was relatively specific but        insensitive To confirm this conclusion we directly        compared the sensitivity and specificity of the four        pairwise comparison method to more standard ttest methods        Fig A We found that the pairwise survival method was        indeed highly specific with  of changes identified by        this method also detected by ttest However as predicted        it was not very sensitive with only  of the expression        changes with p   identified by ttest being        detected by the pairwise survival method Comparison of all        three analysis methods showed that many  genes        expression changes were detected by all three methods Fig        B                    Conclusions        Microarray data analyses have been criticized as being        quite elusive about measurement reproducibility            This is largely the consequence of the large number of        uncontrolled or unknown variables and the prohibitive cost        of isolating and investigating each variable Here we        report the systematic isolation and study of most variables        in microarray experiments using Affymetrix oligonucleotide        arrays and human tissue biopsies We found that all sources        of experimental variability were quite minor microarray R          probe synthesis  microarray R          On the other hand tissue heterogeneity intrapatient        variation Average R for  patients    to         and differences between individual patients SNP        noise Average R    to  were major sources        of variability in expression profiling Thus tissue        heterogeneity and SNP noise have a high potential to        obscure sought after conditionspecific gene expression        changes particularly in humans where tissue samples can        be limiting sampling error and interindividual        variation often is very large We have shown that mixing of        patient samples effectively normalizes much of the intra        and interpatient noise while still identifying the        majority of the most significant gene expression changes        that would have been detected by larger numbers of        individual patient profiles Our results suggest that        stringent yet robust data can be generated by mixing a        small number of individuals with a defined condition n          preferably using different regions of tissue for        duplicate arrays Controls should be similarly processed        The resulting four arrays  controls  experimental        datasets should then be subjected to the fold        survival method as previously described     This will        yield a stringent set of expression changes that are likely        to be verified by larger studies with individual arrays        but at low cost as only four arrays are employed The        preliminary data from just four mixed profiles two        experimental and two control can then be used to generate        functional clusters and pathophysiological models These        preliminary models can then direct more hypothesisdriven        experiments or more extensive expression profiling        studies                    Materials and methods                  Expression profiling          Human muscle biopsy samples were diagnostic specimens          flashfrozen immediately after surgery in isopentane          cooled in liquid nitrogen with storage in small          airtight humidified tubes at C until RNA isolation          Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient samples were all          shown to have complete lack of dystrophin by          immunostaining andor immunoblot analysis and were shown          to have excellent morphology and preservation of tissue          Controls included groups of males and female age          described in text that showed no histopathological          abnormality normal dystrophy proteins and normal serum          creatine kinase levels Biopsy sizes ranged from  mg to           grams with approximately  mg used for RNA          isolation  micrograms of total RNA As described          in the text all biopsies had two different regions of          the same biopsy expression profiled separately          Details concerning the murine profiles will be          published elsewhere In this report we used the murine          profiles simply to test the sources of variation during          sample
