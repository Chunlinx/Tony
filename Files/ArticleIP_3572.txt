official looking guys in oldtimey police hatsturning the revolving doors for me                                       Recently my girlfriendbegan forcing me to forego my usual visit to the acut barber in favor ofher hair artiste friend Raoul who wants not only the customary  for thehalf inch he shears with such aesthetic sensibility from my scalp but also atip And bartenders have their own ideas about what its worth to me to havethem put a lime sliver and a tiny straw in my martini                                       The question Prudie asyou may have guessed is How much dough should I be shelling out If I makethe bartender mad the vodka tonics start tasting less like vodka and more liketonic And if Raoul doesnt get his just deserts Im stuck with a bowlcut Lately Ive been purposely overtipping just to be safe At least Ithink Im overtipping Is five bucks extra enough for an eight block cab rideThe American economy were reminded frequently these days is becomingincreasingly

mostlywhen traveling it is now a fixture of everyday life Prudie for startersthinks a  tip too extravagant for an eight block rideunless of course thedriver provided wonderful therapeutic advice Most people Prudie has observedtipping taxi drivers tack on a couple of bucks no matter what the meter Asfor people you deal with regularly like doormen since youre a Manhattanitegrease their palms once every several encounters or else youll go crazy andbroke With people like the artiste Raoul remain generousas with thebartenderbecause some consequences of withholding tips are more noticeablethan others In other words pick your spots while at the same timeremembering that many service people rely on tips to get by            Prudie balancingly                           DearPrudence
