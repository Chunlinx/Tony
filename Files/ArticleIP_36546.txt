                                 Gores Debate Bait            Fornearly a year while Bill Bradley labored to be taken seriously as apresidential candidate Al Gore studiously ignored him Last weekend afterBradley surged past him in the fundraising contest and in New Hampshire pollsGore turned and opened fire At an Iowa Democratic Party dinner Gorechallenged Bradley to debate him once a week How about it Bill Goretaunted looking straight at Bradley If the answer is yes stand up and waveyour hand Bradley sat on his hands and the press reported excitedly that themomentum in the Democratic race had shifted The debate challenge has changedthe game by advancing several of Gores strategic objectives                                           Kill Bradleys momentum For months Gore has bledmoney and support while Bradley has gained on him In basketball when oneteam makes this kind of run the other teams coach calls a timeout to defusethe hot teams momentum and ruin its rhythm before the game gets out of handSince the strategy Gore had mapped out before the game has already beendefeated and discarded he has nothing to lose by tearing up his schedule tomake room for debates Bradleys game plan however has been highly effectiveand he has much to lose by being derailed from it Even if Bradley ignores thechallenge it has supplanted his message as the campaigns hot story Everyheadline coming out of the Iowa dinner focused on Gores challenge and ignoredBradleys good speech                                           Reverse the expectations game Gore has sufferedfrom being perceived as the spoiled stagnant frontrunner He wants as                  Slate               s Jacob Weisberg has  to restyle himself as the underdogAnd what does an underdog do He dares the frontrunner to debate him Thedebate challenge helps persuade the media to cast Gore in this unlikely roleGore gave a scrappy speech in Iowa and offered himself as a feistyunderdog reported the New York Times  Bradley may no longer have theluxury of trying to be above politicsand repeated debates                                           Change the subject from character to issues WhileGore has appealed for support on the basis of his platform Bradley hasappealed for support on the basis of his character and life story So farBradleys biography has trumped Gores issues Debates which are organizedaround issues rather than personal history would force Bradley to play Goresgame Since polls show that many voters who like Bradley dont know hispositions on the issues he stands to lose some of his support by having tospell out his views By pushing the contest in this direction Gores challengehas already poisoned media coverage of Bradley The inability of many NewHampshire voters to identify Bradleys positions on major issues could loom asa vulnerability says the Times                             Make                Bradley address losing issues Every candidatehas issues on which he expects to win votes and issues on which he expects tolose votes The rule is to talk about your winning issues and avoid your losingissues Bradleys winning issues are campaign reform health care and guncontrol Gore wants to make him talk about three losing issues Reaganomicswhich hurts Bradley among Democrats because he voted for Reagans  budgetcuts vouchers Bradleys past support of pilot voucher programs offendspowerful teachers unions and Democratic voters who think vouchers threatenpublic schools and ethanol Bradleys past opposition to ethanol subsidiesirks Iowans who count on these subsidies to prop up farmers For MichaelKinsleys take on Bradleys inconsistency on the ethanol question click This is why Gore specifically dared Bradley to debate him in Iowa onagriculture Bradley can answer Gores criticismsin interviews he hasalready begun to do sobut politically Bradley loses votes and momentum justby having to address these troublesome issues instead of his winners                            Recast                Gore as a fighter For months the media havedepicted Gore as stiff imperial and out of touch Bradley has played alongcalling Gore timid and associating him with entrenched power By daringBradley to debate him Gore confounds this characterization Gores refrain inhis Iowa speechstay and fightexcited the pundits as well as the crowdThe Times said Gores call to arms conveyed passion and suggestedfocus and purpose The Washington Post reported Gore sprang to lifetonight delivering one of his feistiest performances of the year ATimes headline ventured Notion of a New Al Gore Begins to TakeRoot                            Recast                Bradley as a coward For the precedingreasons Bradley has no strategic interest in debating Gore He didnt budgewhen Gore urged him to stand and accept the challenge and Bradleys aidesbrushed it aside saying there would be plenty of debates down the road Butif Bradley keeps declining the challenge Gore will turn the timidityargument against him For weeks with increasing explicitness Gore has accusedBradley of walking away from the fight by voting for Reagans  budgetopposing farm subsidies and retiring from Congress after Republicans took fullcontrol in  Gores surrogates have accused Bradley of quitting andrunning from battles The media smell a new target By refusing to engageBradley opens himself up to being portrayed as a riskaverse aloof politicianwho does not have the mettle  to fight emphatically for the nominationsaid the Times  Will he hold up as a highminded candidate asked thePost  or will he be seen as just another politician who has  gonewobbly on his party on crucial fights                                           Seize the high ground Bradley dismisses Gorescriticisms as darts I am simply not going to get into dealing with thedarts that are being thrown he says I think the American people want tohave a positive vision of the future This rebuttal might have worked but thedebate challenge has thwarted it and has jeopardized Bradleys posture as astraighttalking idealist Questioning your opponents courage looks cynicalbut calling for debates looks noble Conversely refusing to answer youropponents insults looks noble but refusing to answer a debate challenge lookscynical Gore is using his debate challenge as moral cover for his attacks onBradleys character and the media are turning their scrutiny on Bradleysdefensiveness instead            In hisspeech Bradley handed Gore the perfect metaphor to make this point baseballshome run derby between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa Why cant it be VicePresident Al Gore pushing Bill Bradley and Bill Bradley pushing Al Gore to bethe best we can be Bradley asked Gore proceeded to hit this pitch out of thepark telling the crowd that if the two sluggers had stayed in the dugout anddidnt step up to the plate they wouldnt hit many home runs SundaysLos Angeles Times headline made clear who had won the exchange GoreAsks Bradley to Step Up to Debate Plate            Youhave to feel sorry for Bradley Having ignored him throughout the campaignGore has decidedat a moment oozing with political expediencyto reversecourse demand an open exchange and cast himself as the idealist Meanwhilethe media are playing along hoping to egg on the fight In an interview withthe Post after the Iowa showdown Bradley again ducked the debatequestion declining to lay all the cards out on the table just because Goresuddenly finds it convenient As a strategist Bradley knows hed be an idiotto debate Gore And the last thing Bradley can afford is to look like astrategist
