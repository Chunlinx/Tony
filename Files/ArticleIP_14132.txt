                                 How Lying Pays            According to the Israelidaily Haaretz  there is one politician who rises in the polls forno apparent reason Exposing his lies on television has no effect on hispotential supporters nor even it appears on many of his nonsupportersHaaretz commentator Gideon Samet wrote Thepolitician in question is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu theoddson favorite to win the next general election A Gallup poll in Israellast weekend gave Netanyahu a  percent chance of victory The legendaryphoenix that rises from the ashes is nothing compared to Netanyahu Sametsaid            Both Haaretz andYediot Aharanot reported Monday that Yasser Arafat will now delay thedeclaration of a Palestinian state which had been planned for May  until theend of the year Haaretz attributed this report tosources close to the Palestinian leader while Yediot Aharanot gave itas the opinion of US Special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross ascontained in a secret report from the Israeli Embassy in Washington to theforeign ministry in Jerusalem Haaretz said Arafat is ready tonegotiate a new date with the United States with the most likely one beingDec  the eve of the new millennium It said Arafat was willing to negotiatethis postponement because he fears that a Palestinian independence declarationon the eve of an Israeli election would give Netanyahu a boost            In Russia Nezavisimaya Gazeta said Monday that the idea of aRussoAmerican partnership is now a dead duck Washington is angry aboutRussias criticisms of Operation Desert Fox while Moscow is angry with theUnited States for boycotting Russian research centers as a punishment for themallegedly having supplied nuclear missile technology to Iran America ispragmatic and dedicated exclusively to the promotion of its own interests thepaper said and it is time that Moscow realized this Why beat on a closeddoor it asked Why do it now when the US so frequently demonstrates itsdissatisfaction with the Russian stand on many issues and is even prepared topunish us for it            Meanwhile Segodnya reported that there is nosign of the documents cited by National Security Adviser Sandy Berger as proofof Russias nuclear cooperation with Iran The US Administration stated onJanuary  that all documents on the Iranian case have been transferred tothe competent Russian agencies through diplomatic channels Segodnyasaid This newspaper tried to trace these documents in Moscow but failed tofind them in the government the Security Council the Federal SecurityService or the Foreign Ministry Neither could the State Department and the USEmbassy in Moscow say to which address these documents had been dispatchedThe paper added that Moscow is now preparing to publicly accuse Washington ofdefamation Denying all the American allegations an unnamed Russianintelligence official interviewed by the newspaper blamed them on the currentpolitical situation in the US The official added Some faction probably usedthe Iranian factor artificially to complicate relations with Russia            On the new illness ofRussian President Boris Yeltsin the newspaper Vremya said his acutehemorrhaging ulcer of the stomach was bad news for several reasons First ahemorrhaging ulcer is a serious and painful disease which even youngerpatients find it difficult to combat Second this reveals the full extent ofthe incompetence of the presidents doctors the paper said Too many cooksspoil the broth as the saying goes The best doctors in the country eitherdidnt notice the development of ulcer in the case of their important patientor they themselves produced it by filling the president up with pills beforethe New Year Vremya also pointed out that to this day PresidentYeltsin remains the only guarantee against which international financialorganizations would agree to give further credits to Moscow or to postpone therepayment of its debts provided Yeltsin promised to make the Primakovgovernment pursue a reasonable economic policy            The main story across Europe Monday was the massacre atRacak in Kosovo in which  Albanians were killed with many newspapersdemanding steps by the West to bring the perpetrators to justice In ParisTuesdays edition of LeMonde carried an editorial headlined There Will Be Other Racakssaying that the massacre had been wholly predictable because the West didnteven give itself the means to be taken seriously by Milosevic  Once againthe day after Racak they multiply their warnings and threats and send NATOgenerals to Belgrade when they should be putting on a show of force on theground            In London the liberalGuardian saidthat war over Kosovo will be inevitable if Americans and western Europeansdont send in troops This will almost certainly have to be a NATO rather thana United Nations operation as in Bosnia the Guardian said It willespecially be a test for the British and French governments and of their newunderstanding on security matters since the United States is unlikely to bewilling to contribute more than a token number of ground troops            The conservative Daily Telegraphalso argued for a tough line saying that the atrocity cannotbe allowed to go unpunished and that if the culpability of the Serb police wasestablished Milosevic should face indictment as the commanderinchief of theYugoslav security forces with ultimate responsibility for their actions As for stopping the killing only drastic measures are likely to work such asdeployment of a fully armed NATO deterrent force as is being proposed in somequarters of Congress            In an editorial Mondaydevoted to the Clinton impeachment the Times of London saidthat only a confession by the president that he had lied undercrossexamination could bring the trial to a swift end But instead he willcontinue to rely on public opinion to keep his jurors from convicting him andin his State of the Union message will propose scores of popularmeasures designed to secure poll ratings even if they have no chance ofentering law The editorial continued He is rightly confident that that bysuch means he can maintain himself in power But he should also be concernedabout his reputation Martin Luther King whose memory Americans celebratetoday once asserted On truth there can be no ambiguity on justice nocompromise
