traditionally been conservativeabout whom they bestow scientific awards upon Albert Einstein got his Nobel inphysics  years after he published his work but the committee declined toendorse that reckless relativity stuff            Whatthen is one to make of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine awarded toneurologist Stanley Prusiner this week Prusiners hypothesis is that fatalbrain maladies such as madcow disease and CreutzfeldtJakob disease are causednot by viruses bacteria fungi or some other mundane agent but by somethingstartlingly new that he has discoveredmutant rampaging proteins known asprions short for proteinaceous infectious particles            But do prions cause these diseases In the past yearScience and Nature  the two most distinguished scientificjournals have published three major papers suggesting that the causativeagents of these diseases are not prions and that Prusiners  years ofprion research is simply wrong The latest of these papers was published lastweek in Nature s Oct  issue            Beforemoving on a quick course in molecular biology All living creatures fromviruses on up pull off the feat of selfreplication by encoding the necessaryinformation in nucleic acidsin particular the doublestranded DNA discoveredby Crick and Watson or for a few renegade viruses singlestranded RNA or evensinglestranded DNA These nucleic acids then code for and generate proteinswhich are the stuff were made of Prusiners proposition is that it isproteins not slow viruses that are the infectious agent in madcowlikediseases This is what makes Prusiners hypothesis so radical Prions would bethe only proteins on the planet that reproducenot to mention infect and killanimalsand thus the only known exceptions to the rules of the CrickWatsonparadigm of molecular biology            Prusiners proposition has been controversialfrom the getgo The researcher who did Prusiners lab work at the Universityof California at San Francisco quit over the publication of Prusiners veryfirst prion paper in  arguing that Prusiner was overinterpreting theavailable data to push the prion hypothesis            Over thenext  years Prusiner won over virtually everyone to his prionhypothesisthe lay press the scientific pressbut not the researchers in hisfield He got his share of bad press for which I takeand am givenentirelytoo much credit read my December  feature story in Discover byclicking  By  when Prusiners own papers were still suggesting that theprion hypothesis was at best a long shot he won a million congressionalaward to determine the structure of prions and how they cause disease In Prusiner reported at a major conference that he had proved that theinfectious agents of these diseases were proteins free of nucleic acids Inparticular he had created mice with a genetic mutation that caused what was anormal proteinthe prion protein in Prusiners lingoto become abnormal andproduce disease He then took brain matter from these mice and injected it intonew mice which promptly got sick showing that no viral particles werenecessary to transmit the disease But there was still no paper proving theresults to the scientific community            Two years later when he presented the same mice work atanother conference the news pages of Science and Nature wrote itup as if it cinched the prion hypothesis Although Prusiners work had not beenreplicated by anyone and he had still not published these supposedly seminalfindings that prions cause disease in a peerreviewed journal he won theprestigious Albert Lasker Award in October  The Lasker Award isconsidered a shortlist for the Nobel When he finally published hisproofofprion paper it was only after it had been rejected by the journalCell  Prusiner managed to find a home for it in the Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Science  where it wouldnt have to bepeerreviewed The paper was largely ignored and it was dissed even byPrusiner who admitted to a New York Times reporter that it wasuncompelling Scientists who read the paper suggested that its findings couldbe explained by contamination which is to say by sloppy laboratoryprocedures But four months later Prusiner was still describing the mice workto Scientific American s lay readers as a persuasive experiment            Prusinersboilerplate response to prion critics has been that if madcow disease or anyof the other prion diseases is caused by a virus then surely that viruswould have been discovered by now The fact is its damned hard to find avirus in a mishmash of animal brains which is where you have to look Onereason a virus hasnt been foundif indeed a virus causes these diseasesisthat no one is doing the laborious and expensive work to find it It can takeresearchers decades to find culpable viruseshepatitis C is a famous exampleBut at least those researchers got funded to look which has not been the casein the prion field Prusiner has received in the neighborhood of  million infunding from the National Institutes of Health since  Qualified criticswho request money from the NIH to look for viruses are told by NIH bureaucratsthat if the virus turns out not to exist then their study will have been ofinsufficient significance and scientific merit and thus not worth doing            Despite the vindication offered by Stockholmthe prion hypothesis is still rife with loopholes For instance the diseasesthat allegedly are caused by prions come in a few dozen different strains thesame way that dogs come in different breeds Its easy to imagine variations inviruses or bacteria because they contain nucleic acids which encode forvariations But even Prusiner hasnt been able to explain how a protein thathas no nucleic acid could encode for the variations His own grant proposalsavailable on the Web through the NIH CRISP database are evidence of the problem Onedescribes the problem of prion strains as a fascinating conundrum whileanother explains that the goal of the research project is to find out whetherthe strains differ in the properties of the scrapie form of the prionprotein or whether a second component is responsible for strain specificity theobvious candidate being a nucleic acid            Strainsarent the only problem with the hypothesis Prusiner has yet to show forinstance that a protein sans nucleic acid can be infectious and consequentlyhe has invoked the potential involvement of yet another agent in the diseaseprocess although he insists it has no nucleic acid and calls it Protein XSome of his fellow prion researchers suggest it might be a viral cofactorwhich is doublespeak for saying that the prion aint the infectious agent avirus is            One member of the Nobel Committee says his colleagues wereaware of unanswered questions in the prion hypothesis but awarded Prusiner theprize in recognition of the wealth of information he has unearthed onmadcowlike diseases But if it turns out that viruses do cause thediseases then Prusiner will have won the prize for the discovery of somethingspectacularly wrong            Good science not just NobelPrizecaliber science depends on hypothesis and test and then the rigorousdemonstration that the preferred interpretation of the data was the onlyinterpretation In other words remarkable results demand remarkable evidenceIn the case of Prusiners prize the Nobel Committee has settled for enthusiasmand singlemindedness
