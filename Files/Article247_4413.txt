                                 Change Should Be Welcomed                        Well I am more than glad that Larrythinks that I have joined issues on the matter and have been able to penetratethis world notwithstanding my ivorytowerlibertarian credentials Indeed Ithink that his answer is so useful precisely because it does not rely on anyprivate norms of the cyberspace community in dealing with the broader issuesSubstantively the question he poses at the outset of his letter is one that weshould all answer Why is this space different from any other space Why andhow will markets reduce freedom there            In answering that question I will start again from the other side to makethe case that the complications and issues that he sees in cyberspace arereflections of similar issues that have developed in other markets where theissue is the same How do we overlay private businesses of one sort or anotheron some common grid or infrastructure It is clear that architecture matters inboth kinds of space and in pretty much the same kind of way As a firstapproximation we need to have public highways because it is simply too costlyin ordinary space to build roads that stand one beside the other each limitedto a certain group But the converse hardly follows from that observationThere is no need for all roads to be public A large ranch can have lots ofprivate highways for internal communication Common gated communities haveroads that exclude the public by allowing limited entry by all members of thiscommons And if someone could acquire the land to build a private road beside apublic one we should not begrudge him because he removes some traffic from thecommon infrastructure            Now what happens if the cost of private roads really drops so that everyonecan afford the right level of individualization The answer is that we get moreprivate roads This is what has happened in the telephone industry The partyline by which several families shared a single telephone line went the way ofthe dodo when the cost of technology allowed for cheaper phone lines to bedeveloped And so it is on the Net The reduction in cost could easily allowthe creation of private lines side by side with that open space and if we havethese two regimes public and private operating side by side we can recognizeit not only as a profound change in the Net but a welcome change that ispredictable as a matter of general economic theory            Larry is less sanguine about this because he thinks that the architecture ofthese private structures does more than make commerce more efficient It alsomakes control cheaper But here I can accept the descriptive conclusion butdoubt whether he has pointed to a matter of concern It is as not as thoughwhen ATT starts its broadband system that it can compel me to join itThere still remains the older public road for those who do not want to go alongthe private road The presence of ATT allows for more sorting in themarketplace which means that those people who care more about freedom can movein one direction with the legions of hackers and researchers while those whocare more about security can migrate to a network that gives them protectionagainst anything from advertisement to smut It is hard to see any systemwidethreat to liberty when new technology increases the ability of all individualsto separate themselves from their fellow man and to filter out the informationthat they do not want It is not as though ATT is replacing the open NetIt is giving an alternative avenue to it            Larry then talks about the issue of anonymity and there again we have tolook at both sides of the question Some people prize anonymous speech TheFederalist Papers were written in that voice But no one prizes anonymousthreats or thefts so the question is whether individuals will trade in libertyfor security in the same fashion that Locke asked in dealing with the socialcontract Nor is there anything that says that the choice of anonymity oridentification has to be made once and for all Creditcard companiesfrequently collate data in ways that allow for targeted mailings byadvertisers Most people welcome this because they know that the address can beused by an advertiser without being given to him The company prepares a listfor thirdparty use and guarantees that the names fit certain protocols Anyonewho wants out can click a button to escape Here a good technology allowschoices to be heavily individuated A technological and design issue thatexpands freedom in sensible ways It is not that the Net is architected asthough it were an all or nothing issue It is the extent that any portal to theNet architects itself and gives notice of its deep structure to the rest of theworld            On a similar front several highschool students at the University ofChicago Laboratory Schools designed a program that allows individuals to covertheir tracks when they surf the Net Here again the private response to thesystemwide structure helps improve matters Cookies are subject to the sameanalysis Let Netscape track me so long as they disclose what they are doingBut I think that they would lose market share if they did not allow users todisable the system with a click of the mouse which I take it they do So againindividuation works Taken as a whole then I see no reason for gloom that wehave changed the Net as its user population changes            Larry promises us that more is in store The older Net was endtoend sothat all the action was in the user applications That is fine in principleBut what if the user wants to put his own private network at the end I seenothing wrong with this approach and it would allow Harvard to have as Larrynotes a heavily regulated internal computer culture while the University ofChicago is more opena good reason for Larry to return to his intellectualhome at Chicago But does the new network addon violate the old principle Notas far as I can see It is the gated community example all over The same openNet carries the same traffic as before It is not as though the size of thecommons is diminished because of the subdivision on its side            But what about ATT Let it build its own system so long as it does notshut down any other But now they want to make sure that they influence thetraffic over the Net So they will get less for the service they supply andothers will remain part time on the public highway Or if they have acquiredtoo many direct competitors then we have a situation where there are possibleearthbound antitrust issues a point on which I would be skeptical given theease of entry through other portals on the Net Its power to discriminate couldadd value to consumers and if it does not it will become the Gandor Airportof the  st century            Maybe now we have an explanation for the larger puzzle Why arecyberlibertarians slow to recognize the dangers to the Net from the new set ofuses My explanation is that of optimism itself I dont think there aredangers that are anything close to the enormous possibilities that areintroduced by the enormous expansion of its use That one Net can supportmillions of Web sites dedicated to all sorts of different ends is a tribute tothe original model of how private diversity can flourish on a public grid Whatis truly optimistic about the Net is the sense of ratios The amount of spacethat has to be kept public for all to gain access is relatively small comparedwith the amount of land that has to be used to maintain a coherent highwaysystem So I quite agree that we should pay attention to these changes But Idisagree that we should view them with suspicion The blurb on Larrys bookspeaks of it as a dark exhilarating work I see the cause of exhilarationbut dont have Larrys dark forebodings So long as we keep our intellectualfeet firmly on the ground we shall not lose our way in cyberspace Over to youLarry to explain why this happy estimation of the future is misguided and agloomier response is warranted
