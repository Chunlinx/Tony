                                 Why Saddam Gets Away With It            Why have Americas Araballies from Operation Desert Storm been so skittish about a sequel SaudiArabias leaders say they wont let the United States use combat jets stationedin their country in raids against Iraq AlAhram  the main stateownednewspaper of Egypt recently warned the United States that any strike would becoercive aggressive unwise and uncaring about the lives of Iraqis Themost outspoken opponent of renewed bombing has been Syria Iraqs archrivalEven the Gulf emirates are nervous            Youdthink theyd all be more accommodating Just eight years ago with Kuwaitoccupied and Iraqi troops massed along the Saudi border the Saudis asked forUS help That unprecedented request enlisting Western aid in an intraArabwar seemed to mark a turning point in Arab politics triggering a regionalreconfiguration of alliances So why are Americas former partners balking            Fouad Ajami helps explain this riddleand many othersinhis new book The Dream Palace of the Arabs  Ajami a Lebanese Shiitewho now heads Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University offers ahaunting portrait of a generation of Arab intellectuals forced to come to termswith the West All too often he finds they have failed to do so preferringthe invocation of Arab unity and antiWestern defiance to dealing with thepolitical realities of the Middle East            This isone reason Americas threat to bomb Iraq is provoking such resistance Meddlingby the West is still widely unpopular in many parts of the Arab world evenamong those who dont relish the thought of Saddam Husseins chemical andbiological weapons US intervention smacks of the old Western habit ofarranging Arab affairs to suit Western convenience Many Arabs would ratherrelive the glory days of the  Suez crisis when the great hero of Arabnationalism Egypts Gamal Abdel Nasser withstood an invasion by BritainFrance and Israel Ajami empathizes with the frustration engendered by Westerninconsistency and arrogance But he knows that Saddams brand of nationalism isas much of a dead end as Nassers proved to be and he worries that so manyArab intellectuals seem not to mind being taken for another ride            Ajami the author of The ArabPredicament  the classic  intellectual history of modern Arab politicalthought is probably the second most influential ArabAmerican publicintellectual Pride of place goes to Columbia Universitys Edward Said who isno fan of Ajamis In his groundbreaking  study Orientalism  Saidaccused previous generations of scholars of peddling a view of an exoticbackward savage Orient the intellectual justification for colonizing ormanipulating the region As Albert Hourani the dean of Middle East historiansonce put it in a stroke Said changed Orientalist from a legitimate academicspecialty into an insult            Some ofSaids admirers refer to Ajami by the ugly term Uncle Abua play on UncleTom meaning in this case an Arab Orientalist They will note that Ajami takeshis new books title from TE Lawrence the archOrientalist British colonelof World War I fame and they will accuse him of imperialist sympathies ButAjami a scrupulous commentator with a rich sense of irony is using Lawrenceto make a subtler point The Arabs did not build the inspired dream palace oftheir national thoughts that Lawrence sought to give them they tried to builda dream palace of their own an intellectual edifice influenced by the Westbut not of the West Ajami is invoking Lawrence knowingly to underscorewhat he views as the central Arab quandary To Ajami Lawrence represents boththe good side of the Westits ideas of democratic governance its support forArab sovereigntyas well as its bad side Orientalism meddling Lawrence andhis heirs the colonial masters from Britain and France left the Middle Eastwith a complicated legacy of attraction and repulsion            Ajami begins his book with a bang the suicide of KhalilHawi a Lebanese poet who shot himself on the day in  when Israel invadedBeirut Hawi a Christian from Mount Lebanon turned bigcity academic whoseoften political poetry had once made him an Arab nationalist hero despairedover the wider Arab worlds abandonment of his beloved Lebanon The weakestmost fractured Arab state had become the front line for an IsraeliPalestinianwar that other Arab countries wanted kept far from their borders Hawi had alsocome to detest the willingness of his fellow thinkers to become rentedmouthpieces for Lebanons myriad parties and militias to cheer as the countryimploded Hawi saw Lebanons dirty war as a meaningless blood bath rather thanas another glorious confrontation with Israel Through the tragic figure ofHawi Ajami mourns the tolerant graceful cosmopolitan Beirut of his youth anddecries the factionalism that led to its ruin            Ajamicomplains that many Arab writers and pundits prefer simply not to deal with thecruel realities of the Middle East today the gap between petrodollar wealth inthe Gulf and uninspiring economic growth elsewhere the persistence ofautocracy and the failure to develop accountable governments the debilitatingenmity with Israel the legacy of foreign rule the influence of Westernpolitical ideas and the sheer power of the United States And so they have fledinto panArabism instead            PanArabism dates back to the collapse of theOttoman Turks in World War I which paved the way for what the Greek Orthodoxwriter George Antonius in  famously called the Arab Awakeningtheprospect of Arab selfrule PanArabists sought to unify all Arabs across theartificial borders drawn by the Western empires hearkening back to theglorious Arab caliphates Britain and France who vanquished Turkey in the warhad other ideas and the emergence of real Arab states was deferred But by thes and s the awakening seemed underway led by Nasser and Egypt            Theproblem was that it didnt work The Arab states that arose were uninspiringmonarchies or autocracies and Nassers grand dream of a united panArab statethat included Palestine came crashing down with the Arabs ignominious defeatin the  Six Day War But despite Nassers humiliation diehards stillcling to his legacy and excoriate those who dare doubt its ultimate triumphHaving seen panArabism bankrupted in  more and more Arabs are seekingsolutions from the pastin Islamic fundamentalism which seeks to remodelMuslim societies along the lines of Arabia under the Prophet Mohammed Thispath has been smoothed by the nihilism of those Arab intellectualsincludingSaidwho prefer utopian dreams to a view of politics as the art ofcompromise            The Arab predicament is most painfully evident in whatAjami calls the orphaned peace with Israel The intellectual guardians ofArab nationalist orthodoxySaid the Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani Egyptiancultural leader Saad Eddin Wahbe Egyptian editor and pundit MohamedHeikalhave never accepted the fact of Israel they cannot envision a worldwithout the rallying cause of antiZionism Nothing could have been moreinfuriating to them than the sight of Yasser Arafat the embodiment ofPalestinian nationalism shaking hands with Yitzhak Rabin Israels late primeminister They never forgave Arafat for bowing to what Ajami calls the logicof brute irreversible facts To them the  Oslo accords meant settlingfor a sadly truncated form of Palestinian selfrule without extracting anIsraeli admission of wrongdoing Indeed Said and other rejectionists showed aperverse glee when Israels dovish Labor Party was defeated by BenjaminNetanyahus Likud Here again was a world they could understand Men lovethe troubles they know Ajami witheringly observes            Ajamis heroes are figuressuch as Egypts novelist Naguib Mahfuz the Palestinian academic SariNusseibah and the tragic Hawimen of integrity imbued with the oldconfident spirit of cosmopolitanism and an openness to the Western ideas thatled to the Arab awakening in the first place But they are under siegeMahfuzs secular liberalism so enraged Egypts Islamists that one fanaticknifed the old man paralyzing his writing hand            The political culture ofnationalism reserved its approval for those who led ruinous campaigns inpursuit of impossible quests Ajami writes Campaigns do not come much moreruinous than Saddams  invasion of Iran or his occupation of Kuwait adecade later But Saddam for all his strategic blunders is deft at posing astodays heir to the tradition of Arab nationalism As Bill Clinton ratchets upthe pressure on Baghdad Saddam will inevitably bellow Nasserite defianceAjamis book is an indispensable guide to why anyone in the Arab world stilllistens to it
