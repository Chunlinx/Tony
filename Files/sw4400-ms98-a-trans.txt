             yeah uh do do you uh do any work on your own cars   i uh i used to i dont uh much anymore except just change the oil occasionally   oh yeah yeah i actually i just uh just recently thought about buying a new car and i went and i saw all the Japanese cars and uh really liked the uh actually the Diamante which is uh sort of the luxury Nissan   oh yeah   uh but i i just decided i wasnt gonna get  i wasnt first of all i wasnt gonna get a Japanese car that was about the time that uh   oh yeah that   you know all the all the sort of antitrade stuff was going on  and then uh later decided that uh id just hang on to my own car which has about two hundred and eighteen thousand miles on it its a Chevy Celebrity four cylinder   oh my goodness thats very good   and ive driven it since uh grad school and uh just decided you know i think ill hang on to this car you know its been so good for me for me all this time so uh in fact i got my wife a a used car that was uh also a Chevy Celebrity because   you had good luck with that one huh   you know ive i had good luck and uh i knew enough about all the the basic maintenance you know brakes oil and that kind of stuff to do it myself so   well thats uh i id certainly agree with your with your logic there my uh   uh   feelings about cars are id look under the hood and i see all the um all the stuff under there and i say boy my chances of of doing how shall i say it uh everythings electronic uh  uh its not that id i mean cancel their time its just that uh theres so much you know you cant and you cant tune it yourself you cant do anything its because you dont have the the tools to measure it on on the other hand im i i have a   yeah yeah yeah   a ninety Honda and uh im kind of on the other end of the spectrum i have lets see i have uh twelve thousand miles on a little over a two year old car   all right   and uh     so you dont have any problems with it   so yeah and its a its a absolutely flawless car it uh and its the smoothest car ive ever ridden i uh ah  whats that   is it an Accord its an Accord   Accord yes and uh so the the things that personally if i ever if i had to buy another car uh   yeah   huh id be  the the new American cars uh their ads intrigue me because they think they can catch up uh with uh the Japanese but as far as   uhhuh   i i think one of the things that they are going to have to impress me with is is again this uh the thing that impresses you about yours and thats uh frequency of repair and and absolute reliability   yeah yeah   because the worst thing that can happen to a person is i think is uh to have to go in and get it fixed you know its its   yep yeah because it just breaks it more     yeah  theres a a that that was i i noticed that uh uh with one of my other cars uh if if theres this kind of uh natural curve of decay you know decay curve uh half the time when you take it in its farther down the and you get it back its farther down the curve than when you took it in   yeah   yeah   because those guys are theyre being paid for uh you know last time i had my car repaired uh even even this car i took it in they said sixty dollars an hour and   wow thats as much as i make programming   and well i said sixty dollars an hour   i mean and i dont even get the sixty i only make i only get the thirty so   they charged me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my car out at an hour after they clocked it in     huh   so they they charged me for two and a half you know basically two and a half hours uh labor an hour later and i asked them about that and they said thats uh   yeah   oh thats flat rate sir you know that they look it up in the book and if it takes an hour to do something why and they can get it done in thirty minutes why they charge you an hour   huh   so anyway those that uh     in other words theres no theres no benefit for going to a skilled mechanic   yeah so uh anyway what im looking for is is reliability because i wanna keep it away from the from the uh the repair people   yeah   and the other thing im i guess id be looking for is uh um you know mileage counts with me even though i even though i dont drive that much i i like mileage   yeah yeah somebody told me uh once the a casual conversation that this guy ran a a towing service   and uh   and uh i was telling him about you know i was thinking about buying a car and he said you know i he said he he knew it would sound biased but he said that about uh i dont know four out of five cars that he tows are Japanese cars and he said he just he didnt why you know hed been in the hed been in the business for awhile and he wasnt sure maybe it was because people who bought those cars       you know would would rather have it towed than try some other thing you know like you know having somebody drag it home with a chain
