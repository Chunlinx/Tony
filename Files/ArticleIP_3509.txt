                                 Rough Beasts                           Note This is thefirst in an occasional series assessing the narrative logic of movies                        We have recently crossed animportant cultural divide Movies now make less sense than rock lyrics Once itseemed that the nonsensical blather of a song like Americas Horse With NoName with the immortal lines The heat was hot and In the desert You cantremember your name Cause there aint no one For to give you no pain couldnever be challenged by any rival in any other art form But that was beforethey released The Saint  This unfathomable spy movie is about a masterof disguise who dresses up as among other things a Spanish poet and anacademic doofus to trick the heroinea lonely but gorgeous physicist withheart diseaseinto surrendering the coldfusion formula she carries in herbra And thats the part that makes sense            How domovies like this happen Its hard to say The Saint may be one of thoserare cases in which the inanity is deliberate The fact that nothing inthis movie bears any relation to the basic causeandeffect propositions ofearthly life suggests a conscious stupidity on the part of the filmmakers thatmay in fact be a guiding aesthetic            With the average film though nothing of the sort isintended Those of us who write screenplays for a living are always perplexedat what leaky logic vessels most movies turn out to be given the endlessdevelopment process that takes place before production begins In draft afterdraft in script meeting after script meeting every narrative line is examinedfor signs of warp every motivation of every character is finely adjusteduntil the story is as watertight as a birchbark canoe            But when a movie nearsproduction that canoe is suddenly launched into Niagara Falls The dawdlingprecision of development gives way to velocity and chaos Perhaps a big starcomes aboard declares the script a disaster for reasons of his own andconvinces the studio to hire another writeror five or sixso that the finalshooting script is nothing but a pastiche of scenes from a dozen differentdrafts Perhaps a director has a vision of a big boat slamming into somethinga feature by the way of at least four recent films and uses up so much ofthe budget to bring it to reality that key scenes explaining who was on theboat and why it was out of control are never shot Or perhaps the scenes areshot and never used because the first cut of the movie is an hour too long            Then ofcourse theres the simpler observation that some movies are just badlyimagined and badly written and nobody cares enough to do anything aboutit            In any case this movie season is turning outto be a festival of incoherence It has brought us not only The Saintbut also the braindead epics Anaconda  Volcano  and The FifthElement  Measured against this company Steven Spielbergs The LostWorld seems at first glance to be a seamless web of logic Nowhere inThe Lost World s bestiary is there a creature that behaves with themotivational abandon of that snake in Anaconda  striking minorcharacters with accuracy and blinding velocity in one scene hovering andhissing and generally dithering around in the next so that the heroine hasplenty of time to escape When you see this snake swallow Jon Voight and thenregurgitate him in front of Jennifer Lopez like a cat presenting a dead birdwhen you see Voight give a little ironic wink before collapsing to the floorand dying in a puddle of digestive slime you are witnessing one of thoseclassic IDontThinkSo moments that help define the contemporary moviegoingexperience            TheIDontThinkSos in The Lost World are not lovingly premeditated asthey appear to be in The Saint  Theyre the products of sloppy thinkingHere is a movie that has no trouble making us believe its presidingwhopperreconstituted dinosaursbut then continually breaches the credibilitycontract on relatively minor reality issues like torque animal behavior andmaritime shipping            What are the odds that an yearold girl who has been cutfrom the school gym team would upon finding herself besieged by velociraptorsin an abandoned dinosaurbreeding station happen to be standing under a pairof handy parallel bars Is it likely that she could by twirling around andaround on the bars generate enough power to kick the pouncing velociraptorweighing in at  pounds easy through the air and out the window            Here comes a tyrannosaurusrex charging down a stream bed after a mob of panicky humans It growls andsnaps at the air and though it does manage to stomp one victim who in a nicetouch sticks to the bottom of its foot like a piece of gum in general itmoves with such a lumbering gait that we might as well be back in the swatching Valley of the Gwangi  Where is the lethal swiftness of thepredator If a crocodile can outrun a human being why cant a TRex            OK sothen they sedate the dinosaur and put it on a ship and send it to San Diego Inmidocean the TRex wakes up and somehow breaks out of its heavily securedcargo hold eats everybody on board then cleverly scurries back into hidingSo much for the cruel stereotype of the peabrained dinosaur            The biggest logic bloopers in The LostWorld arise from the conventionality at the heart of the movie NeitherSpielberg nor screenwriter David Koepp nor Michael Crichton on whose novelthe movie is based have shown any interest in challenging the moralisticassumption at the heart of almost every creature feature That good intentionsspunkiness and above all good looks are the safeguards against rampagingmonsters In movies like The Lost World  dinosaurs are not justpredators but avengers nibbling a prissy little rich girl here chomping anenvironmentally insensitive CEO there The bill of fare is numbingly standardVillains are picked off in order of ascending nastinesssadistic brutesfollowed by smarmy flacks followed by twisted visionaries in expensive suitsAmong the heroes we dont have to worry about the principled male scientistthe dynamic female animal behaviorist or the stowaway children But even amongthe good guys a marginal physiognomy or a receding hairline can spell doomKeep your eye on that sadfaced electronics specialist Hes bald and hesgonna pay
