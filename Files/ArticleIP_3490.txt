                                 Battle Station            Randy Johnson ace of theSeattle Mariners is the most thrilling harrowing pitcher in baseball Hes alefthander who puts the sinister back in sinistral Hes  feet  inchestall gaunt with long scraggly hair a rough complexion humorlesseyesaltogether a bit too much of that hitchhiker look As if throwing theball  miles per hour isnt wicked enough he does it with a wild whippingsidearm motion which makes lefthanded batters want to dive out of the box andhead back to the dugout even as the ball is crossing the plate For manyhitters the best strategy for facing Johnson is simple Stay on the bench            Mybrother and I watched Johnson one afternoon recently at Camden Yards home ofthe Baltimore Orioles We could barely take our eyes off him            We didnt notice the catcher            The catcher I learned dayslater when I decided to research the subject was Dan Wilson He is actuallyone of the better catchers in the game But needless to say he is not a starHes no Johnny Bench Hes not even an Ivan Pudge Rodriguez It is hard to bea star when you are a catcher especially when theres the real thing theglamour boy the icon just  feet  inches away on the mound            Thecatcher has the least glamorous most difficult and most selfsacrificing jobin the game He has to do everythingcall pitches throw out basestealersreposition infielders chase down foul balls calm pitchers doctor the ballestablish a rapport with the umpire so he calls a big strike zone chase buntsrun down toward first base to back up the throw from shortstop and worst ofall guard home plate even if it means getting bowled over by chargingopponents Ray Fosse never really recovered from the separated shoulder he gotwhen Pete Rose decided to slam into him at home plate during the  AllStargame Rose set the alltime record for base hits while playing various infieldpositions while Fosse became known only as the guy who got smashed            Acatchers life is Hobbesian Bill Dickeycatcher on the great Yankee teams during the s once got leveled by a baserunner even though the guy could have slid into home far ahead of the ballDickey marched over to the dugout and punched the offender in the face earninga months suspension and a thousandbuck fine Catching pioneer and Hall ofFamer Roger Bresnahan invented the shinguards and the helmet just after theturn of the century when he got tired of getting whonked constantlyat onepoint some writers in New York City reported that Bresnahan had died after aparticularly vicious fastball off his noggin According to Thomas OwensGreat Catchers  Bresnahan worked in the offseason as a privatedetectivea catchers mind is never at rest it seems            A catcheris something of a baseball martyr Catchers are almost invariably slow of footsimply from years of squatting the leg muscles shortening with timeStatistically catchers rarely put up huge career totals in home runs or RBIsbecause no one can catch a seasons worth of games  Catching  is thestuff of an iron man Eventually catchers who can still hit retire to firstbase a position for the fat the stiff the lame and the halt            The catcher sees everythinghes in the center of theaction Yet he is not really seen  The geometry of the game conspires tohide him He must wear a mask He must wear pads and shinguards He is obscuredby his posturea squatand the big mitt he must position in front of himselfHes more of a concept than an actual person The catcher is merely implicitapresumption of the game like the scorekeeper or the grounds crew The catcheris right there in the thick of the action but no more interesting than thechalk lines that delineate the batters box            The catcher is a bluecollarworker in a game of millionaires He wears a steel mask over a helmet whosebill points backward a style that invariably makes even the most hardenedmature catcher seem oddly juvenile a man who failed to grow up All that hardwork and he just looks silly            A baseballcatcher has a nickname The backstop He might as well be an inert mass Yet ofcourse it is he not the pitcher who is the field general Because the pitcherstands tall in full view he cannot send a signal to the catcher as to whatpitch will come next It is the catcher low to the ground with that shadowyzone around his groin who must call the pitch The catcher also gives signalsto the infielders letting them know what to do in case of a double steal orwhat to do if a runner at first tries to steal when theres also a runner atthird Because the catcher calls the game he must know the hitting abilitiesand weaknesses of every opposing batter The catcher is essentially thequarterback of baseball only without the huge endorsement contracts            Chris Hoiles starting catcher for the Oriolestold me one day in the locker room Were usually the dirtiest guys on thefield and the sweatiest guys on the field We stink all the time            He said his gear gets reallyraunchy Its no fun to strap that stuff on when the thermometer hits the uppers And that squatting he doesits as uncomfortable as it looks Meanwhilehe says of the pitcher All the eyes are on him All the recognition goes tohim Theres no whine in his voice This is just reality He knows that when apitcher throws a nohitter the catcher is lucky to get in the photograph in thenext days paper            Hoiles is a big slab of aman now  a veteran but not a star The rap on him is that he cant throwout base runners The thing that impresses fans with catchers is armstrength says Orioles bench coach Andy Etchebarren            Hoiles admits he never had astrong arm He is otherwise steady on defense and can hit home runs He becamea catcher because he grew up in Bowling Green Ohio in the era when JohnnyBench ruled the Reds down in Cincinnati Meeting Bench was one of the greatestmoments of his life            Iabsolutely love the position he says Youre right in the middle of theaction Youre the one that has to make a lot of decisions Theres a lot ofprestige in the position            He means prestige in terms of the team It doesnt carrythat far beyond the dugout though The catcher has always been a somewhatoverlooked position Even Yogi Berra a Hall of Famer was never the great heroof the Yankeeshe labored in the shadow of greater stars like Mickey Mantleand Whitey Ford In my lifetime Johnny Bench has been the singular superstar ofthe position he was once on the cover of Time magazine There havebeen plenty of worthy catchersCarlton Fisk Bob Boonebut the ones thatbecame most famous are those who went into broadcasting such as Tim McCarverJoe Garagiola and Bob Uecker Mike Piazza of the Los Angeles Dodgers is thesnazziest young catcher and could be Cooperstown bound Lately I have beeninexplicably tempted to use Cooperstown bound when talking about each andevery baseball playereg Nice single there by Cooperstownbound AaronLedesma            In the Hall of Fame there areonly  catchers eight from this centuryfewer than one catcher per decadeThat compares with for example  right fielders and  pitchers Everyposition in baseball has more representatives in the Hall with the soleexception of             There is in fact a crisisof sorts in the catcher position No one wants to play it anymore Kids refuseto catch            Theresnot a whole lot of them out there says Etchebarren            Lenny Webster the Orioles backup catcher saidhe started playing the position because no one else would do it            You get beat up a lot hesays There are times when you have to block balls and theyre not alwaysgoing to hit that chest protector            Many ofthe top catchers these days are immigrantsonce again filling jobs thatnativeborn Americans are reluctant to do            Baseball has never been allowed by the intelligentsia to besimply a game played with a ballit must always be a metaphor for somethinggrander like democracy the recreation of the Garden of Eden the rights ofthe individual vs the needs of the collective or whatever In this annoyingtradition let me suggest that the plight of the catcher is symbolic of a diretrend in American societycall it the decatcherization of daily life We justdont get dirty like we used to We dont sweat We finesse our way out oftrouble using the checkbook rather than choose a brutal collision and trustthat we will hang on to the ball            We refuse to liveuncomfortably and in so doing lose all sorts of knowledge that can only comewith the grit of handson labor The problem with so many jobs in todayseconomy is not that they pay poorly but that they are vaporous the meremanipulation of words and symbols and concepts Michael Pollan the writer andmagazine editor writes in A Place of My Own about how he had become sodisconnected with the physical world that he finally decided to hammer togethera writing hut in his backyard a desperate attempt to make contact with realobjects            The affluent classes are morecomfortable than everwe can barely dimly imagine the world just twogenerations ago when millions of Americans cherished the Sears Roebuck catalogfor its utility as toilet paper It is now considered normal to travel severalblocks or even miles to find a place that charges more than a dollar for a cupof coffee But what great coffee We cherish our comfort our good food ourfriendly beverages In summer we condition our air so that we will notsweatexcept when we go to the gym where we pay someone money so that we canuse our muscles We are outfielders now We laze about in the grassy fields oflife We wonder if someone will hit us the ball
