                yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico   i was a resident although very young of the state of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state uh so i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i dont know very much about Puerto Rico um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i kind have a suspicion that that i believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a fullfledged state or or let it go one or the other what is your situation   well im i guess i dont have such such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard uh standard of living or at least um annual average income um part of this i suppose is justified in in in that the climate they dont need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the the more northern territories need however in that case i guess i would favor status quo i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there   oh thats very interesting   and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem um it was it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors uh   your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or   well probably more on in terms of the US um you know im im not quite sure how the US copes with this sort of thing ive lived abrode abroad most of my life so i guess i ive been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the the press as i was you know and uh becoming was becoming an adult so i dont know how the US would cope with it a   umhum   new state that is so very very poor   umhum   um i guess you know wed have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid   i guess um were assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or   i think so   okay thats something that that i guess i have not much of an image of other than than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although im aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have   umhum   um i dont know whether state would statehood would improve their economy i dont i dont know that the very the act of being a state would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they dont have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax i dont know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they arent a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they arent able to tax like a typical state would be how do you feel though about well i guess its to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how having having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didnt have ready negative feelings about being in the states in the Alaska at the time since they they voted absentee i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a second feeling of second class citizenry uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times in their not having a Senate representative   umhum yeah those those are good points um which obviously id never thought about um i dont know what uh i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own um ways of life than they would if if i im trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory   umhum   perhaps compulsory education   uh i see what you mean so that   um and taxes   yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i dont know i i dont even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation um frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and im thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i dont know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico um its interesting because i hadnt thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy uh i had thought of it more in terms of political uh realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country   umhum well well actually i think one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that   so   theyve recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway   umhum   so if theyve just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either theyre doing it because theyre afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they dont want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage     uhhuh thats interesting well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo   i i believe i would probably tend towards that   and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so im ultimately i guess im ultimately in favor of status quo also   well thats interesting   at this point leaning towards uh statehood   right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood   i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i dont think there are any prescriptions about against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something um i dont think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that im im bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of Americas strengths and thats the the the melting pot uh i i   umhum   am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but im troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past and im also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country   um   and Canada i guess comes to my mind as theyre going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that um im troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as t hat it intrudes it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect   umhum umhum thats interesting because although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience uh i was in bilingual education in California and i didnt have any problem with my students but i noticed my my brother who who was uh quite a bit younger was learning Spanish in elementar y school and he cant speak a word   hum   and so obviously it didnt work in California   yeah but im rather in favor of people being bilingual and id be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language   right right   but im  im disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level   oh i see   um im im concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess   umhum umhum   well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called   okay okay well thank you very much   goodbye   byebye
