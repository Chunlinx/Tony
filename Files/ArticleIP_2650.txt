                                 Dark Days at Sunbeam            Lifeblood hemorrhagingLimbs lopped off A general sense that everything is more than just a littlebit out of control All in all not an experience youd want to go through Butthen this is what happens when you have an accident with a chainsaw            In thiscase the chainsaw is Al Dunlap CEO of Sunbeam and the corporate executivewho has become legendary for his rapid restructuring of companies seeminglyplagued by slow sales high overhead and a lagging stock price The accidentis the sudden collapse of Dunlaps heretofore much praised turnaround effort atSunbeam a company that always had one of Americas most enduring brand namesbut before Dunlap had very little idea of what to do with it            Dunlap of course knew He shut down half ofSunbeams manufacturing plants including almost all its US factoriesoutsourced a higher percentage of the companys production cleaned updistribution channels refocused product lines around higher quality itemsfired thousands of workers Then he negotiated a sweet contract extension forhimself that included  million stock options Dunlap did all this to greatacclaim at least from Wall Street Sunbeams stock price tripled immediatelyafter the announcement of his arrival and in the following months it roseanother  percent In his inimitable fashion Dunlap spoke joyfully of thebillions of dollars in shareholder wealth he had created            Dunlapis famous for his short attention span Hes described himself as happiest inthe first year of a turnaround effort when urgent decisions have to be madeand implemented and results are immediately visible After three years thoughhes bored and ready for a new challenge So everyone expected that once therestructuring was done at Sunbeam Dunlap would either leave or have Sunbeamacquire another company upon which he could work his magic The smart money wason Dunlaps departure probably after selling Sunbeam to a competitor as hedid with Scott Paper But the smart money was wrongwhich doesnt mean itwasnt smart Dunlap decided to stay And in part it seems he made thatdecision precisely because he wanted to show his detractors of which                  Slate                has been oneclick here for DavidPlotzs assessment of Chainsaw Al that he could build for the future as wellas salvage companies from the past            The rap on Dunlap after all was not simplythat hes ruthless in job cutting and cavalier about the relationship betweencorporations and the communities in which they do business but also that hesa one trick pony Dunlap may be able to help companies put their shorttermfinancial houses in order the argument went but he cant actually turn acompany into a viable longterm enterprisewhich may explain why he alwaysseems to focus on selling a company after its been cleaned up And whileDunlap seems to harbor no trace of selfdoubt the impulse to quiet thesecritics must have been fairly strong            Andfor a time it looked as if Sunbeam actually was the marvelous turnaround storythat Dunlap tells about all his restructuring efforts It wasnt so much therise in the stock price that was impressive since Dunlaps presence aloneestablished the kind of expectations that automatically draw money into astock Instead it was the companys turn to profitability after quarter uponquarter of losses coupled with a planned and wellexecuted expansion ofSunbeams household product lines and a pretty convincing reinvigoration of thecompanys brand name It appeared that Dunlap might really be able tomanage            But appearances were wrong Sunbeam has nowannounced twice in three weeks that its sales and profit numbers in the latestquarter will be well below Wall Streets expectations Also that sales willactually be  percent below what they were a year ago which is to say that thecompany is shrinking not growing In addition Sunbeam has acquired threeconsumer products companiesColeman First Alert and Signature Brandsandthe costs of those acquisitions are going to be greater than Dunlap hadpreviously forecast even as the logic behind those acquisitions now looksincreasingly iffy Sunbeams stock price has fallen by more than percent            Youmight say then that Al Dunlap has now destroyed  billion in shareholderwealth In fact Sunbeams stock is just about where it was in the daysimmediately following Dunlaps appointment as CEO Dunlap though insists thatthe market has overreacted to the bad news and is missing the real storyApparently the market is an excellent barometer when it treats Dunlap well andwoefully inaccurate when it does not            Poetic justice is always satisfying But thereal question is what actually is wrong with the way Dunlap does business Itisnt the job cutting per se For the sake of employees as well as companiesworkers should be adding value with their labor and they dont get to do thatif theres no market for what theyre making And while Dunlap may have cut tooclose to the bone Sunbeam is not like Union Pacific or Aetna where excessivedownsizing clearly hurt their ability to function            Stillthe reliance on job cutting is symptomatic of Dunlaps real problem which isthe confusion between profits and growth For a turnaround to be real thecompany has to become not merely profitable but also positioned for steadygrowth In the short term killing slowmoving products shuttering factoriesand eliminating layers of management can cut costs so dramatically as to make acompany profitable even if its sales shrink But making that company grow inthe future is a very different task            And in the long term when there is nothingleft to cut the only way to increase profits is to increase sales In thisrespect its striking that in the press release announcing the latest turmoilDunlap said I want to stress that getting the right cost structure is onlythe first step in the process of building a powerful global business The factthat he felt the need to say this suggests he still doesnt fully believeit            Of course in some senseDunlap must think that growth is important because otherwise he wouldnt havespent billions of dollars to buy Coleman and First Alert and Signature BrandsBut here again its telling that when he thinks about the longtermsustainability of Sunbeam he thinks automatically about acquiring othercompanies Acquisitions are not necessarily mistakes General Electric andGeneral Motors among others have done a brilliant job of using acquisitionsto strengthen both themselves and the acquired companies But shuffling dollarsfrom one column to another is not the same as creating wealth Its not thesame as improving productivity Its not the same as adding real value to theeconomy And theres just not much evidence that Dunlap knows how to do any ofthose In the end its not that Dunlap is a shortterm thinker Its that evenas a longterm thinker hes thinking about the wrong things
