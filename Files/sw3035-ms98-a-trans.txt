        uh our children are both uh basically adults they weve weve got two uh ones twenty one and ones twenty five and they they still live at home   umhum umhum   well thats thats a little unusual for uh for children of that age to have both of them that age at home but uh i guess the activities that uh we have with them are uh  pretty few and far between actually the theyre both going on their own most of the time   umhum   so uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about whats going on in the family and what theyre doing and   umhum   that kind of thing   well we have a uh three year old and a one year old   uhhuh   and uh so we you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know   sure it does   and uh  most of the time with a three year old were trying to to get him uh well we play usually in the evening when when i get home you know about five oclock or so until about eight and you know with exception of dinner out in the front or back yard playing like uh tee ball off the you know off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball uh since we just got here here we got a uh a new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him and he really likes riding that around   uhhuh oh yeah i   so you know im trying to supervise him with that and everything and uh playing squirt guns and all that and he really likes that   yeah   and uh the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything  trying to do everything he does   yeah is the one year old a boy a girl   its a girl yeah   ours is the older ones a girl so and the and the younger ones a boy so um   yeah   i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh i dont know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is but course uh Richardsons in the Dallas area   umhum   and uh i think uh the big city uh activities for for children now are theyre good but theres so much uh potential danger you know that you really have to watch your children so closely now that you you cant let them grow up the way   humum   the way i grew up you know that i im from a smaller town in East Texas  and i could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever i wanted to do uh my whole life uh you know i never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there   hm oh umhum   and uh you know i find that its quite a bit different now that uh you know you have to watch your children so closely and uh keep up with them i i feel like uh that its its really a sad commentary on uh you know on life in general that uh you know that children cant cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without   umhum   really close supervision   well i i agree with that and i seem i seem to feel the same way you know even just when i grew up and everything and and the way it is now your its a lot of supervision is in is in hand and everything uh the only other thing i have noticed though is that uh  it seems that theres been a lot   umhum   of or more emphasis emphasis at least in what weve been dealing with and and uh looking you know just start not even not really looking for a school for him but uh like a preschool or something you know where hed go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something   umhum   for for a three year old its that uh theres a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten   right   and it and it seems like its a lot more they need they need to know and be able to do than when we are then when i had to go into kindergarten kindergarten   yeah   and it seems like its more uh you know i dont know theyre  expecting more or uh or just uh you know kids just because of the computer age or whatever it just know more but when they get to you know to be five or six or something   yeah  um i guess  looking at uh back at at what our children did compared to what uh you know what i had to go through in school   but   the uh there is there does seem to be a lot more  in the curriculum its a lot more complicated a lot more available of course   umhum   but uh there seems seem to be a so much more to learn now that it it really makes it more difficult i would think i would i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself uh you know i just or at least itd be a lot harder than it was when i went to school   uhhuh umhum one thing is i got a home computer too and uh  i play uh with the three year old i play some computer games and stuff with him educational games like you know concentration type game  matching things like that  and uh hes he really likes it and and uh   uhhuh right yeah   and i think its important because i think that uh you know it gives him the interaction with the computer because it sure looks like thats gonna be your you know the big thing for a long time   hm yeah i think uh   and given given that knowledge and stuff with it and he seems to enjoy it   oh   and uh of course the one year old hasnt hasnt gotten there yet but uh and the other thing we try to do is uh since the summers times here is uh sign him up for and her for uh different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming you know uh or soccer theres a little soccer thing that hes gonna do for a week or so and uh you know where they go for an hour or so   right yeah yeah   and uh because uh when he was a baby that we did the swimming too and he really liked it so were gonna do that with our daughter too   yeah that uh uh watching the little little boys play soccer is uh is more fun  i cant imagine that them having as much fun as the parents had watching them     i know well we were just talking about that too and i guess its not really soccer its just kind of a well kick the ball around for a while  and see what happens   right yeah  disorganized disorganized disorganized play thats uh really really what it was but     yeah   but uh yeah when ours was a he i guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer and uh and it was it was more fun to watch those boys trying to trying to kick the ball up and down the field   umhum umhum   but uh and it i guess that was uh you know it was important uh  as much important to the parents as it was to the children that uh you know to get out and watch the kids play so   umhum   i guess one of the things that i think about is a you talking about education uh i kind of feel like uh that uh the the school systems in uh particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control the the students have a little too much uh too much leeway  excuse me   umhum   um and and and and thats kind of contradictory to what i said but you know you the have you have to be under control so much when theyre out but when theyre in school they they dont have quite quite as much control over them as uh   right right   as what i would like to have seen uh uh uh i kind of feel like theres theres too much allowed to go on in at at school   right umhum   and uh you know it tends to uh to encourage students to not be as  you know to not concentrate as much on education you know theyre theyre there for a good time and you know to to see how little they can get by with   umhum right umhum well i know a number of people that are in the in the uh school district and down in in uh San Antonio   uh   and uh it seems like its a lot of the problem is to you know you always have the lack of funds but it seems to be getting worse and worse and so they dont have the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as as as kids need   right   and uh you know thats just a problem that who knows how thats gonna thats gonna come out or anything   but uh yeah   but   but uh i i i dont know i think uh you know some of the thing has to do with uh with the civil rights program not that the civil rights programs bad but that theres it carried over into you know individual rights and it you know trickled out   uhhuh
