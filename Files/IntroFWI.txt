                      The Islands and the People        Theyre French indisputably spiced with an intriguing        Caribbean flavor These perpetually sunny islands are also very        beautiful in the best tropical manner a riot of flowers tangled green        forests mountain waterfalls dramatic rocky headlands beaches of        white tan or black volcanic sand And the sunsets are        breathtaking        Each of the islands has an Atlantic and a Caribbean shore        with the waters hues spanning a minispectrum from pale green to        midnight blue In the sparkling unpolluted sea fishing techniques        havent changed much since Columbus claimed these remote outposts for        Spain almost  years ago        Ashore fields of sugarcane and banana plantations drape        steep hills and rolling plains Volcanoes hummingbirds mangroves        mongooses and palm trees complete the picture The heat is yearround        average  C F but so are the trade winds that temper it         Our little corner in the Caribbean crows the publicity        from Paris Actually the French West Indies FWI or Antilles        Franaises as theyre called in France are not at all a neat        geographical cluster The few dozen islands and rocks are widely        scattered along the great curving chain of the Lesser Antilles        Guadeloupe and Martinique much the largest of the islands        and about  km  miles apart are becoming internationally known        resorts To the north little SaintBarthlemy and the French side of        SaintMartin the other side is Dutch have as much charmwithout the        bustle Though some  km  miles away theyre dependencies of        Guadeloupe So are the tiny eastern and southern satellites of La        Dsirade MarieGalante and Les Saintes        All of the islands are now officially and proudly part of        France not colonies as they were for some three centuries Martinique        and Guadeloupe formal dpartements since  have recently become        rgions in an administrative reshuffle Each has a prfet named in        Paris and sends three deputies and two senators more than  km         miles to sit in the national legislature To New York about         km  miles away they send back streams of contented        tourists        French Antilles citizens enjoy the same state benefits as        all French citizens drink the same famous wines and eat the same        cheeses and pats on baguettes just as crustily delicious as those        turned out by every bakery in the mtropole And yet despite the        flocks of familiar French automobiles with yellow headlights the        francs and centimes the gendarmes cafs and justlikeParis little        shops youll sense immediately that this is not nor could it ever be        metropolitan France        The atmosphere is richer more exotic Africans Asians        Indians and whites of various origins have become absorbed and        transformed into the fascinating culture known as Creole By world        standards this racially varied society is a model of harmony        What will strike you first is the marvelous range of subtly        different skin tones and facial features The famous FWI women        inevitably wearing bright earrings and flashing colors manage to be        both graceful and sensuous as they walk This is true even when they        glide along country roads with large bundles balanced on their heads        Little girls learn this surefire postureimprover very early in        life        In these already overpopulated islands where Roman        Catholicism is the predominant religion the government provides an        initial lump sum for each birth and a monthly support grant allocation        familiale for each child Because of the male exodus to France and        elsewhere in search of jobs women continue to outnumber men More than        half of  native islanders are children and the mother is        traditionally responsible for bringing them up handling the money and        making key domestic decisions        Everyone agrees theres a special magic to the Creole soul        Smiling readily but somewhat shy about making the first approach the        islanders will often overwhelm you with kindness once contact is made        Honesty is taken for granted Youll find a simplicity a lack of        complication about many local people yet something too of the        sophistication associated with the French        Away from tourist resorts and shopping areas rarely will        any language be spoken except French and the mystifying Creole patois        which though based on French is almost incomprehensible to anyone not        used to iteven noninitiated Frenchspeakers But people of all ages        will invariably go out of their way to help a foreigner The biggest        marque dattention a tourist can receive is to be invited to a Creole        home        Youll soon notice how easy it is to get a cheerful early        start on these islands Punch the ubiquitous drink of local rum        sugarcane syrup and lime is popular from dawn to dusk And along with        punch gossiping is a favorite pastime in the FWI The women and girls        washing clothes along the river banks are probably doing so if theyre        not singing And its a safe bet that in the openair markets the        salesladies under the big straw hats are gossiping toobetween        transactions involving such prized local items as guavas tamarinds        red pimentos and plantains        While tropical fruits and vegetables abound along with a        satisfying variety of fresh fish much food in the FWI is imported        primarily from France Nowhere else in the Caribbean can you eat as        imaginatively or as well Traditional French dishes are as highly        esteemed as the spicy specialties of Creole cuisine        As on most tropical islands the pace of life tends to be        lazy During the hottest hours things come to a virtual standstill        though the Caribbean siesta is an hour or two shorter than its        Mediterranean counterpart It would be folly for a visitor to expect        Americanstyle efficiency or speedy service it would be wisest to slip        into the casual drift of things West Indian Whether eating touring        or shopping taking your time will always be rewarding        But when the sun goes down and the music starts up theres        nothing lazy about the dancing This is where the biguine began and        still belongs along with all manner of other Caribbean rhythms just as        popular and even more frenzied They say that if you can understand        their dancing youll have begun to understand the Creole soul Its        certainly worth trying        Not fully discovered and certainly unspoiled the FWI are        relative newcomers on the world tourist scene Though their economic        wellbeing is about the most precarious of any part of France these        basically agricultural islands can and do provide the scenery the sun        the sea and the sand in sufficient quantity to attract rapidly growing        numbers of vacationers looking for fun relaxation and something        different
