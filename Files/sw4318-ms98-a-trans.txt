        before the one will take um       okay lets see i guess um i can start im actually were actually trying to find one now because our familys growing yeah   are you really   um so im looking at um something larger than what we have weve got like an eighty four Charger thats about gone and a uh an eighty nine Horizon   uhhuh which are both kind of small   so im looking for something a little bigger yeah um so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh were looking at uh some just some four door five passenger sedans as well   uhhuh are you looking for an American car or you you open to buying foreign cars   um i dont really have a preference either way i guess it you know its   uhhuh   you know  i guess the American cars had a bad reputation but i havent had any real substantial problems with the ones ive had   uhhuh right personally i have a Japanese car right now and i really like it a lot uh i think the Japanese really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh   umhum   you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now but i feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh   yeah   i would be partial to buying another Japanese car but i would also look at American cars but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product so if i were   yeah i mean even even if its just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh theres a door seal that  doesnt quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and and its clearly just a a design problem there   right right it is um im kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be sort of a sports car i would really like to have a sports car um  i dont really i dont have a family so i dont need a a minivan or such to uh  haul people around in   umhum   so im looking for more a a two passenger car that uh   oh like a Miata or something like that   well i like the Miata but i dont like it enough to buy it i would buy something actually the the car that i really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car but uh   um   something along that lines uh because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i id like to move on to something a little better   interesting yeah thats interesting yeah i guess probably the factors wed use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably   right right thats when i bought the car that i bought i was looking for mileage and i was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was get that i would get a   uhhuh   for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money   yeah yeah i can i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that   so right exactly   and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you   yeah   what you pay initially but you know ive got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger actually it was my wifes car that she brought into the marriage   um thats right uhhuh   and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton   uhhuh   its you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but   uhhuh   um the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it so   okay   but uh   uh ive had uh ive had one or two American cars i think and and they were okay i had a Pontiac once and and i never had a problem with it but uh my mother had a Dodge at one point and i i had driven it a few times and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a Dodge  just just from well actually i had a uh   um   a Dodge Omni at one point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality uh   umhum   car   yeah   so i guess youd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car   thats interesting but yeah it its hard to beat some of the uh like i guess were in particular were looking at a like a ninety one Corsica thats uh buy back at a they say GM sponsored auction but i think theyre obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to GM   umhum   after you know its after theyve used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you   right   which is a good deal   yeah because uh i guess um i mean well ninety twos granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for   umhum right   on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and guess the dealer comes out okay you know i dont know what kind of i dont know what GM corporate kind of hit the i dont know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybodys had their chance to make their money off of it   yeah that yeah im sure they did   so but uh i dont know we keep looking at that minivan its just you know we can get a like a Caravan for right twelve five but thats a little more than we want to spend right now   uhhuh right   but uh uh its interesting but uh i dont know if if uh it it seems to be
