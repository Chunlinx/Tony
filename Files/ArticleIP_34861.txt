 Dear Elect            If Prudie were paranoidshe would think some of her readers were trying to get her out of the advicebusiness what with one fellow  wanting Prudie to run for president andnow you suggesting Congress Prudie however is not paranoid so she thanksyou for the  well vote of confidence As for the  why dont you startPrudiePac and see if you cant straighten out the dolts in Washington            Prudie politically                                             DearPrudie                                                      Two of my friendshave begun taking antidepressants One for depression I guess the other toquit smoking Because they are on antidepressants now they think EVERYONEneeds them and have literally been making appointments for their wholefamilies Both have told me I definitely need them I have a professionaltherapist with whom I discussed this and she disagrees My therapist is notagainst medication and in fact recommends it for some patients When Iexplained this to these two ladies they both shook their headslike they knowbetter than my therapist One came right out and shouted that I was in denialWouldnt it be nice if people restricted their opinions to those areas in whichthey had professional expertise What do you think                                       Christine Rochester NY                        Dear Chris            The last time Prudiechecked girlfriends could not prescribe drugs It is a rule of human naturethat people often when they add or subtract something from their lives thinkeveryone else should do the same Tune out the suggestions of these amateurshrinks You are right that it would be nice if people only spoke of thingsabout which they were expert It would also be nice if every female over theage of  had a  gift certificate at Tiffanys Alas my dear neitherone is likely to come to pass            Prudie realistically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Do we as a societyneed a refresher course on what things to say or not to say to a pregnantwoman My best friend is  weeks pregnant with her second child She has beengetting comments about how large she is for the past three months Worse thaneven the comments one woman just stood in front of my friend and gapedsaying Oh my God Why would people feel the need to point out a pregnantwomans size And is there an appropriate response to these people that wouldremind them their comments are not appreciated                                       Sincerely                                       Annoyed in Omaha Neb                        Dear Ann            As for why people sayinappropriate things it usually has to do with the connector cable betweenbrain and mouth being on the fritz These rude and unappreciated remarks justslip out the verbal equivalent of being a klutz The way Prudie knows this isthat she herself has made this mistake a time or two  well maybe three orfour If your friend with the belly spanning two ZIP codes wants to have acomeback she might try looking down then remarking Pretty good huh AndIm only two months along Prudie promises you the thoughtless person willhave nothing more to say            Prudie pointedly                                             Prudie                                                      My girlfriend is astaunch supporter of Patrick Buchanan for prez I feel Buchanan is way tooliberal for my taste I have been a big Pat Robertson fan for years Thegirlfriend also listens to Rush Limbaugh but I know that Rush has been arunning dog lackey of the liberal Republican news media for years A typicalliberal country club Republican I was going to support Sen Bob Smith of NewHampshire in his new Conservative Taxpayers Party but now that hes withdrawnthere seems to be no one true to the Reagan legacy The question is should Idump the girlfriend                                       Redmond Wash                        Dear Red            Youre kidding rightThe part about Buchanan being too liberal supplied the hint And Redmond ishome base for                   Slate                so Prudie will offer a choice of answersallowing for all contingencies  If the political chasm is legitimate and aswide as you describe yes undo from the girlfriend If you guys have suchdifferent outlooks now  future differences have the potential for majorfireworks  If you are a fellow Microsoftie pulling Prudies leg to kill timebefore a Jolt Colabreak why dont you get back to work hmmm
