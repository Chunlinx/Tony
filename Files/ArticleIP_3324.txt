                                 Locus Politicus                           A campaign junkie ratesthe sites                        By Matthew Cooper                            words postedTuesday July  to be composted Tuesday July                         Ive seen the future andits hurting my back Im in the basement on a July night my body contortedmy laptop balanced on my knee Im watching MSNBC and using my computer Thisis how they hyped this new network and yet I wonder Surely Bill Gates didnot want me going to a chiropractor My eyes flicker between screens close andfar making me wonder whether Ill need bifocals More annoying my mind whipsbetween the laidback haveabeer feeling of watching TV and at least forthis novice anyway the intensity of operating a computer Its time to getconnected they say in the ads for MSNBC Yet the only interactivity open tome is to write a question to the president who is being interviewed by TomBrokaw I cant do this though because I didnt submit an Ask the Presidentquestion at an appropriate time Besides some  questions came Clintonsway so I wasnt really going to get in on the action There are glitchesEvery time my browser goes to the page it hits some sound file that belts outBrokaws booming baritone This is Tom Brokaw  I cant make it stop            The Web is supposed to bemanna for me a news hound who devours newspapers who watches CSPAN onvacation and who occasionally tries to fall asleep by counting senatorsinstead of sheep Straining to remember Idahos backbenchers Larry Craig andDirk Kempthorne usually does the trick But the Web is not succor It isoften technically frustrating as was evinced by my wrestling with Brokaw andClinton            Yet there are things Ivecome to love about the Web in the couple of months since I got on it For methe best thing about political Web sitesand by that I mean stuff put up byeverybody from major media outlets to candidatesis that they can get me whereI would have gone anyway only much more quickly As a journalist often on theroad I can now get the Washington Post or the Washington Times  two indispensable papers for newsjunkies Both sites like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are welldesigned and ready the night beforethe paper appears the better to find out what my competitors have that Idont When Henry Cisneros the secretary of Housing and Urban Developmentcame to my magazine the other day for an editorial lunch I was able to prep upquickly at his Web site            Unfortunately much of what is on the Web is diatribe or propaganda foamingwith hate or boosterism irrelevant either way Theres this explosion ofinformation and much of it is crap says Michael Riley executive producer ofAllPolitics thesite maintained by CNN and Time  This makes sites like Rileysespecially valuable because they become basically reliable brand names in asea of muck Along with its counterpart PoliticsNowa joint venture of several news organizationsincluding the National Journal the Washington Post  and theLos Angeles Times AllPolitics remains a place where you can get lots ofpolitical news and know that its quality journalism as opposed to some guyblowing steam Like Time andNewsweek eachsite revels in the narcissism of small differences PoliticsNow fancies itselfmore insiderish and indeed some of its features like a regular columncalled TheBuzz are meant for true aficionados Over at AllPolitics they pridethemselves on being more beyondtheBeltway In fact the chat rooms filledwith regular folk are the most popular parts of AllPolitics They do morebusiness than any bulletin boards onPathfinder says Riley including the sex boards which gives mepause Both sites are good bets            Icant say the same for sites maintained by candidatesWhen the ClintonGorecampaign opened their Web site earlier this summer they treated it like amajor event even bringing the vice president over to headquarters to tout thesite The mouse proves the elephant wrong Gore said sounding likeConfucius The veep meant of course that computers will allow Team Clinton torespond quickly to Republican attacks Bob Doles siteis equally turbocharged And while most candidateWeb sites are rich in position papers and press releases and sound clips andapplets theyre the cyberequivalent of a table set up at a campaign rallywhere you can pick up brochures They are too biased to help you think clearlyabout which candidate is better Perhaps this will change For the momentthough campaigns reach most voters through TV not the Web The Net remainsmore a gimmick a way to signal to voters that Sen Blahblah is a man of thefuture            By contrast I get avisceral thrill surfing over to various political organizations A home pagemay be a groups face to the world but opening it still feels like getting toeavesdrop on a conversation Visit the NRA site and read all about Second Amendment rights described inthe hysterical theliberalsarecoming tone that you would expect from andwhich is echoed throughout libertarianminded sites on the Web Theres alsoan odd universal cheeriness to political Web sites many of which I was guidedto by MSNBCs terrific Internet correspondentMary KathleenFlynn Be sure to visit theSinn Fein Website says a line in the Captive Voicemagazine written by IRA political prisoners Its hard to imagineMartin Luther King writing the Letter from the Birmingham Jail With HotlinksThere is a strange moral equivalence to the sites too Each one pops up andmakes its claim regardless of any relation to the truth One can call up theSerb Action Website and find out how to order books like The Eradication of Serbs  This may come as news to the Muslim citizens of Sarajevo andSrebrenica Less slick is the home page of the BosniaHerzegovinaembassyin Washington DC There is an incongruous pride in technicalprowess Go to an Islamic site and it has that funky icon boasting of being in thetop  percent of all Web sites How shall I visit Mecca I wonder WithNetscape or Internet Explorer            The one thing thatpolitical sites cant replicate is the smell of politics the feeling of beingat a campaign Earlier this year I was at a Bob Dole rally in Omaha I lovedeverything about it talking to the folks who schlepped there on a Sundaymorning the comic effect of having a guy dressed like McGruff the Crime Dogfrom public service ads standing behind Dole I loved leafleting when I was incollege handing out flyers to passersby Not everyone of course can get toa rally But there are political meetings and activities in every neighborhoodTheres plenty of reason to be out on a July night instead of sitting in thebasement
