career But the person who has capitalized most on the legacy isKings younger son yearold Dexter King            Dexter emerged as the Kingfamily spokesman in early  when he succeeded Coretta as president and CEOof the King Center He inaugurated his tenure with a call to arms My fatherdelivered political freedom and I would like to deliver economic freedom Im calling home all those freedom fighters who marched with my father DexterScott King is going to be there with you this time and we will make it to thepromised land            The promised land as itturned out looks like Graceland One of Dexters first acts as president wasto meet the caretakers of Elvis image to learn how to market King like theKing He hasnt let up since In the last four months alone the King familyhas            signed a contract withOliver Stone who plans a movie about the assassination just imagine the scenewhere J Edgar Hoover dolled up in tutu and lip gloss orders the Kinghit            made a gigantic deal withTime Warner to market Kings speeches and writings and            sued CBSalleging that the network had violated copyright laws by excerpting the I Havea Dream speech in a documentary            In February the family also made headlines by announcingthat it supported James Earl Rays motion for a trial Ray who pleaded guiltyto Kings assassination without trial is dying of liver disease He claims hewas a patsy King family members hint at a grand and sinister conspiracy            Dexter itseems has revived the dream Not that dream but the American dreamthat anyone can make a fortune In the s version all it takes is a catalogof marketable data vigorous application of copyright law the financial muscleof a multinational media conglomerate a few good lawyers and frequenttalkshow appearances            Talking with Dexter King is a disconcertingdemoralizing experience Disconcerting because his voice has the sameintonation the same accent the same creamy richness as his fathersDemoralizing because his message is so distant from his fathers Martin spokethe language of protest sacrifice spirituality Beneath Dexters stentoriantones and rhythmic tide one hears only managementese It makes logicalsense to align ourselves with a major player in the industry  We aremoving from the hardware side of the business to the software side  Hisvision he assures me is holistic            WhenDexter took over the King Center the Atlantabased nonprofit needed helpCoretta was a reliable liberal mascot but she foundered as an executive Thecenter had become a hodgepodge of unconnected programsa daycare center alibrary a nonviolence training school It alienated sponsors and neighbors andovershot its budget amassing a  annual deficit by the early s Theprogrammatic impact of the King Center across the last decade has beensomewhere between small and nonexistent says David Garrow who won thePulitzer Prize for his King biography Bearing the Cross             Dexter who had spent most of his professional career as amusic producer and promoter was the one who realized that the family wassitting on a valuable asset the collected works of Martin Luther King JrThese

    The familyhas also tightened its grip on Kings work Besides the CBS suit it won plus legal fees from USA Today after the newspaper reprinted the I Havea Dream speech without permission The Kings demand stiff payments fromauthors and TV producers who want to republish or air Kings speeches            Not surprisingly many King fans see somethinggrotesque in milking Kings immortal words for cash Both Garrow and fellowKing biographer Taylor Branch have criticized the family for its tightfistedcontrol of Kings papers Civilrights leader Julian Bond who reprinted threeKing speeches in a textbook has denounced the exorbitant rates charged by theKing estate Bond estimated that the King fees alone added between  and to the price of his book It is a travesty in the King legacy Did Jesusbelong to Mary asks the Rev Hosea Williams a Martin Luther King Jrlieutenant            Dexterdoes have copyright law on his side a point that he makes with numbingregularity It has always been our legal right to control Kings works hesays America may claim King as its civic saint and I Have a Dream as anational manifesto but Kings words belong to his estate In fact the wordsare the familys only inheritance since King left no material legacy Dexteralso scoffs at the notion that King would be appalled Martin Luther King Jrhimself copyrighted the I Have a Dream speech two days after he delivered itand he sued a record company to enforce the copyright Not that Kingpre was always so scrupulous about copyright He did after all commitplagiarism when writing his dissertation            Dexter also preaches freemarket moralism Marketing MLK isnot merely good businessits good period The real purpose of the ventureshe says is to revive his fathers image to spread Kingian thought in themost effective way possible Publicizing King will make him live His mediawas marching We are substituting the means of todayCDROMs the Internetbooksto get the message out  Our intentions were not for profit Theprofit happens to be a byproduct of doing the right thing            Time Warner after all canreach the entire world A small university press cant The end result of whatDexter is doing now will be to make Kings ideas far more publicly accessiblethan they ever have been before says Stanford University Professor ClayborneCarson who is editing Kings papers for the King Center            Its anargument that would go down easier if Dexter were promoting anythingbesides commercial enterprises After all the King Center haseliminated or in Dexters words divested the centers socialwelfare andeducational programs and Dexter rarely takes public positions on subjects thatdont concern the King familys bottom line            Which brings us to James Earl Ray one casewhere Dexter has taken a position on a public issue In February Dexter andCoretta testified at a Tennessee hearing in favor of Rays request for a trialRay has requested and been denied a trial seven times and the King familyhas never backed his petitions before But this time is different says Dexterbecause Ray is dying and because the Ray family has asked the Kings to speakout More cynical observers say this time is different because of the Kingsdeal with Oliver Stone Dexter says the family has always doubted that Ray wasthe killer and he cites compelling new evidence of Rays innocence collectedby Ray attorney William Pepper Biographer Garrow himself a student of theassassination calls Peppers evidence complete utter hilarious bullshit The fact that Dexter and Mrs King take Pepper seriously is sad            The Tennessee judge ruledfor Ray calling for ballistics tests to determine if a gun with Raysfingerprint fired the lethal bullet But this decision is a long long way froma trial If an appeals court sustains the ruling which is consideredunlikely and if subsequent ballistics tests indicate that the gun did notfire the deadly bullet then there could be a new trial            Not that the delay hasdeterred Dexter Hes planning to visit Ray in prison this week And hestaking his case to the publicthe King book and audiotape andmovieticketbuying public He did Nightline  He did Johnnie Cochransshow He did Jesse Jacksons show He did Montel  Thats what a Kingdoes in the s
