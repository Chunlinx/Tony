                                  The Equality Equation            After all these years I amstill amazed at the persistence of people in believing things that are unprovedor that are more complicated than they realize My most recent example is PayEquity Day called to protest the fact that womens pay is only  percent ofmens Pay Equity Day was April  Perhaps you missed it            Why make pay equity thesubject of a protest Surely Pay Equity Days organizers dont think thateveryone should get the same pay Id guess that my housekeepers pay is lessthan  percent of the pay of the organizers Why dont they protest that factPresumably they would explain that they are more productive than myhousekeeper But the only evidence they have of their superior productivity isthe fact that someone is willing to pay them more than anyone is willing to paymy housekeeper            One might think that would be the end of the matter Menget paid more than women because someone is willing to pay them more just asPay Equity Days organizers are paid more than my housekeeper because someoneis willing to do it            But of course thatisnt the end of the matter If we accept productivity as a proper measure ofwhat people should earn we have to consider the possibility that employerswillingness to pay is a wrong measure of workers productivity It could bewrong in either of two senses Employers may have an incorrect estimate of therelative productivities of men and women Or having a correct estimate of therelative productivities they may want to pay women less than theirproductivity merits because they have some prejudice against women in theworkplace            In a perfect world we could compare the relative earningsof women and men with their relative productivity But there is no good way tomeasure relative productivityat least no better way than looking at relativeearnings which only leads us back to where we started So students of thesubject approach it indirectly comparing the earnings of men and women who aresimilar in the respects that contribute to productivity They compare theincomes of men and women of the same age the same years of work experiencethe same years of education and in jobs of the same stress riskiness anddifficulty When they do they generally find that the gender gap in earningsremains but is smaller than the gap for women and men in total But the resultsare difficult to interpret The number of years devoted to education and thenumber of years of experience for example do not make the same contributionto productivity And it is never possible to be sure that you have takenaccount of all the factors that determine productivity            Suppose you compared the earnings of men and womenwho are yearold lawyers all childless and all Law Review graduatesof Harvard Law School and found that the mens earnings are higher than thewomens Im making this up Would this mean that there is discriminationagainst women We would also find that all the women in this category do notearn the same salary There is something some X Factor other than theconditions I have listed and other than gender which explains the differencein salaries among the women But if this X Factor is unequally shared by menand women there will be a difference in the average earnings of men and womenthat does not reflect discrimination            Maybe the X Factor isheight A taller lawyer can reach the books on the top shelf without a ladderIf all women were paid the same as all men of the same height the average payof men would be higher than that of women because the average man is tallerBut there would be no discrimination            Much of what we know about the economic status of women issummarized in an excellent monograph by Diana FurchtgottRoth and ChristineStolba Womens Figures The Economic Progress of Women in America  Onestriking fact presented there is that childless women at age  earn  percentas much as men at the same age whereas mothers earn only  percent as much asmen This suggests that the relatively low earnings of many women are relatedto their relatively low productivity because childbearing and childrearinginterferes with their productivity in the marketplace But another force may beat work Women who can command earnings that are  percent as high as those ofmen may decide not to have children rather than forgo those earnings We dontknow how the earnings of these women compare with their productivity If theirproductivity is  percent higher than that of men the fact that they are paidonly  percent less would not show that there is little discrimination            There are three gaps involved in thisdiscussion             The gap between the earnings of men andwomen             The gap between the earnings of women and theirproductivity             The gap between theproductivity of women and the productivity of men            There is plenty of evidence that the first gap has beendecliningfairly rapidly by historical standards There is no good way tomeasure the gap between womens earnings and their productivity but it isreasonable to say that their earnings have risen pretty much in line with theirproductivity At least it seems clear that the earnings of the total laborforce have risen pretty much in line with productivity output per hour ofwork when measured correctly Women are so large a part of the labor forcethat it is hard to believe that this could be true of the total if it were notalso true of women If the gap between the earnings of women and men isdeclining and if the earnings of women are rising in line with theirproductivity it follows that the productivity of women has been risingrelative to the productivity of men That would be consistent with what we knowabout changes in the character of womens education and their distributionamong occupations            Whether this combination of facts and speculationis grounds for demonstrations of protest is a matter of taste            I think there is a problem lurking here but it isnot the one the protesters have been protesting In an earlier age whenincomes in the market were lower than they are now the cost to a parent offorgoing market employment in order to stay home and care for a child was alsolower than today And when the menwomen wage gap was lower the clear choicewas for the woman to stay home and look after the child But given highermarket incomes having and rearing a child is more expensive in terms offorgone income And with the menwomen wage gap narrowed it has become lessclear how the staying home with the child should be divided between the motherand the father This problem of family life is not a result of incomes beingtoo low or the wage gap being too big It is rather the reverse
