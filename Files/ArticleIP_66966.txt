                                 Vouching Toward Gore            Towardthe end of Fridays Nightline debate after Al Gore had called BillBradleys healthcare proposal a voucher plan for the third time Bradleyfinally woke up and smelled the danger Theyre not vouchers Al Bradleyprotested It is not vouchers The healthcare program doesnt have vouchersTwo days later in their debate on Meet the Press  Gore elaboratedThere are  million Americans today who get Medicare and Medicaid They areall left out under Sen Bradleys plan because he eliminates Medicaid andreplaces it with little amonth vouchers Bradley fired back immediatelyThats wrong he insisted Its not a voucher            Thevoucher debate represents the third and decisive stage of the Democraticpresidential contest In the first stage each candidate tried to put his bestissues on the agenda Gore pushed suburban sprawl health care and educationBradley pushed gun control health care and campaign reform Each man got oneof his issues on the agendacampaign reform for Bradley education forGoreplus the issue on whose importance they agreed health care In thesecond stage the candidates fought for the high ground on those three issuesGore won the high ground on education by proposing a  billion school aidpackage while portraying Bradley as a voucher sympathizer Bradley won the highground on campaign reform by offering a comprehensive reform plan while teamingup with John McCain against a fundraising system whose corruption McCainhelpfully traced to the ClintonGore White House            Thethird stage is the battle over the remaining issue health care Each candidateis trying to marshal his assets on this battleground by building a thematicbridge to it from the issue he is already winning Bradley is trying to carryhis message of comprehensive reform from campaign finance to health care Heproposes to replace Medicaid with subsidies that would make health insuranceaffordable to more people but would require those with sufficient incomes topay part of their premiums out of their own pockets            Goremeanwhile is trying to carry his message of public responsibility fromeducation to health care He wants to convince Democrats that Bradley bysubstituting partial subsidies for guaranteed benefits would gut the publichealthcare system as well as the public education system If Gore succeeds inlinking the two issues this way Bradley will lose the healthcare debate andwith it the nomination Thats why Gore has distilled this linkage to a singlewordvouchersand why Bradley is fighting to extinguish that word with suchfury            In thecontext of education Gore has defined the word voucher in two negative waysFirst vouchers are a zerosum game As Gore sees it every penny spent on themcomes out of funds previously allocated to a fully subsidized programExperience shows theres a set amount of money that communities have beenwilling to spend on education Gore argued on Meet the Press  If youdrain the money away from the public schools for private vouchers then thathurts the public schools Second vouchers dont cover the cost of the programthey replace The flaw with the voucher theory said Gore is that the vastmajority of those who receive a tiny little down payment on the tuition cannotafford the rest of it            Havingpacked these two poisonous assumptions into the word voucher Gore is nowinjecting that poison into Bradleys healthcare proposal by applying the sameword to both contexts Every single time vouchers came up in the Senate Billfor  years you voted for them Now youre proposing vouchers in place ofMedicaid capped at  a month Gore charged on Nightline  Youcanceled Medicaid and give people  vouchers to try to replace it  If wecancel Medicaid and substitute little vouchers capped at  dollars a monththeres not a single plan available here in New Hampshire that you can get foranything approximating the cap in this plan On Meet the Press  Goresaid Bradley expects recipients of health insurance subsidies to buy into thefederal employee benefit plan Ninetyfive percent of all the health insuranceplans that are part of that plan have premiums that are far in excess of a month            Thevoucher attack has at least made Gores ideological position coherent Formonths Gore vacillated between calling Bradley a liberal budgetbuster andcalling him a cryptoReaganite menace to federal entitlements Now thatquestion is settled Gore will attack Bradley from the left Gore will defendMedicaid the public schools and other governmentguaranteed programs He willaccuse Bradley of threatening to replace these programs with risky andinadequate voucher schemes And he will direct this argument to specificDemocratic constituencies such as senior citizens blacks gays and laborunions            Whatsnot yet clear is whether Bradley will accept this arrangement On Meet thePress  he challenged Gores leftist dogma against school vouchers Ifvoucher experiments demonstrated that the quality of public education wasimproved does that mean that you would not even consider vouchers Then hescoffed that Al proposes an education program that comes from WashingtonYet Bradley refused to cede the left to Gore Rather than defend the idea ofsubstituting vouchers for government control of schools Bradley insisted thatthe two options are compatible Every time I voted for vouchers I voted forit as an experimental basis said Bradley And I also said that I would nottake any public money that was set aside for schools This would be newmoney            Similarly Bradley refuses to defend the mildly libertarian position Gore hasassigned him on health care Bradley could affirm that his subsidies for healthinsurance dont cover the entire cost of premiums He could argue thatindividuals ought to bear responsibility for paying a portion of theirpremiums Or he could simply argue that the amount of money the governmenttakes from taxpayers to subsidize health care should be limited He could inshort embrace and defend the idea of vouchers            Instead Bradley repudiates the word On Meet the Press  he insistedthat the  he allots to each persons monthly insurance premium is not acap Its a weighted average In a Memo to National Reporters after thedebate Bradleys campaign drove home the point THE BRADLEY PLAN IS SUPPORTFOR HEALTH INSURANCE NOT VOUCHERS  Calling the  a cost estimate thememo provided dictionary definitions of subsidy and voucher indicatingthat vouchers are explicitly finite whereas subsidies are not The implicationof these caveats is that if universal health insurance turns out to cost evenmore than the  billion a year Bradley has allotted to it the governmentwill tax and spend more to cover the difference            Listening to Bradleys equivocal remarks on school vouchers and looking at thesliding scale of subsidies and tax breaks he proposes for health insurance youget the feeling hes rather sympathetic toward solutions that take account ofmarket dynamics You get the feeling that this sympathy is what hes hidingbehind noncomittal words such as cost estimates and weighted averages Youwonder whether he could win a general election coming out of the right lane ofthe Democratic Party But first he has to get the Democratic nomination a racehe has clearly decided he cant win in that lane            In a way its Bradleysfault On firearms and campaign finance he defined reform as governmentcontrol He thought he could pass Gore on the left Instead Gore cut himoffand now Bradley cant connect his campaignfinance crusade under therubric of reform to his challenges to existing welfarestate policies onhealth and education Every time Gore utters the word vouchers hes bumpingBradley closer to the right edge of the road Its going to be a short race ifBradley wont bump back
