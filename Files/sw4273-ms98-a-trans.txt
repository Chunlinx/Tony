              yeah well i i can tell you heres an interesting interesting story uh my wife uh when we first had our kids decided to home school our kids     uhhuh it would is isnt that against well in in is that is is that within the law in Virginia   and yeah its its interestingly uh therere a couple of different categories categories of home school uh children uh a lot of people take religious exemptions   umhum   and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebodys somebodys trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and   yeah   and you know so they dont want their kid to go to school to find out that you know the kid really comes out of the cabbage patch   right   but uh  but in our case uh we actually did it uh we took uh educational you know whatever   right   uh because we both had advanced degrees and so we just said uh hey look you know we have enough education to to school our kids and the idea was when we first started was to just do elementary school uh level instead of the public schools and do that at at home uh eight six uh eight seven and four   umhum how old are your kids okay   uh so pretty young kids and so anyway my wife did all of this all of this schooling and uh you know she had curricula that she bought that they actually sell which we never knew of um   umhum   you know it was really complete i mean uh it matched up pretty well with with uh actually matched i thought was better than a lot of the public school curricula but anyway you know you could if you were really religious of course you could get all uh sort of a religious stuff with all the the creation and stuff slant on it   right   but uh theres actually a lot of uh to us anyway theres a lot of other good stuff out there too so we got a couple actually bought a couple of these programs and for grades you know one through six   so like prefab school   yeah exactly exactly   uhhuh   and uh so you know went through it and uh anyway my my wife got to the third grade point with my with my daughter   the four year old   and the oldest one the eight year old   oh uhhuh   got to the third grade point and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and uh also it was a tremendous amount of work   yeah   sure i i imagine it it it it it really was because see you had to do run at least three curricula three separate curricula in parallel and uhhuh   right exactly now it was easier it was actually easier as the younger ones got older because she could just you know kind of take what she had before just the same the same thing that public school teachers do now i mean the   right   but it it was   how how long did you do this for   uh she did it for three years   three years okay   and and actually the kids did really you know uh if you if you believe the tests that uh the state hands out here you know theyre supposed to test your uh your   umhum oh so so every year your kids had to do like some kind of a test to be sure that okay   yeah right they took a standardized test and uh   uhhuh   they they always did really well uh and they never seemed to have any problem with it   umhum   but i can see in a lot of cases like it it we didnt in a case where youve got people at home where they dont for for you know almost the you know political reasons or whatever they dont want their kids to go to school   yeah   i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters and i mean if their kid didnt do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know     oh you mean you didnt have to take them to like a central location and   oh no no they sent them to you     oh they sent them to oh boy yeah umhum   yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them and everything you know just make it seem like like the real pressure youd be under   uhhuh   but uh you know we heard stories we heard all kinds of stories of people you know its like well if my kid doesnt do well on it ill just write in the answers you know uh   why why why did you decide i mean did did you decide like to to do that home schooling because you didnt think the your local schools were were good enough  or     yes we did that yes that was the reason but we did that out of total ignorance because we never went to the schools to find out what they really were doing   uhhuh oh   it was just sort of it was just sort of uh you know hey we remember what public school was like and it was really crappy my wife actually was shes from the Bronx in New York so you know       she knew that public schools could be pretty bad   yeah did um well what did you think about like you you know you obviously paying taxes for for the for for schools did i mean did   and uh yeah oh actually we didnt really begrudge that you know because i mean its like you know  me i mean its good its good that uh to you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school   right   they they shouldnt make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them alone but but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i dont yeah yeah big deal nah   uh you didnt worry about it what uh eventually you put your kids back in back in to public school how did that   right
