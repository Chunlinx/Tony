                                 Microsoft Monopoly                           Frame Game is anoccasional Slate department based on the premise that who wins inWashington is often determined by how the issue is framed The author neitherendorses nor condemns any of the views expressed however laudatory orrepellent                        On Jan a federal judge will resume hearing the Justice Departments antitrust caseagainst Microsoft DOJ accuses Microsoft of violating a consent decree byleveraging Windows percent share of the computeroperatingsystem market tocorner the browser market with its Internet Explorer Microsoft says itsintegrating IE into Windows DOJ says that the two products are separate andthat Microsoft is illegally forcing computer makers to load their machines withIEfirst by threatening to deny them Windows then by artificially repackagingthe two programs as one Microsoft faces similar charges from competitorsconsumer activist Ralph Nader and possibly several state attorneys generalThe press has turned against Microsoft even comparing it to the tobaccoindustry If Microsoft is so shrewd and powerful why isnt it winning thispublicrelations game Because its overplaying tactics and neglecting strategyon several fronts             Power vs beneficence Is Microsoft too powerfulBill Gates like Bill Clinton answers ideology with economic practicalitytouting the countrys prosperity and taking as much credit as he can Microsoftisnt committing the sins monopolies are supposed to commit Gates arguesWindows is cheap and IE is free Lots of companies are selling software theirproducts are rapidly improving and prices are falling Thanks to hightechcapitalism the economy is booming            Thischange of subject has earned some good press News stories have quoted analystsand consumers vouching for the quality and low price of Microsoft productsMicrosofts Strategy Has Given Users Some Benefits proclaimed a New YorkTimes headline over a laudatory Associated Press story But whereaschanging the subject usually works in politics its not as effective in legalfights The courts proceedings keep the media spotlight on the question ofmonopoly             Big government vs big business Awellknown law of politics says that if the debate is about you youll loseFor that reason Microsoft says the antitrust case is about governmental powerThe company portrays Big Brother as the principal threat not just to Microsoftbut to free enterprise consumer choice and prosperity Gates calls the choicebetween private and government control of software the question at the centerof the case Nathan Myhrvold Microsofts chief technology officer conjures upthe specter of a Federal Bureau of Operating Systems Conservative punditshave flocked to this argument            DOJ antitrust chief JoelKlein offers the standard liberal rejoinder Big business too can threatenconsumer choice and government is the only institution capable of stopping itKlein has repeatedly described Microsoft as the enemy of choice declaringNo consumer should be denied the browser of their choice because Microsoftmade their computer vendor an offer they couldnt refuse            Klein will have a hard timepersuading the public that Microsoft is coercive because the company exertsits marketshare leverage subtly It distributes IE free negotiates withcomputer manufacturers to make IE the default browser on their machines andlinks Windows to software and services it wants to promote These methods allowMicrosoft to argue that computer makers can add other browsers such asNetscapes popular Navigator and that users remain free to switch to them            But LarryLessig the legal scholar enlisted by the court to sort out the case is anexpert on subtle methods by which software providers can steer consumerchoices He has argued that the cyberindustrys hidden tyranny of code can bemore pernicious than the clumsy overreaching state These views bode ill forMicrosoft             Public vs private interest While Microsoftstarted with the ideological advantage of not being the government DOJ startedwith the ethical advantage of not being a private interest Microsoft appearsto have evened the score by persuading the press to link DOJ Nader andantiMicrosoft politicians to the companys competitors When Sen Orrin HatchRUtah held hearings on Microsofts alleged misdeeds newspapers noted thatNovell a rival of Microsoft is a major employer in his state The New YorkTimes observed that at Naders antiMicrosoft conference The panels werefull of Microsoft competitors and lawyers representing them AP reported thatNetscape was using the antitrust case in a marketing campaign            Microsofthas used the image of its competitors political influence to portray its ownlobbying as selfdefense Microsoft spokesmen simultaneously profess reluctance at being forced to stoop to lobbying and  chagrin at having doneso belatedly Newspapers have bought both these spins alternately praisingand criticizing Microsofts virginity but accepting it as a given For                  Slate               s view see Jacob Weisbergs DearMicrosoft             Browser market vs operatingsystemmarket Microsofts critics point out that Windows has  percent of the OSmarket Conversely Microsoft points out that IE has less than  percent ofthe browser market

ability of its dominant competitor to secure an exclusive ForRules views on the case see The Case Against the Case Against Microsoft in                  Slate                But distinguishing between the two markets underminesMicrosofts thesis that IE and Windows are integrated                          Technology vs marketing Microsoft says itslinkage of IE to Windows yields improved features and functionality DOJ saysthe linkage is a marketing ploy not a technical necessity Rule concedes thatsuppliers and consumers will gravitate toward the most widely disseminatedstandard regardless of whether it is technically the best ThereforeMicrosoft owes its success to the good fortune of being the preeminentoperating system on IBM PCs Gates calls the WindowsIE marriage the latestincremental step in Microsofts long history of absorbing separateofferings eg disk compression and networking into Windows            Criticsinterpret this kind of standardization and integration for all their benefitsto consumers as triumphs of marketing not technology On this view Microsoftbuys out potential rivals or starves them to death by stealing theirinnovations and adding them to Windows It doesnt create breakthroughs itabsorbs them The companys recent buyouts of WebTV and Hotmail the leadingpurveyors of TV Internet service and free email exacerbate this complaint IfDOJ persuades the court that WindowsIE integration is just one in a series ofMicrosoft marketing schemes the company could lose an image war bigger thanthe courtroom battle             Platform vs tollbooth Much of thedebate turns on a contest of metaphors Gates calls Windows a stable openintegrated platform that gives software and hardware innovators the certaintythey need to build products The metaphor emphasizes stabilitys virtuesfacilitating openness and innovation over its drawbacks stiflingcompetition By sundering IE from Windows Gates suggests the governmentwould fracture the platform and pull down the whole house of cardsProMicrosoft programmers dramatized this point by staging a press conferenceat Naders forum crediting their livelihoods and the nations small businessdevelopment to the Microsoft

         Gates replies thatWindows PCs enable entrepreneurs and artists to reach audiences over theInternet cutting out the feecharging middlemen who control traditional mediaTo which critics rejoin Why not cut out Microsoft too             Desktop vs network An alliance ofcompetitorsSun Oracle Netscape Novell and IBMis developing machines anda universal programming language Java based on the network an alternativeplatform to the desktop Microsoft wants to make sure that the desktop whereWindows holds sway becomes the platform for the network not the other wayaround Thats why network advocates have accused Microsoft of tinkering withJava to frustrate collaboration between Windowsbased and nonWindowsbasedcomputers Its also why Microsoft is marketing a browser folding it intoWindows and battling the antitrust suit While the Justice Department isclaiming that Windows should not include browsing capabilities Gatesprotests Microsofts competitors are busy incorporating basic operatingsystem services  into their browsers             Danger vs dinosaur Faced with two challengestheantitrust case and the networkparadigm allianceMicrosoft is pitting thelatter against the former If the network paradigm is as mature and superior asproponents claim asks Gates how can the government deem Microsoft anentrenched monopoly In fact Gates argues the networkparadigm assault makesincorporation of a browser critical for Windows to stay competitive Windowsmust eat the browser market or be eaten             Technicalities vs tone Microsoftsargumentativeness has disastrously overshadowed its arguments Its lawyers havesought the removal of Lessig and the judge Theyve derided a government briefas proof that poorly informed lawyers have no vocation for software designWhen instructed by the judge to give computer makers an alternative topackaging IE with Windows Microsoft made the alternatives unworkable orundesirable This conduct has embarrassed the companys supporters andtriggered an avalanche of editorials calling Microsoft rich ruthless sneakypetty arrogant and stubborn            Some reports indicate thatthis tonedeaf performance has already irked the judge and has convinced him toenjoin Microsofts marketing practices on the grounds that the company cant betrusted to regulate itself Even if Microsoft wins the courtroom battle itrisks losing the war for consumers hearts and minds The rap on nerds hasalways been that theyre technically brilliant but socially inept Microsoftsbehavior has done little to prove otherwise
