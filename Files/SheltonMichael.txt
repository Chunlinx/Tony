                     You can just answer them and feel free to respond however you want to OK         What stories or books do you remember reading as a little person         Little boy                     My two favorite books as a child was Curious George and The Jungle Book                     Curious George         That was the little red monkey with the black and white                     Yes                     Did you have that doll                     No         I didnt have the doll I just had the books                     Who told did did is that story your mom read to you or did you like                     My mom started reading it to me when I was small and and I picked it up on my own reading and I enjoyed the illustrations as much as the book                     So you liked the pictures                     Yes                     Were they bright books         Or did they have bright pictures                     They all had yellow covers and they were all paperbacks         And they had just little uh cartoons         Not vivid pictures just                     They werent real bright colors were they         And the whole page wasnt colored                     No         It was just individual pictures of the monkey himself and his immediate surroundings                              The monkey I didnt like Curious George         Thats neat         All right um well what about that book that your mama bought you that time that she told briefly that story         That book that she bought called In One Light                     Thats why I have such fond memories of The Jungle Book         Because she purchased a book for me and my brother and um it was a publishing company that could add your names and your friends names and family names into the into the plot of the story         So you became a character         And it really brought home um events of the book to you because it was personal and it was it was individualistic                     Who were you         Do you remember what character you played                     I was just one of the jungle boys                                                               who went through and had interaction with each of the members of The Jungle Book         There was the snake and the lion and the elephant                     I remember The Jungle Book but do you remember the book Little Black Sambo                     No I dont                     OK         That was a story that I have fond memories of         Who would you consider the best storyteller in your family                     The best storyteller would be my grandfather my mothers father                     Lemmie                     Lemmie         Because he he grew up um one of six children and so that just adds to his storytelling and imagination and his hes always had interaction with people so that just adds to how he interacts with people now                     Do you remember any one particular story that he told         You cant think of a story                     Not um right off                     I know the story he tells about well hes always telling about going to play music and how theyd play when he was young         So can you think of a story                     I can remember a story that really is humorous in a way because he always tells a story about how he used to double date with his future wife and my mother which is his daughter and my dad because unfortunately his wife passed away when when she was really young so                     So Eileen and him double dated with your mom and dad                     Right         He would talk about how he would ask um he would always try to get my dad to end up paying for all four of thems dinner                                                               And how they used to ride around together some         That that to me is just something         Its hard to imagine your your grandparents double dating with your parents but you know that was a unique situation                              So hes always been tight                     Right                     Um how does he tell when he tells those stories like does he usually tell them at family gatherings         How does he do it                     Most of the time its during family gatherings         Hes always got a story to tell regardless if he sees you or if its a family gathering         Hes got you know hes going to be the one thats got the one who is keeping the crowd up or or you know just being himself                              What about you         What do you when we you and I since we are husband and wife when we have kids do you imagine yourself as that kind of person         Like that kind of storyteller         Like Grandpa George and Lemmie         Do you see yourself like that                     Probably I dont know some to a degree         Um hes probably the one person in my family whos like that         The rest of my family is pretty laid back and goes with the flow         So I think Id probably be a little bit of him yet a little bit of everybody else and Im not really one to steal the steal the show at gatherings or what have you                     If you were going to tell a story to your kids about your childhood what story would you tell                     It would probably all be sports related stories um because sports to me has been such a big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of um in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right ones         You may end up being thrown out of a game for something stupid you do                     Well I think maybe you are ah trying to preface some story about getting thrown out of a game                     Well um there have been times when me and my friends have gotten into a little bit of trouble         But wed play our archrivals in a summer league baseball game                     Who was your archrival                     The team from the northern part of our county North Stokes and we were the southern part South Stokes         And uh they had one pitcher in particular who didnt like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after I had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time we kind of decided that we were going take it upon ourselves to hit back         Only not with baseballs but with fists so we charged the mound         Um so you know things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and mature                     So what you going to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with a baseball         Charge the mound                     Ive been there and I know what isnt necessarily the right decision                     What about what is your worst memory not your worst as in bad but just the worst kind of memorable memory you have about playing sports all through your life                     Well the good thing about sports is you can remember one thing that occurs or it or it can be a collection of memories         And a lot what I have are a collection of memories because when you play for  years of your life in sports like I have um really what stands out is just year to year         So many things can happen over the course of a year that or over the course of that many years         nothing stands out in particular it is just bunch of fond         memories                     OK we have a phone call         We have an interruption                     OK sorry about that         Uh back to the sports thing         You were talking about how you just had a collection of memories         Well if you had how do you think you got started in sports         What was your familys connection to you in sports         Like Jeff your brother and Denise and your dad and mom                     Well the funny thing is my parents were both athletic in high school         My dad played baseball in school and my mom was the star basketball player                     Yeah with her hook shot                     With her patented jump hook shot         But when it came to my older brother and older sister neither one of them part participated in sports         And I wasnt um pushed by either one of my parents to play sports         It was just the kind of thing where um in kindergarten or even before kindergarten it just it just came to me that I wanted to play tee ball and from there it started         And after that I asked to put up a hoop in our backyard and luckily I had plenty of of children my age to play with and that used to be the ritual have the neighborhood kids come over to my hoop and wed play basketball and it ended up I was playing with a lot of older kids and so I developed an athletic ability through playing with the neighborhood kids in basketball and just starting so early and continuing on in baseball         So its kind of just evolved         It wasnt something that was you know forced upon me                     So Jeff or Denise neither one you dont have any memories of playing with them in the yard                     I would play with them in the yard but they never played any organized sports         My sister is quite older than I am so she and I as far as playing sports together you know that was few and far between                     She was dating when you were playing sports                     Right         But my brother and I would play basketball in the yard or play baseball and we used to play a lot of kickball in our yard because we had a big yard and a lot of kids so we were always coming up with something                     What about hmm your daddy                     My dad would always play too um he was always just one of the kids         Um because we had you know when I was  or  wed play against kids who were   and my brother was about seven years older and he would come out and play and so it was just kind of natural for my dad to fit in and play along         And uh he was always good too and he was one of the reasons he made me good in what I was doing because he would challenge me         Of course he was about  when I was growing up at  or  years old so he he would challenge me to get better                     Did he let you win                     Sometimes but not usually                     Um whats the best memory you have with your daddy and sports because I know your daddys MS Well                     important to you                     Well they always say that some of the bad things are what stands out and not necessarily a bad thing but it is one of my best memories is ah         Well my dad was diagnosed with cancer right before baseball season my senior year and it didnt keep him from coming to any of the baseball games though         I can remember him just in in the months prior just prior to when he died it was like it took every ounce of energy he had to show up at the baseball games but nothing kept him from showing up         Like I said you dont remember one thing in particular you remember things collectively and I remember that season collectively and him making that effort to show up at the games                     So it meant a lot to you that he did that for you                     Absolutely                     He always videoed all your games too didnt he                     As many as he could         That last year I dont have any of those because he wasnt able to do it but all of my baseball and basketball games prior to that he wanted to videotape them for         It kind of started out in a funny way         It started out as Well if I videotape them and we take them home and watch them you can watch each tape and you can analyze what you need to do to get better         And you can also show those to your coach and you know he can view the team and see what they need to do to get better         But you know it just turned into something that I will always have those collection of tapes such memories         Both hearing his voice on them screaming at the refs or screaming at me cheering and what have you         So its its become something that been unique as a collection of tapes                     You said your daddy played baseball and that was the sport you were best in                     Yeah probably         I mean relative to everybody else I was good in basketball but you know that cant really compare to Jerry Stackhouse or anybody like that                                          When you add six inches to me it makes it a little bit tougher for me to compete                     But you are good at baseball                     Um I was decent I guess                     So is that going to be the sport you push on our kid                     Im probably not going to push any sport on our kid my kid although I have always said when I was in college and right after I gave up my sports career I always said my kid Im going to teach him more and work with him all the time         But as Ive grown older and matured Ive decided Im going to let my kid be who he wants to be                     So if we have a                     Or she                     Or a she exactly         Um well hmm since you know this Im interviewing you and you are my husband         I want you to tell me the fondest story you have of me and you together         Something that we have done                     Well its kind of a of a defiance story probably          One of the stories I remember most         Your dads always been real or kind of protective of you                     Yeah                     Especially when we first started dating and you didnt necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC                                          Your little wrecked  Honda Accord wasnt necessarily the thing you were going to drive two hours away especially two hours to come and see me         But um one of the things I remember was you putting it putting yourself getting in trouble and really probably wasnt one of the wisest things we have ever done         Putting your personal safety on the line when you took off two hours up to my house against your parents knowing         I guess your mom may have known but your dad didnt know                     Yeah I think I told my mom                     And uh and we had a nice dinner and we went out to a movie and                     What movie did we see                     I dont even remember the movie                     I think it was Pelican Brief                     I just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have had         And of course one of the things I remember most was going out to the Farmhouse which was our first official unofficial date                                                   And by our first official unofficial date should I go into that too                     Yeah         You can tell that                     OK         Well we ah I had just broken up with my girlfriend of on and off girlfriend of two and a half to three years and you were supposedly dating a guy in the Navy                                          stationed in San Diego                               kind of a long distance relationship                     And my um fraternity was having a cocktail and I of course needed someone to go with since I didnt have a uh girlfriend at the time         And all my friends said Why dont you ask Kristi         Why dont you ask Kristi         Because we had a bunch of mutual friends in the fraternity and                     Which one pushed you the most                     Morgan Collini                     Hum         Morgy                     And um so we ended up going out but I didnt have any idea that you did have a boyfriend                     But I told them to tell                     Nobody told me         And so I was looking at it as a date whereas she was looking at it as a a night out just to get out and do things         I dont know I dont remember if you ended up telling me at some point during the night if you had a boyfriend um but it really didnt slow me down any                                          I kept hitting on you kept trying to charm you         I guess it got to you a little bit because we ended up eventually                     Eventually         Yeah I told you I had a boyfriend on the couch remember         You listened to the Christmas music too much maybe a little bit too much         Um tell me uh about your Grandpa Willis because I dont know him that much         Tell me something about him                     He was one of the most reserved people you will ever meet and ah he was  when he passed away and he was about  and he never weighed over a hundred thirtyfive pounds                     You take after him                     He grew up as a farmer a tobacco farmer and the thing about it is that he smoked nonfiltered Camels since the time he was  years old and he passed away at the age of  with the cleanest lungs but Im sure it didnt make the rest of his body too healthy         But um but he was just an average hard working rural American         With one child and he loved his one child dearly                     Thats your daddy                     When my dad passed away in  it wasnt long after that he deteriorated         Um pretty much to nothing because he ah he had lost a major part of his life and it really brought him down but he didnt necessarily he wasnt one of the most talkative people         If you talked to him it was like pulling teeth sometimes but he would do anything in the world for you         Um he would always go the extra mile he just didnt do it with words he did it with actions                     Did you ever remember him playing was he a sports guy         Did he play sports with you or anything                     Not really hmm he grew up on a farm and you know playing sports was um and he was so much older that I was he wasnt really in the best of health when I was growing up         Um of course we would go up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and uh he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play but he never really participated because he was  years older you know  years older than I was                     So your grandpa was fairly old when you were born                     Right                     I didnt know that         I didnt know your grandpa was a tobacco farmer                     Both of my grandparents were tobacco farmers         Its the main economy in Stokes County is farming         So theres no big towns whatsoever in Stokes County                     I know that you used to do that when you were little didnt you                     Yeah         All of my neighbors and family members grew up on farms and and as a child in the summer when you werent playing sports you were farming or working in tobacco to make money                     What did you do                     You primed the leaves youd chop it and youd plant it         You know all the things necessary to raise the crop                     And then did you sell it         I mean is that what your grandpa did                     Then the owners would take it to the to the tobacco warehouse and then they would auction it off and sell it per pound         And thats what their uh thats what their way of living was was to sell that tobacco                     Hmm thats all your grandpas ever did                     Well thats what they did until they became  or  years old and then my late grandfather Lemmie went to work in a textile mill as a supervisor and my grandfather Willis went to work in a furniture factory                     Industry                     Industry                     Industry industry came in there         Um what about your um         childhood with your brother and sister         What is the funniest story that you remember with your brother and sister as a child         Ive heard a couple but                     My sister was always the little tyrant         She is  years older than me and my brother is  years older than me         And during the summer when we were home from school and I was five or six years old when they were both still home         She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played a part in that and of course she was going to make sure we did our part         So she was the biggest slave driver Ive ever seen and my brother was always the rebel and I you know as a five or six year old I did what I could and she didnt really have a lot of trouble with me but with my brother being when she was  he was  so you can imagine what kind of battles they had         She always had this thing about when we rebelled she would lock us in two separate bedrooms                                                               Well my brothers idea of rebelling was to escape out the window and run around         And one day what he did was we got locked into the room         I dont know what we did necessarily that day but he climbed out the window and was running around                     Which bedroom was he locked into                     He was locked into the front bedroom                     And you were locked into the                     I was locked into the back                     Which back         Your back                     Well that doesnt really mean anything to anybody whos listening                     Well it does         Me                     But anyway he climbed out a window and came by my window and my window was several feet off the ground so it wasnt like I could escape         But he would throw rocks up to get my attention and he saw me look out the window and he was jumping up and down waving his arms and laughing because he was out and I was still in         Well about that time he he jumped on a honeybee                                                               And and the first thing I saw him do was hit the ground holding his feet so he kind of got what he deserved that day                                                               Um showing off a little bit hmm base but they had their share of fights

County Basketball League as a senior in high school is pretty funny         And she used to demonstrate that for me too         We would go out and we would play horse and she would kick my butt
