                                 The Hell of Gates Jr            This weeks New Yorker is light on ads Chatterbox picked it up andfor a second thought it was the New Republic  but thick with highbrowClintophilic rationalization in the form of an essay by Henry Louis Gates JrYou thought Flytrap was about sex and perjury Wrong Its really about thedecline of loyalty among former Clinton aides like George Stephanopoulos andLeon Panetta and the nefarious spread of atomistic individuals loyal to anabstract uniform set of principles such as impartial truth Kenneth Starris the embodiment of these inhuman principles the EnlightenmentscurseAll poor Clinton was doing was trying to struggle with the gummy vexedexigencies of the merely human            Well Gates is right about the gummy part for sure Three questionsthough             Who says theres more disloyalty in this scandal Chatterboxcarries no water for George Stephanopoulos see  and  But his sin isless his disloyalty in acknowledging a potential crime by his expatron thanhis failure to confess his own complicity in that crime Overall the strikingthing about Flytrap is not how much disloyalty there has been but howlittle  Nobody from inside the administration has yet broken ranksthough there have been rumblings from cabinet secretaries Rubin and RileyThere is no John Dean no Deep Throat Compare those Watergate betrayals withthe watereddown subversion of Stephanopoulos and Panetta which amounted tosaying on television what was obviousthat Clinton is in trouble unless heexplains himself soonand you would conclude that loyalty has been on the risesince the Nixon years Maybe what has changed is we no longer expect a loyalaide to admit even the obvious Were so accustomed to spin that common sensesounds like treason Gates includes a few tobesure paragraphs about Deanand then proceeds undeterred Like a thinking mans Johnny Apple he surveysvarious Kennedy and Johnson hackseven tracking down that familiar standbythe unnamed Washington veteranand reaps a harvest of selfcongratulatoryharrumphing along the lines of I come from an era when loyalty and gratitudewere regally honored not like these young whippersnappers etc He citesJFKs secretary Evelyn Lincoln as one of the ancient paragons of loyaltytheembodiment of the courtiers discretion Would that be the same EvelynLincoln who after JFKs death according to                   Slates David Plotzcirculated stories that Jackie had had adulterous trysts in the White Houseand spent the remaining  years badmouthing LBJ and Jackie See Plotzs pieceSounds a bit like Dick Morris defending Bill by badmouthing Hillary             Do we really want to place loyalty over truth Gates main strawman is one William Godwin who in  argued that if you can rescue eitheryour mother or Archbishop Fenelon from a burning house you go for theArchbishop since he has the greater social contribution to make Gateswords In Gates essay those who would favor a stand of principle over theties of blut and boden or even businesswhistleblowersantiwar dissenters anyone who says I often place my duty to society above myduty to my companyare characterized as William Godwin types all lettingtheir own dear mothers burn to a crisp with nary a second thought while theygrandly escort some silkbedizened cleric to safety Worse theyre selfishrootless cosmopolitanssorry theyre selfish moral illuminati pursuingtheir own vision of individual authenticity of unbridled selfassertionat the expense of family and group ties the intricately reciprocal characterof a life lived within community Of course Gates comically stacks the deckwith the Godwin example since Godwin asks that we rescue the cleric not inthe name of truth but in the name of some sort of obnoxious aristocraticutilitarianism Nor is betraying Clinton exactly like burning yourmother In reality of course it is Clintons defenders who are making theutilitarian arguments about the overbalancing value of the presidents greatersocial contribution A larger point concerns the value of loyaltywhether tofamily community employer or other social group Is it really such a greatthing Loyalty in this sense has given us wars racism tribalism andgenocide Selfish uniform principles have given us science human rights andthe ConstitutionThe Enlightenment Individualism Take it away LeonWieseltier             Even if Stephanopoulos should be loyal to Clinton  why should therest of us By the end of his piece Gates has subtly slipped fromattacking exaides who criticize Clinton to attacking anyone whocriticizes Clinton We must all he says start learning to talk about rightand wrong without recourse to abstract principles Anyone else is amamabarbecuing Ken Starrstyle fanatic Gates never explains why Chatterboxor any other ordinary voter owes Clinton the same loyalty as Stephanopoulosdoes If the charges against the president are true isnt it he who hasbetrayed us            Chatterbox could go on and on Didnt Bill Clinton champion the very neweconomy of rootless skilled freeagentsthe very disloyal types Gates claimsthreaten to subject the president to the laws that apply to other AmericansWould we have been better served in Vietnam if fewer officials had quit theJohnson administration to protest the waror if more had quit earlier andmore loudly Why should we spend valuable time reading the journalism of HenryLouis Gates Jr if he is happy to place his loyaltyto his family his racehis colleagues to The New Yorker  to the academic empire hes buildingat Harvardover an annoying abstract principle like truth Maybe Chatterboxhas seen On the Waterfront too many times But should we really root forthe guys who poison Marlon Brandos pigeons
