                    Background        Brucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by a        number of hostadapted species of the gramnegative        bacterial genus         Brucella  In addition to the        economic losses caused by reproductive failure in a number        of important livestock animals accidental transmission of        the disease to humans can occur through animal husbandry        meat processing activities or ingestion of contaminated        unpasteurized milk The highest incidence of brucellosis is        found in regions where local custom encourages the        consumption of raw goat camel or bovine milk or of soft        cheeses prepared from unpasteurized milk Children in these        regions are particularly vulnerable because of their        elevated consumption of milk and dairy products        Many countries have implemented eradication programs        resulting in the reduction or elimination of the disease        but the disease remains enzootic in many regions of the        world In those countries where the disease has been        eradicated or strictly controlled continued surveillance        is essential to preventing reemergence of the disease        Once a new infection has been confirmed in a herd it is        critical to prevent further spread of the disease to other        herds It is equally important to determine by        epidemiological traceback analysis where the infection        originated how it was spread and what measures are needed        to prevent additional spread of the disease from this        primary source        Whenever possible traceback is confirmed by comparison        of the outbreak strain with isolates obtained from the        primary source Identity is established by examining strain        specific traits In the case of         Brucella  species are identified by        the analysis of a large panel of traits composed of        serology growth requirements and biochemical phenotype            These traits also permit additional subtyping of some        species into biovars Unfortunately specific biovars tend        to predominate in certain geographical areas For example        in the USA  of bovine infections involve         B abortus biovar         A number of investigators have attempted to devise        methods for genotyping         Brucella strains Published methods        include enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus        sequencePCR ERICPCR and repetitive intergenic        palindromic sequencePCR REPPCR      random        amplified polymorphic DNAPCR RAPDPCR or arbitrary        primedPCR APPCR      and restriction fragment        length polymorphismPCR RFLPPCR of the         omp  locus      ERICPCR and        RAPDPCR are both affected by assay conditions and        environmental effects during the amplification process              Although the results are highly reproducible        within a laboratory laboratorytolaboratory        reproducibility has been problematic and thus makes the        universal application of these methods unlikely compare           and     RFLPPCR of the         omp  locus is not constrained by        issues of reproducibility and has been useful for the        differentiation of         Brucella species    and for        differentiation among isolates from marine mammal hosts            However as a tool for the epidemiology of brucellosis        in livestock this technique is limited by the low rate of        natural sequence divergence within the locus at the biovar        level        Recently the complete genomes from         B melitensis    and         B suis    were published and the        genomic sequence from         B abortus is complete but not yet        fully annotated     These data have made it possible        to search for regions of DNA sequence variability that        might be useful as markers for diagnostic identification        and differentiation This paper describes the first        application of microsatellite fingerprinting to         Brucella isolates Microsatellite        fingerprinting exploits the occurrence of variable number        tandem repeats VNTRs ranging from  to bp per repeat        and  to  repeats per locus These VNTRs have been        observed throughout the prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms             The addition or deletion of repeat units within        a locus is believed to be caused by slippedstrand        nucleotide mispairing andor unequal crossover events        which increase the rate of mutation at these loci            The variations in the number of repeats give rise to        molecular alleles for a given locus and aid in the        characterization of the individual When multiple loci are        analyzed the resulting fingerprint can be highly        discriminating or even unique Though commonly used for        forensic identification in humans the technique has        recently been used for subtyping a number of pathogenic        bacteria                 We have employed microsatellite fingerprinting for        genotyping         Brucella species based on the number        of tandem repeats of the DNA sequence AGGGCAGT at eight        loci in the genome A PCRbased method was developed to        identify the specific alleles at each of the repeat loci        The technique is compatible with highthroughput        automated detection technologies as well as traditional        less costly detection methods We have named this technique        HOOFPrints for Hypervariable Octameric Oligonucleotide        FingerPrints The type strains of all the classical         Brucella species and biovars were        surveyed to assess the discriminating power of this        fingerprint technique Examples from naturally infected        cattle and wildlife herds were also examined to assess the        level of divergence among and within outbreaks                    Results                  Identification and characterization of the tandem          repeat loci          Multiple tandem repeats of the octameric sequence          AGGGCAGT were initially discovered when searching          sequence files generated from the shotgun sequencing of           Brucella abortus biovar  strain           for a subsequence TAGGGC of IS             The           B abortus genome had nine          chromosomal loci containing at least two complete copies          of the octameric repeat The repeat regions and          approximately bp of upstream and downstream flanking          sequence were individually compared to the           Brucella melitensis biovar  and           Brucella suis biovar  published          genome sequences To facilitate comparisons among the          three           Brucella genomes Table indexes          the coordinates of each VNTR locus in the           B melitensis and           B suis published genomes To          facilitate BLAST searches each locus was mapped to both          the complete chromosome sequence and to the matching          chromosome section in each genome The sequence location          specified in Table denotes the start of the first repeat          unit at that locus Since the published           B melitensis and           B suis genomes are numbered in          opposite orientation the relevant strand for each genome          was also listed in Table           The homologous sequences were aligned revealing          variable numbers of repeats at eight of the nine loci          Fig  Among the three sequenced           Brucella genomes the number of          complete repeat units ranged from one copy eg VNTR          Locus of           B suis  to fourteen copies VNTR          Locus of           B abortus  A notable feature of          the repeat loci was the significant conservation of the          sequence immediately downstream of the repeat units in          eight of the nine loci Alignment of the downstream          sequences of           B abortus            B melitensis and           B suis Fig  identified a          conserved sequence stretch of about bp These          sequences had a higher than normal level of sequence          divergence than is typically found among           Brucella species but a consensus          sequence was evident top line of Fig  VNTR Locus          was the only locus that contained the same number of          repeat units  complete units in all three genomes It          was also the only locus lacking the conserved downstream          sequence data not shown          The VNTR loci were found on both chromosomes of the          published genomes and in most cases were distant from          each other Table  However VNTR Locus and VNTR          Locus were approximately kb apart on the large          chromosomes of the           B abortus            B melitensis and           B suis sequenced genomes and were          arranged in the same orientation VNTR Locus was about          kb away from VNTR Locus on the small chromosomes of          all three sequenced genomes VNTR Locus and VNTR          Locus were also arranged in the same orientation                          Development of the PCR assay          We wanted to examine the depth of variability of the          tandem repeat loci among other           Brucella species and more          importantly whether variability also occurred among          biovars and among independent isolates within a biovar          To rapidly characterize the VNTR loci from a bacterial          isolate eight parallel PCR assays were developed to          enumerate the number of repeats at each locus          Amplification primers Table  were designed to anneal          to the sequences immediately upstream and downstream of          the repeat units The number of repeats at each locus          were deduced from the size of the amplicon produced The          PCR templates consisted of methanolfixed bacteria from a          broad array of           Brucella strains and isolates          listed in Table and the Materials and Methods          section          Amplified products were sized by electrophoresis on           Metaphor or  agarose gels such that the bp increase          of each additional repeat unit was identified by          comparison with a bp mass ladder Sample data of the          amplicons generated from three loci of the           B abortus biovar type strains and          two laboratory strains are shown in Fig A          Alternatively the HOOFPrint procedure was adapted for          high throughput automated fluorescent DNA fragment          analysis by tagging each unique upstream primer with one          of three fluorescent labels Table  The amplicon sizes          were determined by comparison with a comigrating DNA          mass ladder labeled with an alternative fluorescent tag          Data generated for VNTR Locus by automated fluorescent          DNA fragment analysis for the same isolates assayed in          Fig A are shown in Fig B Detection of the          fluorescent tagged amplicons was typically very sensitive          with a high signal to noise ratio Accurate sizing of the          amplicons was essential for calculating the number of          repeat units at each locus                          Identification of VNTR alleles          Alleles were defined by the number of tandem repeat          units found at that specific locus For simplicity the          allele names correspond to the estimated number of          complete repeat units in the amplicon eg Allele has           complete repeat unit Allele has  complete repeat          units Some of the VNTR loci were found to contain small          deletions or insertions within the conserved sequence          Fig  In VNTR Locus and VNTR Locus these          modifications occurred within the amplified sequence          When the mutation affected a multiple of bp the          amplicon still matched one of the hypothetical allele          sizes VNTR Locus of           B suis biovar  Fig  However          the published           B suis biovar  genome contained          an bp insertion within the amplified  sequence of          Locus when compared to the corresponding           B abortus and           B melitensis sequences Fig           This insertion resulted in an alternative ladder of          hypothetical allele sizes that was offset by bp          In practice the empirically determined product size          was found to sometimes differ from the expected amplicon          size by  or bp especially at higher allele numbers          In other cases the observed amplicon size fell outside          of the expected amplicon sizes To determine the allele          assignment selected amplicons were examined by DNA          sequencing data not shown                          Comparison of alleles among the BrucellaReference          Strains for all species and biovars          A panel of  pure           Brucella cultures composed of all          of the           Brucella species and biovar FAOWHO          Reference Strains was assayed by the HOOFPrint          procedure The amplicons obtained from each locus were          sized and the numbers of repeat units were determined          The data were compiled in chart format for easy          comparison Fig  The collective alleles amplified          from a given isolate formed its genetic fingerprint Each          fingerprint was unique and each of the type strains could          be easily differentiated However parts of the          fingerprint patterns were similar among the related          biovars of a single species The VNTR Locus locus for          example contained two repeats in all           B abortus biovars Similarly the          VNTR Locus locus contained a single repeat in the three                    B melitensis biovars          In some cases two or more products were amplified          from a single locus egVNTR Locus in           B melitensis biovar   and           repeats and biovar   and  repeats           B canis  and  repeats and           B suis biovar   and           repeats These results were reproducible from cultures          grown independently but originating from the same master          seed In these instances the alleles would often but          not always differ by a single bp increment          As mentioned above VNTR Locus of the           B suis biovar  sequenced genome          was bp larger than the homologous regions of           B abortus biovar  and           B melitensis biovar  When the          sizes of the VNTR Locus fragments amplified from the          panel of           Brucella strains were compared to          the size range of the normal and the alternative alleles          we observed that the products amplified from           B canis            B neotomae            B ovis  and           B suis biovars   and  were          consistent with the bp offset allelic ladder of           B suis biovar  rather than the          allelic ladder exhibited by the           B melitensis or           B abortus biovars Fig  starred          alleles          There was disagreement between the fragment sizes          calculated from the published genomic sequences and the          observed fragment sizes amplified from some of the VNTR          loci in           B melitensis biovar  and           B suis biovar  eg VNTR          Locus Furthermore no amplification was detected for          the VNTR Locus or VNTR Locus loci of           B melitensis biovar  even though          the same type strains strains M and  were used          for both studies                          Comparison of alleles among selected field isolates          of B abortus          Most bovine brucellosis in the USA is caused by           B abortus biovar  For a typing          method to be of value for epidemiological traceback it          is essential to be able to subtype biovar  isolates A          small panel of           B abortus biovar field strains          consisting of  bovine isolates  elk isolates and           bison isolates was tested to look at strain diversity in          the US Cattle field isolates were acquired from           herds in  states The compiled fingerprints along with          the fingerprint of           B abortus reference strain           are shown in Fig  The allele patterns of           Brucella isolates cultured from          multiple animals in the same herd are boxed together The          first observation was that while the fingerprint pattern          within a herd appeared to be stable the profile for each          herd was unique It was also apparent that the individual          loci were mutating at different rates For example among          the  cattle field isolates Allele was the only          allele found at VNTR Locus and Locus Allele was          also found at Locus in  of the  cattle isolates At          the same time VNTR Locus  alleles Locus           alleles and Locus  alleles showed the highest          variation The fingerprint profiles of the wildlife          isolates were also unique and easily distinguished from          the cattle isolates Nonetheless these isolates shared          the same alleles found for VNTR Locus Allele and          Locus also Allele in cattle The bison isolates          shared common alleles at VNTR Locus Allele and          Locus Allele However because of the very small          sample size it remains to be seen if this constitutes a          true pattern                          Comparison of alleles among multiple production          lots of commercially prepared B abortusvaccine strain          RB          Since a significant degree of variation was found          among laboratory strains and field isolates of           Brucella  we wanted to look at the          level of allele variation generated during limited           in vitro passage of           Brucella  For this purpose we          tested four nonconsecutive production lots of          commercially prepared RB vaccine The fingerprints for          these samples were also compared with the RB parental          strain  with the           B abortus biovar  type strain           and with the unrelated vaccine strain S The          results presented in tabular form Table           demonstrated that limited           in vitro passage of RB did not          induce any allele variation and that RB was distinct          from the other           B abortus biovar  laboratory          strains including the parental strain                             Discussion        Historically it has been very difficult to irrefutably        trace natural         Brucella transmission unless the        strain involved happened to belong to a rare biovar        Furthermore where total depopulation is not applied it is        difficult or impossible to differentiate a new exposure        from a recrudescent infection in a recovered herd with the        current tools available Some techniques have been useful        for the identification andor differentiation of         Brucella species and biovars                but few tools have been available for the        epidemiological traceback of new infections in livestock                Except for biotyping none of these more        discriminating techniques has been universally accepted        probably because of concerns about laboratorytolaboratory        reproducibility The HOOFPrint technique eliminates that        concern because of the extreme specificity for the target        loci        The assay described in this study exploits hypervariable        tandem repeats VNTRs composed of the octameric DNA        sequence AGGGCAGT         Brucella strains can be characterized        by the number of repeats at each of eight chromosomal loci        Associated with the repeat loci is a conserved sequence        approximately bp in length downstream from the repeat        region The function of the conserved sequence is unknown        however analysis of the secondary structure shows this        region forms long stems with intermittent loop structures        The one repeat locus that lacks this sequence contains a        stable segment consisting of three repeat units in         B abortus          B melitensis and         B suis         In other pathogenic bacteria the hypermutability of        VNTR loci has been exploited for strain typing                 To assess the level of variability associated        with the         Brucella VNTR loci a set of eight        parallel PCR assays were developed for amplification of the        individual repeat regions Strong conservation of the        sequences upstream and downstream from the repeats allowed        the design of very specific primers that generate extremely        reproducible results The primers anneal selectively to        long sequences that are both unique and conserved Because        of the strength of the primertarget pairing and        empirically optimized conditions the reactions are robust        and relatively tolerant of minor fluctuations and        variations in the assay environment        In anticipation of future multiplex development and        highthroughput processing each of the unique upstream        amplification primers was tagged with one of three        fluorescent compounds The use of fluorescent dyes        increased the detection level of amplified products        substantially and may enhance the analysis of samples with        very low levels of bacteria However some regions of the        world experiencing high incidence of brucellosis may not        have access to the expensive machinery and expertise        necessary for fluorescent detection of amplicons        Therefore the range of amplicon sizes selected for this        method allows flexibility in the methods available for        detection and differentiation of alleles including less        costly and more common technologies such as agarose gel        electrophoresis        The results show that the HOOFPrint assay is a highly        discriminatory technique among         Brucella species and biovars The        degree of hypervariability at the eight VNTR loci was        surprising considering the profound genetic homogeneity of        the         Brucella genus that has made        differentiation so difficult Even more unexpected was the        remarkable discrimination the HOOFPrint technique revealed        among         B abortus biovar  field isolates        Nevertheless isolates collected from multiple animals in        the same herd had identical fingerprints Examination of        the fingerprint profiles obtained from nonconsecutive        production lots of vaccine strain RB supports that         Brucella fingerprints evolve        gradually These characteristics make the HOOFPrint        octameric repeats ideal for rapid strain typing        Slipstrand mispairing is believed to be an important        factor in generating tandem repeat polymorphisms            Misalignment of DNA strands during chromosome replication        is thought to lead to the addition or deletion of repeat        units Unequal crossover events are also believed to be        involved in repeat expansion or contraction The frequency        of mutation events appears to be influenced by the number        of repeats the sequence flanking the repeats and may        involve multiple mechanisms     Thus VNTRloci        typically mutate at differential rates This differential        rate of mutation at individual VNTR loci in         Brucella is a fortuitous attribute        for VNTR fingerprint analysis It provides a glimpse into        the evolution of the fingerprint profile and may provide        some insight into interrelationships among strains Our        data supports this possibility Certain loci mutate so        slowly that particular alleles appear to become fixed in        specific species andor biovars of         Brucella eg Allele  for VNTR        Locus in all         Brucella abortus isolates tested        Whether this will ultimately lead to species andor biovar        identification through fingerprint analysis will require        the additional testing of a large number and wide variety        of isolates While some loci seem to mutate slowly other        loci appear to mutate frequently enhancing the        discriminatory power of technique Currently the        individual rates of mutation and what factors influence        those rates are unknown Moreover the affects of long term        serial passage both in culture and in animals are also        unknown We plan to investigate these issues further        During the isolation procedure for diagnostic analysis        multiple colonies from an individual tissue or animal are        typically pooled for testing We observed that in several        instances pooled colonies from a single source contained        multiple alleles at a single locus for example see the        S electropherogram in Fig B At first this was        perplexing as it could indicate that certain loci may be        too unstable to be valuable However further examination        revealed that the multiple allele patterns were        reproducible and isolate specific This evokes several        nonexclusive explanations In endemic areas animals have        been shown to carry multiple infectious strains        simultaneously In another scenario incomplete        depopulation of an infected herd could result in a dual        infection during a subsequent outbreak It is equally        possible that the multiple alleles reflect a collection of        accumulating subpopulations present in the host In natural        infections animals typically receive a large dose of        bacteria during exposure These large doses could contain        evolving subpopulations generated by the genetic        instability within individual VNTR loci Over time it is        predictable that the composite fingerprint of the resident        population would gradually change Regardless of the        mechanism by which they come about multiple alleles can        occur Therefore during an outbreak or with a newly        discovered infection involving         Brucella  it will be essential to        test multiple or pooled isolates and multiple animals to        establish the complete representative fingerprint profile        for epidemiological use        Unexpectedly different alleles were found at some loci        than were predicted from the published genome sequences of         B melitensis and         B suis  This was despite using the        same strains for our studies It should be stressed        however that little is known about the histories ie        number of passages clonal selections and culture        conditions of these strains between the time they were        initially isolated from the host disseminated to other        laboratories and prepared for these respective        studies        We anticipate that the testing of a larger number of        isolates from various geographic areas will ultimately lead        to the development of an international         Brucella fingerprint database that        can be searched for epidemiological use A broad survey of        the fingerprints derived from marine isolates will be an        interesting complement to the data compiled from the        classical terrestrial strains The HOOFPrints can be        deposited in spreadsheet format or by numerical sequence of        alleles eg         B abortus strain                 for rapid easy computerized identification or        classification of isolates independent of the testing        laboratory involved With a minimum amount of effort to        standardize the process a VNTR HOOFPrint database could        become an invaluable resource for tracking and eliminating        brucellosis outbreaks worldwide                    Conclusions        Currently very few genetic markers have been identified        for         Brucella species that can be applied        to epidemiological investigation of an outbreak We have        developed a new technique that has the power to        definitively characterize and differentiate         Brucella isolates based on multilocus        VNTR fingerprinting The assay is intended to complement        the existing PCR and bacteriological diagnostic tests        currently used for         Brucella species and biovar        identification The existence of at least eight        hypervariable loci exponentially increases the        discriminative power of the assay for the characterization        of closely related strains beyond the biovar level Through        the analysis of multiple loci similarities as well as        differences can be used to assess the genetic relatedness        of field isolates This in turn can provide insight into        the evolution of a brucellosis outbreak and how to prevent        further spread of the disease Ultimately we envision that        this technique will be used to generate an international        database of         Brucella fingerprints that can be        accessed and used by epidemiologists for control of the        disease                    Methods                  Bacteria used in this study          The bacterial strains used for this study included the          complete array of           Brucella type
