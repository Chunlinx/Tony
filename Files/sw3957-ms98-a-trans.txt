        okay how do you feel about it     well i feel like the major problem we have and the reason that crime has gotten so out of hand is because there isnt a punishment thats matching whats being done     i agree with that   and i think it starts when the kids are little i think the parents in our community teach our children that as long as they can get away with something that its all right   umhum   because i dont see a lot of parents especially where im at i have a lot of the responsibility of what ever is done in our neighborhood because theres no other mothers at home   yes i have the same thing here   and i see a lot of kids very small kids coming home to empty homes every day and doing all kinds of unbelievable things and as long as they dont let anybody know about it they get away with it  so       you know i feel like if our parents mothers stayed home if we had that secure start you know where kids learned the right way to act um they were rewarded for their good behavior and they had a secure family that they came from i think wed see a whole different society   yeah that kind of goes right along with what im thinking too is well the movies and the TV the violence and all the things that are on there if the parents were home in the afternoon when the children came home maybe they wouldnt be watching as much as this   thats right   but then again theres some of them at home at night with them that do not monitor what their children are watching and so its i think youre right in that it is parents caring enough to may be put off having that other car or the other TV or what ever it is theyre working for   yeah right   and take care of the children   well you know i did a survey on why mothers left their children to go to work  and i found out that more than eighty percent of all the people i talked to   umhum  whatd you find out   the mothers went to work to provide a better life for their children and when i talked with their children their children wanted their parents home rather than the the the material things they were getting     yes i i can believe that   and its just too bad that the parents wont listen to this survey so  i just think that um another problem is i think the way the legal system has been set up that the criminals get out and the jails are so over crowded they cant handle punishing the   umhum   people that are committing the bad crimes sufficiently i think they need to put more people out to death um if its completely witnessed and its uh seen that theres no you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair   umhum right right but and maybe not quite so much publicity either i think theres far too much publicity on some of these violent crimes that and then it seems to become a challenge   right i think that to oh out do it   to be shown to people to see if they can get away with it   yeah or out do whats been done   right that its   yeah i think thats another problem um i know that once when i was reading a book when i was studying history and it said you show me a country that can produce strong families and youll have a strong country and if you look back over United States histories our country was strong until the mothers started leaving the home   umhum womens rights and all these good things  the children are the ones who suffer   thats right thats right and they do and then they grow up and it just continually will get worse     yes and and   so i guess what we both agree on is that families need to change their way of thinking   right right yes and until the families change i think that well continue to have this problem and it will worsen   right and i think people need to have some sort of a an idea of why were here and what were doing and what were working towards and why its important to do these things rather than just getting ahead materialistically   yes uhhuh uh back to the old basic morals and   thats right  well um do they come do they come on and say when weve talked visited for five minutes   and things that i i dont know i i thought they did but this is my first time also so well but in   this is your first time um we discussed i discussed on here with someone um last week about the justice system and how it could be improved on juries and we discussed about how half the jury that they select to   umhum   you know come up with the verdict if half of those were law students then they could understand what was going on in the court room and have the time that they spent in their jury district count towards some of their graduation hours   hey that would be a good idea  thats   wouldnt that be a good idea because i think so sometimes the juries dont understand all this the legal you know talk and and whats going on   yeah   and this way it would get people that were a little more knowledgeable at least half of them to be on that board or on the jury   that
