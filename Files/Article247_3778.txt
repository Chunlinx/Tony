                                 Reagans Mixed Legacy                        Dear Dinesh            What a relief Something would be very wrong if we found nothing to argueabout Its also a relief to be able to put aside Morris book which we bothagree is a strange and wrongheaded failure and talk about Reagan directly            And what about Reagan Like most liberals I was horrified by almosteverything Reagan did as president Today I consider him a much moreimpressive figure than I once did and can even admire some of what he achievedBut Morris in his simplistic way and you in your much more knowledgeableway go much too far I think in your claims about Reagans importance tohistory            Several years ago I wrote a long essay of my own about Reagan the onlytime Ive tried to write anything serious about him for a presidentialreference book and I was surprised by how much more sympathetic I was to himthan I had once been He deserves considerable credit I think for restoring asense of possibility and optimism to American popular culture There is ofcourse an easily crossed line between confident optimism and arrogantjingoism and that line was sometimes crossedby Reagan himself and by manyothersin the s just as it was much more disastrously by many Democratsin the s But on the whole I think he was a positive force in the way hereduced the rancor and disillusionment that had grown so corrosive in the lates and s            I also think that Reagan made some I emphasize some importantcontributions to American social policy He continued and accelerated amovement in both elite and popular thinking about welfare policy that hadlargely begun in the Nixon years that welfare should be much more closely tiedto work that it should be to use a phrase created but never really actedupon by Lyndon Johnson a hand up not a handout That movement hasculminated at least so far in the welfare reforms of the Clinton years forwhich both the president and the Congress are responsible Reagans ownunderstanding of the nature of the welfare system and its effects was likeMorris largely simplistic and uninformed But his instincts were at leastpartially right and like many liberals I was slow to recognize that I now dobelieve as I think most Americans do that getting people to work is the bestthing a public policy can do to lift people out of poverty and redeem theirlives I note that William Julius Wilson certainly no conservative has arguedthis quite eloquently in his recent book When Work Disappears  And Ithink Reagan deserves some credit in legitimizing that notion even if hisreasons for doing so are not necessarily ones I would support The Reaganadministration was I think gratuitously punitive toward some of the poorestand most desperate welfare recipients and put much too much of the burden ofits supposed deficit reduction on the backs of those least able to afford itand on programs so meagerly funded that their contribution to deficitreduction was meaningless in any case The same could be said for theunattractively punitive features of the  welfare reform But it has alsogone largely unnoticed that the Reagan administration supported some of theearly state backtowork experiments that eventually showed impressive resultsand that it expanded the EITC which has now after its much greater expansionunder Clinton become one of the great success stories of contemporary socialpolicy            On the larger question of Reagans economic policy however I am less inagreement with you No one can deny that the American economy grew impressivelyafter  that the stock market rose astronomically that there was much newinvestment and that many important new economic sectors flourished Credit forthat must be distributed widely but the economic policies of the Reaganadministration undoubtedly contributed On the other hand the economic boom ofthe s and the s is unlike any previous economic boom in American historyin creating a very substantial upward distribution of wealth and in benefitingthose on the bottom  to  percent of the economic ladder very little if atall Blame for that must also be distributed widely but I have no doubt thatthe Reagan administrations economic policiescutting taxes mostly for theupper brackets while watching higher social security taxes eat away at lowerand middleclass family incomes as just one examplecontributed to this largesocial failure            Finally the Cold War Of course Reagan and Bush and Thatcher and the Popeand many others made contributions to the denouement of the Soviet Union andall deserve credit for that But to say that Reagan was more responsible forthe collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War than Gorbachevorthat either of them was more responsible for it than the cascading economiccrises in the USSR itselfjust doesnt make sense Yes the Soviet economyhad never done as well as Western economies and had often experienced crisesBut the erosion of Soviet economic life in the last  years of its existenceas a nation was much more serious rapid and destructive than anything thathad come before Certainly part of the reason for that was the very high levelsof unproductive military spending But those high levels had been eroding theeconomy since well before Reagan ratcheted up the arms race That was afterall one of his rationales for doing so There were many other grave problemsas well not leastas I mentioned the other daythe Afghan War none of whichwere a result of Western policy            Morris argument that Reagans statements had a tremendous ideologicaleffect on the Soviet people is the weakest way to support the case for Reagansimportance The Russian people whatever their views of their own regime aremuch too proud and nationalistic to take to heart Reagans or any Americansdenunciations of them But while I give Reagan credit for recognizing the valueof working with Gorbachev and doing nothing to obstruct the changes that wereoccurring and that were quickly moving well beyond what Gorbachev himselfwanted I can see no basis on which to attribute the central role in this greathistorical event to him George Washington was president during the FrenchRevolution we do not credit that event to him Reagan was rather morecomplicit in the end of the Soviet Union than Washington was in the end of theFrench monarchy but it was not ultimately his doing            You make a much better case for Reagan than Morris does and historians willcertainly be debating these questions for generations But I suspect that inthe end the judgment of Reagan will be considerably more mixed than yours andperhaps more mixed than mine as well            Its been a pleasure discussing these issues with you I wish I could saythe same about reading the book            Alan
