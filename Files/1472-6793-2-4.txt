                    Background        Tetraethylammonium is known as a poreoccluding blocker        of voltagegated potassium channels     but it also        blocks other cationic channels such as calciumdependent K        channels     and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor            TEA at  to  mM also inhibits osmotic water        flux through human AQP channels expressed in         Xenopus oocytes decreasing the net        swelling rate in hypotonic saline by  as compared to        AQPexpressing oocytes not treated with TEA     This        blocking effect on osmotic water flux was demonstrated to        involve AQP channels specifically by using sitedirected        mutagenesis tyrosine  to phenylalanine to generate a        YF AQP channel that is insensitive to block by TEA but        retains sensitivity to block by mercury The blocking        effect of mercury in AQP channels is dependent on a        neighboring residue cysteine      TEA offers        attractive advantages over mercury as a reversible and less        toxic blocker for AQP channels in experimental analyses of        water channel function however the relevance of TEA as a        blocker for AQP channels outside the         Xenopus expression system has not        been examined previously        Differences in properties including pharmacological        sensitivities have been observed for ion channels        expressed in oocytes as compared to those in native        tissues For example the         Torpedo acetylcholine receptor and        the         Shaker K channel protein differ in        the fractions of protein glycosylated the composition of        the oligosaccharide chains and the degree of protein        maturation when expressed in         Xenopus oocytes as compared with        channels in native tissue or other expression systems             Differences in glycosylation patterns can influence the        binding of external blocking agents The presence of        tissuespecific targeting signals not recognized in         Xenopus oocytes may lead to protein        degradation     These discrepancies raised the question        of whether AQP channels in native tissues are sensitive to        TEA as they are in         Xenopus oocytes Data presented here        show that TEA is effective as a blocker of AQP channels        expressed in a mammalian renal cell line and in native        renal epithelial membrane        AQP channels are complex solute conductors They are        constitutively permeable to water and also function as        regulated nonselective cation channels    when gated        by intracellular cyclic GMP      Even though only a        small proportion of the AQP channels that are present in        the membrane appear to be available for cGMPactivation of        the ionic conductance  modelbased calculations        nonetheless suggest that this contribution could be        meaningful in a physiological setting     Unlike        transporters which move substantial amounts of substrate by        design ion channels function to change membrane potential        by the net movement of relatively tiny amounts of charge         picomoles per cm membrane to generate a change of         mV     hence the low proportion of active AQP ion        channels is consistent with a functional goal of gated        ionic signaling that is distinct from that of massive        constitutive osmotic water permeability        The role of the AQP channel in mediating both water and        ion fluxes raises interesting questions about whether the        pathways are shared or structurally distinct Expression of        AQP channels in bilayers has shown that the water        permeability but not the ionic conductance is blocked by        pchloromethylbenzenesulfonate indicating that the two        fluxes may involve distinct pathways     Work        presented here provides an additional line of evidence that        the pathways for water and ions in AQP can be        distinguished pharmacologically using the blocker TEA as a        probe In combination with data from threedimensional        imaging analyses     these results support the        suggestion that the AQP channel may contain separate        parallel pathways for ion and water fluxes These findings        have potential significance in understanding the complex        role for AQP in processes of salt and water movement        across cell membranes                    Results and Discussion                  TEA inhibition of water flux in AQPexpressing          MDCK cells          TEA inhibited significantly the osmoticallydriven net          movement of water across monolayers of MadinDarby Canine          Kidney MDCK cells expressing human AQP as compared to          AQPinfected MDCK cells without TEA treatment Figure           MDCK cells were induced to express AQP by infection          with replicationdeficient adenovirus see Materials and          Methods These cells showed a high rate of water flux          ranging from  to  lcm hour and a significant          block by  mM TEA ranging from  to  in  sets of          replicate experiments The TEA block of AQPmediated          water flux for all data combined was  In control          MDCK cells infected with empty virus the water flux was          significantly lower approximately fold ranging from           to  lcm hour In these control cells the net          flux rates with and without treatment were not          significantly different Therefore the enhanced water          permeability and concomitant sensitivity to block by TEA          were dependent on the expression of AQP channels MDCK          cells transfected with empty virus showed no augmentation          of transepithelial water movement confirming previous          work that showed water does not flow across tight          junctions in MDCK confluent layers     Cells          transfected with empty virus also showed no effect of TEA          treatment The magnitude of block of AQPmediated water          permeability by TEA is consistent with that reported          previously for AQP channels expressed in           Xenopus oocytes                              TEA inhibition of water flux in renal tubule          Preparations of pure descending thin limbs and pure          ascending thin limbs from the inner medulla were          segregated by morphological features Descending thin          limbs with their cells with nuclei protruding into the          lumen differ markedly in appearance from ascending thin          limbs with their large round flat nuclei when viewed          with DIC optics      The differential expression          of AQP in the two different types of segments abundant          in the descending thin limb and absent in the ascending          thin limb visualized by immunocytochemistry confirmed          the accuracy of the morphological identification Figure           AQP provides the predominant pathway for water          transport in the descending thin limb      In          preparations of isolated perfused descending thin limbs          net osmotic water absorption rates J           v  and water permeability P           f  were significantly lower in the          presence of  mM TEA than in the absence of TEA Figure           This sensitivity to TEA correlates with the          expression of AQP channels in this region The overall          effect of TEA in descending thin limb was to cause a           block of J           V and a  block of P           f  The pairwise comparison of          individual tubule preparations before and after TEA          showed a significant percent change of      mean           SEM n   in descending thin limb In contrast          preparations of ascending thin limbs that lack AQP          channels showed essentially no net water flux and no          effect of TEA under osmotic gradient conditions For data          from ascending thin limbs the pairwise comparison of          individual tubule preparations before and after TEA          showed a nonsignificant percent change of               n   These data show that the blocking effect of TEA          on water permeability originally observed in          AQPexpressing oocytes can be reproduced in a          physiologically relevant condition TEA blocks water          permeability in a tissue that has abundant native          expression of AQP channels whereas it has no effect in          tissue lacking AQP expression                          Lack of TEA block of ion channel conductance          Heterologous expression of human AQP in           Xenopus oocytes a system that has          been well characterized for electrophysiological assays          was used for twoelectrode voltage clamp studies to          evaluate the effects of TEA on ionic currents External          TEA mM failed to block the cGMPdependent ionic          current in AQPexpressing oocytes Figure  Current          responses were assessed with voltage steps from  to           mV from a holding potential of  mV Fig A The          initial response shows the currentvoltage relationship          recorded by twoelectrode voltage clamp in an          AQPexpressing oocyte in isotonic  mM Na saline see          Methods The activated response was measured in the same          oocyte at  minutes after addition of  mM sodium          nitroprusside SNP which elevates endogenous cGMP          levels The effect of  mM TEA with  mM NaCl was          assessed by perfusing the recording chamber with TEA          saline containing SNP No appreciable change was          observed For the representative example shown in Figure           the conductance measured as the linear slope of the          currentvoltage relationship between  and  mV Fig          B for the initial condition was  nAmV After          channel activation the conductance was  nAmV in Na          saline and  nAmV in  mM TEA saline The reversal          potential of the current Fig B shifted from          approximately  mV in the initial state to about  mV          in the activated state consistent with the activation of          a nonselective cationic conductance permeable to both Na          and K  Similar results were observed for other          SNPactivated oocytes n   as well as for          AQPexpressing oocytes activated by prior incubation in           mM BrcGMP as described in     In          AQPexpressing oocytes the conductance induced by          BrcGMP in control Na saline did not change          significantly      mean  SD n   after          perfusion with  mM TEA saline thus confirming the          absence of a blocking effect of TEA on the ion          conductance by AQP channels The activated AQP ion          channel is less permeant to TEA than to Na or K               however because of the high extracellular Na          concentration  mM in the TEA bath saline in the          present study the measured reversal potential of the          activated current was not appreciably different with and          without  mM TEA          Results presented here show that TEA serves as an          effective though partial blocker of the osmotic water          permeability mediated by human AQP channels expressed in          a heterologous mammalian cell line and by native AQP          channels in isolated rat renal descending thin limbs of          Henles loops Before the characterization of TEA          mercurial compounds were among the only known blockers of          AQP affecting both the constitutive water flux and the          regulated ion conductance      For AQP channels          expressed in           Xenopus oocytes the block of          osmotic water flux is  in  mM TEA  in  mM TEA          and  in  mM TEA as referenced to the osmotic water          flux in control AQPexpressing oocytes     Data          presented here show that the level of block by TEA is          comparable or greater for AQP channels expressed in          mammalian cells  mM TEA produces a  block of osmotic          water flux in MDCK cells and  mM TEA produces a           block in renal descending thin limbs The effect of TEA          on water permeability in cells and tissues that express          high levels of AQP channels is likely to be significant          given the substantial amount of water that can be moved          across AQPexpressing epithelia for example see data          on descending thin limbs in Fig  The idea that TEA          might be a candidate for a lead compound for the          development of drugs with possible clinical applications             is supported by the present data that show the          effectiveness of TEA in two different mammalian models of          AQPmediated osmotic water permeability While the          usefulness of TEA           in vivo as a research tool may be          limited by toxicity and effects on other channels at          higher concentrations it offers a degree of          reversibility and selectivity not seen with mercury an          agent which acts by covalent modification of all exposed          cysteine residues               The regulated ion channel function of AQP is not          blocked by external TEA An intriguing question remains          regarding the location of the permeation pathway for          cations in AQP channels Analysis of the crystal          structure of GlpF suggests that potential ion binding          sites may be located in the central pore at the          fourfold axis of symmetry in the tetrameric association          of subunits that form the channel     Interestingly          this arrangement of a tetramer of subunits to form a          central ion pore is a hallmark of the family of          voltagegated ion channels     which rely on a          tetrameric organization to create a central pore for ions          that is lined by sequences contributed from all four          subunits In contrast the four individual pores for          water or glycerol located within each subunit of AQP or          GlpF appear to be lined with hydrophobic residues          expected to preclude ion permeability                Importantly TEA distinguishes between the two pathways          in AQP supporting the idea that the ion and water pores          are physically distinct although they coexist in the          same channel complex          The AQPmediated ion conductance may contribute          measurably to the function of tissues in which AQP is          abundantly expressed such as in the mammalian renal          proximal tubule     Further work is needed to assess          the additional levels of regulatory control that may          constrain the availability of the AQP proteins to serve          as ion channels gated by cGMP within a background of          constitutive water channel activity The maintenance of          an ionic pore as well as a conserved cGMPbinding domain          in the AQP carboxy tail for regulating activation              suggests that the ion channel function is likely to be          essential for physiological regulatory processes that          have yet to be fully appreciated

and to measure net fluid movement            across the epithelium with an imposed osmotic gradient             Cdextran MW  was added to the            perfusate                                Determination of net water movement and water            permeability of thin limbs perfused in vitro            There is no net transepithelial water movement with            solutions of identical osmolalities in the bath and            lumen For this study however we determined the            occurrence of net water absorption and water            permeability when we imposed an osmotic gradient from            bath to lumen see below Net water absorption J             v nl min mm tubule length             was determined in each collection period with             Cdextran in the perfusate using the following            relationship J             v  V             i  V             o L In this equation V             i initial perfusion rate nlmin            is calculated by dividing the cpm of C in the            collected fluid by the cpmnl of C in the initial            perfusate and by the time of the collection period V             o collection rate nlmin is            measured directly from the collection and L mm is            the length of the tubule perfused measured with an            ocular micrometer For purposes of determining the            water permeability of DTL and ATL we imposed a             mOsmolkg H              O osmotic gradient from bath to            lumen with sucrose and determined J             v as just described Water            permeability P             f  m s  was then determined            from the equation P             f  J             v A             s V             w C             osmol  where A             s

  movement was examined TEA bromide  mM was added to            the bathing medium and the NaCl concentration was            reduced by  mM to maintain the osmolality constant            Collection periods were  min in length and each tubule            served as its own control for measuring net water flux            and water permeability in the presence and absence of            TEA  Cdextran
