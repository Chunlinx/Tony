                                 Gimme Some Skin                           CruellaDe Vil Cruella De VilIf she doesnt scare youNo evil thing will                        If your multiplex is like mymultiplex and whose multiplex isnt when you go to a screening of Dalmatians  you will see six previews Here is what Hollywood is preparingfor Americas children a cat movie another cat movie an ape movie anotherape movie a dog movie and another dog movie In the second dog movie the dogshares top billing with a dolphin            The coming plague of animalfilms is nothing new The last few years have witnessed Babeanimatronic pigs dogs sheep several Homeward Bound s dog and cata couple of Free Willy s whale and countless others I havemercifully been able to forget Everywhere you turn some movie is preachinginterspecies comity and rhapsodizing about animals superhuman intelligenceAny day now I expect my cat to strike up a conversation with me probably abouthis threepicture deal with Castle Rock            No movie embraces animalpropaganda with as much enthusiasm as the new  Dalmatians  Disneysliveaction version of its old animated feature It is the heartwarming animalmovie distilled into its purest form The cuddliest animals Dalmatian puppiesare threatened with the most horrible fate clubbing skinning being turnedinto fur coats at the hands of the most villainous villainess Cruella De VilStrangely we are supposed to revile Cruella for designing fur coats yet rootfor the hero Roger who designs violent mindnumbing souldestroying videogames            Naturally Cruella gets her comeuppancea variety of Home Alone styleagonies inflicted by farm animals  This teaches the requisite morallesson It is far better to torture a human being than to allow a single puppyto come to harm In the end the Dalmatians and their human masters livehappily ever after Children cheer Animalrights groups coo Parents drive tothe Pet Pantry to buy Dalmatian pups for Christmas            After watching  Dalmatians  I too wanted to driveto Pet Pantry to buy Dalmatian pups  and skin em After  hectoringminutes of the movie I wondered Whats wrong with Cruella De Vil Whatswrong with a Dalmatian fur coat And where can I buy one How much is thatdoggie in the window While the ASPCA and PETA chapters compose their indignantletters to the editor and heat their vats of oil to a rolling boil let meexplain            Theres nothing wrong withDalmatians that a good furrier couldnt fix The movie  Dalmatianspromises dogs that are goodnatured healthy intelligent resourcefulgorgeous Except for the last part this is a lie Dalmatians are highstrungTheyre hyperactive They bark too much Theyre bad with children They shedconstantly Theyre hard to train The Dalmatians dont even perform tricks in Dalmatians  An Airedale does the tough stunts the Dalmatians merelybark on cue Theyre illsuited to living indoors Many of them are deaf andall of them are dumb They are in short lousy pets            Thisinspires an equation Beauty plus difficult temperament equals fur We do it tominks We do it to foxes Why not to Dalmatians Cruella has it right A furcoat preserves what is desirable about Dalmatianstheir beautyand eliminateswhat is undesirableeverything else            There are two main objections to Dalmatian furcoats The first is principled Fur is wrong It barbarically exploits animalsits unnecessary and so on To this I offer only the standard furindustryreply Fur farming doesnt have to be cruel Minks live longer on fur farmsthan they do in the wild Dalmatians one imagines could roam more freely on alarge farm than in a cramped urban apartment And Dalmatian farmers would notsimply kill Dalmatians for their fur Dog meat is prized in other parts of theworld It used to be in the United States too on his Western expedition withClark Meriwether Lewis raved about it Dalmatian farmers can set up shop inplaces where dog meat is eaten Maybe Dalmatian burger is an ecologicallyefficient substitute for beef though it might dampen enthusiasm for McDonaldscurrent  Dalmatians promotional campaign            Thesecond objection to Dalmatian farming is visceral The mere thought of farmingdogs for fur nauseates you With this objection I sympathize Dogs arecharming People love their dogs even their Dalmatians They see somethinggrotesque in the idea of making them into winter outerwear It offends commondecency            Yet we do cruel things to animalssmart animalsaffectionate animals cute animalsall the time People raised on farmsunderstand this Pigs are sociable loving and a hell of a lot brighter thanDalmatians Have you seen what gets done to them  Do farmers weep aboutit Calves are adorable But veal is delicious            Of course it is argued thedogmans best friend the family petis different So says modern bourgeoisAmerica which has turned the pet into a fullfledged member of the nuclearfamily even more sacred than other human beings such as curmudgeonly auntsDisney by anthropomorphizing its critters exploits this Americanmushymindedness and makes us forget that pets are in the end just animalsBut God gave man dominion over the beasts of the earth If an animal haseconomic utility we should farm it            In  when Disneyrereleased the animated  Dalmatians  demand for Dalmatians soaredHere is a prediction This December it will happen again Tens of thousands ofchildren will hound their parents into buying charming Dalmatian pups forChristmas As before many of those charming pups will in two years grow upinto charmless dogs Hundreds of them perhaps thousands will be abandoned ordropped at the pound They will be shut up in cages Later they will beeuthanized            Now why is that better thanbecoming a fur coat
