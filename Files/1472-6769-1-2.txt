                    Background                  The sevenconformer dataset          The Taxol molecule is a complex diterpenoid with a          conformationally immobile core consisting of the fused          AD rings Side chains critical for bioactivity of the          molecule and analogs are those emanating from the core at          C C and C To evaluate the energetic performance of          various computational schemes seven Taxol conformations          derived from experimental data with differing torsional          angles in the C fragment were examined The diversity          of C side chain orientations is illustrated in Figure           in which the diterpenoid core AC rings have been          superimposed and amplified with reference to specific          torsions in Table  The first five are those with the          highest estimated populations  to  with a G range          of  kcalmol from an NMRNAMFIS analysis in CDC            solution     Structure            corresponds to the nonpolar          conformation observed as the predominant species in CDC            or CD            Cl            as depicted in Figure           Characteristic of the form is the hydrophobic collapse             of the benzamido phenyl at C and the benzoyl          phenyl at C The point is illustrated by the short            distance between the centers of the corresponding phenyl          rings Conformer            experiences a similar collapse with          a somewhat shorter ringtoring distance derived from an          alternative set of torsions along the C side chain          Table  With respect to the close approach between          pendant hydrophobic centers            and            resemble the semisynthetic analog          of Taxol Taxotere docitaxel The latter compound          differs constitutionally from Taxol in that the C          acetate becomes an OH and the NHCOPh benzamido group          is replaced by NHCOO           t Bu The single crystal Xray          structure    and the D NMR CDCl              d  of Taxotere likewise          demonstrate hydrophobic association in this case between          the           tert butyl and the C phenyl          group Structure            is the polar form frequently found          in DMSOd            D            O It too exhibits hydrophobic          collapse but between the Taxol phenyl ring attached          directly to C and the Cbenzoyl ring Figure           Isomers            and            are extended rotamers in which the          C benzoyl phenyl ring is distant from both C terminal          rings Rotamer            corresponds to the recently          proposed bioactive conformation of Taxol bound to          tubulin    The perspective given as             illustrates the T relationship          between the three phenyl rings of the molecule Figure           The final two Taxol conformers included in our          dataset            and             appear together in the unit cell          of an Xray crystal structure determination    The          latter is a C side chain extended structure while          hydrophobically collapsed            is very similar to             Table complements Figure in          providing a selected set of dihedral angles to illustrate          explicitly the conformational variation among the seven          Taxol torsional isomers                            Results        Five conclusions are immediately evident from Tables            For a given medium gas CHCl           H          O there is no consistency in energy        ranking within the molecular mechanics methods MM and        MM  performing similar to MM offer no        exceptions  None of the forcefield solvation models        posit nonpolar          to be favored in CHCl           while only MM predicts polar          and          to be most stable in the water        continuum model Table   About half of the force field        protocols in Table suggest the extended uncollapsed        conformer          to be lowest in energy  Use of        Gquality ESP charges as recommended for the continuum        solvation models  b   leads to conformer           a nonpolar type conformer distinct        from          as the uniform global minimum for        both gas phase and solution models Table  The next        lowest conformer is predicted to be  kcalmol higher        in energy while overall conformer ranking between the        different force fields generally inharmonious Thus        incorporation of ESP charges amplifies and alters the        energy rankings  AM and PM calculations in the gas        phase vary in suggesting                    and          as most stable Table  While H          O solvation correctly identifies polar                  the CHCl          model also favors either          or extended          rather than          or                              Discussion                  Electrostatic interactions dominate and differ          across methods          For Taxol application of commonly applied force          fields as well as the semiempirical methods AM and PM          results in an ordering of conformational energies that is          method dependent and mostly inconsistent with          experimental data In an attempt to understand this          behavior within the force field framework we examined          the various energy contributions for each conformation          and method In most cases the overwhelming factor is the          electrostatic term a component that is seriously          amplified by incorporating ESP charges The point is          likewise illustrated by damping rather than magnifying          intramolecular electrostatics Taxol includes ten polar          functionalities five atom units four esters one          amide and five  or atom units three OHs one ether          one C carbonyl In one set of calculations the latter          five groups were converted to the hydrocarbon analogs CH                      CH            and CCH             respectively The optimized          structures Table  are very similar to those cited in          Tables and  but the individual global minima are          shifted to different conformers When the five COX          units are converted to trans butene moieties now          removing all heteroatoms and most of the electrostatics          in the molecule the energy minima shift once again and          the average energy spread between high and low          unconstrained energy conformations ie             diminishes to an average of           kcalmol Table  The latter is to be compared with an          average of  and  kcalmol for the fully optimized          structures of Tables and  respectively          The molecular mechanics results might be ascribed to          the presence of low quality    parameters in the          force fields employed Indeed MM and MMFF involve           and  such interactions out of a total of  and            and  respectively However MM and AMBER          incorporate only  and  such parameters respectively          yet their ability to accurately predict the purported          experimental forms is not improved The two semiempirical          methods each locate  conformations with energies no          more than  kcalmol above the lowest but none of the          calculations selects the same set of low energy          conformers          Modern force fields with stretch bend torsional          hydrogen bond and crossterms are parameterized primarily          within threebond units ABXY Of the two additional          key terms the van der Waals component operates with a          very short range force and essentially prevents atomatom          interpenetration In the absence of damping the single          longrange interaction that persists from one end of the          molecule to the other is the electrostatic contribution          While individual bond dipoles are characteristic of the          Allinger MM family of force fields other molecular          mechanics methods employ atomic charges In either case          no general scheme for parameterizing the electrostatic          interaction among multiple polar groups in threespace in          terms of conformational energies has yet emerged          Similarly within a quantum chemical semiempirical          framework charge polarization notwithstanding          conformational energies are sensitive to method and          charge distribution Inspection of Table reveals that          unlike the forcefield results described in Tables and           all four semiempirical recipes predict polar          conformers            and            to be the low and global minimum          energy forms respectively when the aqueous solvation          continuum model is employed The one exception AMAM          suggests both polar and nonpolar forms            and            to be equally populated This          limited success is negated however by the incorrect          prediction that the same polar species are also the low          energy forms in the gas phase and in the CHCl            solvation model In no instance do          the semiempirical calculations predict either nonpolar          forms            or            to be dominant in CHCl             As mentioned above the AMAM          calculations posit equal populations for            and            within the latter regime but they          simultaneously relegate nonpolar            to a higher energy The remaining          semiempirical methods predict the empirically verified          nonplar conformers            and            to be unobservable in the          chlorocarbon solvent with energies ranging from  to           kcalmol above the polar collapsed conformation It          might be concluded that the water model is robust while          the chloroform model is illparameterized although the          AMSOL literature on solvation    gives little basis          for this contention Alternatively the few inerrant          predictions for             combining both structure and          continuum aqueous solvation energies might well be          fortuitous The likelihood that this is correct is          accentuated by the fact that Taxol conformational          analysis by NMR has never been performed in pure water          but always as a mixture of DMSOd            and D            O    In addition in anhydrous          methanol a solvent with a high dielectric and the          capacity for explicit hydrogen bonding as in water the          polar form goes undetected  b                           TTaxol the butterfly conformation          For the unsuspecting organic or medicinal chemist          however either interpretation is equally unfortunate          Faced with a large polypolar organic structure and a          solvationequipped semiempirical package the user is          limited by the proposition that the aqueous solvation          model might provide the correct global minimum but that          other conformers may or may not be assigned an          appropriate relative energy In less polar chlorocarbon          solvents the Taxol structure and other molecules with          similar complexity do not appear to be capable of even          qualitative ranking by the various methods with respect          to energy An interesting but fortuitous outcome in this          respect is that conformer             the T or butterfly conformer of          Taxol is predicted to be the dominant conformation by          MMFF AMBER and MM under various protocols Table           Semiempirical models likewise predict it to be of low          energy though not the most stable Table  This          conformer was assigned a low population in the          multiconformational analysis of Taxol in chloroform              used in the fitting of the electron crystallographic          density of the tubulinTaxol complex in zincstabilized          sheets and ultimately assessed as the binding          conformation for Taxol in this structure     A          unique but difficulty observed conformer computational          methodology overestimates its stability and might have          led to its discovery by misrepresentation While the          operation of serendipity is much to be desired in the          drug seeking process errant methodology is the least          desired path to discovery                            Conclusions        As a consequence of the above considerations for highly        polar molecules like Taxol it is overoptimisitic to expect        that conformational searching based on a         computational energy criterion will        yield results faithful to experiment The use of solvent        continuum models clearly does not ameliorate the situation        Our observations and those of Halgren    suggest that a        given force field or quantum chemical method selected for        potential application to a highlypolar molecular system be        carefully validated to assure that conformational energy        comparisons are not spurious Until this problem can be        addressed at a fundamental theoretical level it would seem        prudent to employ an energyfree conformational search        protocol We find the NAMFIS approach valuable in this        respect      however there are a number of equally        attractive alternatives    that in principle can also        bypass the energy catastrophe Future work will be devoted        to examining a range of functionalized organic molecules in        order to define the boundary of molecular polarity within        which standard conformational search methodology can be        applied with confidence                    Materials and Methods                  Force fields and semiempirical methods applied to          Taxol          The study was conducted by employing four popular          force fields in MacroModel MM MM AMBER and          MMFF    Each was used in the gas phase with two          continuum solvation models CHCl             H            O  b  with default MacroModel          atomic charges Table  To provide a comparison with          MacroModel we also tested solvated MM and          polarization enhanced MM    In addition the          seven AMBER conformations were fitted with MNDO          electrostatic potential ESP charges scaled to the          G level     and the calculations repeated
