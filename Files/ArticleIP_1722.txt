have been trying tosell the organs of executed criminals to American doctors  for livers for lungs of nonsmokers  for kidneys and  for pairs ofcorneas In a scoop last Friday the Daily Telegraph revealed thecircumstances under which a Murdoch publishing company the London subsidiaryof HarperCollins had canceled publication of the memoirs of Britains lastgovernor of Hong Kong Chris Patten for which it had already paid an advanceof             The paper found that Murdochhad personally intervened to get the book stopped because he feared that itsantiChinese slant might threaten his TV interests in China After oneferocious editorial last Friday the Telegraph published another Mondaysaying that behind the machinations within HarperCollins is Mr Murdochsdetermination to suppress condemnations of a vicious and brutal dictatorshipwhich allows its citizens to be shot dismembered and sold in pieces Murdochand Black have long been locked in a British newspaper price war            MurdochsTimes of Londonprovoked much comment by failing to publish anything about the affair untillast Saturday when it carried a small story on Page  headlined News CorpPuts Its Side in Row Over Patten Book But it grew more evenhanded Monday whenit said that HarperCollins was now fighting a rearguard action to stop athreatened revolt by some of its authors The writer of this story theTimes  media editor Raymond Snoddy was widely reported as having saidin a radio interview that the lack of coverage in the Times had damagedhis own reputation and probably that of the newspaper as well I

abuse from his newspaper rivals of a kind thatmight make a lesser person feel faint But it said that this scandal was notnearly as shocking as his decision four years ago to drop BBC news from hisHong Kong satellite service to appease China and concluded that Britaindidnt need legislation to curb Murdochs media power but needed politicianswith the guts to snap their fingers at bullies            In anoped piece FT columnist Philip Stephens wrote that those who fearMurdoch should stop for a moment to savour the delicious irony of his latestobeisance before the Beijing gerontocracy He concluded The frenzy withwhich he seeks to expand his empire betrays a realisation that it will notoutlive him The mogul has become a mouse In the Guardian AndrewNeil Murdochs former editor of the London Sunday                Times said his exboss had shown neither integrity nor morality in his handling ofPattens book It is a sorry tale from which he emerges a diminished tarnishedfigure            Most

who was credited with supplying much ofthe ideological drive and marketing expertise Other British newspapersclaimed that the US gun lobby had helped finance the march            El Pas of Madrid led
