                                 William Buckley Quotes Himself in SelfDefense                           Last week William F Buckley Jr read a Slate Book Clubabout his latest novel The Redhunter A Novel Based on the Life and Timesof Senator Joe McCarthy  and decided enough was enough One of theClubbers Eric Alterman had called Buckleys book a lumbering themelesspudding of a novel that forces ones eyelids shut like an invisible vise Theother Ronald Radosh had described it as heavy and plodding without any realjuice to it Buckley weighed in defending his work against all chargesaesthetic historical and ideological and quoting a critic writing inBuckleys own National Review who deemed the book wonderfullyreadable  a witty fastmoving yarn Now Buckley has askedSlate to run the following excerpt from the book so thatreaders can judge for themselves We are delighted to oblige                        Chapter             Acheson Collects McCarthyana            Dean Acheson was cutting up newspapers in his lawoffice at Covington and Burling However fastidiously he discharged his dutiesas a practicing lawyer his mind was on other things not least his reputationas Secretary of State during the last four years of Harry Trumans presidencyHis daily stimulantIf you can call it that he remarked to his partner andclose friend Harold Epison the daily ingestion of poison I inflict onmyselfwas what he referred to with some scorn as the McCarthy page in themornings newspaper He had been reluctant to evidence a formal interest in theunspeakable senator But in fact he read all references to him and though onlyout of sight collected voraciously choice items He had taken to scissoringout clippings from newspapers when his secretary wasnt in the room andtossing them into his briefcase But after a few weeks he decided that it wouldbe better to undertake his project in a more orderly way That was when he toldhis secretary Miss Gibson it is possible that when I do my memoirs I shallhave in them a chapter on the  grotesqueries of Senator McCarthy For thatreason I shall ask you to clip out of the papers those articles or editorialsI designate with the initial M These are to be clipped and put in a manilafolder in the bottom drawerhe pointed down from where he satoverthere            Day after day week after week month after monththe folder grew in size The methodical Mr Acheson took to classifying theentries according to his estimate of their ranking MO parsed asMcCarthyOutrageousAt rd level MP parsed asMcCarthyPreposterousst level He had other categories including T forTreasonable  and L for Laughable  He also reserved aclassification for criticisms of McCarthy that he especially savored His veryfavorites earned as one would expect a  whence MC Such a discoveryin a morning paper would put him in a very good mood and sometimes he wouldeven drop a quick note of commendation to the author When Senator Benton saidof McCarthy that he was a hitandrun propagandist of the Kremlin model MrAcheson had filed the remark as an MC and dropped a note to Benton Billnice score today on McMenace Well done            This mornings reference to McCarthy by DrewPearson in his column had caused him to glow What he is trying to do is notnew It worked well in Germany and in Russia all voices except thoseofficially approved were silenced in those lands by intimidation But hedecided against dropping a note to Pearson He would not wish to run the riskof Pearsons quoting him He could hardly countenance any public appearance ofan ongoing contention between Dean Gooderham Acheson Yale Secretary ofState and Joe McCarthy Chicken Farmer Marquette whereverMarquette was Junior Senator from a state that had lost itssenses            He had dined the week before with defeatedDemocratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson Dean Acheson enjoyed thecompany of Stevenson but thought him indecisive Acheson relished the storyAdlai had told him over drinks at the Metropolitan Club about the dinner withPresident Truman The President was then living across the street at BlairHouse while the White House was being rebuilt Truman had summoned him whenStevenson was still governor of Illinois            I walked in the door and the President said Imean just after barely saying Hello he said Adlai I want you to run forPresident You should announce the third week in Aprilthis dinner was inJanuary  Deanand say that you will seek a leave of absence as governorof Illinois             I told him I was very flattered by the suggestionbut that I was committed to run for reelection as governor of Illinois            What did he say            He didnt even acknowledge what I had saidHe went on and talked about this and that but at dinner repeated exactlythe same instructionsI was to run for President announce the third week inApril etc I gave him the same answer After dinner he walked me to the doorand you guessed it said the identical thing one more time and I gave backthe identical answer Then you know what he said Dean The trouble with youAdlai is youre so indecisive              They both laughed            Then Acheson had looked up            You know Adlai the President was quite correctyou are indecisive            But at least Adlai wasnt equivocal about McCarthyAcheson had given an MC to Adlais designation of McCarthyism before thepress club as a hysterical form of putrid slander and as one of the mostunwholesome manifestations of our current disorder            When Harold Epison came in to the office of hissenior colleague just after five it was in order to spend an hour on theappeal he was shepherding to the Appellate Division on behalf of their clientthe Kingdom of Iran But he began by asking Dean whether he had seen thereference to McCarthyI caught it in the New York Daily News  which Isometimes see It wasnt in any of the Washington papersby OwenLattimore            No Acheson hadnt seen it            Somebody apparently asked Lattimore after a speechwhat he thought of McCarthy He saidI have this in memory DeanMcCarthy isa base and miserable creature             That is a thoughtful summary Acheson said Hethen paused Rather a pity it was done by Owen Lattimore He is not exactly adisinterested party on the McCarthy question As a matter of factHaroldobviously to go no furtherit hurts me to say thisI think thatmiserable creature was substantially right on Lattimore  But that hardlyvitiates the soundness of Lattimores summary on McCarthy He made a mentalnote to write down Lattimores characterization and slip it into hisfolder            You may be interested to know Harold that a fewRepublicans who are well situated think McCarthy has gone far enough            Surely the question is What does Ike think            Acheson turned his heard slowly as if to say thatthe words he would now say were sacredly confidential            He is I am I think reliably informed prepared tomove  That is enough on that subject            I agree Dean Howre you getting on with yourbook            I write every night five times a week I try todo five hundred words a day            Have you got a title for it yet            Yes Im going to call it A Democrat Looks atHis Party  Weve lost a lot of spirit in the Democratic Party in the twoyears since Ike came in Of course theres a lot of disequilibrium in thecountry You will find Harold that this is always so after a societycompletes a major effortin this case winning a world war Churchills defeatwas a symptom of that kind ofletting your breath out The surprise here wasthat Mr Truman defeated Dewey But that also meant that the opposition nevergot a chance to exercise its muscles Not until Ikes victory in             So your book is intended to do what            To put the Democratic Party back on its feet asthe civilized party the intelligent party A worthwhile project wouldnt youagree            Of course But you know Dean I hope you willconfront headon the foreignpolicy problem I agree with everything you sayabout Senator McCarthy You know that But it is a fact that we had to fight awar in Korea that President Eisenhower ended            Yes The war ended officially five months afterEisenhower was electedand three months after Stalin died            Dean you are being the advocate now We Democratsdid get into that war we didI know hate that word lose China            You are correct that we have to focus verycarefully on what is happening in the Soviet Union We dont know what thetriumvirate thats in power now Khrushchev BulganinI continue to refer toit as a triumvirate though they executed Beria a week ago good riddance Whatthe successors to Stalin are going to do we dont know but there are no signsthey are giving up their commitment to rule the world But yes I amready to say this with great care I will show you the draft of that chapterI will say that it is correct that the Communists cant be allowed to go anyfurther Well didnt Mr Truman say that By engaging them in Korea            But the challenge will be to distinguish betweenthe right kind of antiCommunism and McCarthys antiCommunism A bigdifference Harold did you see what Henry Reuss said about McCarthy the otherday Reuss was a Democratic contender against McCarthy in  I think I mayjust have a copy of the clipping            Acheson leaned over and pulled out the bottom leftdrawer on his desk He said Senator McCarthy is a taxdodgingcharacterassassinating racetrackgambling complete and contemptible liar            Achesons face brightened He gave the closest heever gave to a giggle I wish I had said that Harold
