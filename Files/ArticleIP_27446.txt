                                  Kill and Die for quotCredibilityquot            At least Henry Kissinger is consistent When he andRichard Nixon took over the Vietnam War in  they didnt make much of aneffort to defend the original objectives of the enterprise Instead theemphasis was on credibility having got in for whatever reason wise orfoolish we couldnt just change our minds and get out In order to preservecredibility we needed victory or as time went on peace with honor or asmore time went on a decent interval between our withdrawal and the othersides triumph            Thirty years on Kissinger and many others aresaying a similar thing about Kosovo Having got in NATO must win or thealliances credibilityand possibly the alliance itselfwill be destroyedBut for most who make it the credibility argument serves a very differentpurpose this time During Vietnam it was a lastditch appeal by people whogenerally had supported the war for years With Kosovo the credibilityargument popped up after about five minutes and mainly from people who saythey oppose the original decision to get involvedor who avoid sayingprecisely where they stand on that basic question Credibility in shortused to be a coverup now its a copout            During Vietnam credibility did not persuade manywho otherwise opposed the war As a moral argument it seemed scandalouslytrivial and as a debating point it seemed like moving the goal posts You nolonger have the stomach to pretend that the mission of young Americans killingand dying for freedom for the Vietnamese people can succeed but you want themto kill and die for credibility Even geostrategically it seemed wrong Everyextra day we spent blood and treasure on a war we no longer believed in madesubsequent threats to use military force less credible not more soAnd thus more than a decade after that war ended an overnight victory inGrenada was hailed desperately as the end of the Vietnam Syndrome            Credibility is still aslender reason to kill and die What would President George W Bush orPresident John McCain say to a grieving mother Your son died forcredibility Al Gore and Bill Clinton have also invoked credibility in answerto the question of why we fight            Perhaps credibility would be worth dying for if it actuallydeterred war That is the argument If the enemy believes that youre not onlywilling but also certain to use enough force to defeat them you wonthave to start a fight to get your way Sen Joe Lieberman DConn echoes thearguments over Vietnam when he says that if we dont persevere in Kosovotyrants in Europe and Asia and the Middle East will run wild because theresno one on the block to speak for the values and security that we holddear            But consider the historyof credibility since World War II There have of course been occasions whenthe United States let its credibility founder In the s there was the Bayof Pigs in the s the fall of South Vietnam in the s the retreat fromLebanon after the bombing of the Marine barracks in the s Somalia In eachcase the United States committed force and then withdrew after the situationbecame intolerable            Did these defeats irreparably harm our credibility andpropel wouldbe aggressors to believe that the United States would never fightPerhapsalthough I dont remember too many Republicans saying that the Gipperhad irreparably jeopardized American security by pulling the Marines out ofBeirut The line between a deft strategic withdrawal and a collapse ofcredibility is in the eye of the beholder US withdrawal from Vietnam in didnt prevent the United States from using its nuclear deterrent to keepthe Russians out of the Yom Kippur war later that year            Conversely Americanwins havent dissuaded tyrants As Benjamin Schwarz and Christopher Layne havewritten Just as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was not deterred byUS action against Iraq Saddam Hussein was not deterred by US action inPanama Manuel Antonio Noriega was not deterred by US action in GrenadaLebanon and Vietnam Ho Chi Minh was not deterred by US action against NorthKorea and Kim Il Sung and Joseph Stalin were not deterred by US actionagainst Adolf Hitler Tyrants it seems act up whether the United States hasbeen winning or losing            Some have argued that because Kosovo represents such a hugecommitment of US power it cant be compared to say Lebanon or the Bay ofPigs Lieberman made this argument on Meet the Press recently Andothers have said that since this is a NATO operation its differentalthoughthe principle is the same whether its one nation or  that are fighting Butneither of these arguments holds up Vietnam represented a much largercommitment of US force than we see now in Yugoslavia and yet the UnitedStates retreated from Indochina Likewise NATOs credibility is said to be atstake in Kosovo But who can doubt that NATOs original mission as adefensive alliance would remain strong even if Milosevic managed toprevail in Kosovo Would a crazed Russian dictator in  really believe thathe could roll tanks into Germany with impunity because NATO had failed to wresta Yugoslavian province from Belgrades domination in             Its telling that thecredibilitists dont apply their standards to all countries Ironicallytheres a certain Blame America First quality to their argument Cold Warriorslike Kissinger hardly argued that the Cuban Missile Crisis ended Sovietcredibility If credibility were such a fragile commodity we wouldnt haveneeded the Reagan buildup after the Russians blinked during the Cuban MissileCrisis or in  when they made noises about helping the Arabs in the YomKippur war and then backed down            Perhaps the better conceit than credibility isconsistency  The consistent Israeli policy for instance of not givingconcessions to terrorists is widely acknowledged to have stymied the oncecommon hijackings and other acts of terror directed against Israel Theconsistency of Israeli policy made the difference But consider Israel inLebanon Today the Jewish state maintains only a thin security zone insouthern Lebanon deeper in Lebanon Hezbollah guerillas now operate openly interritory once policed by Israeli forces But who thinks this retreat haseroded Israeli credibility I doubt military planners in Damascus and Tripolithink of the Israelis as softies            The difference betweenconsistency and credibility is that consistency implies a reason You will useforce to defend some policy or principle This is inherently more credible thana commitment to use force for no good reason except that you said you wouldIts more credible because it is more limited and because its more plausiblethat youll do something if its something you have a good reason to dowhether youve said youll do it or not            For example suppose NATO could establish a consistentprinciple that the Western nations will not permit genocide or neargenocidalethnic cleansing to take place anywhere they are in a position to stop itie there would be no pretense of an obligation to invade Russia or China orfarflung regions like East Timor By discouraging future ethnic slaughtersthat would give an added moral justification to saving the Kosovars That wouldbe credibility worth fighting for Unfortunately most of todays credibilitymongers invoke credibility precisely to avoid such a moral commitment            Incredible
