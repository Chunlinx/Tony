        the most  the interesting political development of the whole year and everything thats been happening in the former Soviet Union with the break up and the reconstitution     yeah i agree i been interesting to see how Gorbachev has uh been releasing the power to Yeltsin including including the uh button for the nuclear arsenals   well youve got to wonder what really happened in the socalled August Coup who really planned that thing out who stood to benefit   yes uh i agree its uh  thats some things that nobody may ever know for sure   oh well i suspect that Mister Yeltsin probably knows a lot more about it than hes ever let on   yeah he may but itll be interesting to see how this sort of loose commonwealth uh works from the standpoint of uh being as one political entity or whether its really just going to be kind of a loose confederation   well of course theres always the problem of the twelfth republic Georgia thats in a civil war right now what happens with them   also uh did uh did those Baltic States did Astonia and Latvia et cetera did they   no their no they they went all three of those   pitch their lot in with them or   Latvia Estonia and Lithuania went completely independent and had nothing to do with the commonwealth of states so they each three separate republics although i think the three of them have gone in together in some sort of confederation while they each are are supposedly independent   it may be interesting to see how when they start talking about border defense whether theyre gonna i think most of those independent countries are going to decide that they want to defend their own borders   well then what happens in the UN Russia supposedly gets the Soviet Unions seat and what happens with the eleven other republics i guess they dont get anything who knows   well  i think the what Russias going to bid for is the seat on the Security Council but i suppose that all of the other eleven can or the ten others or however many there are can be admitted as regular members of the UN   i dont know if these all are really independent countries or like states in the United States it almost looks likes some ways like the old Confederate States of America is almost what this arrangement looks like   yeah could be its gonna be   youve got uh eleven or twelve basically quote independent republics which are in a confederation does look a lot you know i think if we went back and looked at Civil War documents itd be a similar arrangement to the Confederate States of America   yeah could be  could be although they a lot of those existed as states prior to uh to their being a Soviet Union so i i dont know   well you have to look back to the great expansion of Peter the Great followed by Catherine the Great uh which pretty well set the course for what then became the Soviet Union i mean it has its roots back there in the in the early seventeen hundreds   yeah thats true i dont know what uh currency things are going to be done too whether each one will have to completely establish a currency based on whatever system or whether they can rely on the ruble somehow and uh and uh   oh i think one person put it aptly the ruble is rubbish   well thats true probably for any of them   course then the problem is what they do with their nuclear weapons thats the more interesting problem   well theres only four states that have any though only the Ukraine and Belorussia and Russia themselves and then that one middle Asian the one that starts with a K Konestan or something whatever that is uh theyre the only four and two of the four have said they would like to destroy them its only that fourth one that worries me a little bit but they dont have any intercontinental ballistic missiles down there either they have short range nuclear capability and presumably not very many of them judging by where that is   well who knows what theyre going to do with them   Russia had ninety percent of them on Russian soil so theyre still going to control the by and large the large amount of those   well of course the question is what Gorbachev does i guess he goes and writes his memoirs or something   hes been offered a position in the United States in Colorado to teach   i think hes turned that down now   yeah i imagine he would because hed have to move over here lock stock and barrel and hes still got children and grandchildren there in in Russia so   well i dont think he i dont think he wants to do that but he he certainly would be like an elder statesman or whatever   well he certainly give lectures around the world if he wanted to do that on an informal basis he could also uh  like you say uh write a book probably be a best seller   or how i survived the August Coup but really didnt survive it   yeah well its all been a outgrowth of what he started he started  uh
