                                 Reich Redux            Granted Robert Reichsisnt the very first name that comes to mind these days when you think aboutpolitical figures in trouble over twisting the truth But if there ever was amoment that showed the importance of finding the fine line between spinning thefacts and dispensing with them this is it For an object lesson in thedifference consider Reich redux            Lastyear                   Slate                reported that in parts of Locked in theCabinet  his memoir of his term as labor secretary Reich fabricatedquotations and distorted events Moreover the changes appear to have beensystematic rather than random crafted to create Hollywoodstyle set pieces inwhich Reich was the embattled decent man who was savaged by ruthlessjournalists politicians lobbyists and other Beltway vermin Click here to readthe original story The real people for whom nasty lines had been constructedwere not amused            Reich replied that his book was faithful to his experienceas he remembered it that the media were unfairly attacking him yet again thatthe discrepancies were minor and that he would correct them in a futureedition Now the new edition is here in the form of a paperback with revisionsand a new introduction            In thisnew introduction Reich again portrays his variances with reality as merememory slips Memory is fallible he writes Where I have subsequentlylearned of errors or misinterpretations I have made changes in this edition Inno instance however are the changes of material importance to the story Irelate            The books disputed passages come in threebroad types First denied quotations In his new introduction Reich saysYou are duly warned had you not assumed it already that most of the quotesin this book should be considered paraphrases rather than verbatim accounts asis often true of memoirs But many of the people Reich quotes have denied thesubstance as well as the precise wording of the quotations ascribed them RepMartin Olav Sabo DMinn denied that he had said the following of his fellowDemocrats Were owned by them Business Former House Republican leaderRobert Michel denied that he had told Reich that Newt Gingrich and friends wereout to destroy Theyll try to destroy anything that gets in their way Andso on            In thenew edition Reich has not changed these disputed quotations You just have todecide whom you believe            The second sort of dispute involves Reichs interpretationsand characterizations of events andor people Lane Kirkland the formerpresident of the AFLCIO comes in for rough treatment in Reichs book and hewrote a bitter letter complaining about it He especially objected to anaccount of a dinner party at his house at which his wife Ilena according toReich exclaims in horror and the whole table falls silent when Reichpunctures the evenings highsociety ambiance by mistaking mint jelly forsauce            The newversion makes some small but revealing changes in the party scene Somecharacters who Lane Kirkland said had been fabricated have been removed IlenaKirkland still exclaims No as Reich makes for the mint jelly But she is nowa solicitous hostess rather than a tactless snob She is apparently concernedthat I will embarrass myself Thats nicer The scene has been subjectifiedtoo In the original Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan wasappalled like the rest Now I imagine he is appalled like the restBefore various people stare at me silently Now I feel as if everyone isstaring at me No one can dispute that Reich felt and imagined what he says hefelt and imagined But the moral is the same I might as well have farted TheStarSpangled Banner Sams right Washington sucks Again readers needto decide for themselves how likely it is that a Cabinet officer would bring aWashington dinner party to a mortified standstill by mistaking jelly forsauce            The final most striking category ofdiscrepancy involves public events where official records exist and flatlycontradict Reich In one such casea presidential press conference at whichreporters supposedly bombard him and President Clinton with nasty questionsnone of which appears in the White House transcript the actual questions werequite pedestrianhe makes no changes Much more interesting however are twoepisodes that Reich has overhauled            In one of them acongressional hearing on the minimum wage becomes an attack ad as Rep JimSaxton RNJ jumps up and down in his chair like a schoolboy and crudelyberates Reich while a breadandcircuses audience laughs and applauds In factmost of the spoken lines attributed to Saxton were made up the real hearingwas dully decorous and as far as I could tell from the videotapes theaudience was politely catatonic In the new version Reich sticks to thetranscript and accurately quotes Saxton droning on at length about studies andGodfathers Pizza Saxtons statement is partisan but monotonously real andReichs complaint is not that he was attacked but that he had no real chanceof getting a hearing at this hearing            He stillexaggerates the hostility displayed and says that Saxton wont let me answerwhen in fact Reichs chief economist is later allowed to deliver alecturelength reply To compare Reichs new version with the original click But this time he gets the Washington story basically right The point ofmost Washington hearingsfor all concerned including Cabinet secretariesisnot to listen and learn but to talk and score points In real hearingsadversaries brandish impressivesounding studies and tell sob stories ratherthan making buffoonish personal attacks            In the original book one of the most striking incidentsinvolves Reichs talk before a roomful of National Association of Manufacturersexecutives and lobbyists allegedly all male and smoking cigars straight fromcentral casting In the original Reich is set up by his host and thenambushed by a hostile questioner named John and when he tries to answer withan eloquent Mr Smith speech My fist is clenched Sure you and yourshareholders have done fine But what about your workers  he is drownedout with boos and hisses At one point the room erupts in cries of Bullshitand Go back to Harvard            For anyonewho knows Washington the idea that a roomful of slick corporate lobbyistswould treat a sitting labor secretary this way is preposterous And theydidnt of course In his revision Reich gets rid of the cigar shtick andagain substitutes actual words while trying to preserve what he can of a senseof hostility Johns pedantic speech is quoted accurately but characterized asa tirade and Reichs answer is given as the mumbling equivocation that itactually was John I will get back to you with all the information on itThat was the information I have You have different information Instead ofboos and shouts we have only I hear hisses from several locations Well wecannot dispute that he thought he heard hissesthough the transcript reportsand the transcriber remembers only scattered applause and laughter            Here again the new scene has been spun ratherthan fabricated The level of hostility has been exaggerated but through itthe real Washington rather than a screenwriters fantasy is recognizableClick to compare the new and old versions            In bothrevised scenes Washington is still a nasty place and Reich still shines as aperennially beset paragon of decency But the issues are of interpretation notfalsification Locked in the Cabinet itself makes some shrewd andunflattering comments about the Washington games of spinning and posturingReich portrays himself as an innocent who knows little of such things But infact both as labor secretary and as memoirist he plays the game as well asthe next fellow The next fellowhis old bossshould read this new editionattentively For the president however it may be too late to revise            If you missed our link toJonathan Rauchs original story in                   Slate                click here Andcompare the old and new versions of two incidents that Reich
