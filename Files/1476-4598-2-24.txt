                    Background        Carcinoma of cervix uteri cervical cancer CC is a        leading cause of cancerrelated mortality in women        worldwide      CC arises by distinct morphologic        changes from normal epithelium and progresses to carcinoma        through a series of welldefined preinvasive lesions        Histologically CC presents as either squamous cell        carcinoma SCC or adenocarcinoma AC    with SCC        predominating Converging evidence from epidemiological and        molecular studies suggests that infection of genital human        papillomavirus HPV is causally linked to the development        of CC     Since only a small fraction of HPVinfected        cervical intraepithelial neoplastic CIN lesions progress        to invasive cancer these studies further suggest that in        addition to HPV other host genetic factors play a role in        cervical carcinogenesis     A number of molecular        studies have identified genetic alterations in these two        histologic types of CC and at various stages of precursor        lesions       Despite this molecular        characterization the genetic basis of CC initiation and        progression is still very poorly understood Therefore        identification of the underlying genetic changes may        provide further insight into the molecular basis of CC        Epigenetic hypermethylation in the promoter regions of a        number of genes has been recognized as an important change        in the development of human cancer     A growing number        of cancerrelated genes have been identified to harbor        methylation of cytosine residues in CpGrich promoter        sequences The pattern of such promoter methylation has        been noted to be nonrandom in various tumor types while        certain genes are commonly methylated in diverse tumor        types      The extent of aberrant promoter        hypermethylation and its association with loss of gene        function in cancer suggests that CpG island methylation is        an important mechanism in inactivating tumor suppressor        genes TSGs        The role of epigenetic gene inactivation in cervical        tumorigenesis is poorly understood A few previously        published reports on CC and its precursor lesions showed        promoter methylation of specific genes      However        these studies were limited by the small number of genes and        tumors examined To investigate the role of promoter        methylation in detail in cervical tumorigenesis we        evaluated CpG methylation of  genes in  CC specimens        and cell lines We found  of CC patients exhibiting        promoter methylation The         CDH          DAPK          RARB  and         HIC gene promoters were frequently        methylated Methylation status was correlated with clinical        and histologic characteristics and microsatellite        instability MSI We also found evidence that promoter        methylation inactivates gene expression in CC and exposure        to methylation andor histone deacetylase HDACinhibiting        agents reactivate the gene expression                    Results                  CDH DAPK RARB and HIC gene promoters are          frequently methylated in CC          We examined the status of promoter hypermethylation of           genes            CDH            DAPK            RARB            HIC            FHIT            RASSFA            APC            CDKNA            MGMT            BRCA            TP            TIMP            GSTP            MLH            p           ARF  and           RB  in eight specimens of normal          cervical squamous epithelia and  CC specimens Promoter          hypermethylation was not found in the DNA isolated from          normal cervical smears for any of the tested genes          However hypermethylation was detected in one or more          genes in  of   CC specimens The frequency of          promoter hypermethylation for individual genes was           CDH             DAPK             RARB             HIC             FHIT             RASSFA             APC             CDKNA             MGMT             BRCA             TP             TIMP             GSTP   and           MLH   Table  The          remaining two genes            p           ARF and           RB  did not show promoter          methylation Seventyone of   primary tumors and           of   cell lines exhibited methylation Although          the patterns are similar primary tumors had a higher          frequency of methylation of           CDH and           DAPK genes as compared to cell          lines while           RARB            HIC            RASSFA            MGMT  and           TP genes had higher prevalence in          cell lines as compared to primary tumors Table  A          high frequency of promoter methylation was detected in          primary tumors for           CDH   of  tumors and           DAPK   of  tumors           RARB  and           HIC  genes were less          frequently methylated in primary tumors Other genes           FHIT            APC            CDKNA            RASSFA            BRCA            MGMT  and           TIMP  were rarely          methylated in primary CC Table  Fig                           Analyses of HPV and microsatellite          instability          Eightysix of   tumors were positive for HPV          DNA The remaining four tumors were HPV negative HPV           alone or in combination with other HPV types was found in            HPV  was found in eight  tumors          while other HPV types  different types in            tumors          Of the  primary tumors studied for promoter          methylation  tumors were also examined for          microsatellite instability MSI using  di or          tetranucleotide markers        We found  of            tumors had MSIH and  of   tumors          exhibited MSIL phenotype The remaining tumors did not          show MSI Table                           Promoter hypermethylation in relation to          histological clinical and genetic characteristics          To evaluate the relationship between promoter          hypermethylation and clinicopathologic features as well          as other genetic changes methylation status was          correlated with histology age stage and size of the          tumor clinical outcome HPV type and microsatellite          instability Table shows the results of univariate          analyses examining the associations between methylation          and these characteristics Although both squamous cell          carcinoma SCC  and adenocarcinoma AC           exhibited an overall high rate of promoter methylation          we found statistically significant differences in various          genes in these two histologic subsets Table  Promoter          methylation of the           CDH            RARB            FHIT  and           MGMT genes was noted only in SCC          whereas the AC exhibited significantly higher frequency          of promoter methylation of           HIC  in AC vs  in SCC           APC  in AC vs  in SCC          and           BRCA  in AC vs  in SCC          Table           A significant correlation was observed between the          overall frequency of methylation and the tumor stage P            Higher stage stages IIIV tumors exhibited an          increased overall frequency of promoter methylation          Table  However the differences were not          statistically significant when individual genes examined          On the other hand           RASSFA methylation was associated          with lowgrade tumors P   Tumor size has no          effect on the overall frequency of methylation Age also          has no influence on overall frequency of promoter          methylation However           RARB gene was more frequently          methylated in younger patients  in below  years          and  in above  years age P   Promoter          methylation of           APC  in patients below           years vs  in patients above  years age P           and           BRCA  in below  years and           in patients above  years P   genes were          significantly higher in older patients          In order to assess the prognostic role we also          correlated treatment response and clinical outcome with          promoter methylation The overall frequency of          methylation was higher in patients who died of cancer          DOC  as compared to those who were alive with          recurring disease or complete remission  Table           P   Although statistically not significant all          the patients whose tumors showed promoter methylation of           MGMT  tumors and           BRCA  tumors genes DOC within           months of followup after the initial diagnosis          Promoter methylation of the remaining genes did not show          such differences in relation to the outcome To assess          the role of radiation andor chemotherapy treatment on          outcome we correlated methylation with response in          patients with at least  months follow up after          treatment No significant differences in the overall          promoter methylation were found in patients with complete          remission CR compared to patients who DOC or had only          partial response PR In this group all the patients          that showed methylation of           MGMT and           BRCA genes failed to respond to          the treatment suggesting promoter methylation of these          genes may be a bad prognostic indicator Table           Promoter methylation of           RARB gene was also predicted a          worse prognosis as  of the patients with methylation          were either DOC or only partial responders compared to          only  patients with CR exhibited methylation of this          gene Table           Table summarizes the results from multivariate Cox          Survival models Overall after adjusting for age          treatment tumor size stage and HPV type neither total          number of methylated genes nor presence of methylation of          each specific gene were statistically significantly          related to survival However methylation of  genes did          suggest a doubling            RASSFA and           MGMT  or tripling            BRCA  of risk compared to those          who did not have these genes methylated These          differences were not statistically significant due to          small number of tumors analyzed and need to be confirmed          using a larger sample size          Type of HPV infection had no association with the          status of promoter methylation Table  Although the          MSI phenotype also had no significant correlation with          overall promoter methylation the           HIC P   and           APC P   genes were          frequently methylated in patients exhibiting MSIH          phenotype Table                           CDH and RARB expression in CIN          To examine the role of           CDH and           RARB genes in CC progression we          carried out immunohistochemical analysis in  CIN          specimens Nine lowgrade and  highgrade None of the          lowgrade CINs showed downregulated expression while          only  of   showed absent or reduced expression          suggesting that           CDH inactivation is a later event          in CC development The expression pattern of RARB in          normal epithelium is complex since the staining          intensities are highly variable between nuclear and          cytoplasmic compartments There was no normal epithelium          to evaluate the expression in most CIN cases studied          However all the cases that we evaluated for RARB          immunoreactivity showed some positive mesenchymal cells          We evaluated the intensity of nuclear staining in           cases of paraffinembedded tissues One  of the          nine lowgrade CINs showed decreased nuclear expression          whereas   of  evaluable highgrade CIN lesions          showed complete lack of nuclear expression Fig  If          confirmed the downregulated RARB expression in          highgrade CINs suggests that this occurs early in          progression and plays a role in the development of          CC                          Gene expression is down regulated by promoter          hypermethylation and reactivated by demethylation          To examine the biological role of promoter methylation          in CC we assessed the levels of mRNA by          semiquantitative RTPCR in eight cell lines and compared          with the respective control values obtained from the          averages calculated from  normal cervix after          normalization against           ACTB  This analysis was performed          on  genes            CDH            DAPK            RARB            HIC            MGMT            RASSFA            and MLH  that exhibited          methylation in one or more cell lines and primary tumors          Fig            RARB gene showed either complete          absence of or down regulated expression in all cell lines           methylated and  unmethylated Of the six cell lines          with           RARB gene methylated three HT          MS and ME exhibited reactivation upon treatment          with Aza deoxycytidine or nbutyrate alone or the          combination of the two Three cell lines CI CaSki          and SW that had promoter methylation of           RARB did not reactivate expression          after treatment with these drugs Fig  One of the two          unmethylated cell lines also reactivated the expression          of           RARB           The           CDH gene exhibited a complete          absence of expression in one cell line SW that          showed promoter hypermethylation and two other cell lines          CA and SiHa without evidence of methylation Fig           The SW cell line with methylation and one of the          two unmethylated cell lines showed reactivated expression          upon treatment with Aza deoxycytidine or in          combination with nbutyrate but not with nbutyrate          alone The remaining five cell lines neither showed          evidence of decreased mRNA nor any effect of          demethylating or HDACinhibiting agents on expression          levels          The           DAPK gene showed a complete absence          of expression in five and down regulated expression in          one of the  CC cell lines studied Fig  Of the six          cell lines with down regulated expression  had promoter          methylation and  had unmethylated promoter of the           DAPK gene Both methylated cell          lines HT and SiHa and three CA MS and          ME of the four unmethylated cell lines showed          reactivation upon exposure to Aza deoxycytidine or          in combination with nbutyrate One of the unmethylated          cell lines SW that showed a complete absence of          expression did not reactivate after treatment          The           HIC gene was methylated in  of           cell lines Three of the methylated cell lines CI          SiHa and ME and one of the three unmethylated cell          lines MS showed down regulated expression Treatment          of Aza deoxycytidine or nbutyrate alone or the          combination of both activated gene expression in all the          cell lines whether or not promoter had detectable          methylation Fig           The           RASSFA gene was methylated in           cell lines and all three showed a complete lack of          expression None of the unmethylated cell lines showed          evidence of downregulated expression of           RASSFA mRNA Two of three cell          lines with           RASSFA methylation and complete          lack of expression reactivated upon treatment with          Aza deoxycytidine alone or in combination with          nbutyrate One of the methylated cell lines HT          however did not reactivate gene expression after          treatment The unmethylated cell lines showed normal          expression and the treatment had no effect on          expression                    MGMT was methylated in two cell          lines One of the two methylated cell lines CaSki          showed a complete absence of expression while the other          methylated cell line SW showed normal levels of          expression Treatment with demethylating and          deacetylating inhibitor did not activate the expression          in any cell line regardless of promoter methylation           MLH gene was methylated in one          cell line SW but we found no evidence of          downregulated expression in this cell line data not          shown                            Discussion        Genetic alterations play an important role in the        development of CC       Our extensive molecular        analyses identified a number of specific genetic changes in        invasive CC and its precursor lesions                  However epigenetic alteration in cervical        tumorigenesis is not well characterized      In the        present study we identified an overall methylation in         CC cases Previous studies by Dong et al  and        Virmani et al  have also reported a similar overall        high frequency of promoter methylation      We        identified promoter methylation in  cases in         CDH          DAPK  and         RARB genes while it was less        frequent  cases in         HIC          FHIT          RASSFA  and         APC genes in CC patients The        promoters of         CDKNA          MGMT          BRCA          TP          TIMP          GSTP  and         MLH genes were rarely         cases methylated                CDH is the most commonly methylated        gene in the present study showing promoter methylation in         of CC cases Dong and coworkers have shown earlier        that the         CDH promoter is methylated in  of        invasive CC     Ecadherin         CDH  is a major adhesion component        of epithelial cells which plays an important role as an        invasion suppressor gene Loss of function of         CDH gene has been shown to occur in        widespread of epithelial tumor types by mutational or        promoter hypermethylation mechanisms      We have        also identified loss of expression of         CDH gene in  of CC cell lines        analyzed Thus these data suggest that inactivation of the                CDH gene by promoter methylation        plays a major role in CC tumorigenesis However our        immunohistochemical analysis of Ecadherin protein showed        no evidence of decreased expression in precursor CIN        lesions Therefore these data indicate that the        methylation of         CDH gene is a late event in the        development of CC                DAPK gene is methylated in         cases in the present study Dong and coworkers also        previously showed promoter methylation in  of CC                    DAPK is a positive mediator of the        programmed cell death induced by gammainterferon            Loss of         DAPK expression has been shown to        occur in a number of human malignancies primarily by        promoter hypermethylation     It has also been shown        that loss of         DAPK gene expression was associated        with aggressive and metastatic phenotype in many tumor        types     In the present study in addition to showing        high frequency of promoter methylation of         DAPK gene we found a complete lack        of expression in two of the methylated cell lines and four        of  unmethylated cell lines Thus our results suggest        that loss of expression occurs in CC cell lines by        mechanism other than complete promoter methylation        Therefore our data further suggest a role for         DAPK in CC tumorigenesis        The third most commonly methylated gene in the present        study is         RARB  A previous study also has        reported promoter methylation in  of invasive CC and         and  of low and highgrade CIN lesions        respectively     These authors suggest that         RARB methylation is an early event in        multistage cervical carcinogenesis Our semiquantitative        analysis of         RARB gene expression by RTPCR showed        downregulated expression in all the eight cell lines        analyzed whether or not the promoter methylated Fig         In addition our immunohistochemical analysis of RARB        showed lack of expression in  of highgrade CINs It has        been reported that         RARB mRNA is down regulated in a        number of tumor types     including cervical cancer            Taken together these data support the concept that         RARB play an important role early in        cervical cancer progression The direct role of         RARB in regulating gene expression        and its retinoidmediated antiproliferative        differentiative immunomodulatory and apoptoticinducing        properties may offer a therapeutic target in the future for        CC treatment            As reported in a previous study we also found promoter        methylation of         HIC in  of CC             HIC is a zinc finger transcription        factor that is transcriptionally silenced by promoter        methylation in several types of human cancer            Heterozygous         Hic mouse with promoter methylation        of wild type allele develop carcinomas sarcomas and        lymphomas suggesting that this gene acts as a tumor        suppressor gene             HIC gene was down regulated in        majority of the CC cell lines examined by us and this        downregulated expression was reactivated upon treatment        with demethylating and HDACinhibiting agents These        results support the tumor suppressor role of         HIC and its inactivation by promoter        methylation in CC may be a critical epigenetic change in        tumor development        The present methylation profile of CC identified        significant differences in the methylated genes between SCC        and AC We found that methylation of         HIC          APC  and         BRACA genes was more common in AC        while         CDH promoter methylation was seen        only in SCC Such differences in the two major histologies        have also been reported previously for         DAPK          HIC  and         APC genes     However we found         CDH promoter methylation restricted        to SCC in the present study while Dong et al found        methylation in both histological types     This        difference may be due to small number of AC patients we        studied Distinct patterns of promoter methylation between        SCC and AC however suggest that epigenetic pathways of        tumor suppression may be different in these histologic        subtypes Contrary to the previous reports we found a low        frequency of         pCDKNA gene promoter methylation               The reason for these differences is        currently unclear        Our statistical correlative analysis of promoter        methylation with clinicopathologic parameters HPV type        and microsatellite instability identified significant        associations A most significant finding was that overall        promoter hypermethylation is associated with the        progression and predicts significantly poor diseasefree        survival This was most evident in         BRCA and         MGMT genes where all the patients        with promoter methylation were dead Table  The        multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that promoter        methylation is an independent predictor of outcome for         BRCA fold risk and         MGMT  fold risk genes Promoter        methylation of cancerrelated genes has been reported to        predict patient prognosis for a number of genes                     BRCA plays a critical role in DNA        repair and recombination cell cycle checkpoint control        and transcription This gene has been shown to be        hypermethylated in tumors arising from breastovarian        cancer syndrome     Although we detected complete        promoter methylation of         BRCA gene in only  of primary        tumors other mechanisms that inactivate this gene might        exist The present MSP data and its relation to poor        clinical outcome warrants a further study of         BRCA role in CC         MGMT gene encodes        OmethylguanineDNA methyltransferase and this enzyme        effectively removes DNA adducts formed by alkylating agents            Epigenetic gene silencing of         MGMT confers enhanced sensitivity to        alkylatingbased chemotherapy and lack of methylation        associates with failure to respond to chemotherapy             On the contrary all patients that had         MGMT promoter methylation were dead        within  months of initial diagnosis which predicts a        poor prognosis A possible explanation for this failure to        respond may be that all the four patients in the present        study were treated only with radiotherapy with or without        combination of surgery The standard treatment for        advancedstage cervix cancer has been the combination of        radical surgery and radiotherapy     The utility of        cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with advanced CC has        been recognized recently     Thus the epigenetic gene        silencing of         MGMT  although in a small        proportion may serve as indicator of responsiveness to        treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs that cause DNA        adducts in CC        Most patients in the present study population were        treated with traditional radiation and surgery treatment        protocols To assess the impact of promoter methylation on        treatment we compared the patients followed for more than         months after treatment This analysis suggests that         RARB methylation predict a worse        prognosis P   Twelve of the   patients with         RARB methylation were DOC or did not        respond to the current treatment while only  of the          patients with         RARB methylation exhibited complete        response Since         RARB functions as a tumor suppressor        gene and its chemopreventive effects are purely based on        retinoid induced reactivation the patients that received        radiation therapy will have no effect on these tumors Our        data therefore suggest that the CC patients showing         RARB promoter methylation may benefit        from targeted chemopreventive treatment of combination of        retinoic acid demethylating and chromatin modifying        agents that reactivate the gene expression An        understanding of the exact mechanisms of         RARB loss of function in CC is        essential for such a strategy        Microsatellite instability MSI is hallmark of mismatch        repairdeficient cancers which has been observed in all        cancers arising from Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal        Cancer HNPCC syndrome some sporadic colorectal and other        cancers     MSI is generally associated with germline        mutations in one of two MMR genes         hMLH and         hMSH  Epigenetic inactivation of        promoter hypermethylation of         APC and         HIC also results in MSI phenotype in        sporadic colorectal cancers      Accumulating        evidence supports the view that promoter methylation of        mismatch repair genes may be related to MSI phenotype             A number of previous studies have shown the        existence of MSI phenotype in CC      In the present        study we found that MSIH occurs at an increased frequency        in tumors with         HIC and         APC promoter hypermethylation        Association of         APC promoter methylation with MSI        phonotype has been previously reported in endometrial        cancer     Although the significance of these results        is currently unclear we believe that inactivation of these        genes by promoter methylation causes microsatellite        instability and may contribute to the development of        CC        Aberrant promoter methylation changes that occur in        cancer are associated with transcriptional repression and        loss of function of the methylated gene     Since we        found evidence of downregulated expression of several        methylated genes in CC cell lines we tested to see if this        downregulation could be reactivated by methylation and        HDACinhibiting agents Transcriptional silencing of genes        resulting from DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is        reversed by treatment with the hypomethylating agent        azadeoxycytidine and HDACinhibiting agent nbutyrate        in a dose and durationdependent manner We found that        Azadeoxycytidine treatment alone or in combination        with nbutyrate resulted in reactivation of gene expression        in most cell lines that showed promoter methylation In        some cell lines exposure to nbutyrate alone has resulted        in reactivation of the gene expression for example in         HIC gene Fig  These data        therefore suggest that other epigenetic mechanisms        involving defects in chromatin modification factors such as        acetylation and methylation of histone proteins may also        play role in gene silencing Thus our data also suggest        that epigenetic changes that accompany methylation are        common in CC and play critical role in CC development                    Conclusions        The present study identified promoter methylation in a        number of genes in CC The most frequently methylated genes        were         CDH          DAPK          RARB  and         HIC  We have also shown that        promoter methylation of these genes result in        transcriptional repression Furthermore         RARB gene expression is down        regulated in highgrade CINs These data suggest that some        of the methylated genes may play a role early in the        progression of cancer Here we showed that promoter        methylation is associated with advanced stage of the        disease         RARB and         BRCA promoter methylation predict a        worse prognosis and the         HIC and         APC promoter methylation is        frequently associated with MSI This knowledge of        epigenetic changes in CC may have implications in our        understanding of the role they play in CC development        Particularly if the present results are replicated and        identified in precancerous lesions this may be useful in        predicting the highrisk lesions to progression and serve        as targets of treatment                    Methods                  Patients Tumor tissues and cell
