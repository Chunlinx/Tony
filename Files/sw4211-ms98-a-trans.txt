        okay uh well what do you think is there something wrong with public schools     well im not so that i am not willing to send my kids to them   oh is that right uhhuh   yeah now thats partly because i want my children to have a religious education uh which a public school can not and should not   uhhuh uhhuh   offer uh but its also because   right you feel they get a better education   i fill that theyll get a better education i fill that i have more control over uh the type of social pressure that they get expose to because i can choose   umhum   you know if the kinds of essential not only am i choosing the kind of schooling that theyre getting but i am also choosing the other kinds of children who are going to be there because       it works both you know because not only am i doing this but presuming the other parents are doing the same thing   right right they have the same motivation for sending their children their well i think there is a problem with with the public school education system and i   yeah yeah   i think it is demonstrating by the fact so many people uh graduating from high school and cant even uh perform some simple uh math problems and uh or or even read a a decent uh book uh or geography i mean some of them cant even identify the states United States or various places in the world so i think that we are sending uh some some children out into the world with a very poor education foundation and i think that the problem started when the National Education Association stop being for education and really became more of a labor union and only put their main entrance in teachers pay like education like money was the the solution to every thing   yeah   i think that the i think the answer is something what you are doing right now i think that a voucher system or some competition between schools to give uh parents a choice of where they send their children to schools and allowing   yeah   uh the school to compete with one another the become better i think that is the American way   well i think i i think that that works too uh you know i i sometimes wonder there a a school system near me that they actually a fairly good one what theyve done is they had one school that was because of the neighborhood the neighborhood school system basic the school system basically and they put their talented and gifted program in the poorest school district you know the or the poorest poorest elementary district that was part of this larger district   uhhuh right   and um they allowed any of those neighborhood children who wanted to stay there to stay and then they didnt it wasnt that they had the talented and gifted program just housed in this building   umhum   all of the classes were based on talented and gifted and all the kids were treated the same way and as a result this is now the best school in the school district which is really kind of interesting   thats uhhuh umhum a magnetic school   well its essentially a magnetic school thats right but its also a neighborhood school you know and the neighborhood there are some of the neighborhood kids who cant manage and the talented and gifted program because   uhhuh   and i think its more case of you know there are some children in this world who i accuse of perhaps  you know and and they just       not only can not compete they simple didnt you know those kids really felt uncomfortable but the majority of kids if theyre taught the way that they teach talented and gifted kids it turns out the majority of kids really are that way   right umhum   you know each one a little bit different but each one has a lot to offer so thats a public school that works but then there are other public schools in that same district that really dont work   umhum   and and unfortunately even that school although it seems to be working academically has some um some real race problems that uh which is real unfortunate because most of the kids who comes in are white and most of the kids who are there are black or   uhhuh i think part of the problem with the education system really isnt the education system but it really has to do with the loss of the family structure in the United States and the loss values of uh you know the guidance that went along with the stable family structure isnt isnt there for all the kids like it use to be   yeah yeah i think you right i think you right and i think that a caring teacher can do a lot to change that but then you are not talking about is it a public school is it a private school is it you talking about you know are you and the kids are going to be lucky enough to hit the teacher who can get home
