                 now what was your first name again   Bob   Bob okay uh how how do you feel about uh gun control Bob   its its kind of like abortion its kind of a touchy subject but um i i feel that   yeah it is   any person is uh has the right to be armed but i dont think they should have an arsenal   yeah   i dont believe in uh automatic weapons i dont believe in in uh having antitank guns and um i i theres just theres just too many uh weapons around   yeah uh i kind of i agree i guess i dont i dont think that we need uh um these these automatic or semiautomatic rifles even i mean i dont really even care that the i dont know if you hunt or not but i dont even care that some of the hunters say they they like them i mean   no im im not   that you know uh maybe they use them for legitimate purposes but theyre all you know folks are getting them and using them for not so legitimate to say the least   yeah no   purposes what do you feel about uh um how do you feel about a waiting period   i yeah i think thats a a good thing in in the sense that it um it stops someone that is acting on a impulse however uh anyone that has a revenge factor in mind is is going to weight that out   right   um most um Dallas has if you read in the papers recently um the um uh murder ratio in Dallas one point uh seven i think per day   uhhuh   uh and ninety somewhat percent of these know uh the perpetrator its its not its not criminals that are going out and killing people   yeah   it its people with guns that are that are shooting other people   yeah its probably not someone thats running down to the store and buying one either is it probably someone whos got one already yeah   no someone thats got one and and and for some reason whatever um they became uh enraged or you know it uh some of these are somebodys dating somebodys uh girl friend or exwife or um a person that they know and and its its again something that you know its its a uh its a decision of uh emotion not um its not something you can really control usually i dont think you can   uhhuh   i dont think you can regulate it if they dont use a gun maybe theyll use a knife   hm yeah yeah i mean yeah i dont know if i mean yeah if someone wants to do someone in theyre gonna do it whether they have a gun or not uh what do you think about that um that uh   sure   deal with the police officer evidently evidently um i guess they speculate that it was teenagers that that somehow got a hold of a gun   well yeah yeah yeah and and you look at the you know drive by shootings and things like that with with young uh people involved its its its a very volatile situation its a funny world that we live in   yeah i i we just moved here about eight or nine months ago from from uh a little town in North Carolina   umhum   and uh we have lived in Fort Worth before and and in Houston for a while so we were you know were accustomed to the big city but my kids werent in in the age they are now theyre in uh high school and junior middle school   umhum   and the middle the high schools around here um man police have come in and and uh you know they got they raid the school and take out ten revolvers you know i mean its just uh   yeah sure   so it seems like um you know it seems like and no and thats not a case of someone flipping out and running down and buying one so a waiting period isnt gonna help that but it seems like that there ought to be something that could be done  to at least make it harder for those kids to get their hands on guns   well that thats parental control   yeah   and and thats you know that extends beyond guns that extends to drugs and everything else that that is bad in our society and and we dont have the we dont have the parental control that that we need   yeah thats true   thats thats a theres theres theres no deterrent um there really isnt and and youre not going to stop uh guns from being on the streets again if they dont use a gun theyll use something else and and then you take away the fact that uh somebody has a right to protect their property
