                well i i been uh ive probably had more time than you have to think about this subject so ill tell you is is it a serious problem yes i do believe its a serious problem however there are solutions to it   umhum yeah umhum umhum   and foremost uh where we compare we that we are now doing fifty percent of our uh people are voting uh were probably making a comparison against uh some European and uh and uh uh say newer republics that uh that have very high percentages   umhum umhum   uh so uh one of the reasons that that uh one one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the United States is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays and then we further complicate it by saying you know well keep the polls open until eight oclock   what right   most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they wont be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up   right   my solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now   oh really they hold it on the weekends   they hold it on the week no they hold it on a either a Saturday or a Sunday or at least a day when when uh a great number of people arent working in in America thats not true because a a great number of people work on Sundays   Sunday uhhuh huh well uh   but but thats one of my solutions so   i i know here in Dallas that theyve just instituted in the last couple of years a um a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections and they i dont think theyve seen a really high improvement   have you absentee voted in in in Texas well i have absentee voted in uh New Hampshire and its a fairly fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot   no no i always vote oh really   i dont say its that complicated but part of the process also is that you must register preregister at some particular point New Hampshire is fairly easy but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh   hum to absentee vote specifically   well to vote to vote to just vote so registrations are perhaps a a problem also and were the mobile mobile society uh people are always mobile you know one out of every seven people moves every year   oh umhum   uh thats almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know if you compound that that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote   umhum but  i dont think its difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their they   well   their voice is heard i mean and the people that ive talked to   well maybe thats another factor the motivational factor the motivational factor is probably i   right i think that is the biggest one thats the biggest problem i   well thats diminished by we weve noticed this in particular i im just read two books one of them is Whose Stars and Stripes Now   umhum   the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty eight its a fairly decent book i mean its uh   oh really hum   its preceded by uh several other books by these guys uh Wake Me Up When Its Over was about the eighty four elections and i forget what the other books were but any case uh it it its uh       uh the  uh uh there was the Blue Smoke and Mirrors was the one in eighty two uh they these guys uh have taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections in any case they say that uh theres a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting its the only way that you can use television effectively   i dont understand that why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public and the publics um gullibility   no the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than uh than than a positive factor and you and you know to if you if you go on the attack and and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign and its not refuted people will you know uh believe it if you dont refute it as he didnt that that there must be some truth to the matter see   well he did refute it he he refuted it just wasnt effective enough to   well he didnt refute it until the last two weeks of the campaign he didnt believe anybody would believe that and indeed his trend started upward   well that see i i didnt believe anybody would believe that either i i i guess i have i have a hard time coming to terms with the the fact that the American public really   well they do   was you know so   well dont give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability and and and it     well then how can a democracy work then how how can it work   well it uh well i dont know is it working i mean thats thats the question i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they dont throw rascals out everybody seems disappointed but they dont throw the rascal out their own rascal   right right   uh my my solution to to part of this is is to to make it an economic economic incentive for people to vote that sounds rather crass i think because then then youre saying well uh   what     you know you  it could be convoluted convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them i mean you know you take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever   huh   but that it would be very difficult to administer because im sure that any time money and votes are involved it just the whole thing just stinks   well how about how about the reverse of that when ive heard about Englands elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks even for the higher offices in the in the land what if we totally took money out of the campaign made just severely limited the campaigns so money wasnt so much of an issue i feel like if if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count   yeah but the idea is to get the individual to the polls and and and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls   i dont think i dont care how easy it is for them i dont think theyre going to because they dont think that their that anybody listens to their vote they think whoever has the bucks they really think that the packs you know no matter what youre promised during a campaign and these days were promised hardly anything of substance right   oh you mean the special interest groups   and uh and uh yeah no matter what a uh candidate promises during the campaign which isnt very much specific any that they dont promise anything specific these days but whatever youre promised they just they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office i mean i think thats the   well read my lips and and and no new taxes and yet Bush did that but i mean but but hes excused from that generally people ive read polls now where theyve excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget   yeah yeah   well then why did he say that during his campaign then he should it was totally   oh he he he gave it that he he did he did he promised the best he could and hes the president and he should he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will   yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well   but i think its uh i mean i think you       you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters and hes motivated because we happ en to be the cradle of liberty and all that i think voters are motivated uh   what about what about voters in the other countries that youre talking about like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts and well the newer democracies because its going to be totally different but   well i dont know if they have higher turnouts overall i dont think England has i think England has about a seventy percent sixty five percent turn out   you dont think so uhhuh   i think that we just discovered in this in in the Indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the in the world   oh   uh just it was got violent more violent every year they went down to almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up Gandhi but   right oh really     simply because people were so concerned about   yeah   their inability that to that their vote doesnt count anyway   hum   and the corruption of politics in in in that situation but then but you know everything is relative to when uh  you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we  talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right   yeah   i mean is but but before these enormous before this Voting Rights Act what we had was a a great deal of our population uh mainly the Blacks in the South and the Hispanics were precluded by   umhum oh   by uh voting laws uh from registering from their eligibility to register now everybodys available   oh   so if you really computed it they probably when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout because all the eligible voters   oh i see because right werent qualified disqualified were disqualified   you know the it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of   but isnt that isnt that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the Blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just dont vote or is that just the the truth   no i think the high theres a higher percentage in in certain Black areas of voters i dont know about Hispanics you know   yeah   i just i i mean i havent studied the statistics well enough to i mean i think in this sort of a   well   conversation we can only do our own reactions   right right but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in Dallas last year they have this huge fight going over redistricting here and at one point they did they took another vote on it   umhum   and they uh the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to to pass their plan and this is something that had been going on for months it was on the news every night they and they have had lawsuits over it i mean it was it was a major issue and there still wasnt enough minority vote to get to pass the plan that they were backing so thats you you know i think that you have really hit on something there to say that uh those   what do you mean   well with the minorities and were saying we have low voter turnout maybe it is is uh now that we have minorities included in the   you know Karen i wonder if we are recording   why did you not press one   i did press one but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up
