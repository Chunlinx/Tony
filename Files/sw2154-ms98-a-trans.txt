              normally i listen to CNN or Headline News about an hour a day and then i supplement that with uh radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week   do you   and a newspaper if i have time   yeah i dont usually have time to read the newspaper everyday so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening i always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the the weeks hot events so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else   thats true and and how do you rate the uh how are you pleased with the news coverage that youre receiving   for for local news i think we do real well where its we live in a kind of small town but i think we get excellent local coverage um and i like the national news that we see we we watch NBC and i think they do a real good job so im ive been real pleased with the quality of the news we get how about you   on the whole im pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves um since i dont necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite   right   uh i think im fed up with trite there seems to be more and more of it and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations and as as expensive as they are to produce they certainly dont want any dead airspace   uhhuh yeah but i think theres enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries because im going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions i dont really need their help to do that   i  i were certainly in agreement there   i dont think radio is as bad to do that as TV is   uh radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done theyre maybe theyre a little more efficient   umhum   or have more to do over that same time frame i dont know which that answer is   right   uh i think the my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like Sixty Minutes do you watch that   i used to but i dont anymore maybe once or twice a year   well i used to watch Sixty Minutes until they did two programs uh that i knew both the people and the incidences incidences   uhhuh   and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint   really   that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings   yes   and it ever since that time i just dont watch uh so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not   yeah well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what Sixty Minutes presented and that they didnt present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with so i started questioning just how how bias they really were so   i dont know did i dont know how old you are but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite   hum   so i dont i dont know if youre familiar with him or not   no not really you know in the last few years just his kind of informal segments ive seen but i never got to see his actual nightly news i liked i i did grow up with David Brinkley   well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold   uh uhhuh   of Cronkite and he did a a pretty good job The Huntley Brinkley Report was quite excellent over the years   yeah we we used to watch um him and i guess John Chancellor and i always liked David Brinkley and i and i used to enjoy John Chancellors style of reporting but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and thats where i get get into the problem with with him i frequently disagree with his commentaries so   well once theyve reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore   right what did you think of the news coverage of the war   well i almost felt like it was too much indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening   umhum   uh   i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst   really   and i dont need their fillins you know     did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military did   yes but i i think it helps me everyday in trying to review what the state that the world is in and try to guess where were going   i wondered if it would help you sometimes fillin the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on   well i i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with Sixty Minutes   okay what weekly um magazine do you look at is it   i like US News and World Report at one time or another ive taken them all for a year i believe in giving anything a chance   uhhuh sure   uh but i keep coming back to that one so i thats kind of my favorite   does it give a pretty good overview of everything or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories   its primarily um a few big stories and then lots of highlevel reports   yeah   uh heres what went on in Asia over the past week and theres maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories   that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick   uh it too is one those you know  in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways and i do most of my reading in the bathroom   right   um and its one of those that i can either read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that im going to spend in there   right   and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days   well were working on a Newsweek uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory sub scription so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like Glamour or Sports Illustrated so we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us so to speak   well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway   it cant hurt     well anytime that we stop and think it cant hurt     no i i even i enjoy reading T News i try to catch it because its another example they just they just show you the words and the facts and they they dont offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we dont listen to the radio at work at all so i dont like to go the whole day without hearing anything   oh im with you i have to check T News every everyday its my noontime dose of facts   yeah and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that   no   you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you um updated information so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and its its offered through the local phone company free of charge   hum   so thats an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use   well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that   it it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think its its catching on throughout the country
