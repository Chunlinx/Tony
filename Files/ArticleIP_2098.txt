                                 William Bennett Gays and the Truth            This is tough news Itsnot pleasant to hear said former Education Secretary William Bennett on ABCsThis Week Nov  But its very important and its part of telling thetruth The occasion for toughbutneeded truth telling Bill Clintonsfirstever presidential speech to an organized gayrights group the HumanRights Campaign Clinton had conferred respectabilitywronglyon the gayquest for approval when in fact said Bennett he should tell the truth onthis one Homosexuality takes  years off your life The average lifeexpectancy for gay men Bennett declared was just             Many a mothers heart aroundthe country must have sunk at that moment amid premonitions that she wouldoutlive her son A wellknown public figure would think twice before deliveringtidings that grim right And Bennetts statistic was no slip Only days laterin the Nov  Weekly Standard  he repeated the assertion phrased formaximum emphasis            The bestavailable research suggests that the average life span of male homosexuals isaround  years of age Fortythree  Italics his            Yes its a sensational arresting number which may soonpass into general circulation Already for example the National               Review has repeated it unskeptically in an editorial Where did thefigure come from and how plausible is it            Bennettgot the number from Paul Cameron a researcher well known to followers of gaycontroversies Cameron a former assistant professor at the University ofNebraska who has consulted for such gayrights opponents as former Rep WilliamDannemeyer RCalif heads a group called the Family Research InstituteCameron resigned under fire from the American Psychological Association and waslater formally terminated from membership following complaints about hisresearch methods He has had runins with other professional groups includingthe Nebraska Psychological Association and the American SociologicalAssociation According to Mark Pietrzyks expos in the Oct   NewRepublic  the state of Colorado initially hired Cameron as an expertwitness to defend its statute restricting gayrights ordinances then electednot to use his testimony after it got a closer look His lifespan figures havecirculated for years in religiousright circles but Bennetts comments appearto represent their first real breakout into wider public discussion            Camerons method had the virtue of simplicityat least He and two coauthors read through back numbers of various urban gaycommunity papers mostly of the giveaway sort that are laden with bar ads andpersonals They counted up obituaries and news stories about deaths noted theages of the deceased computed the average and published the resulting numbersas estimates of gay life expectancy            What do vitalstatisticsbuffs think of this technique Nick Eberstadt at the American EnterpriseInstitute sums up the reactions of several of his fellow demographers Themethod as you describe it is just ridiculous But you dont have to be atrained statistician to spot the fallacy at its heart which is to quoteCenters for Disease Control and Prevention statistician John Karon thatyoure only getting the ages of those who die Gay men of the same generationdestined to live to old age even if more numerous wont turn up in thesample            Othercritics rattle off further objections The deaths reported in these papersmostly AIDS deaths will tend to represent the community defined by such papersor directly known to their editors It will include relatively more subjectswho live in town and are overtly gay and relatively few who blend into thesuburbs and seldom set foot in bars It will overrepresent those whose passingstrikes others as newsworthy and underrepresent those who end their days inretired obscurity in some sunny clime            Bennett is a busy man but even he has access to the backof an envelope A moments thought might have suggested a few simple testcalculations Suppose he assumeswildly pessimistically given currentincidence datathat half the gay male population is destined to catch the AIDSvirus and die of it The actual average age of AIDS patients at death has beenabout  Presumably protease inhibitors will extend average longevity butthat will only increase Bennetts difficulty For the number  to be the trueaverage death age for the entire population of gay males HIVnegative gay menwould on average have to keel into their graves at  Looked at another wayif even half the gay male population stays HIVnegative and lives to an averageage of  an average overall life span of  implies that gay males with AIDSdie at an implausibly early average age  actually            Againstthis Cameron and his supporters argue that according to their survey ofobits even if they dont have AIDS homosexual males tend to die bytheir mids and lesbians by their late s Some downright peculiar resultsfollowed from this inference One is thatcontrary to the opinion of virtuallyeveryone else in the worldAIDS in fact hasnt reduced gay males lifeexpectancy by that mucha few years at most Moreover the obits alsorecorded lots of violent and accidental deaths From this Cameron and companyconcluded not that newsworthy deaths tend to get into newspapers but that gaysmust experience shockingly high rates of violent death With a perfectlystraight face they report for example that lesbians are at least  timesmore likely to die in car crashes than females of similar ages in general            Unfortunately there really is no satisfactorymeasure of actual life expectancy among gay men However Harry Rosenberg themortalitystatistics chief at the National Center for Health Statistics sayshes unaware of evidence that HIVnegative gays have a lower life expectancythan other males Rosenberg also points to one reason to think the HIVnegativegay male may actually live longer on average than the straight male Gays mayhave higher incomes and more education on average than straightstwo factorspowerfully correlated with longer life spans Bennett himself appears to sharethis view terming gays as a group wealthy and well educated            Challenged by the HumanRights Campaigns Elizabeth Birch in the letters column of the Dec Standard  Bennett remarkably dug in to defend the Cameron numberswhich he said coincided with the views of other authorities such aspsychiatrist  Satinovers  book Homosexuality and the Politics ofTruth  does discuss gay life spans but cites as its authority Camerons study In other words Bennett is not adducing a second authority forhis assertions but merely falling back on the first via its recycling byanother writer            Throughout the controversyBennett has made much of the cause of truth with a capital T HisStandard article portentously titled Clinton Gays and the Truthaccused the Clintonites of scanting that important commodity Bennett is rightto the extent that theres no excuse for telling falsehoods in the course ofraising otherwise legitimate issues He should mind his own lesson
