turned from the video screens to see you on the way outThe Baby ThinksWhered Ana K goIs this another one of the learning experiences I am expected toundergoto suffer I guess the reason babies my age have millions ofextra neurons is so we can learn I suppose that as a neonate I hadlittle choice in what happened to me and must have felt breast warmthwetness fullness without clear ideas of internal vs external originsDo I need to repeat Lacan here cf the symbolic stage wPiagetssensorimotor stage of functional recognition eg recognition thatsomething is for drinking or for wetnessShe waddles over to the table and pulls a disposable diaper out of aMinnie Mouse tote bag Lying on her back on the floor she pulls off herused Pamper and replaces it with the fresh oneOh the joy of zinc ozide she burbles Although Ive never seen apenis I expect its like carrying around a faucet Ive having a timefinding the muscles to pee as it is Im operating the circular reflexan outgoing impulse eg leading to the contraction of a musclefollowed not mainly by the satisfaction ofneed but rather by some incoming sensory impulse eg in the eyeurethra etc Pressing down the selfadhesive flaps she sits upbottle still in her mouth and musesNow however my babyhood seems to require concentrated efforts toconstruct myself learning to be me seeing hearing talking andwalking I begin to take pleasure in operating the circular reflex toproduce interesting spectaclesBabysized mentations of accomplishment frustration satisfactiondeprivation attach themselves to the sensations and form the bases of mylove anger etc But the way they grow has to mean that what I willlearn to call emotions are very dense mixtures of sensation andinterpretation in narrative form I feel sad because X happened Xhappened because Y did Z to me or I did Z to Y Someday I will knowthat Noam Chomsky says innate human grammar requires subject verb andusually objectthat our human brains are wired to view and thus to talkabout the world in this wayalthough not necessarily in this orderHere adult Freudians will be bound to object Baby you are conflatingorganic brain with functional mind I dismiss this as reifying a purelymental phenomenon plus its too confounding for my developmental stageInstead I will consider a feeling I have begun to feel now I am sadAn explanation will arise very quickly I feel sad because I am sure bythen I will be able to imagine some causal relationship between my bodymy bottle and the disappearance of Ana K Im reminded of previoustimes I have felt sad and I will connect them into a series by way ofthe synaptic corridors they pass through The sadness itself willalready be an explanation of a somatic sensation or mental phenomenonSensations are on my skin or the virtual skin emotions arealreadyprocessed sensations or mental phenomena SMP  pleasuresatisfaction warmth ie security  feeling OK Wet diaper disappeared person  insecurity  feeling badShe stumbles the bottle between her hands held up to release thelast dropsI have to say parenthetically that this new stuff in the bottleaffects the feel of things in a big wayEven now my feeling OK is associated with events and people gottalove them or want them or hate or fear them These associations willbecome progressively more elaborate as I accumulate more experienceSoon I can say I feel I am cold and contemptuous of others because I amafraid to experience their rejection of me or I love him because hemakes me feel secure and confident and wanted The explanations willnot particularly help in feeling better if one feels bad converselytrying to feel good will not seem to be enhanced by good explanationsI will live through years of therapists encouraging me to experience mypsychic wounds my feelings with the idea that I can achieve a state ofbeing in which pain can be experienced without debilitatingconsequencesI will ask now while I have extra synapses isnt it the narrativeitself that inscribes the scars on our

regarding the seeminguniqueness of our own Dr Martin Rees of Cambridge and the AstronomerRoyal says contemplating alternate universes could help scientistsdistinguish which features of our own

this a lucky universe or whatCyril In  Dr Brandon Carter a theoretical physicist at MITposited the Anthropic Principle asseverating that these coincidenceswere not just luck but were rather necessary preconditions for us to belooking at the universe After all we are hardly likely to discoverlaws that are incompatible with our own existenceVyvyan Our mission Cyril contra the lawspromulgated by fundamentalists as in Iran or the United StatesCyril How thrillingly political of you to say so Vyvyan my unicornusFreeman Dyson another physicist once said The universe in some sensemust have known we were comingVyvyan YepCyril Dr Steven Weinberg is positively Miltonic in his comments on theuniverse which he sees bubbling progeny like yeast buds According tostring theory Dr Hogan of Washington says the laws of physics that wemortals experience are lowenergy  dimensional shadows of sorts of a or dimensional universe cosmological constantAh heres a snack Im ravenously puckish Oh I thought you

toastronomical observations otherwise undetectable energydarkenergy accounts for about twothirds of the massenergy of theuniverse today outweighing matter two to one But according to modernquantum physics empty space should be seething with energy that wouldoutweigh matter in the universe by far far more by a factor of atleast Vyvyan And what to wear in dark energy So the speedingup ofinflation lends more energy than was thought to exist And thecosmological constant a formula to account for this discrepancy mustbe within ranges compatible with usCyril Just just so And as we know the logical consequence of thisis that we queers in our indolence have seen through the canard ofvulgar Marxism We live the principle that production is not the basisof human life Instead it is enjoyment

hallucinates mans predestinationfor the objective transformation of the world or for the productionof oneself todays generalized humanist themeit is no longer aquestion of being oneself but of producing oneself from consciousactivity to the primitive productions of desire Karen dials her message machine to leave this memorandum Bquotes Marx for whom men begin to distinguish themselves from animalsas soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence RememberthatShe asks Merle her Maltese Why must mans vocation always be todistinguish himself from animals Is mans existence an end for which hemust find the meansSliding back the curtain on the sidelight of the door a little Karen Bcritiques the notion of production of subsistence it is theinstrumentalization of nature She summons up Marx Labor is in thefirst place a process in which both man and nature participate and inwhich man of his own accord starts regulates and controls the materialreactions between himself and nature He opposes himself to nature asone of her own forces setting in motion arms and legs head and handsthe natural forces of his body in order to appropriate naturesproductions in a form adapted to his own wantsHow tedious Karen sighs Why cant these men see that labor is notthe basis of human existence Even Marcuse for all his slavering aftererotic freedom says labor is grounded in an essential excess of humanexistence beyond every possible situation in which it finds itself andthe world   it is necessary and eternally earlier than play itis the starting point foundation and principle of play insofar as playis precisely a breaking off from labor and a recuperation for labor But that is so wrongTaking her own version of luxury in an Henri III straightback wooden chair Karen tightens her black toque and murmursMarx doesnt see that in his symbolic exchanges primitive man sicdoes not gauge himself in relation to Nature He is not aware ofNecessity a Law that takes effect only with the objectification ofNaturePrimitive society does not exist as an instance apart from symbolicexchange and this exchange never results from an excess ofproduction It is the opposite to the extent that these terms applyhere subsistence and economic exchange are the residue of symbolicexchange a remainder Impatiently retelling her jet beads she thinks survival is not aprinciple We have made it one She remembers Africa and her otherlover Jean Baudrillard saying For the primitives eating drinkingand living are first of all acts that are exchanged if they are notexchanged they do not occur It is symbolic exchange where therelation not the social is tied and this exchange excludes anysurplus anything that cannot be exchanged or symbolically shared wouldbreak the reciprocity and institute power Better yet this exchangeexcludes all productionGood old Jean she sighs stealing from Bataille like thatThe door chimes A gorgeous young Arab rings her bell With highlystylized sincerity long eyelashes down he tells Karen he is at herservice My name is Ahmed Oedipus Ben Maas he says and for mework is something other than laborThe artisan lives his work as arelation of symbolic exchange

their tunes by virtue ofcomputer s and s the organ is manual and pedal I spend my daysscrambling through forests of big and little pipes for it is a very bigorganOne Sunday evening Im relaxing around this musty French poolreminiscing about a day in LA in  when some rich queen threw a poolparty for People With AIDS up in the hills within spitting distance ofthe Hollywood Sign Boys with purple blotches all over their backs andchests played in the sunny water while a few longtimers sat inwheelchairs wrapped in bright blankets wheeled mushrooms in big strawhats It was in that pool that I met FerdFerd was not the hosthe had no more money than it takes to buy a usedToyota pickupbut he was the big cheese because he was the director ofthe PWA group bubbling on the lawn with precious tentativejoy in thesunshine We all loved Ferd then He was healthy enough to work for ourbenefit  hours a day he was edgy enough to get our group funded atthe vanguard of sexual healing as both treatment and preventionstrategy Ferd was a little like our figurehead as we breasted thewaves our sun king as he ordered the world with and for us and alittle like a social director who under his bonhomie was transparentlyterrified of friendshipHe slid into the water next to me and we bobbed up and down smiling andcruising I trying to assure myself I was still cute and attractiveFerd called upon to concentrate so long on one person that sexual desiresnuck up on him unbiddenin fact he would later say unpermitted inhis job as director and animator of our clump of radical patients andvictims since a sexual liaison would reduce his availability tolisten handhold inspire cajole hug solace the others he thoughtin his care That afternoon he pulled himself out of the pool with aslight turgidity visible in the folds of his floppy yellow trunks andsmiled as if he expected to be back to bob some more with meHe didnt come back soon not until after I fended off a handsome guywith really bad AZT breath who I knew wasnt likely to take up with meanyway He was already twice a widow of wealthier lonelier men who lefthim houses and money for cosmetic surgery I had nothing to offer butsweaty organsWere walking next door to look at Aldous Huxleys house Ferd saidwhen he came back smelling of sunblock lime and vodka Want to comealong I did The Huxley property explained our host was really justa crater as a fire had destroyed the building where Aldous wrote andtook his LSD where Laura struggled on alone until  The HollywoodSign was so close that the OOD took up most of the view on one sideFerd started in about his acid trips He had met Leary at Millbrookonce in  he had done light shows at the Fillmore with Janis CountryJoe The Incredible String Band one of his fey favorites Sly and theFamily Stone at the Electric Circus I wish there was still acid to betaken he said now that Im not scared about blurting out Im gayto some straight hippie companionThat must have happened twenty years ago I replied Surely youvecome to terms with all of that by now After all here we are alltogether having fun living proof that God doesnt punish the wickedwith anything more than painful ugly death and stigmatized sufferingYes surely I should feel cheered by your reminder of how good we haveit Ferd said But lets dont call each other Shirley Actually Itake antidepressants now so I dont bother with scared or unhappy anymoreI think our consciousness should be altered early and often he toldme his good eye engaging mine We need to experience being withoutrelation to timeescape from a conception of a forward moving series ofevents the most senserich of which felt as the present and less richassigned to a recallable but fading past Further the brains capacityto take in and review sensory input led to the development of neuralpathways that could access and perceive or experience the occurrence ofreview and cogitate on the process itself Sensory input is reviewedthrough the same neural pathways or analogous or related or proximateones that process raw sensory input It is unclear whether the brainalways knows the difference between processing the sensory input weusually think of as perception of reality and processing the processingwhich as mirrors can reflect each other can approach infinity as sensedata become perceptions become organized ideas become abstractcategories and then categories of categories Given what little isunderstood about the brain it is not possible to say whether theseprocesses are or are not organized in hierarchies The brain may assignmore or less attention energy ranking by importance or immediacy orproximity or some other orderor notThe result of all this I think is that humans have a brain thatprocesses sensory and internal mental phenomena at too many levels toooften too much with inadequate mechanism to turn the processing offWe have brains too good for our own good we think and abstract feelingsand memories too much This ceaseless idling is what we have learned tocall our feelings however remote the neural processing may be fromsomatic reactions to events perceived as happening now Like HALour brain and by brain I keep trying to mean all the data processingmechanisms from senses to memory to thinking thinks what it does isreal What psychological literature and philosophy have alwaysconfoundedthe subject and object and later the divided subjectbecomeless compelling as explanation and certainly as a concept to provide acomfortable relation to external reality But the brain is best seenas actively seeking processing and thinking at all levelssimultaneously consciousness is a trick of our brains describing us toourselves stringing processes and events into a self asserting to usthat the self of today is the same one as any other day selecting dataand memories to substantiate itselfYeah youre right I said I never thought he was sexy after that Reception

the jug sky and earth dwell You are awake now Herr Siegfried Joseph says calmlyAhh Joseph he croaks I think I understand Kant talks aboutthings in the same way as Meister Eckhart and means by this term thingsomething that is But for Kant that which is becomes the object of arepresenting that runs its course in the selfconsciousness of the humanego The thinginitself means for Kant the objectinitself To Kantthe character of the initself signifies that the object is an objectin itself without reference to the human act of representing it thatis without the opposing ob by which it is first of all put beforethis representing act Thing initself thought in a rigorouslyKantian way means an object that is no object for us because it issupposed to stand stay put without a possible before for the humanrepresentational act that encounters it It is very materialistdespite the awful neologismsJoseph straightens Siegfrieds sparse white hair and tells him TheBuddha teaches that sense impressions can be understood as relationshipsof conscious being to being The categories of Kant only interferewith this relationship Heidegger is closerJa yes I think so He reads  This appropriating mirrorplay ofthe simple onefold of earth and sky divinities and mortals we call theworld The world presences by worlding    Joseph reads further That means the worlds worlding cannot beexplained by anything else nor can it be fathomed through anything elseThis impossibility does not lie in the inability of our human thinkingto explain and fathom n this way Rather the inexplicable andunfathomable character of the worlds worlding lies in this that causesand grounds remain unsuitable for the worlds worlding  HerrSiegfried Heidegger is saying what the Buddha saysAs soon as humancognition here calls for an explanation it fails to transcend theworlds nature and falls short of it The human will to explain justdoes not reach to the simpleness of the simple onefold of worldingThis is pretty

We could have been together Then we would have thoughtwe recognized each other togetherThe Intellectual OriginsThe thought was that repression of natural impulses was a reificationof the restriction to bare necessities for labor under capitalistrelations of production At first we noticed that abundance notnecessarily personal abundance although the postWWIICold War takeoffof the US economy afforded better living for much higher proportions ofthe US population was not satisfying to us although it seemed to besufficient for our parents who had suffered serious deprivation duringthe Depression and then horrifying war our fathers ignorant men throwntogether in foreign lands to face death with only each others bodiesfor supportwhile longing for the comfort of love and habit sent by thewomen who became our mothers in letters to unknowable islands andbivouacs Our dads came home moved into nuclear family houses fartherfrom their parents aunts uncles etc than ever before tried to

length of the columns ofsandstone carved into the living rock by the NatabeansAbra was the daughter of the brilliant psychiatrist Abraham Maslow whoworshiped the motherless girlsome said he set her on a pyramid aboveall the rest of womanhood Her education was a strange one based inMaslows reading of the life of John Stuart Mill Abra read Heraclitusin Greek and Lucretius in Latin by age five and besides her fathersGerman and English she also was versed in preMohammedan Arabic Notcontent with degrees in Pythagorean geometry and Khwarizmi algebraAbra was also a famous hostess and cook Her salonand her parties at the Dakota during the war years attracted RuthBenedict Margaret Mead and Tallulah Bankhead uncorking fine vintagesand feasting on Abras speciality an international ratatouille ofwholeroasted zucchini Japanese eggplant and spicy Italian sausagesalla putana later copied by Alice Waters for ChezPanisseOne fateful day in the blazing sun Abra was stretching around one ofthe colossal stones with a tape measure seeking the Nabateans idols ofthe sun god Dushara whose symbol was an uncut black stone Allat thegreat mother goddess of Arabia was his mother and consort All overPetra she had opened carved niches containing pillars or large separatemonoliths representing Dushara She was in front of the TreasuryKhazneh when a troop of Bedouins came thundering up picturesquely ontheir sleek Arabian steeds Their muskets firing the Bedouinssurrounded Abra and sent her native helpers scurrying into the dustShe fearing for her life but resolute rose and turned to face thecrowd of swarthy men The tallestsensually dark and handsomedismounted and came in her direction seizing her by the hand andwrapping his other arm around her waist A scream was forced from herlips as they were pressed against the firm mouth and bulging chest ofthis man with magnetic dark eyes In an instant Abra was swept away acaptive of the SheikhMaking from Petra for the Wadi Arabah the Sheikhs band had a stiffclimb down unloading and loading the horses and pack mules where thetrail between rock cliffs was too narrow to let them pass There at WadiMusa where the rock finally opened these wild knights of the desertpaused and pitched their tents while the erotic dancing girls undulatedrhythmically As they cooled their palates and ate their dates theSheikhs men knew they could not be followed as they were the mastersof their desert domainAn international incident ensued the British Protectorate was forcedto divert a key unit of men from Jerusalem to search for Abra therebyleaving the King David Hotel unprotected But that first night Abrafaced her captor alone on the moonlit desert She was carried into histent and bathed by three maidens who scented her hair with jasmine thendraped her in rich silks She was thrown onto a divan covered inpriceless rugs right into the arms of the young Sheikh now abluted andsmelling of powerful sweet muskalthough there was also anintoxicating aroma of horse and sweat lingering at his thighsStill determined not to collapse in fear Abra sat up and said inarchaic Arabic Honorable host please treat this guest with thecourtesies traditionally vouchsafed to strangersHis eyes widening a smile brightening his sensual lips the Sheikanswered her in Oxbridge English You will be treated better than ifyou were a mere stranger Remember how receptive to strangers they wereat Sodom which lies buried only a few leagues from here Now I willhave a kissAbra feeling it was more strategic not to resist too much tried toturn away but his exotic honeyed tongue darted between her lips beforeshe was prepared Ohhh please she moaned Be gentleThe Sheikh emitted a low musical laugh and replied I am always gentleand always savage In this case however since you are an agent ofinternational petroleum prospectors you do not deserve much gentlenessin this our desert land He pulled her roughly toward him and graspingher wrists extended her body across the soft rugs and lay atop herI am a scientist and a virtuous woman Abra cried in Natabean buther cries went unheeded as the moon and its caravan of stars crossed theblue desert   Less than a year later the Sheikh proudly held up Achmed benMaslowSheikh his beautiful son and named him his heir commanding allthe tribes of Bedouins to swear fealty and loyalty to him forever Asthey swore their oaths the babys mother shot her violator the fatherof her child through the heart and was consequently set upon andbutchered by the loyal Bedouins Achmed however grew to

scheduled for anunidentified infantThe Total Urogenital Sinus Surgical Procedure was to be observed byparticipants of a Feminizing Genitoplasty and Total UrogenitalMobilization seminar presented by the hospital with associated surgeryby Dr Dirck Diink of the FinnoUgric University School of MedicineApproximately two dozen people picketed the hospital in a peacefuleffort to draw attention to what they perceive as nonconsensual genitalmutilation Several protestors were intersexed people whose surgery aschildren resulted in assignment to the wrong gender Approximatelytwenty minutes before the procedure was to begin a bomb went off in theempty surgical theaterThe combined bombing and picketing efforts paid off Not only did DrDiink cancel his appearance but the hospital also invited talks byadult survivors of early childhood surgery intended to assign an infantto one gender or the other Several of the protestors were intersexedpeople whose surgery as children resulted in assignment to the wronggenderThis action by queer transgender and intersexactivists loudly demonstrates our collective outrage at what isoccurring in hospitals around the country five times a day tononconsenting

ill in various ways  such as bypossession gaze etc  they have to leave them once propitiatoryofferings of food drink etc are made to them Even the mere mentionof the Buddhas virtues is enough to frighten them Moreover the chiefof the yakkhas Vessavana Vesamuni is one of the four regents of the universe maharaja and as such a devoted follower of theBuddha The ordinary yakkhas that trouble humanbeings have to obey his commands Thus in all rituals connected withtovil it is in the name of the Buddha andVessavana that the yakkhas are commanded to obeythe orders of the exorcist And in the rich folklore that deals with tovil there are many anecdotes that connect everyritual or character with some Buddha of the past or with some BuddhistdeityInto the room comes Timmy staggering with the

remember them I will try to write somedownOur brains seem to work through chemical and electrical circuitsthat first register bodily impressionswhether presented fromoutside through the senses or internally from nerves monitoring thebody or nerves monitoring the thought processes and memory The minddevelops as a consciousness that our brainbody is actively involvedin the process of processing The mind is somehow tricked intobelieving that it is continuous and identical to itself despite theocurrence of different sense impressions and different sentientresponses at each moment of our lives We seem to want to believe weare the same from day to day hence the creation of a self as avessel of continuity of identity Of course this self isinflected by genetic and cultural factors a st C US gay whitemale self is not just biological but historicalThis self comes to dominate our reception of input and processingof reactionsfeelings and thoughts There is some speculation thatbecause women are subjected to much more biological change on aperiodic basis they have less investment in the rigid maintenanceof a continuous selfidentical self In any case most of Westernhistory explains things on the basis of continuities individual orsocial and the interruptions to continuityOur self tries to hold things together in the midst of ongoingchaos by assuming continuities and asserting it can and mustintegrate different responses to similar and even wildly divergentprocesses that happen to the body and the mind One of the ways itasserts this attempted integration is to believe the individualthoughts that pass through our minds scientists concerned withthoughts and consciousness say a thought passes through in around seconds and that a new one occurs at least as often are connectedto each other although they are notin factconnected by anythingexcept the assertion of their connectednessI take from this the conclusion that a desire to integratedifferent impressions feelings or impulses into a self is based onan illusory belief that it is even possible and therefore that theattempt to integrate is always a failure That failure results in afeeling of inadequacy that is the genetic consequence of the factthat our brains are too sophisticated for our own good Anindividual human feels inadequacy basic shame not because hesheisnt as good as others but because no human is capable ofintegrating what is not integrateableNor is any human capable of reconciling autonomy vs doubt of hercapabilities love vs hate like vs dislike or any other thing wesee as dichotomous bifurcated oppositebecause binaries are alsoinadequate to contain the complex variability of situations and leadto rigid distinctions about what is inside and what is outside whatis good and what is bad what is functional and what isdysfunctionalHuman society functions through the confusion of our connectionsand disconnections with others and ourselves pretending we areindividual identities and creating power networks that pervade everydistinctionSexuality is one of the confusing connectionsdisconnections thatis infused with power and powerlessness and islike all otherprocessesactually not composed of self and other in and out goodand bad creative and destructive because these binaries areinadequate but just about as far as our brains can go with thedelusions of continuity and selfidentitythst C gay men in the US inherit American culture and strugglewith it burdened like all other humans with the delusion that itis possible to integrate impossibly divergent feelings impressionsimpulses into a coherent self Since we cant we feel shameOthers feel shame too but our shame is inscribed with thedichotomies and hierarchies of masculine power in our own particulargay male way as constructed by the social processes gender classrace geographic accident of the last several centuriesSo why not decide that shame is inevitable that everyone feels itin herhis own body and that therefore it is not useful to doanything with it except ilaugh at it and move on We ignore the factthat we cant fly we dont feel shame at not being able to overcomegravity We do invent airplanes and banana peel jokes We alsoinvent philosophies psychologies and religions that help transcendthe blame and depression that are reactions to the inadequacy of thehuman brain We even invent antidepressants most of which arepretty crude at this stageWild sex is one of the incommensurable feelings bodily and socialprocesses that sometimes breaks through the rigidities of self andallows us the relief of a disintegration of nonidentity It cantlast because our mindbody cannot continue without the assertion ofidentity Ecstasy means from Greek outside the selfBut nothing we have invented can overcome the basic problem that wecant integrate unintegrateable differences we want wild sex andwe want domestic comfort They can be made to coexist but theycant be made into one stable thing The recent history of gay sexthrough sexual experimentation to the search for transcendence andblowing our minds to AIDS to postAIDS ennui and depression is Ithink evidence of our

whatever into a feelingof unity wholeness of uniting with higher levels of being Thesemodes of transcendence are more or less known and knowable and can becorrelated with the levels of brainmind consciousnessThe other category is the recognition and embrace of Immanencebeyond epistemology not a category of knowing but one derived fromthe logic of inner and outer self and otherI Trzz note I reject the possible correlation of these twocategories with the sexual division of labor among humans andultimately with gender stereotyping By the time of the HighPaleolithic or Neolithic cultures of these caves societies hadevolved far beyond the basic divisions of child rearing and othertasks I have witnessed the fact that women provide adequately forthemselves and their children and share the surplus through foodgathering and hunting of small nearby animalsGiven the consequent fact as I have observed here in  BC thatsocial structures rather than necessity selected for hunting Iconclude that men developed hunting as a supplement as somethinghelpful but not usually necessary something to do to exercise theirbrains and to take a more active role Cooperation and language hadalready been established through experience of gathering sharing andmaintaining food and the health of motherchild groupings All ofthese activities could be performed with the brain of a Neanderthalas Trzz has

ofthree to about six individuals Generally slow and inoffensive theyspend all their life in the water They are vegetarians and feed onvarious water plants They are the only mammals that have evolved toexploit plant life in the sea margin Anderson  The ordinal name Sirenia is related to thesupposed mermaidlike nursing of dugongs thought to be the origin ofthe myths of the sirens and manatees The

he could rememberThe sex he first had was with himself R G had taught him tojack off around age  and hed refused to  with Ricky T and thatother kid V because he didnt like the smell of Vs crotch Now

their selfregard ornot He thought such talk was trivial and tried to not tell suchtales even to himself It was difficult for a compulsive repeater whowas used to saying over and over some phrase or song that caught inhis mindHe understood now that nothing happened unless he wanted it to Thehumblings must have been something he wanted and the unhappinesseshed thought stemmed from his deficiencies were feelings hedobviouswly cultivatedAnd somehow a few years ago he began to take the pills andeverything changed He was no longer so sure he was an unhappy personin fact he felt pretty richtig most of the time and his brain wasfreer to think and play If that happened because he swallowed anorganic chemical it must mean his mind in its ceaseless processingmust have been interpreting in a particular way a way that he nolonger had to experience His unhappiness was an interpretation thatwas not necessary he could just as well be patient and observantmindful of how his narration of the

appreciate your dedicationThe thing I most cant remember is how a woman feels insideIve felt nothing lower than my heart for yearsThe author admits he made Siegfried Rheinfahrt up Siegfried isnteven his real name He was christened in St Nicholas Church inLeipzig in  as just ordinary John Jacob Jingelheimer Schmidt butpeople would all shout at him As a chorister the boy would have sungthe works of the Churchs most famous kappelmeister JS Bach He often referred to this music as thearchitecture of life meaning that Bach provided a structure for hisunderstanding during the complex changes he was to face throughout along and difficultThe first documentary evidence of his name change is in hismembership card in Der Eigene a physical strength group withintellectual ties to Goethes seminal romantic novel Werther His youthful enthusiasm for camping and nude swimmingleft himalthough not his liaisons with English upperclasshomosexuals one of which is thinly disguised in Spenders The Temple

Brechtssemidocumentary Kuhle WampeUnlike many of his peers Siegfried was convinced by  that theNazis would take state power in order to save capitalism for theGerman bourgeoisie and its English investors He disappeared fakinghis death at the hands of Brown Shirts in a riot in Berlin andembarked for Moscow for military and political training Althoughindependent corroboration is not to be had a journal entry in makes evident that he was back in Germany involved with a Lutheranminister whom we know only as Dietrich B His recollection is thatDietrich and I worshiped with great fervor

vacillation in his twoyearcourtship of a certain Karen a Danish psychoanalyst and his almostimmediate divorce from her after their marriage in  Despiteconsiderable effort expended by the author no clarity as to theidentity or subsequent fate of Karen can be offered here Theprecipitous rejection may have been followed by more dangerous eventsas Karen is said to be of Russian perhaps Jewish extractionThe name Siefried appears frequently after that time in the Sovietarchives of clandestine operatives Recently released and decoded thepapers indicate a leading role for Rheinfahrt in the armed resistanceto the Nazis within Germany Some scholars may denigrate the effortsand the role of the Communists in the resistance but the prominenceof Rheinfahrt is certainly the reason why he was to emerge as a majorfigure in the liberated Democratic Republic of GermanyWhat marks Rheinfahrts activity in the Party and Government inEast Germany is the frequent criticisms and selfcriticism heunderwent Apparently R was not enthusiastic about the transfer ofindustrial assets to the Soviet Union and he is probably the unnamedparty leader who was sent twice for proletarian internationalisteducation to Moscow He returned each time chastened but quicklyinvolved in new controversies During debates over development ofLeipzigs huge chemical plants R is known to have said We

made Stendhal different from Balzac orHomer from Virgil He learned from another volume in the same displaythat his sexual fantasies about the crewcutted athletes in his schoolwere not normal and that they had a name in fact he was mostdevastated to learn that his urinary appendage had a name and adifferent function and he cried in embarrassment upon learningpeniswas the accepted name for what he and his brothers were taughtto call the wetter And vagina was too confounding altogetherHaving no sisters never having caught his mother without her girdlehe was not so sure where this vagina was located or what it didIgnoring it all was by far the best course he concludedVenison was named by his mother who thought her son had a freakishgamey look His father a sarcastic reformed drunk predicted thathed have an odd taste not like ordinary meat and it was truelike all Scandinavians his sweat was sharp and acrid a combinationof genetics and overindulgence in rutabagas and lutefisk He

was while staring into the impossibly deep waters of Lake Superiorthat Venison received the first intimations of his special mission andof mankinds aquatic mammalian peers He learned that humans werehairless because they were originally aquatic apes able to evolveinto standing bipeds with the aid of the buoyant waters of the ageswhen they first emerged from the arboreal ecosystems that had

bloodpressure heartbeat metabolism of fats and carbohydrates and sugarlevels in the blood Through direct attachment to the pituitary glandthe hypothalamus also meters secretions controlling water balance andmilk production in the female The role of the hypothalamus inawareness of pleasure and pain has been well established in thelaboratory It is thought to be involved in the expression

of lives over an oilfield Iraq is a strategic battlefield whereordinary young Americans hoping for education and escape from thesuffocation of ordinary American lives fight young Iraqis who hopefor something very similar Inexperienced naive fighters are pittedagainst each other one side to maintain the present corporate worldorder and the other to replace it And its not a fight just betweenIraqis and Americans Global market conflicts overwhelm any nationalpower look at Sudan Russia IndonesiaNo matter who gets elected on Nov  neither Kerry nor Bush will everdare to address the most important issue what is America Ourhomeland No its a military and political shield operating todominate the global market a market that doesnt care what ordinaryAmericans want Bush and Kerry both use the rhetoric of Americansecurity and American power but neither will admit that its not evenabout this country America as a great nation is over We were maybemaybe weighing the ideals and the failures of Jefferson and Lincolnand all a country that embodied greatness once But we are not anymoreHey What HappenedWe the people who used be so productive were lulled out of ourvitality by corporate grasping and by big demand for US goods and USdollars until the stock market took its dreadful dive in Prosperity was of course not spread equally among us the averageincome declined but corporate income skyrocketed to the top MostAmerican working people have clung to belief in a future that affordeda home college for the kids insurance even for domesticatedpartnersuntil the US economy was converted from production of goodsto production of money and financial equities That future was alittle like an LA garden all exotic plants tended and watered bypeople and resources brought from across the borders Now not just ourjobs but even our money has gone overseasto countries that actuallyproduce things All America can offer is flextime service work thatonly immigrants can afford to take Even the soldiers are taking paycuts because of outsourcingIt Looks BadSo instead of despair over the loss of good old America lets takea compassionate look at the whole planet living creatures nearlyruined cherished moral and religious ideals perverted into familyvalues and competing hostile forces that nations can not control Astronger more secure America is a nostalgic fantasy And we cannotexpect to negotiate our way out of continual wars either because weblindly let corporations sell our birthright for a mess of oil andsilicon chipsthey use up all the bargaining chips Neither Kerry norBush neither good cop nor bad cop can pacify let alone rectifythis messWhat do we do nowVoting out Bush and Cheney could stimulate worldwide ideals offreedom democracy and peace We will be more secure if we dismantleAmerica and open the whole garden We can fight for a global orderthats fits for this earth based on the desires we share with allpeople everywhere Things worth fighting for right nowNo Borders no border defenseFree Health Care for Everyone nobody will needinsurance companiesFree Child Care for Everyone any mother orfather can work and every child can feel secureNever mind that these are utopian ideas the demands themselves movepeople to realize that if these basic human needs were met thencompetition for scarce resources would diminish And they can be metabundantly from the incalculable wealth we produce together on thisearth  I hope this says something Ferd says to himself I grant that itdoes matter whether its an avowed fundamentalist Christian militaristor a liberal who might be more malleable on issues but ChristAlmighty What a poop Kerry isHes not confident that his argument addresses what he feels is anunderlying problem he wants to show that its ok to love this placewhile fighting for a new global order that does away with AmericansuperpowerIts sad isnt it What we love is here in this place Where we arealive we learn to love the scene the settings in which we areconscious Unnoticed all the people and trees and sidewalks make aplace a country which we consider central to the experiences wehave Their centrality might be illusory after all what were reallyattached to is our consciousness our aliveness But mental processesbecome affect our bodies and our brains do that in this place and wecall our place America We need to find some way to keep the love butto give up the fatal connection to power to glory The republic ofliberty at least the hope and the struggle for liberty that markedthe best of American days is no

own representatives That issurely the first principle of democracy We are the only race in Kenyawhich does not elect its own representatives in the Legislature and weare going to set about to rectify this situation We feel we aredominated by a handful of others who refuse to be just God said thisis our land Land in which we are to flourish as a people We are notworried that other races are here

Kenya See the website of FemaleGenital Cutting Education and Networking Projectwwwfgmnetworkorgwhere the chapter on clitoridectomyis printed in full The Story Continues cites only short excerptsbelowINITIATIONOF BOYS AND GIRLSTHE CUSTOM of clitoridectomy of girls which weare going to describe here has been strongly attacked by a number ofinfluential European agenciesmissionary sentimental proAfricangovernment educational and medical authorities We think it necessaryto give a short historical background of the method employed by thesebodies in attacking the custom of clitoridectomy of girlsHere Jomo Kenyatta political leader of Kenyas independencedescribes the context in the integral Kikiyu culture of the custom ofclitoridectomy of girls and other rituals surrounding it as well asinitiation ceremonies for boys He makes it clear that these customsfunctioned to make young people part of community religious and sociallife and compares them to Jewish circumcision He also makes plain thecontemptuousand contemptibleefforts of the Scottish Mission todestroy all pagan customs of the Kikyu peopleHowever this urge for abolishing a peoples social custom by forceof law was not wholeheartedly accepted by the majority of thedelegates in the Conference General opinion was for education whichwould enable the people to choose what customs to keep and which onesthey would like to get rid ofIt should be pointed out here that there is a strong community ofeducated Gikuyu opinion in defence of this custom In the matrimonialrelation the rite de passage rite of passageis the deciding factor No proper Gikuyu would dream of marrying agirl who has not been circumcised and vice versa It is taboo for aGikuyu man or woman to have sexual relations with someone who has notundergone this operation If it happens a man or woman must gothrough a ceremonial purification korutwothahu or gotahikio megironamely ritualvomiting of the evil deeds A few detribalised Gikuyu while they areaway from home for some years have thought fit to denounce the customand to marry uncircumcised girls especially from coastal tribesthinking that they could bring them back to their fathers homeswithout offending the parents But to their surprise they found thattheir fathers mothers brothers and sisters following the tribalcustom are not prepared to welcome as a relativeinlaw anyone whohas not fulfilled the ritual qualifications for matrimony Therefore aproblem has faced these semidetribalised Gikuyu when they wanted toreturn to their homeland Their parents have demanded that if theirsons wished to settle down and have the blessings of the family andthe clan they must divorce the wife married outside the rigid tribalcustom and then marry a girl with the approved tribal qualificationsFailing this they have been turned out and disinheritedSome Aspects of the Ceremonies   Late in the afternoon an arch of banana trees and sugarcanes isbuilt at the entrance of the homestead of the matuumo    To start the race a ceremonial horn is blownAt this point the girls who are not allowed to participate in therace start out walking to the tree escorted by a group of seniorwarriors and women singing ritual and heroic songs When the girls arenear the tree the ceremonial horn is again sounded this timeindicating that it is time for the boys to start the race The boysthen start running in a great excitement as though they were going toa battle The truth is it is really considered a sort of fightbetween the spirit of childhood and that of adulthood    ceremonial racing    determines the leader of thatparticular agegroup The one who reaches the tree first and throwshis wooden spear over the tree is elected there and then as the leaderand the spokesman of the agegroup for life It is believed that sucha one is chosen by the will of the ancestral spirits in communicationwith Ngai and is therefore highly respectedThe mogumo ceremony occupies only a shorttime As stated above the boys climb the tree break the topbranches while the girls collect leaves and twigs dropped on theground These are later tied into bunches and carried back to thehomestead to keep the sacred fire burning the whole night and also tobe used in other rituals especially in making the initiates bedsThe songs rendered by the relatives and friends round the foot of thetree generally pertain to sexual knowledge This is to give theinitiates an opportunity of acquainting themselves with all necessaryrules and regulations governing social relationship between men andwomenAt the completion of kunna mogumo breaking ofthe sacred tree the boys and girls are lined up according to theorder of their adoption Here a ceremony of taking the tribal oathmuuma wa anake is conducted by the eldersof the ceremonial council The initiates promise by this oath thatfrom this day onward they will in every respect deport themselves likeadults and take an responsibilities in the welfare of the communityand that they will not lag behind whenever called upon to perform anyservice or duty in the protection and advancement of the tribe as awhole Furthermore they are made to promise never to reveal thetribal secrets even to a member of the tribe who has not yet beeninitiated    The songs they sing on the homeward march are directedtowards denouncing all things that are not fit and proper for anyadult member of the community to do Moreover the phrases embodied inthese songs are to encourage the initiates to become worthy andhonourable members of the adult community into which they are to begraduated   At the end of the ceremony the boys and girls are free to go to theirrespective homes to rest until next morning Care is taken to protectthem from anything that might inflict wounds upon them as theshedding of blood is regarded as an omen of ill luck The initiatesare guarded the whole night by senior warriors against outsideinterference In every home a ceremonial doctor mondomogo wa mambura is assigned by the traditional councilnjama ya kirera to protect the initiatesagainst any possible attacks from witchcraft and also against anytemptation or enticement to indulge in sexual intercourse    After The Girl is Operated OnAt the time of the surgical operation the girl hardly feels any painfor the simple reason that her limbs have been numbed and theoperation is over before she is conscious of it It is only when sheawakes after three or four hours of rest that she begins to realizethat something has been done to her genital organ The writer haslearned this fact from several girls relatives and close friends whohave gone through the initiation and who belong to the sane agegroupwith the writerThis signifies that the children have now been born again not as thechildren of an individual but of the whole tribe The initiatesaddress one another as WanyuWakine whichmeans My tribal brother or sister When the ceremony is completedall burst into ritual song They bid farewell to one another and thenleave the homestead under the escort of their relatives On thearrival at their respective homes a sheep or rat is killed by theparents to welcome them home again and anoint them as new members ofthe community koinokai na kohaka mwanake ormoiretu maguta At this ceremony the parentsare provided with brass earrings as a sign of seniority This isdone when the firstborn is initiated   With such limited knowledge as they are able to acquire from theirconverts or from others who invariably distort the reality of theirua in order to please them these same missionaries pose asauthorities on African customs How often have we not heard suchpeople saying We have lived in Africa for a number or years and weknow the African mind well This however does not qualify them orentitle them to claim authority on sociological or anthropologicalquestions The African is in the best position properly to discuss anddisclose the psychological background of tribal customs such as irua etc and he should be given theopportunity to acquire the scientific training which will enable himto do so This is a point which should be

impact as his fleshhad gone the way of lipodystrophy with the cold white rim of thetoilet A man alone can easily neglect to lift the seat althoughAmbrose had recently replaced the unhygienic seat left behind by theprevious tenant with a pristine pink one which he thought made awhimsical match with the pink tiles on the bathroom walls yet hednever been moved to harmonize the blue color of the floor tilesperhaps because hed painted above the tile wainscoting in asemigloss aubergine he thought was a further inspired choiceWhen he hit the rim he was pleased that he was able to ejaculateHoly Shit within microseconds of contact congratulating himself onthe miniscule timelapse between pain signals and an appositerejoinder Having feared just this kind of undignified clapping oftender skin onto the chilly and narrow porcelain he was wont to leavethe seat down until recently when it became redolently clear thattiny droplets of urine were deliquescing to burden the air with thefug of a public latrine There was no completely agreeable solutionexcept permanent vigilanceIn any case after replacing the seat and spreading his anal porehis disappointment at the quantity and texture of the waste he pushedout was mollified only when a very organized plume of gas was emittedfollowed by a much more gratifying elongated extrusion of shit and afinal firm fart that enabled the distended belly to regain somesmoother roundness The unhindered egress of his excreta permittedAmbrose a moment of reflection regarding the toilet as the biologicalaltar wherenot unlike the deep connection with Nature inherited fromhis Native American forebearsthrough autonomic muscular contractionsand flexions of the organism one performed the ritual of selfworshipin which the very alimentaryeliminative tubular configuration of thehuman body was experienced most to resemble that of otheranimalsfundamentally In fact the coincidence of the English adverbconnoting radical excavation of the underlying ground of animal lifewith the noun denoting the bottom part of the human bodynot countingthe lower extremitiesentered his mind spiced with a mild frisson ofpride at the primitive adaptation that efficaciously coordinatedinvoluntary peristaltic motion and voluntary bearing down and pushingto achieve evacuation The sensation of clean unopposed extrusionalong with the bombast of flatulence and the highly parabolicpresentation of urine through the manually guided penis waspleasurable in the extreme wreathed with smells that one could notdeny were olfactory tokens of life of healthy inward and outnessalthough only ones own could be granted this status and exempted fromthe general disgust others bodily excrescences could awaken in one ifthey originated from any of the rest of us Ambrose had like manywarriors of the spirit had occasion to taste this matter but hispalate rejected the ugly bitter flavorso surprisingly intolerablydifferent from its fetid and rich olorousnessand he concluded thatdespite the alluring abjection it most theatrically might otherwiseoffer coprophagia would never be his choice at the banquet table ofinfantile sexual fixationsMeditating on the high estimation Pascal placed on frequent andcopious defecation enjoying especially the more vernacular version ofthe triadic encomium to good shoes    and a warm place to shitwhat was that other priority he couldnt remember Ambrose turnedhis attention to more rigorous exigencies of the present situationThat is he remembered he was entrusted by the Big Humpback Himself tobring in the suspicious Oedipa for testing Hopping over the coldtiles disregardingcreeping neuropathic foot pain attributable once again to what wereblithely called medication sideeffects he therefore gave himself ashake eschewed a wipe preferring the prospect of a warm lavage andturned on the shower lighting a cigarette to enhance the waiting timewhile the hot water made its way from the distant heater to hisbathroom When all was right he tossed his butt into the toilet andlathered and scrubbedAmbrose Broussard knew about what were called twospirited amongthe anthropological queers who wanted to authenticate their ownproclivities and choices and he felt a strong antipathy at theprospect of eliminating Oedipa Moreover his early support for hissworn bloodbrother Venisons visionary schemes had diminished sharplyin the last several months as the whiteturbaned flocks of convertsincreased and Ven took on the vocal tones of incipient madnessAmbrose stalked out to his vehicle a feulcell equipped hybridHummer roared to the edge of the compound and swept Oedipa away withminutes to spare before the Fruit of the Sea armed security arrivedWhat the fuck are you doing demanded Oedipa Let me out of hereThe Killers are coming for you and me too now that Im running withyou Well ditch this car at The Big TwoHearted River Well go intothe woods and walk to Seney hop the train thereChapter  Nick Atala and Rene Ambrose

they be after me Oedipa askedYeah I wonder Ambrose was getting impatient They might want tocheck out a Sirenia disciple who wasnt what she said she wasWhen there was no answer to that he asked Just who are youanyway Youre really a guy ehNo she retorted Whats it to you anywayIm sick of Venison and Im saving your ass Thats whats it tomeThey said nothing more until they stopped for food at the

AlI dont know said Al I dont know what I want to eatOutside it was getting dark The streetlight came on outside thewindow The two men at the counter read the menu From the other endof the counter

sandwiches inwaxed paper Plus twenty five for the coffee threefiftyThe man turned back to look at the paper bag of sandwiches You gotquarters AlAl paid and the men left Oedipa came out from the bathroom behindthe counter opposite the door She sat on the stool next to AmbroseDont look now dont turn around Those guys are The KillersAmbrose said Were lucky theyre Florida guys and dont know me Ibet they know what you look like thoughShe took their coffee and sandwiches across to a booth She motionedfor Ambrose to sit on the same side of the booth to make it moredifficult for George the counterman to overhearOK um Ambrose she said Heres the deal So theyre after meIve gotta get to Sault Ste Marie and across to Canada Ill pay youto drive me thereNope no no Soo Ive got a powerboat in

Diversionprovided by bloggersWendell and Cass two penguins at the New York Aquarium in ConeyIsland Brooklyn live in a soap opera world of seduction andintrigue Among the  male and  female African

flirt profusely and dump their partners for single males withbetter nestsWendell and Cass however take no part in these cunning schemesThey have been completely devoted to each other for the last eightyears In fact neither one of them has ever been with anyone elsesays their keeper Stephanie MitchellBut the partnership of Wendell and Cass adds drama in another wayTheyre both male That is to say theyre gay penguinsThis is not unusual There are a lot of animals that have samesexrelations its just that people dont know about it Mitchell saidI mean Joe Schmoe on the street is not someone whos read all sortsof biology booksOne particular book is helpful in this case Bruce Bagemihls Biological Exuberancepublished in  documents homosexual behavior in more than animal species The list includes grizzly bears gorillas flamingosowls and even several species of salmonThe world is indeed teeming with homosexual bisexual andtransgendered creatures of every stripe and feather Bagemihl writesin the first page of his book From the Southeastern Blueberry Bee ofthe United States to more than  different bird species worldwidethe birds and the bees literally are queerIn New York its the penguinsAt the Central Park Zoo Silo and Roy two male Chinstrap penguinshave been in an exclusive relationship for four years Last matingseason they even fostered an egg togetherThey got all excited when we gave them the egg said Rob Gramzaysenior keeper for polar birds at the zoo He took the egg from ayoung inexperienced couple that hatched an extra and gave it to Siloand Roy And they did a really great job of taking care of the chickand feeding itOf the  penguins in the Central Park Zoo Silo and Roy are not theonly ones that are gay In  the park had four pairs of homosexualpenguins In an effort to increase breeding zookeepers tried toseparate them by force They failed said Gramzay  Elsewhere a female ape wraps her legs around anotherfemale rubbing her own clitoris against her partners while emittingscreams of enjoyment The researcher explains Its a form ofgreeting behavior Or reconciliation Possibly foodexchange behaviorIts certainly not sex Not lesbian sex Not hot lesbian sexSix bighorn rams cluster rubbing nuzzling and mountingeach other Aggressosexual behavior the biologist explains A wayof establishing dominanceTheyve been keeping it from us There are homosexualand bisexual animals ranging from charismatic megafauna like mountaingorillas to cats dogs and guinea pigs There are transgenderedanimals transvestite animals who adopt the behavior of the othergender but dont have sex with their own and animals who live inbisexual triads and quartetsBruce Bagemihl spent  years scouring the biological literature fordata on alternative sexuality in animals to write Biological Exuberance Animal Homosexuality and NaturalDiversity  pages about exactly what goes on at South ParksBig Gay Als Big Gay Animal Sanctuary The first section discussesanimal sexuality in its many forms and the ways biologists have triedto explain it away The second section A Wondrous Bestiarydescribes unconventional sexuality in nearly  mammals and birds orangutans whales warthogs fruit bats chaffinches  It is a fundamental Darwinian principle that traits and behaviourscannot spread over evolutionary time if they reduce an individualspersonal reproductive success To be more precise an imaginaryspecies consisting only of individuals with an exclusive and lifelonghomosexual behaviour will be extinct in one generationParthenogenetic virgin birth species do exist in nature theyconsist of  females but a  homosexual species has never beenfound Such a species cannot exist Just as a sterile species cannotexist What does exist in nature are species with up to  percent ofhomosexuals according to Bagemihl But even this is a puzzle Ifthose individuals do not reproduce evolution theory predicts that thepercentage in the population must decrease continuously down to alevel that is produced by new mutations But we observe more thanthat So how should the excess be explained One possibility isbisexuality the combination of homosexual and heterosexual behaviourin the same individual But this cannot be the answer either becausebisexual individuals will produce on average less progeny thanfulltime heterosexuals So the existence is still unexplainedBagemihl skilfully demolishes a variety of explanations forhomosexuality proposed by biologists This is one of the best andinteresting parts of his book Probably few people have theencyclopaedic knowledge of homosexual behaviour in animals to be ableto refute the variety of hypotheses to explain away homosexualityIn the end Bagemihl concludes somewhat surprisingly thathomosexuality has no function it just isHomosexual behaviour has an intrinsic value Can I Get A Witness Nov Kenya Times Witnesses say the girls body levitated uptoward the ceiling Her knees were bent upwards her legs stillspread apart her

this excerptoutlines some recent Federal counterintelligence operationsnewswire Press Clipping Oct Legal  Judicial SurveillanceHarassmentThe new COINTELPROauthorCamille T TaiaraThe feds are spying on  and harassing  political activists with afury not seen since the sEARLY THIS MONTH the federal government launched the latest crudeoffensive in its socalled war on terror Titled the October Plan theprogram called for aggressive  even obvious  surveillance of awide range of individuals regardless of whether or not theyresuspected of any criminal wrongdoing until the Nov  presidentialelection according to an internal document leaked to the pressThe plan  a collaboration between the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies involves renewed scrutiny of mosques and interrogations of peoplewhose national origin religious faith or political leanings mightin the eyes of the feds indicate even the most farflung relationshipto terrorismImmigrants and others interviewed by the FBI have been questionedabout immigration status  theirs and others  and about theirpolitical and religious views the National Lawyers Guilds StaceyTolchin said at an emergency press conference called by the SanFrancisco branch of the American Arab AntiDiscrimination Committeethe Bay Area Association of Muslim Lawyers the NLG and the AmericanCivil Liberties Union of Northern CaliforniaFor staffers at these organizations responding to these kinds ofcrackdowns has become alarmingly routine This is the fifth round ofFBI informal interviews targeting immigrants based on their nationalorigin religion and increasingly their political viewsNo one knows just how many have been deported as a result of theinterviews or of the various dragnets conducted over the past threeyears Local NLG attorney Nancy Hormachae reported that at least people were forced into deportation hearings as the result ofthe notorious Special Registration program alone And the fact thatnone of these campaigns has proffered a single alQaeda operativehasnt deterred the Bush administration a bitSo far immigrant Muslims and those from the Middle East and CentralAsia have suffered the brunt of the Bush administrations attacks oncivil liberties But as NLG immigration attorney Mark Van Der Houttold me Going after immigrants is just the first step towards goingafter US citizensIndeed a look at the past three years shows that Attorney GeneralJohn Ashcrofts offensive has widened to include a range of citizenswhose only real crime is their opposition to the Bush administrationspoliciesThe FBI comes callingPresident George W Bush Aschroft and company have made it easierto spy on everyday citizens without probable cause of criminalactivity even allowing for the indefinite detention of Americansdubbed enemy combatants without charges or access to a lawyerTheyve eviscerated laws meant to keep a wall between the CIA and theFBI and erected an extensive domesticspying infrastructure enlistingprivate citizens and relying on private industry to a degree neverseen before Today federal agencies are maintaining a grand total of domestic watch listsThe Bush administration has shifted federal funding away fromtraditional law enforcement and toward domestic spying explained JohnCrew an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California specializing inpolice practices and surveillance issues A lot of this activity isin fact being carried out by local police working with the JointTerrorism Task Force he told me explaining that those agents areconsidered federalized They report to the FBI Local city officials even local police chiefs  are often not aware of what thesespecial officers are doingAs the Bush administration loosened professional standards for lawenforcement it simultaneously increased financial incentives forconducting surveillance Crew continued To qualify for grantslocal law enforcement must have organizations in their locale thatare threats he said They have to justify their own budget byamplifying the threat factor     elision of many examples of spying on activistsCivil liberties watchdog groups obviously worry about the chillingeffect these kinds of surveillance and crackdowns have on ourfaltering First and Fourth Amendments But they also insist thatAshcroft and companys approach isnt making us any saferWhen law enforcement fails to distinguish between violent criminalactivity and legitimate dissent  and when it favors collecting asmuch information on as many people as possible rather than usefulintelligence resulting from bona fide criminal investigations  itschoosing quantity over quality Crew said You develop good leadsby generating trust not by disrespecting peoples rights And ifyoure looking for a needle in a haystack adding more hay doesnthelp anyThe bills that have recently passed through the House and Senate inresponse to the  Commissions findings

MacKellinis playing Mrs Twankey We are taking you to meet him the day afteryou arrive All despite being in black mourning for poor RenataTebaldi truly the voice of an angel now Well meet your plane atHeathrow dear Have a safe flight If Time Not Space If Space Not TimeIn Islington on a rainy Sunday night in January Cyril Vyvyan andAmbrose emerge from the cinema commenting on their disappointmentwith What the BleepThat film is nothing dear boys says Cyrilbut an infomercial for a particular type of Buddhist thought whichhas seized on quantum mechanics as an explanation for theirtheological concern with consciousness and the desire to shed theego in order to be at home in the new construal of the universeWilling to play the interlocutor not unlike Alan Alda in scienceprograms on US public television Ambrose asks but dont you agreethat matter is no longer to be thought of as solid and stable andthat energy is what makes the universeLets start more simply  ripostes Cyril The films expertachiropractor so he undoubtedly has the scientific background tocomment on thistells us that functional MRIs show the same areas ofthe brain are active when looking at say an apple as whenremembering an apple He then says this indicates that the braincannot tell the difference between what is real and what is onlyremembered Therefore consciousness is constituting reality Thatsjust bad scienceVyvyan sees his point First of all the fMRI is not precise enoughto show that the very same neurons are active in both cases  Andheres the car Mind your umbrellasSecond if I may second your searchlight brilliance dear Vyv addsCyril the film assumes that consciousness and the brain arecoterminous congruent That leaves out the whole rest of the bodyincluding the eyes the muscles that move the lenses in the eyes theskin of the hand that might hold the appleeverything elseWhy yes of course muses Ambrose as the ancient Bentley coughssneezes and is finally underway That means that the assertion aboutconsciousness constituting the world is not proven by that argumentBut what about the Heisenberg quoteatoms arenot things We know from Bohr and others that the act of observationchanges phenomena observing a subatomic particle can determine eitherits location or its momentum but not both In fact all we have areprobabilities for where any given particle is prior to observation itcould be everywhere or nowhereTheories abound darlings to explain this uncertainty principlebut the purest is the Copenhagen consensus right Cyril dear Thatthere is no thing no entity we can call matter or energy orreality All we can do is ascertain probabilities which do notdefinitively prove anything is anywhere Ambrose interjects For that matter it doesnt disprove it eitherCyril is more measured In fairness Bohrs formulation that there is no thing called reality is not theonly way to see the universe Einstein might still be right that Goddoes not play games David Bhm sees implicateorder Most scientists are agnostic on the question of whether thereis a real universe out there independent of our observation of itThe best that can be said is that observation and we could stretchand call that consciousness I guess is implicated in everyphenomenon we can observe and seemingly in every phenomenon we cantheorize to explain Think of superstring theories and the likeBut this movie goes too far it wants us to believe ourconsciousness creates reality which is conventionally Buddhist butits bad Buddhist doctrine and bad science together Its a maresnest of postKantian goo that is far to keen on idealismWell my Chingachgook let us show you the good old Berkeleyanreality of an English dinner Well go to an Indian restaurant for ahot curryNot to go on about it replies Ambrose but I was confused by thediscourse on addiction in the film What didyou think of thatBah Vyvyan expostulates We are told by that Elke Sommerlookalike with beautiful skin and blue eyeshadow that everything we like or dislike is an addiction but ifwe take a hot bath we are transformed and can throw away our anxietymedicationsThey should rather have said agrees Cyril that antidepressantsare a logical outcome of theories that brain chemicals and electricalconnections among neurons are the seat of emotional reactions ofdelight and distress Readjustment of those electro chemicals is aperfectly marvelous course to take and even more soa fortiori ifconsciousness is all somehow quantumbased addiction chemistryThe Bentley pulls up on Finchley Road in front of a popular

freely and quickly fromtalk about experimental inaccuracies to epistemological or ontologicalissues and back again However ontological questions seemed to be ofsomewhat less interest to him For example there is a passageHeisenberg  p  where he discusses the idea that behindour observational data there might still exist a hidden reality inwhich quantum systems have definite values for position and momentumunaffected by the uncertainty relations He emphatically dismissesthis conception as an unfruitful and meaningless speculation becauseas he says the aim of physics is only to describe observable dataSimilarly in the Chicago Lectures Heisenberg  p  he warnsagainst the fact that the human language permits the utterance ofstatements which have no empirical content at all but neverthelessproduce a picture in our imagination He notes One should beespecially careful in using the words reality actually etcsince these words very often lead to statements of the type justmentioned So Heisenberg also endorsed an interpretation of hisrelations as rejecting a reality in which particles have simultaneousdefinite values for position and momentumhttpwwwaiporghistoryheisenbergpchtm Bohr denied that classical concepts could be used to attributeproperties to a physical world initself behind the phenomena ieproperties different from those being observed In contrast classicalphysics rests on an idealization he said in the sense that itassumes that the physical world has these properties initself ieas inherent properties independent of their actual observationhttpplatostanfordeduentriesqmcopenhagenBohm suggests that the whole universe can be thought of as a kind ofgiant flowing hologram or holomovement inwhich a total order is contained in some implicit sense in eachregion of space and time The explicate order is a projection fromhigher dimensional levels of reality and the apparent stability andsolidity of the objects and entities composing it are generated andsustained by a ceaseless process of enfoldment and unfoldment forsubatomic particles are constantly dissolving into the implicate orderand then recrystallizingThe quantum potential postulated in the causal interpretationcorresponds to the implicate order But Bohm suggests that the quantumpotential is itself organized and guided by a superquantum potentialrepresenting a second implicate order or superimplicate order Indeedhe proposes that there may be an infinite series and perhapshierarchies of implicate or generative orders some of which formrelatively closed loops and some of which do not Higher implicateorders organize the lower ones which in turn influence the higherBohm believes that life and consciousness are enfolded deep in thegenerative order and are therefore present in varying degrees ofunfoldment in all matter including supposedly inanimate matter suchas electrons or plasmas He suggests that there is aprotointelligence in matter so that new evolutionary developmentsdo not emerge in a random fashion but creatively as relativelyintegrated wholes from implicate levels of reality The mysticalconnotations of Bohms ideas are underlined by his remark that theimplicate domain could equally well be called Idealism SpiritConsciousness The separation of the two  matter and spirit  is
