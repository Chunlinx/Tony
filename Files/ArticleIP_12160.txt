                                  He Has To Go            The preliminaries are overIt is time to decide Should the Senate convict President Clinton and expel himfrom office My answer after months of indecision is a strong Yes            I had formerly beenimpressed by the argument that ousting Clinton would set a precedent for anyparty having a sufficient majority in Congress to get rid of any presidentwhich would convert us into a parliamentary democracy At one time I hadthought our problem might be solved by the  th Amendment whichprovides for the removal of a president found unable to perform the duties ofhis office But that required the concurrence of the vice president whichwould surely not be forthcoming I had also thought that Clinton might save usa lot of soulsearching by resigning but apparently he will not At some timesI thought that censure or rebuke might do as punishment and expression ofindignation            I can say exactly when I came to the conclusion thatClinton had to be removed It was the morning of Dec   That was twodays before the House of Representatives was to start action on impeaching himIt was also one day before he gave orders to bomb Iraq I got out of bed thatmorning took in the papers and scanned the first page Within  minutes Iwas decided and not only decided but decided with a heat that I rarely feelabout public affairs What sparked this heat was the picture of Clinton inGaza and the reminder of the picture of Clinton the previous day wearing ayarmulke at the grave of Yitzhak Rabin And I suddenly thought Is this theman I want representing the righteousness of America in a land sacred tobillions of Jews Christians and Moslems Then I asked whether I wanted himto represent us anywhere Do we want him laying the wreath at the Tomb of theUnknown Soldier comforting our mourners saluting our heroes Do I want to seehis sincere face on television every day No decidedly no            No even more decidedlyno after the bombing of Iraq I dont know whether he decided to bomb Iraq inorder to divert us from the forthcoming impeachment debate That is the pointI dont know and most of the world doesnt know He has generated the beliefthat he is capable of taking such grave action to save his own skinTerminating the action in Iraq without any conclusive results only a few hoursafter the House voted for impeachment strengthened that belief He had startedthe bombing just in time to give his supporters the refuge of arguing that toimpeach the commander in chief while our troops were in harms way would beunpatriotic He had stopped the bombing as soon as that argument becameuseless That is an abuse of power The whole episode shows how unfit he is tobe president He has polluted the atmosphere within which policy decisions aremade            L ike almost everyone else I want to get this thing overwith But to me this thing is not only the process it is also the Clintonpresidency I dont want to punish him or have a national catharsis I wantsomething more practical I want him off our screen            I admit that I neverwanted Clinton to be president and never voted for him But I was always coolabout it I have not been a deepdyed Clinton hater Except for the  healthcare plan and his vacillation toward Iraq his policy has not been terriblein my opinion The performance of the economy during his administration hasbeen good and although I dont attribute very much of that to him at least hehas not been an obstacle I dont expect any improvement or any change inpublic policy as a result of his departure            In an article I wrote during the  campaignpreLewinsky I said of Clinton                           But he has oneserious deficiency as a president He is prone to foolish mistakes Everypresident like everyone else makes mistakes Foolish mistakes are ones thatcould reliably have been known in advance to be mistakes There is something inBill Clintonsome odd combination of naivete and conceitthat makes himliable to such mistakes                        He has gone too far inhis foolish mistakes and beyond foolish mistakes and I am no longer coolabout him as president            People who are legally fastidious say its not the sexits the perjury For me it is partly the sex If he had lied under oath aboutparking illegally I wouldnt be so disgusted But for a married man to haveoral sex with a woman employee less than half his age in the OvalOffice I cant claim not to be offended by that I have been told that isan oldfashioned puritanical attitude But even oldfashioned puritans havethe right as citizens to protest the behavior of their president And it is notonly the perjury It is the sophomoric deviousness of the perjury that is aninsult to our intelligence            The constitutionalquestion remains Does his behavior add up to grounds for removal from officeThe words in the Constitution high crimes and misdemeanors give us muchlatitude If the framers had wanted to limit us more they could have been morespecific Essentially they left the judgment to usnot to an opinion poll oreven to our political representatives who are closest to the people but to ourmost senior political representatives the Senate My opinion is that not everyperjury is a high crime as grounds for removing a president from office ButI believe that Clintons performance before and after his perjuries hasuniversally generated such a response of disapproval ranging from cynicism todisgust as to degrade the ability of the presidency to serve its functionClinton has said that it is his goal to degrade the ability of Saddam Husseinto threaten Iraqs neighbors But Clinton has degraded the ability of thepresident of the United States to lead the nation and the world That is a highcrime            I am still concerned about the risk of setting a precedentfor opposition majorities in Congress to remove presidents for purely politicalreasons Future generations will have to deal with that For now we have to setthe precedent that presidents of the United States should so behave themselvesas to merit the confidence of the world This is a big country and surely wecan find men and women in it who are as capable of being president as MrClinton is and who are also able to commit themselves to good behavior            The Constitution requires a vote of at leasttwothirds of the Senate to convict and expel a president The Republicans willnot have a twothirds majority and Clinton cannot be convicted on the votes ofRepublicans alone That is a good thing The precedentsetting risk would begreater if the president were convicted by a strictly partyline vote The caseagainst the president should be strong enough to justify some members of hisown party voting against him In the case of this president it is
