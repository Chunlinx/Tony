My son is  and very successful His fiancee is  and is a veryintelligent successful woman They have been together many years livingtogether for the last three The problem is not their relationship but my sonand his intended are both witchesthats right witchesand they are having ahandfasting a witchcraft wedding ceremony My wife and I are devoutCatholics and it seems that going to a pagan ceremony goes against all ourreligious beliefs Even one of the elder priests in our parish said it would beagainst God to attend such an event though a younger priest said as long as wedidnt take part in the ceremony it would be OK                                       I know my sondoesnt believe in Satan or evil Hes a very good boy and Im proud of himHe has even allowed me to read the ceremony that will be performed Actuallyits just about the most beautiful ceremony Ive ever read but Im veryconfused Should I possibly go against my faith to support my son by attendinga pagan rite or should I alienate my son because of my own religious beliefsAny advice would be appreciated                                       Charles                        Dear Cha            Oh my talk aboutdilemmas  your

              I enjoy your columnand often think your advice is excellent and daring Except in the case ofWondering too I suspect Prudie was napping when she answered that one Imyself not being shy wouldnt mind a friendly chat while in the office stallsbut many would Some would feel embarrassed at simply being identified andaddressed in a compromising position Others would feel tense and conversationmight interfere with the reason they are there Not to mention that some peoplego there to sit and be quiet and have a small private break Addressing someoneby name after identifying them by their shoes while they are sitting on thecommode seems downright rude to me                                       Privacy Please                        Dear Pri            Prudie has finished her nap and wishes toacknowledge that the flubup fairy was visiting her when she answered thatletter Persuaded by several people she now wishes to reverse herself and begsthe pardon of anyone whos had to suffer chitchat during a private momentsimply because Prudie said it was OK            An interesting sidelightto bathroom Kremlinology is the mens room tradition articulated in thepreceding letter

wevebeen living together for two and a half years I was brought up with thevalues that you got engaged got married and then started a family For somereason I was blessed with this baby much sooner than planned What can I sayor do to convey to my boyfriends mother that this is a blessing and not atragic event Please help Thank you very much                                       Confused                        Dear Con            For one thing you can tell your boyfriends motherthat the baby is on time the wedding is late Was this woman by any chancea member of Congress when they decided that Ingrid Bergman should be kept outof the country If you have no idea what Prudie is talking about ask yourparents            In any case yourattitude about the blessed event is most pleasing and your relationship soundssolid To assuage social convention however and to validate Prudiessuggested retort perhaps you and the fathertobe might consider legally tyingthe knot  and perhaps before the little bundle of joy requires a sitter            Prudie expectantly                                             DearPrude                                                      I was ensconced in amanly game of collegiate footballwatching when I overheard the womenfolkdiscussing proper breastfeeding etiquette When asked I indicated that aslong as the breast is hidden under a blanket with the child I dont mindHowever when a woman goes National Geographic and everything is out in theopen I feel a bit squeamish There was no consensus amongst the men oneturned up the volume on the game so he didnt have to deal with the wholething The women were mixed in their opinions So what is appropriate whenbreast feeding in public Thanks                                       jeff                        Dear jef            Though there isdisagreement on the subject good sense and good taste would seem to dictatethat this perfectly normal function can be carried out in public with as littleobviousness as is feasible Prudie is not sure about a total blanket tent forboth baby and breast but an attempt at decorous draping would seem the thingto strive for            Prudie discreetly
