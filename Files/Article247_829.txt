                                 Slavia You Go            The Washington Post and New York Timeslead with the tense fallout from last Fridays massacre of Albanians in Racakin the Kosovo provinceYugoslavias expulsion of William Walker the USdiplomat heading up the international peacemonitoring mission in KosovoWalker had blamed the massacre on Serbian security forces The Los AngelesTimes  which fronts the Walker tossout leads instead with yet anothersneak of President Clintons State of the Union address to be deliveredtonight Clinton will says the paper echoing reporting previously in theNYT  propose funding most of his social policy goals from schoolconstruction to longterm care for the elderly through targeted tax breaksrather than through new spending The NYT adds to the list of leakedspeech provisions with todays tips that Clinton will ask for more money foraid to Russia to help contain the threat that Russian nuclear arms might fallinto the hands of terrorists and will endorse a  tax credit forstayathome parents The Wall Street Journal Work Week column gives a clue to theneed for the latter proposal by reporting that last year  percent of motherswith kids under age three held jobs up from  percent in  USA Today which also fronts Yugoslavia leads with a story comboing the SOTU Clintonsstillstratospheric job approval ratings and the beginning of his formalimpeachment defense today The papers latest poll of  adults indicatesthat more than eighty percent of respondents say Clintons presidency is asuccess although only  percent view him as honest and trustworthy            The Yugoslav coverage mentions that in addition to Walker being expelledthe chief war crimes prosecutor for the region a Canadian was turned away bySerbian authorities when she tried to make her way to the massacre site Itsthe consensus of the papers that the ceasefire brokered last October by a USspecial envoy is no more And indeed the LAT cites an AP report of apostmassacre ambush of Serb policemen by Albanian rebels            Both the LAT and NYT quote Walker who saw some of the corpsesat Racak as saying the killings were a crime against humanity The NYTfront shows the bodies on display in a village mosque with shrouds over theirheads where they were apparently shot at close range The papers report thatSerbian police later forcibly removed the bodies to conduct their ownautopsies which means in all likelihood that international authorities willnever be able to confirm what actually happened            The LAT says the Belgrade government accused Walker of violating hismandate as head of  or so international ceasefire monitors and both theLAT and NYT carry Walkers remarks condemning the Serbs for thekillings The Post also carries Walkers condemnation but also quoteshim making this odd concession Maybe we went beyond the limits of themissions mandate and thats why the government is mad at us            The NYT reports that NATO has warned Yugoslavian president and Serbleader Slobodan Milosevic that he had better take seriously the warnings madelast Sunday by NATO The paper says that warning stopped short of revivingplans for NATO airstrikes against Serbs in Kosovo and Serbia But theLAT says the alliances Sunday remarks were a final warning toMilosevic to comply with the ceasefire                           NYT columnist Thomas Friedman says that the US airstrikes against Iraq lastmonth rattled Saddam and showed that his system of control and intimidation isless impregnable than previously feared and weakened his support among hismilitary protectors the Republican Guards Nows the time therefore hewrites to really rattle his cage He offers such suggestions as turning upRadio Free Iraq extra loud and having the UN declare Saddam a war criminalAnd one cant help but think Friedman was also making a suggestion by passingalong what hes heard about what really happened to Nigerias dictator when hedied suddenly last June three prostitutes slipped him poison during a trystperhaps by putting it in his Viagra            A frontpage WP story says that there is a serious crowding problem at the White House that hasprompted the Park Service to propose a  million overhaul The unfolding ofthe story shows that the paper is just a little too credulous about the needfor this spending Examples of worsening congestion and strain at the WhiteHouse the Post cites include Storage space is so scarce that items forholiday decorations and the yearly Easter egg roll are kept elsewhere Andthe China Room where the presidential china is on display doubles as a coatroom for state dinners and The florists were forced to open boxes of flowerson a table set up in the corridor            The Post has apparently adopted a breakthrough innovation thatenables it to get copy into the paper faster Each piece gets its own editorwho edits nothing else How else to explain todays columns by James Glassmanand Allan Sloan They both lead with the exact same anecdote taken from thesame Sherlock Holmes story
