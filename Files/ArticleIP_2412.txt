                                 Pataki and Potatoes            By Franklin Foer            After  years ofcalculated disregard the Irish potato famine has suddenly forced itself ontothe US political scene Thanks to a bill signed by New York Gov GeorgePataki starting next fall high school students in his state will be legallyrequired to study the Irish potato famine The legislation amends a  actthat mandated students take a course on human rights violations withparticular attention to the study of the inhumanity of genocide slavery andthe Holocaust Now the mandate also covers the mass starvation of the Irishbetween  and             Similarbills are pending in other states and a bill pending in Congress would requirethe Department of Education to include the potato famine in all the modelcurricula it concocts Meanwhile organizers of the upcoming St Patricks Dayparade in New York have made the famine the theme for this years marchclaiming its a much understudied instance of genocide And groups havelobbied for the issue of a US postage stamp commemorating the th anniversary of the calamity            The campaign bespeaks the transformation of IrishAmericanlife When the Irish were on the way up intent on mastering and merging intoAmerican society they viewed the Great Hunger as a somewhat shamefulepisodea tragedy to be cordoned off in the past and overcome Now that mosthave made it the ethnic remnant that once ruled Tammany Hall Albany andBoston and anointed the governors and presidents has retreated intovictimology            Even though IrishAmericansface virtually no discrimination some have embraced a politics modeled afterthe campaigns of AfricanAmericans and Native Americans demanding their fairhistorical duethat American institutions recognize their old hardshipsTammany Tiger has died and come back as the Ancient Order of Hibernians theAmerican Irish Teachers Association the Irish American Foundation and theIrishAmerican Caucusinterest groups and old fraternal orders playing newbreedidentity politics            But thepotatofamine campaign and the historical interpretation it aims to canonizehas more to do with the present than the past            Like the Holocaust for the Jews or slavery forAfricanAmericans the potato famine is the omnipresent haunting presence inIrish history Consider the events magnitude At the start of the famine in nearly  million people lived in Ireland Five years later thepopulation had dwindled to  million Two million had emigrated and over million had died            Thefamine is also synonymous with British oppression Kept alive by folktradition the idea now reverberates in political symbols and pop culture Inspeeches Gerry Adams the head of Sinn Fein the Irish Republican Armyspolitical wing continues to evoke the famine to condemn British occupation ofNorthern Ireland IRA prisoners held by the British have famously used hungerstriking in part to allude to the faminethe most monumental historicalexample of British tyranny Or take folk rocker Sinead OConnors songFamine released two years ago Its lyrics argue that labeling the calamityfamine fails to draw enough attention to the British role in provokingit            These arguments draw on an interpretation of the faminethat has flourished since the event itself It goes like this In  thefungus Phytophora infestans arrived on the Isle of Wight off the coastof England when an infected potato peel from an American ship washed ashoreWithin two months the blight had spread across Europe from Ireland toScandinavia But because of a deliberate British policy the Irish bore thebrunt Irelands British rulers refused to curtail exports of wheat from thecountry which could have fed thousands and heartless absentee Britishlandlords evicted starving tenants For their part the British claimed thatlaissezfaire policy precluded intervention in the market to halt the crisisand that the Irish needed to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps Butthe interpretation goes it was really racism and antiCatholicism that led theBrits to sit on their hands            Bytreating the potato famine as a human rights violation the Pataki potatoamendment in New York assumes a variation of this interpretation Naturaldisasters dont violate human rights As in the case of slavery and theHolocaust alongside which the famine will be taught there must be a culpritAnd that would be the British Pataki made this explicit at the bills Albanysigning ceremony History teaches us that the Great Hunger was not the resultof a massive Irish crop failure but rather a deliberate campaign by theBritish to deny the Irish people the food they needed to survive            Too bad for the kids who will be taught thispartisan line most recent historical evidence doesnt support it In thes a revisionist school of economic historians proved that limiting wheatexports would have made only a puny dent in the calamity British actionwouldnt have mattered In addition British intervention to assist thestarving assumes a more contemporary idea of the states responsibilities thatdoesnt jibe with mid th century realities If Ireland got hithardest by the famine it was because it depended more heavily on the potatofor sustenance than other countries            Although scholarshipcontinues to ascribe some culpability to the Britishfor instance the Britishdid contribute to the Irish dependence on potatoesmost historians emphasizethe famine was primarily a natural disaster and conclude that British inactionwas hardly part of a deliberate plan            Even theIrishthe ones in Irelandhave distanced themselves from the New Yorklegislation The Irish Times  one of the countrys leading newspapersquestioned the hyperbolic rhetoric of the amendments supporters in the stateassembly And an Irish government official recently in the United States for asymposium on the famine has refuted Patakis description of the famine anddistanced the Irish government from the New York law            Yet New York state senators and legislators privately admitthey assented to the legislation because they were impressed with the ferocityof the support for the bill Its pork concedes one assemblyman from upstatewho voted for the measure A necessary move to get the Irish vote We all haveIrish constituents in our district and they care Another representative ofIrish descent from Syracuse who vocally opposed the bill with the argumentthat the legislature shouldnt dictate highschool curricula has receivedthreatening phone calls that accused him of selling out his people Otheropponents were deluged with calls denouncing them as antiIrish bigots Andthat was after the bill passed overwhelmingly            Its asectarian sort of reaction Either you are for us or against us And itssymptomatic IrishAmericans have fewer doubts about the more radical Irishnationalism than do most Irish For instance IrishAmericans have celebratedthe Sinn Fein which raises the bulk of its funds in the United States Yetthe party has never garnered more than  percent of the vote in an election inNorthern Ireland and last year won only  percent of the vote in Irishelections            This tendency for descendants of immigrants totake a harder line on nationalistic issues than the folks still living back inthe old country is not of course peculiar to IrishAmericans Its theDiasporachic Eric Liu described earlier in Slate the recent tendency of Americanminorities to think of themselves as communities in exile a component of thegreater national obsession with finding ones roots It is evident inIrishAmericans increased visits to Ireland the Irish American Foundationcalls them pilgrimages the burgeoning membership of fraternal organizationslike the Ancient Order of Hibernians now at  and rising contributionsto groups like the American Friends of Sinn Fein in  it raised a record million            The lure of the diaspora maybe more atavistic for IrishAmericans than other groups About  years ago itseemed IrishAmericans would cease to identify strongly as IrishAmericansJohn F Kennedys election to the White House and the success of celebritieslike Grace Kelly proved that the WASP establishment which long impeded accessto IrishAmericans was crumbling Because Irishness meant less to society itmeant less to the Irish Along with mass culture the advent of television andmovies worked to eliminate the differences among ethnic groups Alsosuburbanization shattered the old urban institutions the pubs and fraternalsocieties that once provided the ballast for Irish communities            When an identity iscontrived or reconstructed in exile after a long fallow period ofnonidentificationas in the potatofamine campaignits bound to be moreradical than the real thing like the religious convert who becomes morezealous than those born into a religion The emotional connection to themotherland becomes more intense than the connection to reality The result isromanticization Terrorist groups like the IRA become freedom fighters and ablight becomes genocide
