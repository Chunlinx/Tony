                views huh political views huh   well just any any political event or view or anything   well i think Bush done screwed up   well uh in what way   well as far as like the the people over there he told them to uprising have a uprising you know and overtake Saddam so now that theyre listening hes not helping them   i dont think he ever told them to to rise up against Saddam Hussein   yeah thats what he said when it first started that they should think about what theyre doing and and you know what hes doing that they should you know make him understand it its just like them saying that we should understand what Bush is doing but they dont have no say so in it i guess   well unfortunately the the United States as a government cant get involved in a civil war in another country because its not it its   well thats what Vietnam was was a civil war thats what get you know its like a double double standard   well   you know   im i uh the uh the Kurdish in the northern part of Iraq unfortunately when the the uh Mid Eastern countries were when the boundaries were adjusted and changed and all the Kurdish were basically forgotten because theres a group of Kurdish in Northern Iraq theres some in uh Western Iran and theres some in Southern Turkey   oh yeah   and uh   well thats where he bombed before with the Turks thats where he put the chemical weapons before   umhum   and killed all them people whats uh Saddam did   yeah it its just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didnt get their own uh   land or something   well their their own government or their own something originally   um yeah now they have to deal with whatever they get dished out more or less taken on from each side because theyre getting it from like Turkey closed their borders   umhum   you know so i think theyre screwed up there   yeah theyve theyve got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem   uhhuh and then Iran i dont know if they can go to Iran or not that wasnt   the the Iranian borders are still open uh from what i understand understand um   David   the Iraqis the Kurdish are going into Iran to Iran and into Syria i know that the Saudi the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict   yeah   uh   now they have yeah theyre pretty strict anyway   yeah       and i doubt that theyre letting too many Iraqis in   uhhuh   unless the people have proof that theyre leaving that theyre not going to stay   yeah i dont even think that will help right now because you never know whos on whose side and theyre worried about that and they could get over there and change their mind or something you know who knows   then the Saudi Arabians will just shoot them   yeah now thats something i like about the country theres not a whole lot of crime over there as far as petty crime you know they   well they its a its all the countries over there are very wealthy   yeah   and so most of the people are wealthy and and they dont have some most of their basic needs for for food and shelter and clothing are met so they dont have any   yeah   uh any need thats going to drive them to to petty theft or or to that type of crime   i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but if youre the   yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy but from what i understand though that its private its the same type of wealth distribution where you have a the very few are very wealthy   yeah   but since theres so much more to go around that that leaves the the lower classes with more   yeah thats better than none at all i guess   yeah   they dont have no crime   so you think that that George Bushs foreign policy is poor because of because of whats happening to the Kurdish people   they no i just think i dont know if he should have made that statement other than that you know hes all right you know but i dont know im not a Bush fan im not really none of thems fan i just wish something else could be done in this country i dont know what   something else done here that would would solve the problems in the Mid East or or   no that would solve our own problems i dont know i think the war was good to a point but then it really didnt help us any you know   no other than than reestablishing the dominance of the United States in the in the world economy   you know yeah thats it thats all thats that the to let the world know that we could do what we say we was going to thats about it   another thing that was good if youre looking at the balance of the super powers between the United States and the Soviet Union you know the United States went in and led the battle and and solved the problem and the Soviet Union is is a whimpering is a whimpering country right now because they theyve got so many problems that they cant even   now they now they have an internal problem themselves right now and i think that has to do with them having problems with food and and and and prices and all of that stuff   yeah yeah a lot of their their civil problems where theyve got their uh Baltic states rising against the the uh the leadership in in the Russian state   umhum   uh is the same type of deal as what occurred with the Kurdish people its the same type of situation where   they they want their own their   where where ethnic groups were split up and and our and dont necessarily have the same uh social structure or value systems as the government   yep   its i its its kind of fortunate that that the United States was founded in the way that it did because its such a mixture of people   oh goodness yes   with with for the most part with the same ideals   yeah more or less just whatever it its really that choice   yeah and and   thats the biggest thats the bottom line is its your choice its not told to you or pushed on you its whatever choice you want to make you can make it yourself   yeah and and when the when the United States was founded the people the people who founded the country all had the same value systems and beliefs and so immigrants coming in understood that and and it wasnt as if it was forced upon them they chose to come to this country   yeah   it wasnt as if a a new government was established when they were already here   umhum   so well i think weve taken up at least five minutes       ive enjoyed talking t o you   all righty byebye   bye
