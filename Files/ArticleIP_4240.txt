in my view Forexample she is fearful that her yearold will someday date a person ofanother race and she defends those who as she puts it want to preservetheir traditions She also continually complains about the services of hermaid What puzzles me about her nattering on is this She is well aware of myopinions which are completely opposed to hersso why is she always gassing onlike this What do you think Thanks for your time                                       Sick of Listening toThis Crap                        DearSick            Peoplenatter on about subjects knowing there is disagreement

the time because that would be very boring but we doagree close to  percent Anyway youre my fave so I hope this makes up forthe rudeletter from Ms Keck She certainly could have been more polite in writingto you                                       CharlieMcDannald Fort Walton Beach Fla            DearCharlie            You werekind to let Prudie know of your solicitous sentiments She has
