a skill that is learned Until it is perfected we younguns rely onbusiness magazines and books as to how to interview In fact I have used boththe Tell me about yourself and Why do you want to work here lines verbatimbecause I was following the experts advice about what makes a goodinterview                                       What the gentleman may have perceived asamateurish and obnoxious could have been a combination of nervousness andinexperience Here was an obviously experienced man coming into this youngupstarts company probably extremely welldressed and with credentials earnedbefore the CEO was even born It is quite humbling for me to have people withmuch more experience than I call and ask to be considered for aposition                                       I am sorry that thewriter didnt get a call back but there still could be an opportunity thereHe could call back and offer to be a mentor This would give both parties achance to learn about each other Better yet start a business as aprofessional mentor in his area of expertise charging a monthly retainer forthe privilege of calling him to ask questions whenever they wish He has somuch experience and as shown by the last interview there are a lot of us outthere who could benefit from it                                       Future Young Entrepreneur of the Year in Canada                        Dear Fu

when attempting to interact withwomen Its not that they necessarily dislike me nor I them its just thateverything feels so uncomfortable Prom is coming up and I am currentlywondering whether or not to ask anyone Everyone around me is telling me I HAVEto go but it just seems like an uncomfortable hell Yet if I dont go I fearI will regret it for the rest of my life Any suggestions                                       Sincerely                                       Apprehensive  Slate reader since age                         Dear Ap            To be  and experience difficulties interactingwith women means that emotionally and developmentally you are still workingthings out Everyone does not hop into the boygirl thing with ease andcomfort What supposedly comes naturally can take awhile to arrive            That everything feels uncomfortable may mean thatyoure more than normally shy and insecure Or it could mean that youre morethan normally shy and insecure Time will reveal what is comfortable As forthe prom there is no need to push yourself into something you would be just ashappy skipping Plus it sounds as if you have no one in mind            You are  Prudie isnot Trust her that if you decide to do an end run around prom night you willnot decades from now be bemoaning that fact            Prudie promisingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I work with a guyIve tried to befriend In fact I even introduced him to the woman hes goingto marry The problem is that he does things like inviting me to lunchthenwhen Im trapped in his carsays he needs to run errands first He evenreturned one of those gripsqueeze things Id given him because he wore a holein it and it was spilling the stuff inside Is he just a jerk And if so howdo I continue my friendship with his fiancee whom I still like                                       Split Loyalty in San Rafael Calif                        Dear Split            Prudie is never sure what the word jerk meansThis chap however sounds like a clod and certainly someone deficient in thesocial graces and good sense departments If you choose to continue with himyou might try to fluff up his social skills by example An instance might be ifhe tries the luncherrands stunt again simply request that he do his choreswithout you because your intention was to have lunch If he is a super boor andtries to override you request that he stop the car and let you out            Your friend hisfiancee may be a lost cause as a continuing friendship if you call it a daywith Mr Clunk Thems the breaks kiddo            Prudierealistically
