            okay   yeah how many times have you called or or participated   uh this im about my fifteenth call   okay i im a little less than that i was going to call this week i forgot about it just until i was going to do it tonight uh i have i was i called i think every day last week and i forgot about this week i got so tied up with some other things   yeah   i got about ten i think   yeah well lets see our our topic is uh elections   voting   uh uh the reason i think the elections are are so low and im not sure what they mean by eligible voters are they talking about people that have registered or people that are are old enough to vote but havent registered   oh yeah im sure i would think they would talk about people who are already registered and and uh you know the ones that are on the rolls already you know   yeah   im amazed myself sometimes ive got some ideas and theyve tried a few things but  you first   yeah uh well i think one of the reasons uh only fifty percent or so vote in the national is uh well for one thing just just uh having to get to the polls   yeah   because a lot of people work and not every place will give you time to get off to go to the polls   yeah yeah i im kind of with you in fact i even think that the theres a conspiracy i wouldnt call it a conspiracy but you know if you really wanted uh you know hundred and hundred million people to vote why would you have voting from seven oclock in the morning to seven oclock at night for a national election   yeah   to me you need to have two whats wrong with having two days uh Thursday Friday or three two and a days Thursday Friday and Saturday or something you know where people can vote uh i dont think theres a  i dont think theres a lot of politicians want a heavy vote out because uh i can agree in local elections elections which usually are on Saturdays and im not too sure thats the best idea i think maybe you should have it you know Friday noon till Saturday so that people who i like do things during the week   yeah   and i might do it and i i really think that they dont try you know i i really think its obvious the answers to me is just to have longer you know have at least two days for a national election my goodness   yeah and either that or all either have also uh uh second shifts   right right   because a lot of people work uh you know hours that oh they may have two or three hours there that they could either go before or after work   right   but uh uh that pushes some people   well yeah the seven oclock in the morning to seven oclock at night is is usually the average time that most workers go to work you know   right   and im amazed by that that uh the only good thing theyve done lately is have these uh uh elections uh what do they call it when you can vote ahead of time uh   uh absentee   uh absentee and ive done that and actually weve got some high turn outs here in Arlington on some of the absentee because you can vote like two Saturdays before or something like that   yeah   but i think its amazing that they they keep complaining about people not voting and and national elections should be more than one day i mean i dont see how you can have tens of or hundreds of thousands of people that you know just cant quite make it on that particular day for one reason or another you know   yeah yeah   two days to me doesnt seem to be too unrealistic for a national election   yeah and as far as local local elections are concerned  pardon me  i can understand you know why a lot of people dont vote on those because in the first place not many people are are really that knowledgeable knowledgeable about what the uh what the uh candidates are for or against   right   and uh uh a lot of the uh uh what do you call them not bonds but uh   yeah the bonds we had some here in Arlington recently but   yeah a lot of the bonds and uh other things that youre voting on people just dont know really what the whole things about   yeah i i dont really know why you have uh uh you know in a small city or whatever medium size city you have a couple hundred thousand people eligible you know and you get ten thousand to vote i dont have an answer for that i think that uh       it is apathy without question uh we are we are not taking it as serious as   yeah yeah   the people who have lost their rights and everything overseas and everything and i think uh i dont know how to change that   plus   i always try to vote for those and but i and there are some that if when they have them on Saturday ill say all right im going to work im going to go vote this afternoon and then ill get busy and if no one reminds me then i will forget so im not too sure course i guess thats part of being apathy too but i do try to vote in every one but uh   yeah   i dont i dont have an answer for the local elections and why you have ten percent of the people voting thats really so low im amazed   plus yeah plus i think a lot of people are just flat disgusted   oh that too that too yeah   uh uh not realizing the way you change it is to vote   yeah   but uh   but i think in national elections uh again it should be the time is definitely against the people i think you ought to have two days youre voting for president   yeah   uh why is it so sacred to have it on Tuesday and uh why couldnt it be Friday and Saturday i dont know what the ideal day is if youre trying to catch a weekend or maybe just Tuesday and Wednesday ill bet youd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there and they uh tell you the the that who won before seven thirty and before the elections before the polls are closed   yeah   and i think they jump in way way too early i think that ought to be restricted somehow   yeah   uh they will not restrict it but they just ought to not release i dont know i dont know what districts are releasing the numbers to these newsmen that they can predict uh i i thought the polls had to be closed before you were allowed why would you release it to the newsmen first i i dont even know how the news media get these numbers from the polls i would think that ought to be sacred and and until its all over   plus also i im sure that theres a legitimate reason for it but i dont understand uh personally why you have to register as a Democrat or Republican or whatever and then being being able only to vote in that that race that primary   that primary uh yeah i dont   i i can see in one way that the right people would try to cancel out votes   yeah   uh but uh   well i think you can say you are an independent too but i dont know uh     yeah   yeah i havent thought about that much i ive uh wondered about it but i havent really got concerned about it one way or another you know   yeah   uh what that holds back or anything   yeah   but youre right it it that that is a funny rule at least uh   yeah   men and women can vote its amazing that we can still look overseas and see you know this thing in Saudi Arabia and all and they still dont allow women to vote it is still amazing of course we we dont have such a wonderful history that   yeah   you know we didnt allow Blacks to vote uh and we didnt allow women to vote until i dont even know what the year was for women   yeah   nineteen nine or something like that when was that   yeah     so well were changing at least at least were trying and and maybe this absentee thing will will take a hold and uh get more people to vote   yeah and im not im not real sure what the well i guess i do what the purpose was i started to say what the purpose of the registration is uh it seems like to me they could use uh either your drivers license or your social security number or something like that because   umhum   a lot of people dont vote because they didnt register   yeah i dont know why       well i think it ultimately i could see why you wouldnt register necessarily when youre eighteen or nineteen because you dont get around to it but i i think that people should register you know after a year or so i dont its not really that hard uh i havent thought that people dont vote because theyre not registered i really think uh of course that apathy too you dont bother to register   yeah   uh i am amazed i dont have an answer for why the numbers are so low   yeah   yeah i think youve got to have a good fight you know you have to have a lot of controversy   well i guess its kind of like watching a ballgame uh or or sports if youre not if youre not interested in the game you wouldnt you dont care whether you see it or not   right or if its close you know you like to see them close you dont like to see someone just totally run away with it and in football in a football game or anything even if youre for one team or the other you always like to see lets have a good game which means you want to see a close game you know   oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   so if theres no controversy if youre not worried about whos going to win if you think its going to be a shooin then uh you know you dont vote so uh   yeah   but at at least i guess were so far ahead of some of the other countries uh that weve still got a better system and and we are we have been doing this for two hundred years so uh uh i guess its still better that a lot of others   yeah i i think usually as a general  rule the best man wins most of the time   yeah yeah it is surprising how uh uh even with low numbers uh   although i was a Goldwater man  and he didnt win   yeah well i here in Arlington we had this baseball thing and it was a big controversy and everyone was talking about it yet the voting was so low it was unbelievable and they were spending a lot of money   yeah   you would have thought we would have had close to half of the people in the city voting for this that was going to raise your taxes and it was like twenty five thousand or something like that you know   yeah   so that part of it is still uh theres something that people for some reason they dont really want to vote uh   yeah   and maybe maybe absent maybe you ought to be able to do it on your telephone you know i mean i dont know   yeah yeah i think uh if they made it a little more convenient they might get more votes   yeah yeah and it may come to that you know with the electronic age   yeah   yeah you put in your code
