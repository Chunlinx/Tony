                    Background        High affinity humoral immune responses to most protein        antigens require cognate interactions between        antigenspecific T and B cells Antigenspecific T cells        encounter antigen presented by dendritic cells that migrate        to the paracortical regions of draining lymph nodes after        initial antigen contact     Only dendritic cells have        the capacity to induce activation in resting peripheral T        cells      Once activated differentiated T helper        cells contact antigenspecific B cells and provide signals        for B cell differentiation via CDCD interactions as        well as by the production of cytokines              Consistent with this general understanding of the induction        of antibody responses to protein immunogens good antibody        responses to synthetic peptideepitope constructs have been        shown to depend on the presence orientation and        multiplicity of the T cell epitope in the construct                As a confirmation of this finding with synthetic        epitope constructs most protein immunogens studied to date        contain multiple T cell epitopes for example                    T helper epitopes have become common components of        synthetic vaccine constructs due to their ability to        provide immunological help for both humoral and        cellmediated responses        T cell epitopes        that can induce helper activity by binding to a wide range        of HLADR alleles have been developed by a number of        investigators using various antigen systems              T cell epitopes that have the property of binding across a        wide range of HLADR haplotypes are necessary for the        construction of synthetic vaccines that would be useful in        the human population as a whole DNA and peptidebased        vaccines have become popular due to the comparative ease of        construction the circumvention of potential safety issues        around attenuated organisms and for their potentially        enhanced immunogenicity compared to heatkilled and subunit        vaccines       DNA vaccines have the added        attraction of efficiently priming both humoral and        cytotoxic cell responses a property largely lacking in        subunit and attenuated organism vaccines Priming of        cytotoxic cell responses is necessary for the design of        therapeutic cancer vaccines as well as for viral vaccines        Multiple antigen peptide vaccines can also be designed to        contain T and B epitope regions from numerous protein        antigens derived from a complex infectious agent which        could therefore confer broad protection without the        potential dangers of an attenuated whole organism vaccine            However it is of note that occasionally a        welldesigned peptidebased vaccine can elicit strong        antibody responses to the synthetic immunogen that do not        confer protection from the parasite to which they were        originally designed     This may be due to either the        induction of an inappropriate antibody isotype in the mouse        strain used or to an inadequate overall response        While subunit vaccines have their inherent shortcomings        they carry the added benefit of potentially inducing        complex antibody responses to multiple sites on the whole        protein immunogen Subunit vaccines are of interest in the        prevention of parasite infection    and for a variety        of infectious diseases     An ideal subunit vaccine        for the induction of protective antibody responses would be        a protein from the diseasecausing organism that was        minimally modified from its original structure to retain a        variety of potential B cell epitopes In addition the        modified subunit vaccine would be designed to be highly        immunogenic by the addition of promiscuous T cell epitopes        To this end we have characterized the immune response of        partially outbred Hartley strain guinea pigs to two related        bacterial proteases The two bacterial enzymes studied        represent important industrial enzymes used in a number of        applications including serving as an additive for laundry        products and animal feed processing These enzymes have        been well characterized as to their activity and        specificity by us and by others      While these two        proteins are approximately  homologous at the amino acid        sequence     one of the proteases was significantly        less immunogenic than the other Reduced immunogenicity was        characterized as significantly lower titers of        antigenspecific IgG when animals were immunized with the        same amount of the enzymes We determined the T cell        epitopes in both of the proteases using mer peptides and        splenocytes from immunized animals In order to be        classified as an epitope the average proliferative        response to a peptide had to reach a stimulation index of         Two regions met our criteria as epitopes in the        immunogenic protease We tested a total of  guinea pigs        and found no epitope regions in the less immunogenic        protease A sequence comparison of the enzymes in the T        cell epitope regions revealed that a single amino acid        change could confer a T cell epitope onto the        lessimmunogenic protease This variant was constructed        and was found to be a functional and stable protease        Immunization of Hartley strain guinea pigs showed that this        single amino acid change created a T cell epitope where        there was no detectable epitope before and the presence of        this epitope correlates with an improved immunogenicity in        the variant Finally we show that the variant induces        broadly crossreactive IgG antibodies and that priming of        animals with the variant protein results in higher titers        of antigenspecific antibody upon subsequent immunization        with the parent enzyme                    Results                  IgG antibody titers from B lentussubtilisin and          BPN YL guinea pig immunizations          Female Hartley strain guinea pigs were immunized with          two related bacterial proteases           B lentus subtilisin and BPN          YL These two bacterial enzymes share  homology at          the amino acid level They are also comparable in their          proteolytic activity and specificity      Animals          were immunized every two weeks with a  ug dose of          enzyme in adjuvant Serum samples were drawn prior to          each immunization over a tenweek period Serum samples          were tested for antigenspecific IgG antibodies by ELISA          Titers were calculated for each animals antibody          response Averages for four animals are presented in          Figure  The titers over time are presented as serum          dilution B and as Log titers A Immunization with           B lentus subtilisin induced higher          titers of antigenspecific IgG than BPN YL after           weeks The response to           B lentus subtilisin reached          maximal levels by about  weeks At the  to  week time          points titers leveled off and the average titers induced          by immunizations with           B lentus subtilisin were about           fold higher than BPN YL           B lentus subtilisin remained more          immunogenic at doses from  to  g not shown          Overall maximum titer levels vary but the difference in          immunogenicity between           B lentus subtilisin and BPN YL          has been seen in three separate guinea pig studies This          difference in immunogenicity has been noted by others          using an intratracheal method of immunization                                        T cell epitope mapping of B lentussubtilisin and          BPN YL          Splenocytes from immunized guinea pigs were used to          determine the position of T cell epitopes in           B lentus subtilisin and BPN          YL  animals were tested for each immunogen mer          peptides offset by  amino acids were used at  M and          were tested at least in duplicate for each immunized          animal Peptides eliciting a fold or higher average          proliferative response over the background response were          considered T cell epitopes These epitopes are shown in          bold in Figure  Two T cell epitopes were found in  of          the  guinea pigs immunized with           B lentus subtilisin but none          meeting the criteria of a threefold increase in          proliferation over the background were found in the           animals immunized with BPN YL in this experiment p            nonparametric Student ttest Notably the first                    B lentus subtilisin epitope has an          analogous region in BPN YL only the first amino acid          is different It was hypothesized that if the first          valine in the analogous BPN YL sequence was changed          to an isoleucine a T cell epitope analogous to the one          found in           B lentus subtilisin would be          created A modified BPN YL VI enzyme GP was          prepared with this single amino acid change Figure                                    Enzyme activity and stability          Enzymatic activity has been implicated as a source of          the allergenic property of Der p the major dust mite          allergen       In order to account for this          variable the enzymatic activity of the variant protease          GP was compared BPN YL Proteolytic activity was          determined in a standard sAAPF hydrolysis assay The          activity of GP was found to be approximately  of          the parent BPN YL enzyme Figure  Another factor          that could influence the immunogenicity of a proteolytic          enzyme is the relative stability of the protease If the          protease remains active for a longer period of time any          effects of the activity would be comparatively magnified          The halflives of both enzymes were tested at C over a          hour time period to assess relative stability The          assay was performed at physiologic pH   At various          time points the proteolytic activity remaining in the          samples were tested At  degrees and a pH of  BPN          YL has a halflife fiftyfive hours longer than GP          These results indicate that the two enzymes have          comparable stability and efficacy Comparable enzymatic          activity and stability suggest that the variant molecule          has a similar tertiary configuration as the parent                          Tcell epitope mapping BPN YL versus          GP          Hartley strain guinea pigs were immunized with  g          per dose of either BPN YL or GP every two weeks          After  weeks epitope mapping was performed as described          using the BPNYL mer PepSet and splenocytes from          the primed animals Figure  In addition proliferative          responses to the intact inactivated BPN YL enzyme          were tested Immunization with GP resulted in an          increased proliferative response to whole protein          BPNYL The average stimulation index proliferative          response to enzymeproliferation in control cultures to           ug of whole protein was  versus an average

stimulation index of  in any of the          animals tested n   This is consistent with our          previous results for this enzyme using splenocytes from          animals immunized with  ug per dose of enzyme every two          weeks for  weeks Four out of five of the GP          immunized animals responded with stimulation indices of          greater than  to the modified epitope region in BPN          YL peptide  The average response to this peptide          was approximately  Peptide  is offset from the T          cell epitope described in           B lentus by  amino acids This is          a result of creating linear mers from the two          sequences where there is a  amino acid contraction in           B lentus subtilisin as compared to          the BPN YL sequence Primed splenocytes from guinea          pigs also respond to peptide  that is  amino acids          offset towards to Nterminus and subsequently overlaps          with the T cell epitope region The creation of a T cell          epitope in BPN YL also resulted in the display of a          complex set of weak epitopes in the molecule Peptides           and  induced average responses over the  animals          that reached an SI of approximately  Five peptide          regions induced average responses of approximately           Therefore creation of a strong T cell epitope in this          protein initiates an immune response that leads to the          diversification of T cell responses to other regions of          the molecule                          Antibody titers with BPN YL and GP          In order to test whether the modified enzyme could          induce higher titers of antigenspecific IgG now that it          carried a strong T cell epitope guinea pigs were          immunized with increasing doses of BPN YL or GP          Serum samples were taken every two weeks and titers were          calculated Average titers for four animals per group are          shown in Figure  Immunization with the modified enzyme          resulted in higher titers of antigenspecific IgG at          early time points in the immunization protocol Figure          a At later points during the immunization protocol          lower doses of the variant induced higher titers than the          parent Figure b c d At four weeks the  ug dose          GP induced an average serum dilution titer of           versus no detectable IgG in the BPN YL immunized          animals This difference between GP and BPN YL has          a p value of  when calculated using a twotailed          nonparametric Students ttest By ten weeks the          difference is no longer detected at the  and  g doses          but there is still a tenfold difference in titers at the          lowest dose                          Linear B Cell Epitopes BPN YL v GP          A potential explanation for the increase in antibody          titers is that the modification in GP results in a          conformationally distinct molecule with unique surface          regions thereby increasing the total number of antibody          binding sites Guinea pig serum samples from animals          immunized with  g of enzyme were used to determine the          position of linear Bcell epitopes in BPN YL Figure           The serum samples were drawn at  weeks and whole          protein titers are shown in Figure  Serum samples from          four animals immunized with BPN YL and four animals          immunized with GP were tested on biotinylated mer          peptides offset by  amino acids Serum was diluted           for all tests Guinea pig IgG was detected with          HRPconjugated antiIgG The average optical densities          for each peptide were divided by the background The          average result for each peptide is shown The linear          Bcell epitope regions recognized by both polyclonal          serum samples are similar The amino acid modification in          GP would be in the region of peptides  to  If          the amino acid modification produced a B cell epitope at          this site it does not crossreact onto the unmodified          peptide regions tested here The regions of the BPN          YL molecule detected in this assay are predicted          external loops Dr Richard Bott Genencor International          personal communication The major regions recognized          peptides  and   and  and  and  are          equivalently recognized by both serum sets Of the           regions of the molecule showing an average twofold          increase in IgG binding over the background  of these          regions are detected more strongly by the GP sera           peptide regions are uniquely detected by the BPN YL          serum and  are uniquely recognized by the GP serum          There is a shift in one epitope region from peptides           where the GP antibody epitope runs from peptide           to peptide  and BPN YLs runs from peptide           to peptide  This  amino acid shift forward indicates          a slight difference in protein folding This difference          has little apparent effect on the other antibody epitopes          delineated by this assay This assay demonstrates that          GPspecific IgG antibodies readily crossreact with          BPN YL linear antibody epitopes                          BPN YL and GP Priming Immunizations          It was of interest to determine whether increased          titers of IgG antibodies to BPN YL could be induced          by priming animals with the T cell epitopecontaining          variant Four sets of four guinea pigs were immunized          with  g of enzyme over a sixweek period in series The          animals were immunized three times once every two weeks          This protocol was chosen to correspond with the titer          data presented in Figure  Group A was immunized three          times with BPN YL Group B was immunized first with          the GP and then twice with BPNYL Group C was          immunized the first two times with the GP and the          third time with BPN YL          Finally Group D was immunized all three times with          GP Two weeks after the last immunization serum          samples were taken and ELISAs were performed to compare          titers All ELISAs were performed using the parent          enzyme BPN YL as a plate coating reagent Results          clearly show once again that immunization with GP          induces over fold higher levels of antigenspecific          IgG than the unmodified parent enzyme Figure  The          difference between group A and D was highly significant          p   In addition a single immunization with          the T cell epitope modified variant GP is sufficient          to induce higher levels of parentenzymespecific IgG          after subsequent immunizations with the unmodified parent          enzyme While the average titer increased by          approximately twofold the difference between group A          and B was not statistically significant Each group          contained only four animals with appreciable scatter in          the individual responses Two immunizations with GP          prior to immunizing with the parent enzyme did not          improve the titers as compared to a single priming          immunization with GP This result suggests that          priming with the variant enzyme can induce higher levels          of crossreactive IgG antibodies than immunization with          the unmodified variant alone This experiment also          confirms that GP immunized animals produce high titers          of IgG that crossreact on the whole BPN YL          molecule                            Discussion        We have shown that a single conservative amino acid        change in a bacterial subtilisin enzyme can create a strong        T cell epitope in our guinea pig model Immunization of        guinea pigs with this modified variant results in an        improved crossreactive immune response to the unmodified        parent enzyme in both antigenspecific IgG antibody        production and T cell proliferative responses The improved        immunogenicity of the variant was not related to changes in        the proteolytic capacity of the enzyme because the variant        exhibited  of the activity of the parent enzyme The        introduction of a single T cell epitope apparently allowed        for the diversification of T cell responses to the protein        because multiple epitopes were found in the BPN YL        sequence after immunization of animals with the variant        Figure  An increase in the complexity of the T cell        response is consistent with an increase in overall antibody        titer to the enzyme as more T cell helper activity is        potentially available The antibody responses to the        variant and parent enzymes were shown to be largely        overlapping indicating that the increase in the antibody        titers seen were not due to the addition of a novel        structure capable of being recognized by unique antibody        specificities This is shown by the last experiment where        priming with the variant enzyme increased antibody titers        to the parent enzyme upon subsequent immunizations        It was of interest that the unmodified protease induces        antigenspecific IgG in the absence of detectable        immunodominant T cell epitopes BPN YL may possess weak        T cell epitopes that are below our limit of detection in        our cell culture assay Our criterion for an epitope was an        average stimulation index of  In addition it is        notable that both of the immunogens tested display        considerable proteolytic activity The proteolytic activity        of the parent enzyme could be responsible for inducing T        cell independent B cell differentiation via a number of        different mechanisms       Finally we have seen        than both chemically inactivated and an inactive variant of        the parent protease used in these experiments are incapable        of inducing IgG in a mouse model data not shown The        proteolytic activity of these molecules also acts as an        adjuvant for specific IgG production            The ability to induce improved immune responses by the        subtle changes described here could have a number of        potentially vital applications The use of a T cell        epitopemodified whole protein immunogen confers a number        of advantages The first advantage is the priming of a        diverse immune response to the protein that allows the        generation of both a complex and robust T helper responses        and secondly the concomitant affinity maturation of the        antibody response to naturally occurring antibody epitopes        This is especially relevant to the design of subunit        vaccines for malaria and schistosomiasis where high titers        of high affinity antibodies are usually the best defence        against invading organisms       Creating T cell        epitopes in expressed proteins has been demonstrated here        for Hartley strain guinea pigs and for various inbred        strains of mice      Interestingly the introduction        of T cell epitopes from a henegg lysozyme or ovalbumin        into mouse TNFalpha also resulted in an increased        crossreactive antibody response in mice     However        the protein construct was no longer cytotoxic for L        cells suggesting that the modified protein was not in the        correct tertiary configuration Incorrect tertiary        configuration could lead to the production of specific        antibodies that do not crossreact with the native        molecule T cell responses to the variants were not well        characterized In this paper and in the report from        Tsujihata    T cell epitopes were created within the        molecule of interest without affecting the activity of the        enzyme We created a naturally occurring T cell epitope by        comparison to a related protein In addition we found that        the creation of a T cell epitope in BPN YL resulted in        a complex pattern of T cell response to the enzyme The        challenge of utilizing this technique for the creation of        subunit vaccines for the human population will be to create        T cell epitopes within a protein of interest that will not        have deleterious effects on the activity or the stability        of the protein of interest and that would be effective        across a number of HLADR haplotypes            The improved antibody response measured in this paper        was increased titers of guinea pig polyclonal IgG We did        not measure potential differences in guinea pig IgG        isotypes Changing the interaction of peptide MHC class II        molecules T cell receptors and other antigenpresenting        cell specific ligand interactions to foster stronger        higher affinity T cell signalling has been shown in mice to        skew T cell differentiation from Th to Thlike patterns                      Differences in        Thdifferentiation patterns have downstream effects on the        type of immune response mounted and in particular on the        isotypes of antibody expressed This has been well        documented for mice and humans but less is known about Th        differentiation in Hartley strain guinea pigs        In our system we cannot distinguish if the amino acid        change we have created has its effects on binding to the        guinea pig MHC interaction with the T cell receptor or        more efficient processing of the epitope from the protein        precursor     Any or all of these mechanisms could        contribute to the enrichment for peptidespecific        proliferative responses seen in vitro        The ability to up regulate antibody and T cell responses        to whole protein immunogens by the modification of T cell        epitopes suggests that the converse would also be possible        Down regulation of T cell responses to functionally intact        enzymes would have obvious implications for both existing        and potential protein therapeutics                    Conclusions        The immunogenicity of an enzyme can be increased while        maintaining the majority of its stability and proteolytic        activity by incorporating a single amino acid change The        variant enzyme was found to have a major T cell epitope        where none existed in the parent In addition to the        increased cellular response humoral responses were        increased at low doses and as well for high doses early in        the immunization schedule Enhancing the T cell response to        an enzyme in addition to the humoral response has        applications in the construction of recombinant vaccines as        well as in proteinbased therapeutics                    Materials and Methods                  Protease enzymes          GP was created by sitedirected mutagenesis of the          sequence of BPN YL and expressed in
