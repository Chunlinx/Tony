        okay um       i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldnt want everybody to have guns and i think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody In fact you know i cant imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose um so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family id rather have some restrictions put on weapons   umhum   but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh uh activity those would be fine but when you get into um a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes we need to put restrictions on them   um thats probably i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think um   umhum   i definitely think that there some things shouldnt be limited like like you said rifles and um hunting rifles and probably handguns for people who use them to   umhum exactly for for self protection sure   right and but i think the i think  semiautomatic weapons people say they use them because it for sport but i i personally cannot see any use for them other than uh for for for only like people who just like have some sort of crazed   i cant imagine that yeah umhum   you know ambition to use have high powered weapons or something   to do massive amounts of killing uh yeah   right and i mean you can only how much do you want   the only thing i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is uh uh you know going to kill a massive amount of people or uh somebody thats escaping thats uh very dangerous   umhum   semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down but um   right   you know i i think of my family uh theyre very much into sporting and uh you know as far as hunting and also like uh clay pigeons   right umhum   things like that so they have may have some shotguns they may have other types of uh hunting type things but i figured if the if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what im saying versus a   right yeah   you know a small handgun um that can be you know put right in your coat pocket and nobody would see it but yet you cant stop people from having you know a handgun in their home   yeah thats true right   even if there are small children around theres you know you cant say people with small children cant have guns and people without small children that may have grandchildren you know still have these guns but   umhum yeah right   um i guess i i was always taught number one a gun isnt a toy   right   um you know and i dont know if that makes a difference if the parent sits down to them and say this gun can kill you know and dont ever play with it   umhum right   um so i dont know if that makes a difference or what but   well i think partly uh in that case i think that cases like that its definitely um i think if youre to say okay we have to get rid of them all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad it its um its saying were too   umhum but criminals would get them i mean even if they had to go across borders to get them   right right and people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished and people who   umhum   and theyre saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that youre not smart enough to teach your kids how to how to uh   how to use you know to make sure that guns are put up as something as uh not a toy yeah because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that but um   right right umhum right   i never had an interest in them being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns   umhum right   and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasnt a toy   right   and of course we were quite young and we went through uh the National Rifle uh Club and so we were taught   umhum   you know kind of at a a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay if you gonna learn how to shoot a gun youre going to learn how to do it correctly and youre going to learn how to have safeguards and   umhum   and know how to protect yourself but yet have this you know training so that kids arent you know they have to have a certain respect for it   right well i think i mean we i grew up in a family and and my father had two guns because he used to hunt years ago but   umhum sure   stopped before really before i was old enough to remember but and i knew we had the guns in the house and the the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time   umhum sure yeah   but we it was never my brothers and sisters nor i never i mean none of us ever thought well lets go look at the gun or lets go get the gun out it was just something you knew was there and the it was your fathers and you you that was not something youd go and play played with at all   yes yeah   and i think maybe uh and thats the type of the thing that should be you know stressed   yeah i think so and and i dont know if the kids nowadays are different than what i i cant explain
