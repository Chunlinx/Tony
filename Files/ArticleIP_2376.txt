                                 Insufficient Funds            The folks in Bill ClintonsWhite House see Novembers election as a replay of Ronald Reagans electoral triumph But they may be overlooking a more obvious parallel RichardNixons landslide in             Until his campaign movedinto gear Nixons popularity like Clintons until recently was lowstuck atthe nemesis figure of  percent as Theodore White recounted in TheMaking of the President   But again like Clinton Nixon was fortunatein the choice of his opponent By fall of  in full contest with thehapless George McGovern Nixon was enjoying  percentplus popularity            ThoughNixon had no Gennifer Flowers growing in his home garden he had been plaguedby allegations of unethicalor at least unattractivebehavior dating back tohis earliest political days in California Still while the public might thinktwice about buying a used car from either Tricky Dick or Slick Willie mostpeople seemed willing then as now to make an independent judgment about theincumbents ability to governespecially when weighing it against the capacityof his challenger            Both presidents came into their secondterm electioncampaigns having governed against type Nixon the Republican proposed toestablish a federally guaranteed income for all families with children Heextended the foodstamp program nationwide and established a federal benefitfloor for the elderly and disabled Urged on by a Democratic Congress hesigned a pile of biggovernment initiatives These included a  percentincrease in Social Security benefits plus automatic costoflivingadjustments the black lung disability benefit program for miners andcreation of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration            Grants forlowincome housing programs needy college students the arts and humanitiesurban renewal mass transit community health and worker training gushed fromthe federal Treasury When inflation jumped in the summer of  Nixon didntfool around with balanced budgets tight money or other conservative nostrumshe slapped on wage and price controls  he had remarked a few monthsearlier            Democrat Clinton on the other hand having setoff leftward at the start of his first term soon reversed course Under strongpressure from the GOP Congress in his third year in office he submitted a planthat purportedly would balance the budget in seven yearsat the price of deepdomestic spending cuts Later on the campaign trail he declared his devotionto school uniforms youth curfews tough crime control and kiddiesafe TVprograms Where Nixon would have doubled family welfare rolls Clinton signed abill that promised to deny benefits to most welfare recipients after fiveyears The era of Big Government is over Clinton proclaimed in his State of the Union address            Thechallengers to both presidents were undermined by the rise of noisy extremistsin their respective parties who alarmed many mainstream voters For McGovernit was the hard left abetted by the hippie fringeBella Abzug along withAbbie Hoffman For Dole it is the religious right and noisy populistsRalphReed with Pat Buchanan looking over his shoulder The  Democratic platformwas a wish list compiled by every liberaleven radicalgroup in the countrywho carried their banners across the floor of that years party conventionSouthern whites and bluecollar workers deserted the party and itsfundraising capacity was debilitated for years to come among big donors andsmall givers alike            The GOP had its  convention under far better controlbut the fractures made evident during the contentious primaries were no lessdeep Debarred by his own party from running on his record of fiscal and socialmoderationand with Clinton preempting much of the conservative agendaDolesought as McGovern had in  an eyecatching proposal to set him apart fromhis competitor            And like McGovern Dole wasenticed into an untenable choice not by his partys fringes but by ostensiblyresponsible establishmentarian elements For McGovern it was the liberalprofessors of Yale and Harvard who persuaded him to embrace his misbegottenaperson demogranta cashwelfare plan that would have put half thecountry on the take For Dole the damage was done by a coalition of pinstripedsupplyside enthusiasts and Nobel laureates from Chicago Harvard andStanford These worthies lured the redinkwary Dole into espousing anacrosstheboard  percent taxrate cut that even the average voter not tomention most of Wall Street could spot right off as a budget buster            With theeconomy rebounding smartly from the brief  recession and inflationtemporarily in check even the unpopularity of the raging Vietnam War couldntshake the power of Nixons incumbency McGoverns big blip in the polls cameearlier than Doles postconvention gain His gap with Nixon according toWhite narrowed briefly to  percentage points after a string of primaryvictories The disastrous Democratic Convention however left McGovern a thenrecordsetting  points in the hole Dole got a bounce out of thewellorchestrated Republican Convention but soon fell back into a doubledigitdeficit With the gap still of landslide proportions in most polls Dole hasbeen written off correctly or otherwise by the pundits See this weeksHorseRace            Finally lest their opponents weakness notsuffice to produce a landslide both incumbents got further help from athirdparty candidate Nixon from George Wallace who drained white Southernsupport from the Democrats and Clinton from Ross Perot who likely will drainwhite suburbanites from Dole            Beyond the election theparallels may break down Nixons Watergate sins dismissed by the public onthe eve of the election as at most the work of overzealous campaign aidescaught up with him in his second term Clintons Whitewater and assorted othertroubles having been more thoroughly aired in his first term may have runtheir course In any case its hard to imagine Clintons vice president AlGore accepting bundles of cash in his White House office as Spiro Agnewdid            Its not so hard howeverto imagine the GOP following the pattern set by the Democrats after pulling themselves together momentarily to field a winning centrist candidatefour years laterand then thwarting his ability to govern as the Democrats inCongress did Jimmy Cartersthereby producing an era of domination by theopposition for the next two decades
