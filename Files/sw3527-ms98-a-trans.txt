                 okay do you do you have a home or are you in apartment okay so do you have to do a lot of garden work   uhhuh i have a home not really we have a a small back yard and small front yard but um   uhhuh   um i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding and he mows the lawn because the lawn mowers too heavy   oh okay   thats another story  and um and uh i do the edging and stuff like that but um it doesnt take us that long because our our yards so small but um i try and do as much you know flowering as i can and   uhhuh umhum   that kind of stuff the seasonal things   umhum yeah uhhuh   but um and well i think we have one of the nicest yards in the in the neighborhood   well thats nice  i wish i could say that       ours is pretty small too but it it takes about an hour with the two of us working to you know do the bushes and and all of that sort of thing um the worst part is controlling the weeds   yeah yeah oh yeah   which i hate because we dont like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a dog and and you know hes gonna be out in the yard and who knows what he eats out there but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway   thats true   uh hum what else i get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that sort of thing   i dont  no he does that   no oh okay well if if they go up like one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof and i i went up on the roof once and ill never do it again   uhhuh yes oh oh God   i decided i was afraid   yeah i dont blame   so this year he got lazy so i said fine ill put some on the bushes and thats about it thats all it it gets   yeah huh   but   okay we dont have that many bushes to put them on um our our yards are very uh narrow and so we have some bushes but we dont have too many but we have a nice tree in the front and   umhum umhum umhum   uh we have people that an association that comes and mows everybodys front yard and um they keep hitting hitting it the tree with the lawn mower you know every time you do that you   oh wow oh no uhhuh   it it um kind of kills the tree for a while and so thats kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again   yeah oh   and we started mowing our own lawn because they were doing that and so anyways we have a nice full tree now and and we put our we usually fill it with lights and that kind of thing   umhum umhum umhum umhum   so and they would um they also edged and they would edge into into the shrubbery and oh gosh it was getting really bad so we   hum oh but you still have to pay for it though even though theyre not gonna do it   yeah because its an association fee   oh is it real expensive   yes its like seventy a month   oh okay oh my goodness   yeah and it i dont like i i just get really upset every time i make that check out but um   yeah well do do they do other things for yall   they take care of the um landscape because we live in a culdesac and theres a island in the middle and so they care of that and theres a pool and they take care of the pool and and theres a pond they take care of the pond and the park area and that kind of thing and so youre   umhum umhum umhum   basically paying oh and the sprinkler system that that our yard doesnt have a sprinkler system but the island does and um certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems and   uhhuh umhum   and so that way if someone moves out the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing you know so   hm but you knew when you moved in youd have to pay that didnt you   well it it it went up since we pay and thats the bad thing i just hope it doesnt go up any more because we just cant afford it anymore i dont know what to do if you cant afford it   oh yeah i dont know either thats interesting   so um but theyre thats what they do they take care of basically the front yards and unless you dont want them to do it and   umhum now do they do things like plant bushes and trees   they only only in like in the common areas and then the island but they dont do it in your yard   oh okay so theres like no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that   right uhhuh yeah so weve added bushes and and shrubbery too   umhum yeah when we moved into our house i just hated the bushes they had and i i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back and put new ones out front but that was a lot of work took me a long time   i know yeah yeah  thats what we did when we first moved in too just rearranged some things   umhum yeah and then then we put in a sprinkler system and we wont go through that again i will pay someone to do it oh it took so long   oh oh really oh   because my husband was you know digging the trenches because he didnt want to get a trencher you know there the machine thatll do it because he knew so many people that broke it through their water main or their gas main doing it   oh yeah   and i guess that costs you an absolute fortune   oh thats true so gosh you did it manually huh oh yeah oh God   by hand yeah yeah but it works great now that weve got it yeah its nice   i bet yeah thats a good investment there   yeah well we needed to because were having some foundation trouble and you know you have to keep the the area moist around the house or it makes it worse so we had an incentive there   oh oh   to do that
