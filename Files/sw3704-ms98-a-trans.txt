                what was the topic   uh just about um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years   i said uh right right yeah   and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field   well thats a good one i hadnt thought about that yeah   that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home   yeah really   and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers werent at home   uh oh there there was a stigma attached to it   yes and uh but nowadays its just so common   and and a necessity   a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that ive had children ive stopped uh working   yeah   that its kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i dont have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check   uhhuh yeah really i well i hadnt thought about it i can see i i think if they asked me for a work number id just write down my home number you know because thats where you work   uhhuh right   yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i i thought well you know in a lot of different ways i i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much its changed i mean uh uh i live in Houston but im im in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami its i mean honestly English is almost a second language now   umhum yes   uh you know with all the uh influx of uh  South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh i i guess a majority in Miami you know of course in Houston uh youve got the people from Mexico so thats certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh   thats true   the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed  so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and and now i mean its you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country   uhhuh right   plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that were doing what were doing tonight uh you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted   umhum umhum right   uh you know thirty years ago uh  a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event   yes thats true   and and and you know and it wouldnt be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i dont know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i im not sure of that   right no and it wasnt like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and its its pennies but for them its just a socialized behavior   oh yeah thats right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh  i dont want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event   umhum umhum   and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month theyd have a stroke     thats true  thats probably true   but you know its something that ive just i mean i factor that in i mean thats thats part of my budget i mean i expect to have you know a seventy or eighty dollar phone bill and quite frankly am pleased if its anything below that   umhum right me too   yeah   well thats good in in in our homes we all have a lot uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago   oh well and you know microwaves   right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and     oh ive got yeah i mean ive im single and i have three televisions you know and i really theyre two well   umhum   one of them is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and ive got another one i bet i havent turned on in six months i mean its there you know     uhhuh   and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones   right we load up on all of the conveniences and theyre not special to us anymore just a   um thats right thats right   necessity and theres the people who dont have televisions are are uh you know unusual in our society   yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know its a big uh issue ive run across a few people before that that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh dont own a television and of course you know people look at them yeah like yeah you know but   umhum umhum     and its its it would be really quite frankly even though i am not
