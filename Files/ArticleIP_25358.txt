one nasty little country invading alittler but just as nasty country So what does Sen Moynihan think ofAmerican intervention to stop nasty little Yugoslavias invasion of littlerbut almost as nasty Kosovo Hes a hawk            Conservative columnistCharles Krauthammer declared before the Gulf War If a small heavilymilitarized regime can stand up to a global blockade and the opprobrium ofthe entire world  and still emerge intact and in possession of the fruits ofits aggression the message to every other potential aggressor and victim willbe clear There are no rules in the postCold War world            So whats Krauthammers view of the small heavilymilitarized Yugoslav regime that is standing up to a global blockade and theopprobrium of the entire world He would leave Yugoslavia intact and inpossession of the fruits of its aggression Hes a Kosovo dove            Kosovo is performing a zoological alchemy onAmericas foreign policy leaders Hawks have mysteriously become doves doveshave inexplicably become hawks Kosovo has upset the traditional taxonomy andreplaced it with what appears to be chaos            But its not chaosHeres who is where on Kosovo and how they got

includes other Democratic legislators who opposed theGulf War The Europeanists are pragmatic rather than moralistic about KosovoBiden opposed intervention in Somalia Haiti Lebanon and Kuwait But heshawkish on Kosovo because its in Europe and Europe unlike the Persian Gulfand East Africa is a vital American interest America Biden likes to say isa European power The Europeanists are also NATOists They say NATO will beruined if it doesnt stop Milosevic so the United States must support thealliance            The Europeanists claimsare somewhat disingenuous Its hard to argue that benighted bankrupt Kosovois a more vital American interest than oilrich centrally located Kuwait Sothere is another unspoken reason why the Europeanists favor intervention aDemocratic president

every Americanmilitary operation from Grenada to the Gulf War Sen Paul Wellstone ofMinnesota is a preeminent Liberal Humanitarian The Democratic senator opposedthe Gulf War because Saddam Hussein is no Hitler and the control of Kuwaitioil was not a cause worth dying for But Wellstone favors Kosovo interventionto stop the Holocaustlike atrocities occurring there            The Liberal Humanitarians are a product of thepostCold War peace During the Cold War liberals shunned militaryinterventioneven humanitarian military interventionbecause such adventurismcould provoke conflict with the Soviets and tended to buttress thuggishrightwingers The end of the Cold War has freed them to pursue humanitarianends The United States now can be the worlds policeman so itshould be            A

                  The CredibilityFanatics                        Henry Kissinger is theintellectual leader of the Credibility Fanatics They are conservatives whofundamentally detest US involvement in Kosovo and have little interest in themorality of the issue They dont believe Kosovo is important enough to fightfor they wish we had never gone to Rambouillet and they think it will be ahorrible ugly conflict But while their Kosovo instincts are dovish they areReal hawks pronounced rayall Now that the president has committedUS forces we must win If we dont the credibility of NATO and the UnitedStates will be shattered Unsurprisingly Republican Sens John McCain ofArizona and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska the Senates leading veterans areCredibility Fanatics                            CasparWeinberger                        Weinberger a kind ofconservative counterpart to the Europeanists deserves his own category HisWeinberger Doctrine which precludes US military action except in absolutelyvital cases of national security would seem to bar any Kosovo interventionBut Weinberger has declared that the Balkans are a vital nationalinterest because they were at the heart of two world wars Hence the UnitedStates should interveneand with overwhelming force                           Hawks IntoDoves                                        TheNeoIsolationists                        Many Republican senators belong in this categoryincluding Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Deputy Majority LeaderDon Nickles of Oklahoma During the Cold War these conservatives were hawksbelieving the United States should intervene promiscuously to reverse communismKrauthammers Reagan Doctrine Now that theres no Evil Empire theybelieve the United States shouldnt intervene militarily unless nationalsecurity is really at stake            The Neos cite three reasons for their Kosovodovishness First Kosovo is not a vital American interest It has nocommercial or strategic value Second unlike Iraqs invasion of Kuwait theSerbian rout of Kosovo is a civil war and the United States should not involveitself in civil wars We leave sovereign nations alone Third and morepreposterously Sen James Inhofe of Oklahoma claims that interceding on behalfof Kosovars demonstrates a EuropeanAmerican bias in American foreign policyWhy dont we help the Rwandans and the Sudanese Krauthammer fits in theneoisolationist category but not perfectly Click for why            The NeoIsolationistsare not entirely insincere They really do believe Kosovo is tooirrelevant to national security to risk American lives But theres alsoanother major reason they have turned dovish Democrat Bill Clinton ispresident and they side against him reflexively                            ThePaleoIsolationists a k a Turtledoves                        They are the mirror imageof the Liberal Humanitarians Pat Buchanan is their champion Like the Neosthey are Cold War burnouts They were ferocious Cold Warriors but they favoredmilitary action only to defeat the communist menace not for any greater moralpurpose Now that there is no menace they have withdrawn into their shellsThe Paleos believe almost nothing justifies intervention these days Buchananopposed the Gulf War on the grounds that it was irrelevant to Americas vitalinterests Any oil price increase caused by Iraqs takeover he claimed wouldhelp the United States by hurting Europe and Japan If the invasion of Kuwaitdidnt qualify as a vital interest then a civil war in Kosovo certainlydoesnt Unlike the Neos the Paleos are not against the Kosovo bombing forpartisan reasons They would oppose US involvement even if a Republican werepresident                            The IsraelAnalogists                        This is less a group thanan undercurrent No one has explicitly adopted this position The closest thereis to an advocate is New York                Times columnist AM RosenthalPalestinian advocates have exploited the Kosovo war by likening Serbianviciousness against Kosovars to Israeli cruelty toward Palestinians The IsraelAnalogists would turn that comparison around Rosenthal for instance opposesthe Kosovo bombing partly because the Serbian army and the Kosovo LiberationArmy are morally equivalent in their brutishness Just as thePalestinianIsraeli conflict is more complicated than the Palestinian cartoonof it so too the SerbianKosovar war is subtler than it seems Rosenthal eventacitly compares Serbs to Israelis Serbs are as likely to give up Kosovowillingly because the Albanians want it as Israelis are to give up Jerusalembecause the Arabs want it The subtext Serbia has as much right to Kosovo asIsrael does to Jerusalemnamely a lot            Not all hawks and doves have changed placesConsider                            TheConservative Moralists                        This group includes BillKristol and his Weekly Standard  Jeane Kirkpatrick and otherneoconservatives These folks are Reaganites who did not give up Reagansimperial moralistic vision when the Cold War ended They dont believecommunisms defeat ended Americas global obligations The United States shouldstill strike boldly against authoritarian oppressors The ConservativeMoralists are less concerned with the national interest than with whats rightThe Standard  for example editorializes that Republicans should supportKosovo action unless they want to become the party of callous indifference tohuman suffering                            The OldSchoolLefties                        The rest of the left may have turned hawk onKosovo but a few diehard doves remain The                Nation  for examplehas written extensively against the war A recent cover story argued that thebombing was dubious because a the United States was just as brutal in Vietnamas the Serbs are now b the United States ignores similarly horrific ethniccleansings in Turkey Rwanda etc and c US policy is being driven bycorporate interests Its reassuring to know that some things indeed neverchange
