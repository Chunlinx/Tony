                                 The Hipness Is All            Peoplemake a mistake in supposing hip to mean stylish Hip is aselfconsciousness Nathanael West offered an example of it in his short novelThe Dream Life of Balso Snell  by writing this            An intelligent man findsit easy to laugh at himself but his laughter is not sincere if it is thoroughIf I could be Hamlet or even a clown with a breaking heart neath his jestersmotley the role would be tolerable But I always find it necessary toburlesque the mystery of feeling at its source I must laugh at myself and ifthe laugh is bitter I must laugh at the laugh            Butthats not all He also laughed at the laugh at the laugh and so on untoeternity The selfburlesquing quality in the truly hip is relentless whichmeans that hip is a tragic condition From this point of view life must havebeen hard for Nathanael West But it is true that hip is amusing            West wrote only four novels before dying in an auto crashat the age of  in  The last of those novels The Day of theLocust  was filmed in  which makes it the most famous of his titlestoday But the key to understanding him lies in the first of his novels TheDream Life of Balso Snell  which took three years to write from  to and ended up  pages long The Dream Life is wild Wests heroclimbs into the anus of the wooden Trojan horse and goes wandering through itsintestines having adventures He meets a little boy who shows him hiswritings and he meets his old writing teacher Miss McGeeney who shows himher writings The little boys writings turn out to be by Miss McGeeney andthe hero and Miss McGeeney end up having sex And so forthwith the effectbeing exactly as promised by the manifestoes of Surrealism a work of totalrealism            For youfeel in The Dream Life  that West has filmed a jerkycamera record ofhis own dream life and that each new ridiculous scene represents a furtherunfolding of an altogether real and plausible personality The personality isnervous fearful sexually frustrated to the point of hysteria terrified ofwomen and perhaps mildly homosexual But it is also too rigidly imprisoned insardonic literary references or in the movies or in popular clichs ever topenetrate its own deepest emotionswhich in any case are too shameful to beacknowledged The personality is not unlike Kafkas except with lessintellectual intensity which is too bad and with American inflections whichis wonderful Perhaps there was something Jewish in the stylethough West whowent to the trouble of changing his name from Weinstein which in those dayswas a good idea from a career perspective even in Hollywood where he wrotehis screenplays might not have appreciated the ethnic emphasis            The Dream Life of Balso Snell seems to have taughthim the rudiments of literary form and in his next two novels MissLonelyhearts  and A Cool Million  he funneled thishalfhysterical personality of his into some reasonably disciplined yet fullygrotesque story linesin the case of Miss Lonelyhearts  the noir dailylife of a cynical Christian advice columnist and in the case of A CoolMillion  the adventures of a Horatio Algertype character I suppose thatMiss Lonelyhearts should count as Wests masterpiece due to thefantastic procession of importuning advicehounds that traipses across itspagesa procession of battered wives crippled cuckolded husbands syphiliticchildren rape victims and deformed teenagers whose sufferings could breakyour heartexcept that Wests demeanor makes the whole thing slightly funnyas in a sick joke Theres much to be said for the tone of comicbook violenceHe buried his triangular face like the blade of a hatchet in her neck            But ACool Million is in its modest way the most perfect of his books Thenovel is strictly a sendup of American patriotic inspirational literature Ayoung hero sets out to earn his fortune and save his aged mother from evictionHe passes through every station of the uplift narratives He meets a beneficentbanker and patron falls in love with the girl next door traverses the UnitedStates Every word in the novel plunks the tinkly piano keys of a dime novelBut the American land of opportunity that goes reeling by in the backgroundturns out to be a nightmare of freefloating violence and organized fascismbrilliantly imagined by the way until the America of A Cool Millionhas outdone in scariness even the America of Kafkas Amerika  Westshero loses his thumb his teeth his leg his scalp and his nose and thecreepier his sufferings become the funnier is the book sad to say            Its hard to imagine that West could ever have written aconventional novel with any success He tried in The Day of the Locust with its more or less realistic story of Hollywood down and outs butmostly he succeeded in placing a veneer of hardboiled literary conventionsover his manias about women and sex which makes him seem just as crazy as inhis other books but less aware of it therefore less entertaining The Libraryof America edition of his writings edited by Sacvan Bercovitch includes in aspirit of thoroughness random essays and stories that the author neverfinished some screenplays and a few letters to F Scott Fitzgerald EdmundWilson and other literary figures These have their points of interest Mydear Mr Fitzgerald You have been kind enough to say that you liked my novelMiss Lonelyhearts  I am applying for a Guggenheim Fellowship            But those first three novelsshow us everything that is appealing about West He had the kind of neuroticsardonic satiric manic and generally ic personality that I imagine was notso common  years ago for who else was like him in American letters I cantthink of anyone only to become mandatory today So he was prophetic too Thetest of time has never been an accurate gauge of literary genius Greaterwriters than West have been doomed to fade with the years Time does tell ussomething though In the case of Nathanael West it tells us that earnestnessages and hip is ever fresh
