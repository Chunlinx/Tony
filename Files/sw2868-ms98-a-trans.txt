                okay uh have you did you have you grown up in Dallas Stephanie   uh no ive only been here for the last ten years uh   oh where are you from   i grew up most of my childhood in Germany   in Germany   uh and we we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance   well now theres a place id like to visit   so we we traveled all over Europe   oh thats neat   when i was when i was very young unfortunately a a little bit too young to really appreciate   uhhuh   uh i was grade school age uh   my husband my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war and so weve seen lots of pictures of the of the beautiful spots and areas yeah   uh uh that that would be a to me a really nice vacation because im im not in physical shape for something like that but uh   yeah   i i sure would work on it  if i had an opportunity like that     yeah thats neat neat  what kind of vacations do you like   uh well my husband and i are scuba divers   oh huh   so we both like to go to dive resorts uh we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon   uhhuh   and we dove there uh but we we did about six dives while we were there and uh we were originally planning on going to Cayman   oh uhhuh   uh last year   uhhuh   uh but we werent able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have like eleven people for this package uh deal   uhhuh oh uhhuh yeah   uh and we couldnt get enough people together uh to go so it ended up falling uh falling through we were going to get a really good price   yeah when when our children were younger we enjoyed we lived up in uh New York   uhhuh   or or New Jersey and and used to like uh traveling into upstate New York and camping   uhhuh   and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing but weve never really uh did any diving or anything little bit of sailing of uh uh  oh   snorkeling   water skiing   oh really   but not much of uh   um   of anything else uh   well my husband and i both like water so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that   uhhuh its got to be the water when when we were in Jersey we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot its really they had   yeah we   a really nice beach areas there   after we moved away from Germany we moved to New Hampshire   uhhuh   and i lived there for seven years   oh i see   uh and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close we like the we like the white mountains and   thats a really pretty area too uhhuh no   uh unfortunately i didnt really get to go skiing much while i was there i went skiing once   yeah we loved the we loved the the New Jersey area too because the  the lakes were really pretty close you know you could   uhhuh   you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really and then we werent too for from the Appalachian Trail we did quite a bit of hiking which is kind of fun   uh   are you a you a hiker or not not so much huh   not not really so much if if if there was some place that that we went to where there was hiking involved i i would be you know happy to go hiking but we we never have really planned a vacation around uh places to go hiking   uhhuh so your your next your plans are try to find someplace to scuba scuba dive   yeah our next vacation will will be scuba diving im sure   you have any children   no not yet   okay then thats probably one of the reasons our we had little children all the time so some of the things are not as quite as uh adaptable yeah it is   yeah yeah its a its a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have have children   you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too and so i think what   yeah yeah and diving is something that especially for small children uh i think the the minimum age for diving is   yeah   is probably legal anyway would be probably about sixteen   eleven or twelve i would think probably but maybe fifteen even i know that uh   yeah   uh one of one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family you know we go wherever somebody is that we havent seen for a while  so that thats kind of uh we just   uhhuh   came back from uh uh Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate   um   from uh with his Masters degree in social work and so that was fun and and the summer we have a we have a a reunion in in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities   uhhuh   where were going to camp for a week with as many members of of a rather large reunion group that uh as we can get together so   that that sounds like a lot of fun our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too   yeah yeah   that there were several hundred uh people and they all kind of met at a central place i i didnt go   um   uh but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation   we weve traveled weve moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a   uhhuh   a small camper weve weve traveled in a big one i hate them  because theyre hard to jockey around you know but maybe a pickup with the back on   something or something like uh whats the like the Volkswagen Vanagon ive heard is really nice   yeah so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes but you wouldnt want to do it all the time   yeah   uh we have enough friends here and there i would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and you know   uhhuh my dad has been talking for years about uh getting a fifth wheel   uhhuh   and just picking up hes retired uh hes in his sixties and he uh   uhhuh   would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just   yeah   you know not be settled anywhere just see see the rest of the country   yeah i think it is i think that would real and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but but have your home base where your home is   uhhuh   and then just travel out for like maybe oh a month maybe go   he he does that quite a bit he he hasnt lately though uh because hes been ill   and yeah   uh but hes been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and you know hell say this is my itinerary im going here here and here and ill be back in about two months   yeah there are a lot of neat neat places to visit in America thats for sure weve i havent been much to the south i havent been in in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama i guess thats those are the only states i have not visited but uh up the coast uh at uh uh in Maryland and around there where the where the early history is theres some Johnstown and uh in some in that area is just really neat interesting things to so you know   uhhuh have you been a to a lot of the different historical sites   yeah we took a trip uh around to the uh Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something i believe it was uh had about three kids then i think but that was a really fun interesting trip i   uhhuh   we we read Bruce book before we went you know and so we were ready to look up the places we read about it was really interesting   yeah i i think right right now while my husband and i dont have any kids well probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and and adventurous types of things and then when we eventually when we have kids   yeah yeah yeah   now his his folks did a lot of traveling across country you know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that   yeah well now camping is fun with kids if youre you know once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones but even even some little ones do pretty good but but when they get a little bigger so they can help that thats a fun way to  to uh cut costs and its enjoyable too very restful   yeah yeah yeah i i do enjoy camping   i mean i find yeah i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of a change   as long as i have a shower nearby im fine  and electricity   yeah  well im with you i need my creature comforts too well it was great to talk to you   yeah it was nice talking to you too Beth   okay see you later byebye   okay byebye
