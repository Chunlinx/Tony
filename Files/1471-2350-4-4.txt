                    Background        Dilated cardiomyopathy DCM is a disorder characterized        by fourchamber dilation of the heart DCM is often        progressive and results in reduced heart function and        congestive heart failure Although etiologically diverse        inheritance is a significant contributor to the development        of DCM Supporting this mutations in a number of different        genes have recently been associated with familial forms of        DCM     and mutations in the gene encoding lamin AC        appear to be a significant component Lamins A and C are        two different proteins produced by alternative splicing        from the same gene They are identical along their first         amino acids and differ only in their carboxyl terminus        As specialized proteins of the intermediate filament        protein family lamin AC is found at the inner nuclear        membrane where it forms a scaffold that interacts with a        network of membrane bound and nucleoplasmic proteins in        addition to chromatin       Mutations in the gene        encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin produce        autosomal recessive Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy a        disorder that phenotypically overlaps the neuromuscular and        cardiovascular features seen with lamin AC mutations            Consistent with this lamin AC directly binds emerin             Lamins A and C are broadly expressed in many        different cell types and are primarily expressed in        terminally differentiated cells It is not known how        mutations in         LMNA lead to tissuespecific        phenotypes        The first autosomal dominant form of cardiomyopathy was        mapped in  to the centromeric region of chromosome             Linkage was achieved using genetic and clinical        material from a large wellcharacterized kindred            One of the striking characteristics from this family was        the degree of cardiac conduction system disease that        primarily targeted the atrioventricular node             Many members of the kindred exhibited sick sinus syndrome        atrial fibrillation and sudden death        In addition to DCM with conduction system disease and        variable skeletal muscle involvement mutations in the        Lamin AC gene OMIM  have been shown to cause        autosomal dominant    and autosomal recessive           EmeryDreifuss Muscular Dystrophy EDMD autosomal        dominant limbgirdle muscular dystrophy type B LGMD            autosomal recessive type  CharcotMarie Tooth type             familial partial lipodystrophy             Mandibuloacral dysplasia    and HutchinsonGilford        progeria     The phenotypic spectrum from DCM to EDMD        and limb girdle muscular dystrophy appears continuous        However the mechanism by which         LMNA mutations lead to cardiac versus        skeletal muscle disease is unknown        We now evaluated a woman with DCM and sinus bradycardia        Her immediate family history was significant for        symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation        She is a member of the kindred initially described by        Graber         et al     We screened this        individual for mutations and found a novel mutation in exon         of         LMNA  This two bp deletion is        predicted to disrupt the reading frame and produce a        truncated lamin A and C                    Methods                  Patient recruitment          Written and informed consent was obtained in          accordance with the University of Chicagos Institutional          Review Board Clinical data were obtained through          evaluations performed at the University of Chicago                          Genetic Analysis          DNA extraction from blood was performed using PureGene          according to the manufacturers recommendations PCR          primers were designed to amplify all twelve protein          coding exons of           LMNA Table I DHPLC analysis of          each exon was carried out on a WAVE Transgenomic exon           was analyzed at C with  acetonitrile          SSCP was performed using MDE FMC as described              Direct sequencing of PCR products was completed using          cycle sequencing To confirm the presence of the          mutation PCR products were purified and digested with          AlwN I                            Results                  Phenotype Analysis          A  yearold Caucasian woman with a history of          paroxysmal atrial fibrillation sick sinus syndrome          dilated cardiomyopathy and fatigue was seen in the          University of Chicagos Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic          for evaluation and treatment The patient is a member of          a large kindred previously described       The          patient was evaluated by EKG Figure  that demonstrated          marked sinus bradycardia and first degree          atrioventricular block An echocardiogram showed moderate          dilation of the left ventricle  cm end diastolic          internal diameter and mild dilation of the right          ventricle The left ventricular performance was estimated          as the lower end of normal with a normal fractional          shortening  Figure  The patient reported no          neuromuscular complaints and on physical exam showed no          overt muscle weakness          The pedigree for this proband is shown in Figure           All affected individuals had undergone pacemaker          implantation for symptomatic bradycardia Her mother          reported fatigue and was also noted to have an abnormal          skeletal muscle biopsy Because of her marked fatigue and          family history of sudden death a dual chamber pacemaker          and automatic defibrillator were implanted Of note the          proband reported an improvement in her fatigue symptoms          after pacer implantation With pacemaker implantation          her baseline heart rate improved from  bpm to           bpm                          Genotype Analysis          All twelve exons of           LMNA were screened by denaturing          high performance liquid chromatography DHPLC and single          strand conformation polymorphism SSCP Figure  In          exon  a two bp CT deletion was detected in the           LMNA gene Figure  The two bp          deletion falls into positions  and  of the NCBI          Accession  NM where  is the first coding          nucleotide This frameshift mutation is expected to          disrupt the lamin A and C sequences after the first           amino acids In addition  novel amino acids          CPAQPAPEAAGSQGGEASRPGGLTGP are added after the          truncation The relatively high proline content of this          additional sequence and the positioning of this          truncation would be expected to disrupt the second half          of the coiledcoil region of the protein An additional           unrelated subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy were          screened by SSCP and DHPLC and found not to carry the          delCT mutation Finally  chromosomes from          control DNA samples were checked and found not to carry          the delCT mutation                            Discussion        Our findings demonstrate a novel mutation in lamin AC        in a proband whose family was previously linked to DCM with        conduction disease and chromosome q locus            Mutations in the         LMNA gene associated with DCM have a        more severe prognosis and higherevent rates compared to        individuals with DCM that do not have         LMNA mutations     A recent        report describing another family with a         LMNA mutation causing DCM and        conduction system disease documents the need for permanent        pacemaker implantation     Previous reports on the        probands kindred support a highevent rate in family        members often resulting in sudden cardiac death even in        family members with permanent pacemakers     For        example ten out of  family members with pacemakers for        highgrade atrioventricular block died suddenly Subjects        with         LMNA mutations should be carefully        evaluated for both pacemakers and defibrillators        It is presently unknown whether autosomal dominant lamin        AC mutations impart their phenotype through dominant        negative or haploinsufficient mechanisms The majority of        reported         LMNA mutations are missense In this        case the mutant protein is thought to be expressed and to        act through a dominant interfering mechanism A smaller        number of         LMNA mutations are frameshifting and        are expected to create truncated lamin A and C In at least        one case a nonsense mutation at amino acid position  was        described     This mutation is effectively a null        allele and therefore dominant mutations at least in this        case would be expected to arise from haploinsufficiency of        lamin AC Of note mice with a null allele in         lmna display a phenotype only in the        homozygous state     The mutation we now describe is        predicted to generate a substantial protein fragment        consisting of the first  KDa of lamin AC The novel        prolinerich sequence that is predicted at the carboxyl        terminus of the truncated lamin AC may further interfere        with lamin function Lamins assemble into a higher order        structure and truncations may interfere with this assembly        The presence of aberrantly assembled lamin filaments may        also interfere with other lamininteracting proteins such        as emerin or nesprin            The exact mechanism by which         LMNA mutations cause disease is not        clearly elucidated at this time However it is clear that        mutations in         LMNA cause tissuespecific disease        affecting various differentiated cells including cardiac        and skeletal muscle adipocytes and neurons This suggests        that lamins role at the nuclear membrane affects both        celltype and tissuespecific processes Currently there        are at least two theories regarding the effects of         LMNA     The first postulates        that disruptions of the inner nuclear membrane affect        heterochromatin scaffolding and thereby gene expression In        this model lamin AC is necessary for the appropriate        expression of tissuespecific genes The second theory the        mechanical stress hypothesis suggests weakness in the        nuclear lamina leaves certain tissues more prone to damage        by force This model was first raised when         LMNA mutations were primarily        associated with disorders affecting striated muscle            Interestingly the preferential involvement of the        specialized cells of the cardiac conduction system may        support less the stress hypothesis as the cells of the        atrioventricular node are less expected to undergo        considerable deformation The additional phenotypes now        associated with         LMNA mutations also favor alternative        mechanisms of pathogenicity        Conduction disease preceded the development of dilated        cardiomyopathy in the probands family      This        indicates the necessity for careful documentation of a        threegeneration pedigree in the evaluation of patients        with conduction system disease paying particular attention        to sudden death arrhythmia and bradycardia Genotyping of        patients with conduction disease and DCM may provide        important information regarding device implantation        Genetic counseling for patients and family members should        always accompany genetic testing as variable expressivity        and age dependent penetrance may influence clinical        decision making                        Conclusions        Individuals with DCM and conduction system disease        should be screened by family history and genetic testing        Those found to have mutations in lamin AC should be        evaluated for placement of pacemakers and automatic        defibrillators in order to prevent the sudden cardiac death        associated with this disease                    Abbreviations        DCM dilated cardiomyopathy        EDMD Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy        LGMD limb Girdle muscular dystrophy        SSCP single strand
