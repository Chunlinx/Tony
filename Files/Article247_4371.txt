                                 Roll Over Diane Keaton                        Dear Jeffrey            Whats misogynistic about saying I dont fall asleep when the Sopranowomen are on screen Youre onto something here The women are another wayThe Sopranos breaks with the past What was Diane Keaton doing in TheGodfather  I always thought Michael married her because she was aWaspbecause she embodied his abandoned dream of assimilation and alsobecause she gave him cover In other words he married her because of what sherepresented rather than who she was and the story never freed her from thatdehumanizing factnever gave her any individuality dignity presence whichmeant that we never felt compelled and maybe even didnt want to watch herExcept in III  and Carmela Soprano and her loverboypriest speak forall of us on that one What the hell was that            Carmelas just the opposite Or at least she used to bethey dont give hermuch to do in what weve seen so far Shes been supplanted by Tonys sisterPavarti aka Janice who as you say is an epic draga bullyingselfimportant unsympathetic bohemian drag But back when the writers wereinterested in Carmela which was the first half of last season she had all thequalities that Diane Keaton lacked She was a real counterweight to Tony andSilvio and Paulie Walnuts and Pussy and all the charm they hold for the likesof you which in a mob context amounts to a giant feminist manifesto EdieFalco does the hardest thing an actor can doshe makes Carmelas suburbandecency both fierce and interesting Carmela sees through Tony but takestender care of him anyway because frankly what else is she going to do Shemay not say muchhey shes supposed to be emblematic of the mobs new yuppieisolation so who would she say it tobut shes plenty smart and aware as welearned when she dressed down Father Paul for being a schnorrer whoplays head games with lonely women because he likes the whiff of sexualityThis being the Sopranos however which lets the moss of goodness gather on noone Carmela can also be a selfdeluded preening Italian JAP There was thatwonderful episode early last year where shes appallingly condescending to anold friend the wife of a restaurateur whos been burned out of his restaurantShe hires the couple to cater some fundraising party then in a roompresumably filled with all their mutual friends waves her friend over as ifbossing around some maid Shes clearly forgotten upon what her higherfinancial status rests though the friend wastes no time reminding her            Which brings us to the Soprano marriage which is as you say compulsivelywatchable Our editor suggested to me yesterday that its a somewhatClintonesque marriageTony has a mistress whom he fucks rather joylessly andwith whom he never has an actual conversation but hes really dependent on hiswife although unlike with our president you have the sense that Tony screwsaround mostly because thats what mob bosses are supposed to do rather than outof real need In another likely Clinton parallel the two of them have a longhistory of hurting each other that makes it impossible for them to get theimportant stuff out there even though their desire to do so is palpable Allthis just hangs around in the air unresolved which makes you wish the writerswould get back to it I dunno Maybe Im just getting my soapopera yayas outwith a nighttime series But I do think their marriage has the rare distinctionon television anyway of feeling like something living breathing andevolvinganother feminist touch in its way            So heres my question to you who know so many mob children as opposed toHasidsthough werent you once friendly with some big Hasidic rabbi Didntyou cover them back in your Forward days before you abandoned thechosen people to hang out with the people you claim are the envy of the worldWhat do you make of Tony and Carmelas kids Meadow and Anthony junior Do youbuy how easily Meadow swallows her fathers bullshit about what he does for aliving even after she has pointedly asked about it I do absolutely I thinkits an excellent dramatization of the weird state of knowingandnotknowingthat mob kids are forced to live in Shes not deceived by her fathers liesas she makes clear in lots of little sarcastic asides But if he actuallyfessed up then shed have to deal with his unpleasant reality which wouldrock her world a little more than shes ready for right now            All this in fact is taking Meadow to the verge of becoming TheSopranos  next great female character As far as Im concerned the bestthing that happens in the second season is a major discovery we make about herin Episode  which for once Im not going to give away Suffice it to say thatshe might not be an unbearably selfinvolved spoiled brat after all though ofcourse shes that too Maybe I just want to see her get in on the action causeI was a huge selfinvolved spoiled brat in my day but I think the girl haspotential            Spoiled or not I was taught enough manners to say It has been a pleasuredoing business with you even if you did chop my herring up and stir it intoonions and cream sauce I find that you are not in fact a mook Quite theopposite            LoveJudith
