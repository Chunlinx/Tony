                                                            Dear Readers                                       Prudence is greatlypleased at the confidence so many of you have shown in her by asking heradvice Sadly she must however return to her needlework now                                       In leaving Prudence wouldlike to offer this last piece of advice                                       Exceptin a very few instances Prudence is neither better informed nor wiser than thepersons who write to her She is able to offer helpful advice only because theproblems described are not hers she is not emotionally involved in them andcan consider them objectively So her advice has two parts First when you aregreatly troubled with a problem you should write it down in the form of aletterwhich you may if you wish address to Prudence The act of translatingthe problem into written words rather than brooding over it endlessly andincoherently will itself be helpful It will enable you to see the problem inits true dimensions Second you should not mail the letter but should read itover to yourself and imagine what Prudence would say You will findnotalways but oftenthat you know the answer As Prudence read the letters shereceived she often felt that the writer knew the answer but only wanted someconfirmation Try it seriously for yourself                                       Prudence fondlybidding you farewell                                                         DearPrudence                                                      How should I respond to arelatively good friend who ridicules my Libertarian attitudes Or to otherpeople who are misinformed about the Libertarian Party                                       I dont bring it up myfriend does I try to change the subject as I am tired of defending mypolitical views to him and to other people Many people dont understandLibertarian philosophies nor do they seem to want to And when people do wantto talk about it they erroneously link Lyndon LaRouche with the LibertarianParty hes a registered Democrat for Gods sake or just reject out of handthe Libertarian Partys principles                                       Anysuggestions                                       Dan the Man                        Dear Danthe Man            This is a common problemYou have no obligation to participate in a discussion that you find fruitlessand irritating Your friend cannot be a very good friend if he persists on thissubject despite your obviously unhappy reaction Also you have no obligationto the Libertarian Party to fight on every street corner in its defense            Youshould tell your friend candidly that you do not want to discuss this subjectIf he persists or takes offense you should find a more congenial friendThere are people who are not members of the Libertarian Party but who areopenminded about it and willing to listen even though you may not be able toconvert them If you are receptive to the ideas of other people about politicsand policy you will find some people receptive to yours            Prudenceopenmindedly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Is a gratuity appropriatewhen dining at a restaurant buffet On the one hand since the server is nottaking and filling meal orders a tip seems unnecessary Yet on the other handthe server is not less likely to be underpaid merely because the restaurantoffers a buffet and so a tip may still be expected And if the restaurantoffers menus in addition to its buffet then the diners are occupying a tablethat might otherwise be filled by customers who order from the menu who wouldpresumably tip normally                                       If theserver brings drinks should one tip based on the cost of the drinks What ifthe server brings only water                                       GratuitouslyChallenged                        DearGratuitously Challenged            The pay awaiter gets is adjusted by the market to the probability of getting tips If awaiter works in conditions where tips are unlikely he will get a higher wagethan if he works where tips are customary other things being equal If you gothrough a buffet line and there is no personal service offered to you excepthanding dishes over a counter you are not expected to tip If you go through abuffet line and the waiter seats you gives you a drink even if water and onewaiter is assigned to you you should give a tip But the tip need not be aslarge as it would be if you got full table service            Prudence tipsily                                             DearPrudence                                                      Areyou my alter ego                                       Prudence my realname                        DearPrudence            Since Idont know your ego I dont know whether I am your alter ego Anyway theworld has more Prudences than it has prudence            Prudence gladly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Youprobably will think this is from a Democratic nut but it is a seriousquestion Why does a responsible political party have a goal of reducing taxeson the rich It seems only logical that those with high incomes should pay morethan those with lower incomes A concern that most rational people should haveis how to equitably distribute the great wealth of this country Taxation ofthe wealthy and assistance to the less fortunate is one simple way Also moneyis needed for many many good purposes What is the Republican Partys rebuttalto this                                       Jon Parkinson                        DearJon            Prudence cannot speak for theRepublican Party who can but she can give you some thoughts on thematter            There are probably someexceptions but in general rich people do pay more taxes than poor peopleGenerally Republicans agree that rich people should pay more taxes than poorpeople The issue that divides people and parties is how much more therich should pay            If A has twice as much incomeas B should A pay twice as much tax or three times as much or four times asmuch That is partly a question of fairness to which simply saying that therich should pay more provides no answer It is also a question of economicefficiency Beyond some point taxation of the rich probably reduces incentivesto save invest innovate and work to a degree that is harmful to people whoare not rich But just where that point is no one seems to know            Why do Republicans generallyanswer these questions in the direction of lower taxes on the rich more thanDemocrats generally do That is one of the main reasons they areRepublicans            Yourquestion also raises the issue of attitudes toward taxation in general SinceReagans victory in  many Republicans have come to believe that offering atax cut for everyone is the sure road to electoral success That idea now seemsto be shared by many Democrats although it did not seem to work in             Prudencetaxonomically                                             DearPrudence                                                      A fewyears ago I dated a guy but he moved and it was hard to keep together so webroke up About four months later he died in a fire Problem is his youngerbrother also liked me A few days ago I saw him for the first time since hisbrother died and he still likes me I kind of like him now too hes grown upa lot since the last time I saw him I just dont know if it would be rude tohis brothers memory to date him Id appreciate any input                                       Needs Help inMissouri                        Dear NeedsHelp            You haveno problem Four months would be long enough to mourn this man even if you hadbeen married to him which you werent Preserving and honoring the memory of adeceased loved one does not require you to give up ordinary activities Thereis room in the human heart for remembering the dead and living with the livingIf you were deeply attached to the older brother or now think you were youwill not forget him Your present attraction to the younger brother may be asign of your appreciation of the characteristics of the older brother many ofwhich the younger one may share            Prudenceconsolingly
