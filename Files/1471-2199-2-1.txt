                    Background        Within the long DNA molecules of eukaryotic chromosomes        some replication origins fire more frequently than others        In most cases it is not clear why certain origins are        preferred In several species howeverfruit flies          Drosophila melanogaster            budding yeast          Saccharomyces cerevisiae              and fission yeast          Schizosaccharomyces pombe          evidence suggests that sequences called replication        enhancers stimulate nearby origins This stimulation is        independent of enhancer orientation and within a limited        range independent of distance to the origin        Replication enhancers in fruit flies control the        programmed amplification extra rounds of replication in        noncycling cells of chorion gene clusters on the third        and X chromosomes On the third chromosome several         cis acting sequences         ACE and         AERa through         AERd  are essential for        amplification    Of these         ACE is quantitatively the most        important Its ability to stimulate amplification is both        orientation and within  kbp distanceindependent It        has been localized to a bp region and the effects of        internal deletions suggest that it contains multiple        partially redundant internal domains   Whether it can        stimulate nonchorion replication origins has not to our        knowledge been tested        In budding yeast replication enhancers have been found        near several different chromosomal replication origins In        several cases the enhancers bind transcription factors            In all cases tested so far budding yeast        enhancers have proved to be originspecific they stimulate        only the origin with which they are normally associated in        the chromosome           The replication enhancer that has been studied in        fission yeast is part of the         ura origin cluster  a group of        three origins called         ars ars and         ars in their order from left to        right upstream of the         ura gene in the left portion of        chromosome III green boxes in Fig      We        recently found that         ars and         ars overlap by  bp between        the         Eco RI and         Hin cII sites Fig    The        overlap region is essential for         ars to function as a replication        origin in plasmids In contrast the bp         Eco RV         Eco RI fragment containing core         ars without the overlap is        sufficient for plasmid origin function However addition        of the overlap region to core         ars dramatically increases its        plasmid origin activity   Moreover although the        overlap region has no plasmid origin activity of its own        it strongly stimulated the plasmid origin activity of all        other tested origins          ars and         ars  and it did so in a        relatively distance and orientationindependent fashion          For these reasons we call the overlap region a        replication enhancer yellow RE in Fig  We consider        the enhancer to be a functional part of both         ars and         ars  We found that the enhancer        could not be substituted by a DNA fragment of the same size        and base composition but different nucleotide sequence          This observation suggests that specific nucleotide        sequences within the enhancer are required for its        function        Previously we characterized sequence elements within        core         ars that are important for its        activity as a plasmid replication origin   Now we have        asked whether the sequence elements previously identified        as important are also important when core         ars is combined with the        replication enhancer to form extended         ars  We have also determined        which sequences within the enhancer are most important for        its ability to stimulate         ars                     Results                  Effects of deleting consecutive bp stretches          throughout extended ars          To determine which nucleotide sequences are most          important for core origin and enhancer function we          constructed consecutive bp deletions throughout          extended           ars  To simplify production of          these deletion mutants we destroyed the           Eco RI site between the core           ars and the enhancer and          introduced a           Cla I linker see Materials and          Methods This manipulation did not cause any detectable          change in plasmid origin activity data not shown All          deletions were constructed in this altered plasmid They          are called  Their locations are shown in Figure           which also shows the positions of the inactivated           Eco RI site light orange          highlight and of the introduced           Cla I linker yellow highlight          Note that  are located in core           ars and correspond in position          precisely to the bp deletions previously studied in          this region            Figure ashows the average values of four independent          transformation experiments with constructs containing          from left to right intact extended           ars Ext bp deletions           core           ars lacking the replication          enhancer and vector alone All results were calculated          relative to the values generated by extended           ars  Blue bars indicate          relative transformation frequency number of colonies          generated per  ng input DNA and gold bars indicate          the relative average areas of the transformed colonies          which is a reflection of colony growth rate In general          the more efficiently a plasmid replicates the greater          the number of transformed colonies and the faster those          colonies grow under conditions that select for plasmid          maintenance      Notice that the replication          efficiencies of all the deletions except  are          greater than those of intact core           ars core Fig a which was          the subject of our previous study            For comparison purposes the results from our previous          study of core           ars are displayed in Fig b          In the previous study we measured replication efficiency          only by the transformation frequency assay blue bars          The results were expressed relative to those obtained for          intact core           ars  Note that our new results          Fig a show that the transformation frequency of          intact core           ars is only about  that of          extended           ars  Thus the heights of the          blue bars in Fig bare exaggerated compared to those in          Fig a The previous transformation frequency results          Fig b revealed that the  regions are important          for the transformation activity of core           ars  and the  and           regions are essential Our new transformation frequency          results blue bars in Fig a show that in the context          of extended           ars with its replication          enhancer none of the bp deletion regions within the          core is individually essential for transformation          activity and only the  region is important          As discussed in detail below we have found that when          plasmid origin efficiency is generally high colony size          measurements are more sensitive indicators of small          differences in origin activity than are transformation          frequency measurements For that reason we interpret the          colony size reductions produced by deletions           Fig a to indicate that these deletions cause a small          decrease in plasmid origin activity even though these          deletions have no effect on transformation          efficiency          Thus the transformation frequency and colony size          results show that sequences within the enhancer partially          or completely suppress the negative effects of deletions           on the plasmid origin activity of core           ars  The simplest explanation          of this observation is that sequences within the          enhancerin combination with other core sequencesare          partially or fully competent to carry out each of the          replication functions mediated by each of the bp          regions within the core Note that the enhancer must work          in combination with the core because the enhancer by          itself has no plasmid origin activity            It is interesting that deletion  which is part of          the core but was not previously tested due to a cloning          problem   has a slight stimulatory effect on colony          size implying that region  may be a mild suppressor of          plasmid origin activity The stimulatory effect of          deleting region  is more obvious in the double and          triple deletion analyses to be presented below Fig                    The results in Fig aalso indicate that there is          considerable sequence redundancy within the enhancer          itself None of the bp deletions within the enhancer           reduces transformation frequency Therefore          none of these regions is uniquely essential for enhancer          activity However some of the deletions           moderately reduce colony size indicating that each of          the corresponding regions  makes a modest unique          contribution to enhancer activity                          Comparison of colony size measurements with plasmid          retention rate measurements          In Fig awe used both transformation frequency and          colony size to evaluate plasmid origin activity          Transformation frequency is the standard assay for          plasmid origin activity in           S pombe     Colony size          measurement is usually more reproducible than          transformation frequency measurement compare the error          bar sizes in Fig a but colony size measurement is a          newer assay and not yet so widely used              Furthermore the results obtained with the two assays are          not identical Two of the mutants studied in Fig a          and  produce elevated transformation frequencies          combined with slightly reduced colony sizes Other          mutants   yield normal transformation          frequencies and significantly reduced colony sizes Only          in the cases of  and core           ars are transformation          frequency and colony size simultaneously reduced          For these reasons it seemed important to check the          validity of colony size measurement by comparing it to an          alternative wellestablished indicator of plasmid origin          activityplasmid retention rate under selective          conditions reviewed in   Plasmid retention rate is          the proportion of cells containing plasmid during          exponential growth in selective medium To simplify our          measurements we divided the mutants into three groups          based on the relative colony size data in Fig a The          mutants in group C   and  generated the          smallest colonies   of the area of those generated          by the control which was intact extended           ars  The mutants in group B              produced larger colonies            of control The rest of the mutants were in group A          colony size   of control Then we selected three          mutants from each group and tested plasmid retention rate          in selective medium for two to five independent          transformants for each of the selected mutants          Our results reveal a correlation between colony size          panels on the left side of Fig  see also the relevant          gold bars in Fig a and plasmid retention rate right          column in Fig  The plasmid retention rates of the           tested mutants in group A largest colonies are           for group B mediumsize colonies they are  and          for group C smallest colonies they are  This          correlation suggests that colony size measurement          provides a valid assay of plasmid origin activity in          fission yeast Note however that none of the tested          group A mutants had a plasmid retention rate as high as          that of extended           ars  despite the fact          that both their transformation frequencies and their          colony sizes were equal to or slightly greater than those          of extended           ars Fig a We do not have          an explanation for this discrepancy It is possible that          plasmid retention rate is more sensitive than colony size          or transformation frequency to small differences in the          plasmid origin activity of highly efficient replication          origins We also do not have an explanation for the fact          that the  mutation led to colony sizes in the medium          group B range but plasmid retention rates in the higher          group A range Fig           In the case of origins of somewhat lower but still          high replication efficiencies these and previous          results    suggest to us that colony size may be a          more sensitive indicator of plasmid origin activity than          is transformation frequency These results also suggest          that transformation frequency may be a good indicator of          plasmid origin activity only when replication efficiency          is relatively low Consider for example deletions           In Fig a where the effects of these deletions          were measured in the context of extended           ars with enhancer efficient          replication these deletions had no effect on          transformation frequency but did reduce colony size Fig          bshows that when these same deletions were assayed in          the absence of the enhancer so overall replication          efficiency was much lower each deletion significantly          reduced transformation frequency   Qualitative          results presented in our previous publication            showed that each deletion also reduced colony size Thus          colony size and transformation frequency measurements          seem to vary together when replication efficiency is          sufficiently low                          Effects of larger deletions on enhancer          activty          Because deletions of stretches of  bp within the          enhancer had no effects on transformation frequency and          only mild effects on colony size Fig a we also          tested bp deletions double deletions of adjacent          bp stretches Fig a and bp deletions triple          deletions of adjacent bp stretches Fig b in the          enhancer region          The data in Figs aand suggest that regions           all make individual contributions to enhancer activity          Although individual deletion of region  does not have a          measurable effect Fig a loss of region  along with          region  Fig a does significantly reduce enhancer          activity Regions  and  appear to suppress enhancer          activity Although their individual loss does not have          much effectjust a slight stimulation of colony size           or transformation frequency their loss is          capable of totally suppressing the negative effects of          simultaneous deletion of adjacent sequences  and           or  and  respectively Figs aand           Region  is the bp region whose deletion most          affects enhancer activity Fig a However deletion of          region  by itself affects only colony size In          contrast deletions of two bp stretches  and           severely reduce both colony size and          transformation frequency Fig a Two bp deletions           and  have even more severe effects          reducing both transformation frequency and colony size to          the levels of the enhancerless core within experimental          error Fig b The progressively more severe phenotypes          of single double and triple deletions indicate partial          redundancy of function between the three bp stretches          of which each of the two essential bp regions is          composed                            Discussion        This paper describes the first attempt in any organism        to determine how the presence of a replication enhancer        next to a core replication origin alters the relative        importance of the sequences within the core origin It also        describes the first attempt in any yeast to map the        nucleotide sequences important for function within a        replication enhancer        We have previously shown that         ars is the most active of the        three replication origins in the         ura origin cluster on the left end        of fission yeast chromosome III Fig     We have        also shown that core         ars is no more active as a        plasmid replication origin than is         ars whereas extended         ars is more active than         ars in the chromosome because the        core activity is stimulated by the adjacent replication        enhancer Fig  which is also part of         ars but which has no plasmid        replication origin activity of its own          As a first step toward understanding the mechanism of        replication enhancement we have generated consecutive        bp deletions throughout the         ura replication enhancer Fig         and we have tested the effects of these deletions on the        activity of         ars as a plasmid replication        origin Fig a We also tested the effects of bp        deletions within core         ars  The effects of these        deletions within core         ars had previously been measured        for core         ars by itself Fig b          Here we determined their effects for extended         ars core         ars plus enhancer These        experiments showed that enhancers deleted for each of the        bp stretches within the enhancer were nevertheless        capable of stimulating core         ars  Thus none of the bp        stretches within the enhancer is essential for enhancer        activity However deletion  at the coreproximal end of        the enhancer significantly reduced plasmid origin activity        as measured by the colony size assay Fig a        These experiments also demonstrated that many of the        bp stretches that are important for core         ars function Fig b are not        important for extended         ars function The bp stretch        that proved most important for extended         ars function is region  Its        deletion  in Fig a dramatically reduced plasmid        origin function by both the transformation frequency and        colony size assays Region  contains a stretch of         consecutive adenines in the top strand Fig  Short runs        of adenines and thymines are also present in multiple        locations elsewhere in         ars Fig  These may be        binding sites for the         S pombe Origin Recognition Complex        ORC whose fourth largest subunit Orp contains a        multiple AThook domain which permits it to bind with high        affinity to DNA containing runs of adenines or thymines in        one strand    In fact the largest subunit of         S pombe ORC Orp has been mapped        by chromatin immunoprecipitation to         ars and also to         ars  which like         ars  contains multiple        asymmetric ATrich stretches           We do not yet know the functions of the other sequences        regions  and  thataccording to the results in        Fig also contribute though to a lesser extent than        region  to the plasmid origin activity of extended         ars  What is clear however is        that the functions of all of the bp stretches are at        least partially redundant None of the deletions even         eliminates origin activity In each case other sequences        within extended         ars must be capable of providing        at least a portion of the function of the deleted region        The redundant nature of the sequences within         S pombe replication origins has        previously been amply noted      However        this is the first time that redundancy has also been found        within a yeast replication enhancer         ACE  the amplification enhancer for        the chorion gene cluster on chromosome  of         Drosophila melanogaster  also        contains multiple redundant sequence elements          In an attempt to reduce the redundancy in the enhancer        and identify combinations of bp deletions that        together would completely eliminate replication enhancer        function we constructed double and triple deletions so        that each bp stretch was deleted in combination with        one or two flanking bp stretches to the left and to the        right These analyses showed that the double deletions         and  were especially effective at reducing        origin activity Fig a and the triple deletions         and  were even more effective Fig b In fact        these two triple deletions reduced the activity of extended                ars to the level of core         ars  In other words they        abolished enhancer activity The fact that the enhancer        contains two nonoverlapping essential bp regions         and  indicates that these two regions        cooperate with each other to generate enhancer function        Neither provides complete enhancer function by itself Each        is essential for enhancer function However none of the        three bp regions that together comprise each essential        bp region is individually essential suggesting        internal redundancy within both of the bp essential        regions        What could be the sequences that contribute to enhancer        function within these essential regions Several        laboratories including ours have identified consensus        sequences that are often found in         S pombe replication origins              All of these are ATrich and are asymmetric        in the sense that most of the adenines are in one strand        and most of the thymines are in the complementary strand        Previous origin deletion scans similar to those in Fig         have shown that the regions most important for         S pombe origin function frequently        contain clusters of these consensus sequences             To test whether the         ars replication enhancer is        similarly organized we scanned it for near matches to the        four characterized consensus sequences              We found several potentially interesting consensus        matches within the important portions of the enhancer Fig         In region  the bp region that seems most        important for enhancer function Fig a there is a         match to the consensus sequence identified by Maundrell         et al   which is highlighted        with light green in Fig  Although this consensus like        the three others has not been found to be completely        essential for any tested         S pombe origin a bp linker        substitution in         ars the         S pombe rDNA origin that removes a        Maundrell consensus sequence reduces origin activity about        fold   Consequently there is a good chance that        this sequence contributes significantly to whatever role        region  plays in enhancer function        Spanning the junction of regions  and  is a         match to a bp sequence found by Clyne and Kelley          to be important for         ars plasmid replication origin        activity blue in Fig  In addition region  contains        several overlapping  matches to the consensus sequence        of Zhu         et al    highlighted with        light magenta in Fig  Overlapping matches to this        consensus are also found in region  Fig  which is        highly important for         ars function Fig            These two consensus sequences are therefore good candidates        for playing important roles in the enhancer activities        mediated by regions  and         Note that all three of the consensus sequences and also        many additional regions within the enhancer contain runs of        adenines or thymines and thus are potential binding sites        for         S pombe ORC It has recently been        demonstrated that the         Drosophila amplification enhancers         ACE and         AERd  bind         Drosophila ORC   Thus it is        possible that ORC binding is an aspect of enhancer function        conserved from fission yeast to animals        Testing this hypothesis or any other hypothesis        concerning the mechanism of enhancer function will require        identifying and characterizing the proteins that bind to        the         cis acting sequences described here        During the past decade much progress has been made in        identifying proteins that bind to core origins reviewed in          This progress provides grounds for optimism that        the         trans acting proteins that bind to        enhancers will also be identified in the relatively near        future                    Materials and Methods                  Strains and media                    Escherichia coli DH cells were          used for cloning mutated           ars plasmids The           S pombe strain           ura D            ura D           leu end h    was used as          the recipient strain for transformation assays Cells          were grown at C in EMM   supplemented with uracil          and leucine  mg each per liter when not under          selection or leucine  mg per liter when under          selection for uracil prototrophy                          Plasmid construction          To construct the plasmid pUrascript           ars ext which contains the          extended  kbp           ars   the  kbp           Eco RI fragment containing the          replication enhancer Fig  was cut and bluntended by          treatment with Klenow polymerase New England Biolabs          and dNTPs The gelpurified fragment was ligated with           Cla I linker and then cut with           Cla I and           Hin cII to produce the bp          fragment containing the enhancer   The gelpurified          bp fragment was inserted into the           Cla I and           Hin cII sites of pPCR the          plasmid containing core           ars generated by PCR            The resulting plasmid was then cut with           Eco RI bluntended with Klenow          polymerase and dNTPs and selfreligated in order to          destroy the           Eco RI site at the boundary between          core           ars and the enhancer that was          regenerated during the process of           Cla I linker addition The insert          sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis                          Generation of  bp internal deletions          Deletions  are the same as previously described            To evaluate these deletions in the context of          extended           ars  the bp           Cla I           Hin cII fragment containing the          replication enhancer from pUrascript           ars ext was inserted between          the           Cla I and           Hin cII sites of the deletion          constructs  previously described   For          deletions  the twostep PCR procedure and cloning          strategy described previously    was employed All          primer sequences are available upon request                          Generation of double and triple deletions within          the enhancer region          Double and triple deletions were constructed according          to the same twostep PCR and cloning strategy except          that the choices of internal forward and reverse          primers for the first amplification step were different          For example the rightwardpointing forward primer used          in constructing  and the leftwardpointing reverse          primer used in constructing  were chosen as internal          primers at the first step PCR to obtain the double          deletion  and so on                          Transformation of S pombe cells and colony number          and size analysis                    S pombe D cells lacking the           ura gene were transformed            with equal amounts of DNA  ng from the plasmids          under test All analyses were performed as described          previously    except that transformation plates          were analyzed after  days since the growth rates of          colonies transformed with enhancercontaining plasmids          are faster than those with core           ars alone which was used in          the previous experiment   All results shown are an          average of four independent experiments with standard          deviation shown as error bars                          Plasmid retention rate measurement under selective          conditions          To determine the percentage of exponentially growing          cells containing plasmid the transformants were grown in          selective medium EMMuracil to    cellsml          Then  cells were plated onto selective and          nonselective EMMuracil plates to determine the          fraction of cells containing plasmid
