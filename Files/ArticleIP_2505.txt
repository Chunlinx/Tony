                                 The Long Run of Living Dangerously            The last two weeks inIndonesia culminating in the resignation of its longtime autocrat PresidentSuharto have been exhilarating especially for the thousands of activists whosucceeded in pushing him out Unfortunately it is not yet time to celebrate atriumph for democracy The smart money in the international community isbetting on another round of militarydominated rule even though the popularopposition wants a much more representative government partly to protectitself against the international communitys neoliberal economic agenda Theresulting conflict between economic liberalization and politicalliberalization is likely to be a prolonged one            Tounderstand this next phase of the struggle start with the positions taken byIndonesias most influential trading partners during the crisis From August when that crisis first broke until this May when Suharto finallyimplemented the sharp price increases and subsidy cuts demanded by theInternational Monetary Fund these partners were primarily concerned witheconomic reformbudget cuts currency boards bank regulation and othertechnical policy questions Only at the last minute as Suhartos base erodedand the mass movement threatened to seize power did they rediscover the needfor political reform It was not until the day before Suharto resigned thatPresident Clinton advised him to enter a dialogue with the rest ofsociety            This focus on economic performance has been consistent Onerecalls Clinton dressed in his bright new batik shirt greeting Suharto warmlyat the  AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bogor Indonesia andpraising him for economic leadership The United States also helped Suharto toseize power back in  sanctioned his occupation of East Timor in and basically looked the other way at three decades of oneman rule and serioushuman rights violations After  the United States tried to hedge its betsproviding  million of United States Agency for International Developmentmoney to Indonesian nongovernmental organizations involved in grassrootsorganizing But until this March the United States spent more than that eachyear on training for Suhartos army            AllSuhartos other key First World trading powersJapan Australia GreatBritaindid much the same They had few complaints about his antidemocraticmethods as long as Indonesias growth rates remained high investors got accessto its ample minerals oil cheap labor and market for foreign capital andforeign debts were serviced No one in official circles questioned the way thefruits of growth were distributed or the extreme corruption and environmentaldevastation that it generated No one criticized the fact that Suharto hadsomehow made the Forbes list of billionaires with a personal net worthof  billion or that his friends and family always seemed to be selected aslocal partners by such leading investors as GE ATT Merrill LynchFreeport McMoRan Hyatt and Marubeni Everyone ignored the deepseated ethnicresentments sowed by this systemultimately grounded in the fact thatIndonesias top  families  a majority of whom happen to be ethnicChinesecontrol more than  percent of the wealth The other percent of the population includes millions of workingclass Chinese            In short for three decades the internationalcommunity never bothered to question whether Suhartos system was capable ofsustaining social and political development in the long run His globalsupporters turned against him only when his unpopular administration had becomea threat to the regions stability and just plain bad for business            So nowcomes the long run With Suharto off the stage Indonesias foreign partnersand creditors are eager to turn Indonesias focus back to economic policyespecially the matter of rescheduling its  billion foreign debt andrestarting its stalled IMF program This agendas main political imperative isa strong government that can implement the program quickly A genuine nationalelection that gave the opposition time to organize and prepare an alternativeagenda might mean yet another change of government and costly delaysespecially if an IMF program actually had to be debated by a popular assemblyFar better to have it implemented unilaterally The basic creditor countrypreference is for a kind of Turkish solution a secular state with a civilianface support for freemarket policies and a proWestern if unaccountablemilitary            One basic requirement of this agenda is an alliance withIndonesias military This will be essential to implement the tough medicinelikely to be included in a new IMF programhigher interest rates morespending cuts increased prices more unemployment and renewed debt serviceall at once In recent years the United States and Australia took great painsto cultivate closer relationships with Indonesias military elite notably LtGen Prabowo Suhartos soninlaw and the head of the feared Kopassus specialforces and Gen Wiranto the commander in chief as well as many youngerofficers On his visit to Indonesia last January US Defense SecretaryWilliam Cohen spent half a day with Prabowo at Kopassus headquarters inJakarta The unit has been a leading beneficiary of US training when it isnot busy repressing peasants in East Timor            Indonesia watchers at the IMFbelieve that this civilian facemilitary fist strategy can succeed inIndonesia so long as the military remains united Similar efforts have workedbefore in Brazil  Chile  and Peru now Of coursethere have also been some remarkable failuresthe Shahs Iran for exampleBut Indonesias situation is rather different from Iran in the late s            Indonesias entire economy isnow on life support and the West controls the breathing apparatus Lastmonths riots destroyed the countrys food distribution systemthere are acuteshortages of food and raw materials Ninety percent of Indonesias owncorporations are technically bankrupt and most of the money they owe is toforeign banks The country has been very dependent for management skills onforeigners and the Chinese minority most of whom have now fled Trade andinvestment have shrunk to zero capital flight reached more than  billion inthe last three months and the countrys foreign reserves could be completelyexhausted by the end of June            Indonesias military appearsto be united in charge and armed for bear Just this week it succeeded inintimidating the opposition with a massive show of force in Jakarta Noleftwing colonels have yet appeared to help the opposition at least not inpublic            Mostimportant Indonesias popular movement is not nearly as wellorganized andunited as the opposition movements of Iran or even the Philippines In generalSuharto did a supremely effective job of dividing coopting and simplyeliminating his opponents The Indonesian movement was a rather spontaneousresistance led by ordinary students workers the unemployed and thelowermiddle classes Its only weapon was its now demonstrated capacity tomobilize mass protests and shock the world with violence Many had hoped thatthe daughter of former President Sukarno Megawati Sukarnoputri would play thecentral role that Corazn Aquino did but that has not happened Fortunatelyperhaps for those who favor tolerance and democracy there is also noKhomeinithe leading Muslim organizations are deeply divided            To the extent that the popular movement has anagenda it is precisely the inverse of the international communitys It seeksgenuine direct elections after a period that is sufficient to organizealternative parties and prepare a campaign based on freedom of speech and othercivil rights the right to have free trade unions the release of more than political prisoners debt relief stronger penalties for corruption andpollution no amnesty for Suharto and his fellow thieves and a respite for thepoor from the hardest edges of economic reform But aside from primitiveprescriptions such as cut prices and nationalize the banks the oppositionhas no coherent economic program            This is not to minimize lastweeks extraordinary accomplishment But even though Suharto has been defeatedthe real battle lines between economic and political liberalization are justnow being drawn As one commentator observed in Manila right after Marcos fellAli Baba is gone but the  thieves still remain At the very least it is byno means clear that Indonesia will soon be able to rid itself of itsunaccountable generals rapacious investors massive foreign debts or thepolitical impoverishment that could well be Suhartos most lasting legacy
