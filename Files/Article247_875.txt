Republican congressional leaders that their budget plan will set aside moneyfor Social Security while also providing for a tax cut The Post saysthis is a vague proposal with the size of the tax cut still undefined But thepaper does say that over the next ten years the GOP aims to use all thenonSocial Security budget surplus for tax relief while President Clintonwould devote some of it to Medicare special savings accounts and extradefense and domestic spending The NYT says the GOP proposed tax cutbefore the  election will be quite modest growing to historic dimensionsonly in subsequent years The Los Angeles Times leads with bad news forCalifornias schools low reading scores The death of former Supreme Courtjustice Harry Blackmun age  makes everybodys front the headlines makingit clear that his authorship of the Roe v Wade opinion is at this point viewedas his signal legacy                           USAT reports that Ashbys mother and sister squealed with joy at theverdict but that Ashby took the news undemonstratively The paper says he wassitting when the verdict was read Unlikely The other papers have himstanding Relatives of the victims says USAT  sat in shockedsilence USAT  the WP and LAT report that the Italianprime minister in the US to meet today with President Clinton said he wasbaffled by the verdict The NYT says he was infuriated            The WP and NYT make it clear just how sweeping the acquittalwas Not only was Ashby cleared of involuntary manslaughter and negligenthomicide but also of charges of dereliction of duty and destruction ofproperty even though he was flying lower and faster than the rules allowedNone of the papers mention it but the trial outcome is part of a disturbingrecent trend in US military justice What do the US Navy shootdown of anIranian airliner the friendly fire missile attacks on Allied troops duringthe Gulf War the Tailhook sexual assaults and the US Air Force shootdown oftwo US Army helicopters in the Iraqi nofly zone all have in commonMiraculously the military justice system found that none of these actions wasanybodys fault            The LAT lead says a new federal assessment of Californias fourthgraders reading skills shows that only  percent of them are proficientreaders putting the state second to last only in front of Hawaii in thenation in this category As if realizing what the study suggests

Street Journal main Politics and Policy piece arguesthat President Clintons decision to keep his distance from the press in thewake of the Lewinsky and Broaddrick allegations has hurt the publicsunderstanding of his policies And will hurt historians understanding of themas well            Follow up Yesterday in discussing the Supreme Court ruling that physicallydisabled children are entitled to the provision of publiclyfunded continuousclassroom care this space wondered how it was that none of the papers coveringthe decision seemed at all curious about how the disabled boy in the case couldhave been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident as a fouryearold Well TodaysPapers couldnt take it any more and quickly found out some further interestingfacts The boy was injured when after his father put him on the back of amotorcycle the baby blanket that the father placed around his shoulders becameentwined with the cycles drive shaft breaking the boys neck and snapping hisspinal cord The parents sued the motorcycle manufacturer and accepted asettlement offer of  million Leaving aside the question of how it is thatanything about the motorcycle design or manufacture could have been nearly asimplicated as the fathers illadvised decision to put the fouryearold on amotorcycle it should be noted that that  million was primarily profferedto pay for the costs entailed by the boys injury Hence heres a crucial factnot reported in any of yesterdays stories the parents had already beengiven more than enough money by their own estimate to provide for theadditional cost of keeping him in a mainstream classroom                        The WP reports on one rather peculiar preparation made for Clintonsvisit to the Interior Department yesterday Seems Interior honchos decided touse a footwide version of the departmental seal as the event backdrop aseal featuring blue snowcapped mountains an orange sunset and a buffalograzing Problem was it was discovered late in the game that the buffalo is ananatomically correct he And that Clinton when he spoke at Interior would bestanding wags the Post  right near its anatomical correctness Hencethe lastminute airbrush job by government workers avoiding the appearance ofany interspecies sensuous gestures
