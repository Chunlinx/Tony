                                 High School Confidential            Its no fun being ahighbrow if you dont sometimes swing low I know an expert in  thcentury English history who devours mystery novels by the shopping bag load aprominent intellectual journalist who loves Bruce Willis shootemups and a                  Slate                editor who admits to being hooked on Felicity  Inthis context I am prepared to admit an entertainment vice of my own the teenflick This is a genre that flourished in the mids then fell intoabeyance for a number of years and is now I am happy to report experiencinga modest renaissance            The new rash of teenmovies seems heavily skewed toward quasiremakes of the classics The genrerevived in  with Clueless  which was based on Jane AustensEmma  Cruel Intentions is the zillionth adaptation of the th century French novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses  ShesAll That is loosely based on Pretty Woman  which was loosely basedon My Fair Lady  which was based on George Bernard ShawsPygmalion  Arriving at multiplexes in the next few months will beO  a version of Othello set against a backdrop of highschoolsports and  Things I Hate About You  an adaptation of The Tamingof the Shrew             But it would be wrong to think of these films as classiccomics for the Clearasil set Most of them are movies that utilize classicplots as new ways to frame their exploration into what its like to be anAmerican teenager At their best these films immerse you once again in allthe joys and anxieties of adolescence To me they are the quintessential goodbad movies because while seldom subtle or artful they are capable ofrecreating a familiar and utterly compelling world            The first teen movieswere made in the s but the genre was largely codified by screenwriterdirector and producer John Hughes who drew on his experiences at a largesuburban Chicago high school in the s in a series of movies made in thes The first film Hughes directed was the romantic comedy SixteenCandles  Molly Ringwald plays a quirky intelligent sophomore whowakes up to discover that everyone in her family has forgotten her birthdayInsult is piled on injury as she confronts her socalled life In the clipavailable at right she faces the daily indignity of the school bus The plotwinds and unwinds a mismatch of affections The freshman geek with bracesAnthony Michael Hall has crush on Ringwald Ringwald has a crush on a cutesenior who is dating the feathered blond prom queen The film has all thecommonplaces of the genrethe party that utterly trashes someones parentshouse the voyeuristic visit to the girls locker room the guys betting aboutgetting laid and the happy comic resolution The geek beds the prom queenRingwald lands the cute senior                         S ixteen Candles is awful in some ways A racistsubplot revolves around a Chinese exchange student called Long Duk Dong Yetthe movie sets up the basic theme of Hughes subsequentand I would maintainall successfulteen movies which is to overthrow the stereotypes thatcomprise the basis of adolescent identity The basic insight of the Hughesfilms is that high school is built around a casteclass system which isbasically vicious and unfair Like his subsequent movies Sixteen               Candles is essentially a fantasy about throwing out this system Theexcluded are included and the exclusionary are either enlightened or humbledThe geeks get to be cool the cool kids get humbled the druggies get smartand the smart kids get stoned            Hughes handled thistheme in a more selfcongratulatory and heavyhanded way in The BreakfastClub  This was probably the most famous of the s teen flickslaunching as it did the careers of several of the Brat Pack actorsincludingEmilio Estevez Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy Five different typesa geek arichie a screwup a jock and a sullen arty girlare forced to spend aSaturday in detention considering who they are This is my least favorite ofthe Hughes films because its a moral lesson with flashes of humor Hughesbest films are romantic comedies informed by good values            Happily he returned to form in  with Pretty inPink  which was stylistically the best of the lot This time Ringwald playsa sweet girl from the wrong side of the tracks who has to choose between therichie played by Andrew McCarthy and her loyal pal Duckie played by JonCryer Pretty in Pink is tragically marred by the wrong ending Ringwaldwalks into the sunset with the preppie rich kid But Hughes must have realizedhis mistake because the next year he essentially rewrote it as Some Kind ofWonderful  The quirky and talented poor kid played by Eric Stoltz has acrush on the prom queen which breaks the heart of the orphan girl  who hasbeen secretly infatuated with him for years Check out the clip available atright for the scene in which Stoltz makes the right choice            The male Molly Ringwaldwas John Cusack who started his career with a minor role in SixteenCandles The second coming of John Hughes was the writer and directorCameron Crowe who cast Cusack in Say Anything  a funnier and moretouching John Hughes movie than Hughes ever made Cusack plays the funny kidfrom a broken home who crushes on the Astudent valedictorian played by IoneSkye In the clip available at right Cusack answers her dads question aboutwhat he plans to do with his life after high school            At the end of the s teen films took a darker turn withthe black comedy Heathers  The three popular girls who all have thesame name take up Veronica Winona Ryder who cant resist the offer ofinclusion but detests their values they make her ignore her old friends andplay cruel practical jokes on losers Only this time instead of humiliatingthe jocks and cheerleaders Ryder and her boyfriend played by ChristianSlater kill them View the clip available at left to see them off the firstHeather As black as it is Heathers has the same theme as theRingwaldCusack movies Its a fantasy about high school as a kind rather thana cruel place Ryder realizes that murder is not the right approach and offersto spend prom night with the fat girl everyone abuses            What makes these teenflicks the ideal good bad movies The first is the familiarity of the worldthey portray Not everyone in America goes to a big public high school buteveryone goes to a high school governed by a hierarchy of popularity andcliques Films set at college are never as universally recognizable becausepeoples experiences after high school are too different to generalize aboutUniversities unlike high schools are not unitary social structures Thesecond essential quality of these films is that they are all basically thesame The formula allows one to savor minor differences and adaptations            For some reason teen flicks died out for a while afterHeathers perhaps because it took the conventions of the form as far asthey could go Then following the success of Clueless  teen filmsstarted to trickle back The trickle has suddenly become a torrent Theeconomics are easy enough to understand lacking major stars these movies areinexpensive to make and draw the ideal audiences teens who are capable ofseeing Titanic  times Shes All That was made for a million budget and has already grossed nearly  million            Whats different aboutthe late s version Teen films no longer glorify drug use but other thanthat very little As the genre has expanded it has broken into subgenresTheres the black Heathers category  the most recent exercise being thereportedly awful Jawbreaker  Theres the selfreferential horrorcategory as manifest in the Scream movies Theres a MasterpieceTheatre for juniors category that started with the delightful Baz Luhrmannversion of Romeo  Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes            But the reigning champ is still the Hughesesque romancethe most recent example of which is Shes All That  The heroine is anartist from a broken home whose father cleans swimming pools The most perfectboy in her school who dates the most popular bitch makes a bet with his bestfriend that he can transform the ugly duckling into the prom queen Of coursethe perfect boy ends up ditching his snobby clique and falling in love withher Even the racy Cruel Intentions  set among rich Upper East Sidekids is a spin on the old Hughes formula The evil superrich girl makes adiabolical bet with her stepbrother that he cant corrupt the new girl atschool The stepbrother falls for the good girl and the wicked stepsister ishumiliated in front of everyone            These films have been derided as teensploitationbut I dont think the description is fair Instead of pandering to theprejudices of teens they offer a fantasy about a freer and happieradolescence Their message is that theres life beyond high school kids arentbound by what adults want from them how their peers think of them or the waysin which they categorize themselves All Hollywood films are exploitative tosome extent But Id say a sweet dumb movie such as Shes All That is alot less insulting to teen intelligence and to the average adult one thanPatch Adams or Message in a Bottle
