                    Background        Antibodydirected enzyme prodrug therapy ADEPT               is one of the promising new approaches that        selectively target tumor cells thus reducing toxic side        effects to patients In this approach an enzyme is        conjugated to a tumorspecific antibody The antibody        selectively localizes the enzyme to the tumor cell surface        Subsequent administration of a prodrug substrate of the        enzyme leads to the enzymecatalyzed release of the free        drug at the tumor site This strategy addresses the        stoichiometry controlled drug release and poor antibody        penetration problems associated with the use of monoclonal        antibodydrug conjugates       In addition because        the process of drug release is enzymatic a single enzyme        can generate a large amount of free drug Consequently a        small amount of antibody can be used to reduce        immunogenicity        It is important that the free drug in the ADEPT approach        be highly toxic Using highly toxic agents can reduce the        amount of the monoclonal antibody required thereby        reducing side effects CC Figure  is among the most        potent antitumor agents discovered         It        binds to doublestranded BDNA within the minor groove with        a sequence preference for dAGNTTA and        dAAAAA and alkylates the N position of the        adenine with its lefthand CPI segment             CC also inhibits gene transcription by interfering        with binding of the TATA boxbinding protein to its target        DNA     Despite its high potency and broad spectrum of        antitumor activity CC cannot be used in humans        because it causes delayed death in experimental animals            To pursue compounds possessing the potent antitumor        activity but devoid of the toxic side effects of the parent        compound many CC analogues have been synthesized                           Betalactamases have been widely investigated for their        role in the metabolism of antibiotics including        cephalosporins and penicillins Because of the high        catalytic efficiency and broad substrate specificity        lactamases have been extensively used in the ADEPT        approach to activate prodrugs of vinca alkaloids            nitrogen mustard         doxorubicin              and others     To take advantage of the potent        antitumor activity of the CC class of compounds and        the ADEPT approach we have synthesized lactam prodrugs        Herein we report synthesis and preliminary cytotoxic        effects of a prodrug comprised of a cephalosporin and a        CC analogue Figure         Prodrug          is expected to be less toxic than its        corresponding free drug           However it is expected that the        prodrug will be converted to the potent free drug by        lactamases localized on the tumor cell surface by an        antibody Figure  This selective activation of prodrug          at the tumor site will lead to        enhanced antitumor therapeutic efficacy                    Results and discussion        Prodrug          was synthesized as shown in Figure         The key intermediate           was made using methods developed by        Jungheim et al     and Rodrigues et al            with modifications The spectra data including NMR and MS        of compounds          were identical to those as        reported Compound          was treated with          in DMF to afford the protected        prodrug           Removal of the tbutyl protection        group from          generated the targeted prodrug          with good yield        The cytotoxicity of prodrug          and its corresponding free drug          was tested against U leukemia        cells and the results are presented in Table  When the        drugs were incubated with U cells for a period of h        prodrug          IC            nM is fold less toxic than        its corresponding free drug          IC            nM As observed for other        compounds of the CC class       both prodrug          and the free drug          caused DNA fragmentation and the        cells died by apoptosis data not shown                    Conclusion        This is the first report demonstrating synthesis of a        prodrug comprised of a cephalosporin and a CC        analogue The preliminary in vitro studies show the prodrug        to be less toxic than the free drug Due to the slow        nonenzymatic degradation of the cephalosporins in solution            the ratio of toxicity of cephalosporincontaining        prodrugs to their corresponding free drugs is generally not        very high However some of the prodrugs are very effective        against tumors in mouse models For example a        cephalosporindoxorubicin prodrug was fold less toxic        than free doxrubicin against tumor cells in vitro but        caused tumor regression when tested in tumor xenograft        models     A cephalosporinvinca alkaloid prodrug was        fold less toxic than the free drug against tumor cells in        vitro but was highly effective in tumor xenograft models        in vivo     When taxol was conjugated to a        cephalosporin the resulting prodrug was approximately        fold less toxic than free taxol against tumor cells in        vitro     Thus prodrug          has the potential to be useful in        cancer treatment using the ADEPT approach We will report        more biological data in due course
