                 experience with um uh dealings in government are that im one of these three million dish owners in this country and weve been fighting since about nineteen eighty six to try and get some legislation enacted against some of these cable companies and how theyve been stumping on their competition and what little there is and its a very pro consumer type of legislation but were constantly running into trouble trying to get it passed because were up against huge pack money donations from the cable TV industry   uhhuh   in this country and ive come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers or voters to make a stink about an issue if theres a big pack check involved theyll take the check every single time   uh i guess its not totally not understandable  you know im im sure that if youre looking at whether or not youre going to get elected and have enough money to run that theyve got to uh got to take that into consideration   oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is theyre getting themselves prepared for when theyre out of office when they become consultants or highpowered lobbyists themselves and uh i i think that although some of the people that we have in elected office are upstanding honest people i think that as theyre in the system from longer and longer they get corrupted by it basically by losing touch with the people that theyre supposed to be serving and i think they forget who it is theyre supposed to be representing   its uh well it its its such a complicated thing let me just relate to you uh an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you cant find compromise youre not going to be successful   umhum   um  in eighty six i was president of of an association called DPMA Data Processing Management Association   umhum   uh which was actually at the time we were the third largest chapter in the world we had five hundred plus members and it was just i mean an absolute uh unforseen unforseen unforeseen thing that a woman should become president in this good ole boy city okay         dont misunderstand me now but it it all came down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had uh our board our officers and our board board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage and to come to one voice on on certain things you understand and in my year we did perfectly fine and the the gentlemen that came behind me was a uh wonderful intelligent smooth really good looking successful young black man but he had his own agenda and wouldnt compromise with people he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose   umhum   and it was a terrible a terrible situation i mean the whole thing almost fell apart       and i think what you have to do i mean you i think its important to have an agenda but you also have to be able to to compromise on it because if the majority are against you and you lose more than two or three times you know you lose it it been a terrible situation for you and your reputation   sure   and i think what happens is in order to get anything passed in the big political system in Washington you have to you know compromise with other people and vote for something you dont really believe in but so that they will vote for something that youre asking for   yeah thats that kind of um you know i in a in its gotten very pervasive when it comes to expectations on the part of members of each of the party that you try not to cross party lines on certain votes especially these days and the problem comes about when you have somebody who wants to vote for something the other party advocates strongly and   and they really want to vote for it   yeah well in some cases they do they vote their conscience and then of course you know they may be punished for not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue   yeah uhhuh   because we had a Republican Senator uh John Danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the White House strongly against it because it would reregulate to an extent   yes it would   and they just wouldnt hear of it at all so we had trouble but he stood his ground and carried with him a lot of influence you know people underneath him who are Republicans but at the same point it causes a lot of strife and then people dig their heels in and   and you know theres probably about ten percent or maybe less than that five percent of the people who can vote their own conscience and still be successful but all the rest fall by the wayside   umhum yeah you have to be a real old timer and powerful to be able to do that especially when its committee assignment handout time and   right right i am   things like that
