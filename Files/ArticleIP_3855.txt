Away                        Jacob Weisberg couldnt havebeen more wrong when in his Feb  column CorporateWelfare NIMBYs he implies with no supportingdocumentation that I am selective in my commitment to deficit reduction andeliminating corporate welfare            Weisberg correctly notes Iam a Democratic cosponsor of S  a bill to establish an independentcommission to review and recommend termination of corporatewelfare subsidiesHowever he is incorrect when he states four sentences later Feingold whois up for reelection in  carries a different tune when it comes to aid tofamilies with dependent cheese            Weisberg also poses arhetorical question in his column asking if my commitment to reducingcorporate welfare would  include say federal dairy supports and marketingorders for the milk industry which somehow escaped being scaled back in the Farm Bill            I voted against the Farm Bill in large measure because it did so little to eliminate marketdistortions and bring needed reform to the antiquated Milk Marketing Ordersystem or MMO to make it more reflective of supply and demand The currentsystem instituted in the s distorts the market discriminates against thedairy farmers of the Upper Midwest by providing higher prices called distancedifferentials to farmers who live far from Eau Claire Wis the city fromwhich these distance differentials are calculated and puts Wisconsinproducers at an artificial competitive disadvantage The current MMO systemsurvives because it is defended by powerful interests who are itsbeneficiaries            I have in fact worked hardto create dairypolicy reform including introducing two bills in the th Congress S  which would eliminate the distancedifferential in dairy pricing and S  which would repeal the creation ofthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact a dairy cartel created last year thatallows six Northeastern states to fix higher prices for milk in theirregion            I have often stated that ifthe MMO system cannot be reformed it should be eliminated and Wisconsinfarmers have probably been more active than farmers in any other part of thecountry in calling for deregulation of this system            Weisbergs assertion thatfederal dairy supports  somehow escaped being scaled back in the  FarmBill is also incorrect Federal dairy supports have in fact been cutdramatically In  the price support was  per hundredweight about gallons of milk and the program cost taxpayers about  billion By the price support had been reduced to  per hundredweight and while themyth persists that the dairy program costs billions the facts are that in the program operated at no cost to the taxpayers Moreover the  FarmBill completely eliminates the dairy price support by the end of  Thedairy industry is the only commodity group to have its support terminated bythe most recent Farm Bill Some other commodities such as wheat and feedgrains were provided with hefty annual guaranteed government subsidies in thatsame legislation            So exactly what is thecorporate welfare Weisberg is talking about            Deficitreduction and balancing the federal budget are serious complex and demandingtasks and the policy implications of our efforts reach across the nation evenaround the world These efforts are not advanced by unsupported suggestions ofhypocrisy such as are contained in Weisbergs column                           Sen Russell DFeingold                                       JacobWeisberg Replies                        Read SenFeingolds letter carefully He does not say he wants to end corporate welfarefor dairy farmers He says he wants Wisconsin farmers to get a better dealFeingold wants to reform not eliminate the Milk Marketing Order systemthough he acknowledges that it constitutes a cartel designed to keep dairyprices high Sounds a lot like NIMBYism to me I should add that I would havebeen in a better position to reflect the subtleties in Feingolds position ifhis press office had returned repeated calls asking about it                           Revolted                        I wasrevolted by the reference to JonBenet Ramsay in Thank Heaven for LittleGirls by

                         MichaelKinsley Socialist                        Michael Kinsleys recentarticle EightReasons Not to Cut the CapitalGains Tax truly proves the adage thatliberals cannot stand success            Using Kinsleys analogy ifwe observe that we have too many bakers and not enough butchers it isreasonable to suggest that we ought to reduce the tax on butchers Our rates ofsaving and investment are staggeringly low in both historical andcontemporaneous contexts There is ample reason to believe that increasing therates of saving and investment would be beneficial to the economy Hencereducing disincentives to save and invest eg the capitalgains tax seemsto make sense            The evidence that acapitalgains tax would pay for itself is a bit stronger than Kinsley wouldcare to admit First of all people are going to do something with the moneythey have made as a result of realized capital gains Either they will spendit in which case local salestax receipts will increase or they will move itinto some other form of investment which will be taxed in turn Having thegovernment take nearly onethird of the amount of your investment earnings isway too much            Thepurpose of tax policy should be to generate income for the government so thatit can perform its necessary and essential functions with the least distortionand effect on the overall economy as possible Kinsley seeks to remedy throughthe coercive power of government those circumstances and conditions in societythat he finds troubling I would respectfully suggest that this makes him muchmore of a socialist than his Republican critics                           Stephen JKonig                                       Master ofDeceit                        It astonishes me that AnnDouglas in Psycho Dramas her review of the Sam Tanenhaus biography ofWhittaker Chambers acknowledges that Chambers was right about everything butstill maintains the old liberal condescension for this perennially malignedfigure She recognizes that Chambers Witness is one of the greatAmerican autobiographies even a masterpiece yet still regards it astorrential and lurid She notes Chambers susceptibility to ridicule andparody and concludes that he was a pulpfiction Dostoyevsky an author headmired above all others            Douglas writes as if Chamberswas not really involved in the Communist conspiracy inside this country butsomehow fictionalized it She implies that he was ridiculous for admiringDostoyevsky Finally and worst of all Douglas prides herself for being ableto believe  Chambers testimony against Hiss without accepting hisinterpretation of the SovietAmerican confrontation She faults thebiographer Tanenhaus for sharing his subjects viewpoint and not doubtingthe Soviets more or less total culpability for the long disaster we call theCold War She recommends that Tanenhaus should read some revisionist worksthat challenge such an assumption            But what is her assumptionThat there was a chance for meaningful cooperation with the Sovietdictatorship That its recruitment of Alger Hiss a top official present at theYalta conference which set the conditions for the Cold War by selling outEastern Europe and an architect of the United Nations which grantedindependent votes to Soviet subject states of Eastern Europe was anexception or a trifle That the Communists in America were really grand oldtroopers with a different vision of the future            She shouldtake time from reading revisionist works to look at the revelations of theVENONA files those hundreds of intercepted telegrams from Soviet agents inAmerica that reveal the tip of an enormous iceberg of espionage and subversionShe characterizes Chambers as a Dostoyevskian figure trying to break what hesaw as the invincible ignorance of a nation blinded to the crisis ofhistory by its prosperity and misguided generousmindedness Here she isright The ignorance does indeed appear to be invincible

Alexis Herman President Clintons nominee to be secretary of labor            Lets start with a simplecentral factual error in the first substantive paragraph about Alexis Aftershe left the Labor Department she set up a firm to advise companies on how tocomply with those affirmativeaction regulations Baloney That was not whyshe set up her business She set up her firm to provide advice to corporationslocal governments and nonprofits on dozens of aspects of labor and marketingissues            She started this business tosee if she could make some money by making the workplace work better This waswhat she was trained to do and what she was accomplished at Remember thiswas at the dawn of the Reagan era We of the policywonk elite were allatitter about the theory of federalism publicprivate partnership pablum wasfirst beginning to gurgle from the mouth of a Massachusetts governor and everyprogram to help black kids get jobs with federal help was being axed So Alexishit the road trying to help localities figure out how to get the most out ofwhat was left and trying to help corporations make more progress on hiringminorities and marketing to AfricanAmericans Her first most lucrative andlongeststanding client was Procter  Gamblea contact she had made beforeshe ever entered government            But waitthats not thehalf of the misleading errors in Weisbergs paragraph His accusation byinnuendo when it comes to the Rev Jackson needs to be spelled out He impliesAlexis funneled money to Jesse Jackson when she was at Labor in exchange forbeing the beneficiary of Jacksons largess when she went to the private sectorWeisberg further implies that theres something wrong with Jacksons OperationPush negotiating agreements with corporations that included monitoringarrangements            Most of Alexis business didnot involve any relationship with Operation Push But some contracts did andhere is how they worked Jackson and others spotted in the early s thatthere were no whitecollar minority employees in lots of major companies andno black franchises in major franchise businesses The companies realized theyhad to do better or face marketplace consequences so they set out to hire moreminorities They then turned to Alexis for helpsometimes at Jacksonssuggestion sometimes because other companies had recommended her firm Herwork ended up delivering radical reductions in turnover and that made themmore money provided revenue for Alexis business and opened doors for womenand minorities            Now we get to theappearance of impropriety card Market Square Alexis as a privatebusinessperson provides valuable help to a developer He gives her anownership stake Weisberg agrees nothing is illegal but he ellipticallyimplies theres a problem He implies that Herman later helped HerbMillereven though there is no evidence of it He then adds in a passing shotat Vernon Jordanas if Vernon needs Alexis help            Alexis should be and isproud of her career before and after the Labor Department Apparently withlittle or no knowledge of it Weisberg chose to believe the smug cynicalviewodd that he didnt bother to check with her clients He may dislikeanyone who goes from government to business and back but to make it sound likeAlexis is at the head of the class for likely wrongdoing is unsupportable            This woman has  years ofreal experience making progress on the critical problem of diversity in theworkplace but Weisberg and others are making her sound as if shes been aproduct of Washington DC all the time That is unfair and harms her abilityto help us all later When she talks about teaching kids the culture of workshe isnt speaking dry corporate prose nor is she speaking thefashionsensitive policy prose Shes speaking with some actual experience            Alexisdeserves full and fair reporting and an open hearing The Senate committeeneeds to do its job and get these issues into a forum where the nominee canrespond rather than leeching them through repeated incorrect media storiesWeisberg needs to do his and get a full picture of a person before he choosesto dismiss her lifes work as a trip through the revolving door                           Mark Steitz                                       Addressyour email to the editors to lettersslatecom
