                well what kind of car uh are you thinking of buying next   uh more than likely its going to be a Chrysler   you like the Chrysler products do you   uh Chrysler LeBaron yeah it it wont be a Ford ive got a Ford Mustang now and i hate it   do you really what year is it   yeah its a eighty eight   and why dont you like the Mustang   its um ive had one problem with it after the other the the the paint the paints peeling off of it and theres no reason for it you know and   ill be darned well you know the old sayings about Fords what they stand for   fix or repair daily or find on read road dead   there you go     that uh i its its my electrical system shorted out like two or three times and its been torn up since April and i and   well uh   luckily everything was under warranty so its only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed it would have been like two thousand     well weve always uh weve always had Oldsmobiles and uh been very uh happy with Oldsmobiles but uh my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those uh Mitsubishi Eclipses she really   those those are nice cars   she likes uh likes those uh she has a sister that lives in uh Phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it well what uh what things do you consider when you buy a car   um the gas mileage for one thing and ive uh ive always had like stick shifts i want this next car i want to get i want it to be automatic   i see   because im  im i hate driving anyway and then and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now   yeah well especially when youre in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time   yeah and you know when you work nine to five or eight to five and youre  in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately   that makes it very frustrating   and i look ah and that one of the things with Chrysler right now is is their the warranties that they have and ive i feel like theres everybody everybody ive talked to that owns one is is is is been real pleased with it hm i like those uh those drivers air bag i like that   now this is a LeBaron   uh yeah well all Chrysler products has it in there but i is a Chrysler LeBaron would be the next car i get yeah   i sure like the uh convertible those ragtop LeBarons they really look sporty   yeah yeah i like i like that too huh but i couldnt i couldnt afford the insurance on one of those     well uh we always  this last Oldsmobile we bought uh its an eighty seven but we bought it in eighty eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them   yeah   and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate you know when theyre trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and uh um you know we looked around at used cars and we really couldnt uh afford the payments on a used car because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know and we ended up i think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and our payments   well thats thats what im paying on mine now i i had to get like a first time  my dads always cosigned on on my my loans or whatever and this is one ive  that whenever i got my Mustang this time was by myself because i was out my own or whatever and um i had said that they they said it had to be like a first time buyers car or whatever and theyre charging me unreasonable about interest but ive got eight more payments and its paid for   well thats great   but i got it when i got it when the eighty eights first came out so its its its a good car i mean i got in eighty seven i guess in like November or something like that   uhhuh well when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy seven it was a two door Cutlass Supreme and um it just happened that when we looked for our our new car they had a thing going with Oldsmobile and if youd buy a a new Oldsmobile theyd give you four hundred dollar rebate because it was their seventy fifth anniversary   uhhuh   i believe it yeah seventy fifth anniversary so in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our uh papers on our first car and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it so we we got a four door this time and i sort of went more for the uh the comfort factor and uh i like the smaller cars but im a bigger person and i i really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff   well thats another big factor of mine next next car i gets gonna be a a four door too something with some room   yep   because i  my Mustangs a is is two door with bucket seats and when you buy groceries and stuff like that   and if you try to take anybody uh you know go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome
