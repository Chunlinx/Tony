                    Background        Protein tyrosine phosphorylation regulates many        important cellular functions including signal transduction        growth differentiation cell adhesion and axon guidance        The balance between protein tyrosine kinase and phosphatase        activity is an integral part of this regulatory mechanism        A large number of protein tyrosine phosphatases have been        identified which fall into the broad categories of        cytoplasmic and receptorlike molecules All receptorlike        protein tyrosine phosphatases RPTPs contain an        extracellular region a single transmembrane segment and at        least one intracellular catalytic domain They have been        subdivided into several classes based on the structure of        their extracellular segments Figure  A combination of        immunoglobulinlike Ig domains and fibronectin type III        FNIII repeats in the ectodomain defines the type II        class of RPTPs An additional feature of type II RPTPs is a        potential proteolytic cleavage site within the        membraneproximal FNIII repeat Upon cleavage        extracellular Nterminal and predominantly intracellular        membrane bound Cterminal segments are generated which        remain noncovalently associated   A subset of the type        II class identified previously as type IIB RPTPs   is        characterized by the presence of an Nterminal MAM        domain        Currently four type IIB phosphatases PTP PTP PCP        and RPTP have been reported The hPCP   hPTP          and hPTP   RPTPs are located on human chromosomes          and  respectively and hRPTP is located on chromosome           Several additional human RPTPs PTP PTP        hPTPJ PTPRO share very high sequence similarity         with PCP and are likely to represent the same        gene Unigene database        httpwwwncbinlmnihgovunigene There are in        addition several murine homologues of the four human        genes mPTP Genbank NM  mPTP NM        mRPTP AF mRPTP  and mRPTP   AF        mRPTPmam NM  mPTPf D and mPTP        U The latter two are likely to be murine        homologues of hPCP and mRPTPmam is the same gene as        mRPTP        RPTP is the most recently isolated member of the IIB        family    Northern blot and in situ hybridization        studies have shown that RPTP is largely restricted to the        central nervous system   Within the CNS expression is        developmentally regulated and in the mouse delineates a        unique boundary region in the granule cell layer of the        cerebellar cortex   Motifs in the RPTP extracellular        segment MAM Ig and FNIII domains are commonly found in        cell adhesion molecules The two phosphatase domains in the        intracellular segment suggest that RPTP like other        members of the RPTP family is involved in signal        transduction through protein tyrosine        dephosphorylation        The human RPTP gene has been mapped to chromosome        q   it is located between anchor markers        DS and DS and is flanked by the phospholipase C        gamma  and splicing factor SRp genes The mouse gene        maps to a syntenic region at  cM on mouse chromosome  a        region closely linked to         Pltp and flanked by the markers        DMit and DMit To date only portions of the human        RPTP RPTP and PCP genes have been sequenced however        the region encompassing the human RPTP gene has been        sequenced in its entirety Chromosome  sequencing group        Sanger Centre but it is not as yet fully assembled and        annotated The mouse chromosomal region containing the        RPTP gene has been sequenced Celera Discovery System        but it is also largely unassembled In this report we        describe the cloning of the mouse cDNA the identification        of an unusually long  UTR the identification of        alternatively spliced exons and the genomic organization        of the human and mouse RPTP genes                    Results and Discussion                  The nucleotide sequence and domain structure of          human RPTP          The nucleotide sequence of hRPTP cDNA predicts a          AA polypeptide containing at least eight domains The          polypeptide is comprised of extracellular and          intracellular segments The extracellular segment          contains a signal peptide AA  a MAM meprin A          neuropilin RPTPmu domain AA  an Iglike          domain AA  and four FNIII repeats AA             and  A potential proteolytic          cleavage site is located at AA  in the fourth          fibronectin repeat The transmembrane segment is located          at AA  The intracellular region contains a          juxtamembrane wedge region AA  and two highly          conserved phosphatase domains AA  and           The  hallmark amino acids that define the          catalytic core of the first phosphatase domain are          located at AA  The stop codon is found after          residue  of the amino acid sequence                          Human RPTP genomic organization          We have determined that the region encompassing human          RPTP is contained within  contiguous PAC clones and           BAC clone dJM dJA dJD dJM bAG          dJN dJE dJI dJG dJK and          dJH Sanger Center chromosome  group Figure           We have ordered these clones by identifying RPTP          exons within each of them The RPTP gene spans a minimum          of  Mbp and the RPTP coding sequence is comprised of          at least  exons several of which are alternatively          spliced A prominent feature of the RPTP gene structure          is the considerable variability of exon spacing Figure           Exons  extend over the initial   kbp of the          gene exons  are widely separated while exons           are more closely spaced Of particular note are introns           and  which are   and   kbp long respectively          considerably longer than the next largest intron In          contrast exons  and  form two tight clusters          which together span approximately  kbp In general          this pattern of exon organization appears to be          characteristic of most RPTPs as it is also observed in          RPTP   LAR   CD   and RPTP   Each of          these phosphatases has at least one very large intron in          the region of the gene This feature is not restricted          to receptorlike phosphatases as it is also present in a          number of adhesion receptor genes including Ecadherin          Ncadherin Pcadherin NCAM deleted in colorectal          cancer DCC axonin and F discussed in            The exon and intron sizes and exonintron junctional          sequences of the human RPTP gene are detailed in Table           The majority of  and  splice sites are consensus          sequences There is some variation in the length of          exons which range from  to  bp Approximately one          third of the exons are less than  bp while the          remaining two thirds are in the  bp range Greater          variation occurs in the size of the introns which range          from  to  bp The largest number of introns           falls into the  to  bp bin and somewhat fewer           fall into the  to  bp bin size Only  introns          lie outside this range Three of these fall into the           to  bp range and two unusually long introns in the          extracellular domain are over  bp          The RPTP extracellular segment is comprised of protein          domains the borders of these modules correspond to the          boundaries of exonclusters There are three possible          junctional phases between exons and introns Phase           refers to introns with junctions between the triplet          codons whereas phase  and  introns separate within the          triplet after the first and second nucleotides          respectively Figure Ashows the distribution of intron          phases relative to the domain structure of RPTP Within          the RPTP gene the number of phase  and phase  introns          is comparable at  and  respectively In contrast          there are only five phase  introns in the entire gene A          notable feature of RPTP gene structure is that phase           introns appear to be preferentially associated with the          extracellular segment where they flank each of the          protein domain exon modules The intracellular segment is          almost devoid of phase  introns In contrast phase           introns are primarily associated with the intracellular          segment and are only infrequently represented in the          extracellular region          Recently RPTPs have been examined in sponges             the phylogenetically oldest extant metazoan Although          sponges are multicellular organisms they lack the          cellular cohesiveness of the higher eukaryotes When          RPTPs from yeast sponge and human were aligned and          rooted cladograms constructed the common early ancestor          of the phosphatase domains appeared to be yeast The          second phosphatase domain arose as a duplication of the          first   The RPTP extracellular domain was acquired          during the transition from singlecelled to multicellular          organisms In RPTP the extracellular and intracellular          exon modules are separated by phase  and phase           introns respectively Furthermore intracellular introns          are much smaller than those in the extracellular segment          Together these observations suggest that the RPTP          extracellular and intracellular segments originated as          separate modular proteins that evolved by exon shuffling          and duplication respectively    The two segments          became linked to form a functional transmembrane molecule          during the transition from single to multicellular          organisms          Over fifty percent of the human genome is comprised of          repeat sequences   making it the first repeatrich          genome to be sequenced Analysis of these numerous          segments can provide important indications of the          evolutionary history of a particular region or gene          Transposonderived elements form the largest category of          repeats and include LINEs SINEs LTRs and DNA elements          In the RPTP gene the most common of these are LINE           and LINE  the SINEs Alu  MIR           and THE  LTR  and the DNA elements MLT           MER  and MST  Less common elements          found in the RPTP gene include Tiggers in introns            and   HAL in introns  and   MAD in          introns  and   and U in intron            There is also a Charlie repeat in intron   In          addition to the transposonderived repeats there is a          pseudogene in intron  a tRNAderived repeat in intron           and  variable length nucleotide tandem repeats          VNTRs microsatellites found in the gene The GC          content of the RPTP gene is approximately           Descriptions of the above repeat elements may be found on          Repbase at httpwwwgirinstorg          The overall percentage of the RPTP gene comprised of          repeat sequences is lower by  than that of the          entire human genome In the human genome LINEs comprise           of repetitive sequences SINEs  LTRs  and DNA          elements    In RPTP LINEs comprise  of          repetitive sequences SINEs  LTRs  and DNA          elements  The significance of this deviation in          RPTP from the normal range is unknown                          cDNA cloning and genomic structure of mouse          RPTP          The mouse RPTP cDNA was cloned using a combination of          PCR and RACE The mouse cDNA Genbank accession          AF encodes a AA polypeptide that is           identical to that of the human protein and predicts an          analogous domain structure Figure A The Celera          Discovery System mouse genomic database was used to          identify clones containing RPTP exons These clones were          then ordered and analyzed to identify exonintron          junctions Exon and intron sizes exonintron junctional          sequences and intron phases of the mouse RPTP gene are          shown in Table  In general the exonintron splice          sites in the mRPTP correspond to expected GTAG intron          consensus splicing sequences and the intron phases in          mouse Table  are identical to those in the human gene          Table  Although the two species share approximately           nucleotide identity overall when examined exon by          exon the degree of identity varies slightly between the          extracellular and intracellular segments Figure B The          overall identity of the mouse and human extracellular and          intracellular segments is  and  respectively In          general there is slightly greater variance between the          two species in the extracellular segment for example          mouse and human exons  and  share  and  identity          Within the intracellular segment mouse exon  is           identical to that of the human and exon  which          contains the first half of the catalytic core is           identical Notably the alternatively spliced exons            and a discussed below are   and           identical respectively indicating a high degree of          conservation between mouse and human In summary the          mouse and human genes are virtually identical in terms of          the number and size of exons and the exons differ only          slightly with respect to the nucleotide sequence                          Exonintron organization of the RPTP extracellular          segment                      MAM domain            The relationship between RPTP exon organization and            protein domain boundaries is shown in Figure Aand in            Tables and  Within the extracellular segment exon             encodes the signal peptide and exons   and  encode            the single Nterminal MAM domain a distinguishing            feature of all type IIB phosphatases Although the            function of the RPTP MAM domain is unclear other type            IIB phosphatases have shown homophilic binding            properties When heterologously expressed in            nonadherent cells both RPTP and RPTP bind            homophilically to induce the formation of large            calciumindependent aggregates    Furthermore            when the RPTP MAM domain was deleted aggregation was            eliminated   implying that the domain had a            crucial role in homophilic cellular interactions            The three RPTP MAM exons differ widely in size             bp exon   bp exon  and  bp exon  All            MAMassociated introns are in phase  with the            exception of the second internal intron which is in            phase  MAM domains have been identified in a variety            of cell adhesion molecules We have determined the exon            structure of the MAM domain in all four human RPTP IIB            genes and in human zonadhesin and human            enteropeptidase NCBI database The genomic            organization of the MAM domain in all four IIB            phosphatases is identical In all RPTP IIB proteins            Genbank NM  NM  NM  NM             and in human zonadhesin Genbank AF there is a            MAM domain at the Nterminus the genomic structure of            which is highly conserved In zonadhesin there are two            additional and adjacent MAM domains The genomic            organization of the latter two domains differs from            that of the first The single MAM domain in the human            enteropeptidase gene Genbank Y is more            internally located than that of RPTP close to the            transmembrane region It is comprised of four exons            that are    and  bp in length and is            unlike any of the IIB and zonadhesin MAM domains In            summary all known MAM domains are located within the            extracellular segment but within this region their            location exon number and exon size can vary            considerably The size and structure of exons            comprising the most Nterminal MAM domain appear to be            unique Because the nucleotide sequence of the RPTP            MAM domain predicts a protein similar to that found in            the other type IIB RPTPs it might be expected that the            RPTP MAM domain also participates in homophilic            interactions as was shown for RPTP                                  Ig domain            Adjacent to the MAM domain the single Iglike            domain is split into two similarly sized exons  and             by one intron in phase  Figure A Introns            flanking the Iglike domain are in phase  In the            majority of genes encoding Iglike domains only one            exon encodes each domain while in others such as            NCAM two exons encode each domain   The single            Iglike domain of the RPTP gene falls into the latter            category suggesting a closer relationship to            NCAMlike molecules LAR has characteristics of both            groups   a feature which it shares with several            other genes such as perlecan   and DCC              Within the RPTP IIB family the Iglike domain appears            to act in conjunction with the MAM domain to bring            about homophilic cellcell interactions                                  FNIII domains            Following the Ig domain are four FNIII repeats            Figure A each of which begins with a highly            conserved proline residue FNIII domains are found in            a wide range of proteins and recently have been shown            to be involved in retinal axon target selection              As a general rule FNIII domains are encoded either by             or  exons   Within genes that encode multiple            FNIII domains exon organization may be of one type            or a combination of the two types For example NCAM            has  exons for each FNIII domain   whereas            tenascin   and LAR   have a mixture of both            types In the RPTP gene there is a good correlation            between exon structure and FNIII boundaries Figure            A although there is some variation in the number of            exons per domain Each of the first two FNIII repeats            is encoded by a single exon exons  and             respectively In contrast the third FNIII repeat is            encoded by two exons  and  Somewhat atypically            the fourth FN III repeat is encoded by three exons              and  This domain contains a putative proteolytic            cleavage site RPTP FNIII repeats share high sequence            similarity with those of NCAM but only the third            FNIII domain in RPTP is encoded by two exons In            contrast to the type IIA phosphatase LAR the RPTP            gene does not contain exons encoding more than one            fibronectin domain however like LAR it has a FNIII            domain encoded by three exons            In the majority of known cases the exonintron            junctions corresponding to the FNIII domain boundaries            are in phase  When two exons encode a FNIII domain            an intron interrupts the coding region in a central            relatively nonconserved part of the domain and the            exonintron junction may be in any phase In the RPTP            gene introns separating the individual FNIII repeats            are in phase  the intron internal to the third repeat            is in phase  and introns internal to the fourth            FNIII repeat are in phase  and  respectively                                    Exonintron organization of the RPTP intracellular          segment                      Juxtamembrane region            Following the transmembrane segment exon  exons             encode the juxtamembrane region Figure A            Tables and  This segment of the RPTP protein is            similar to the membrane proximal region in the type IV            phosphatase murine RPTP for which the crystal            structure has been determined   RPTP exists as a            dimer in which the catalytic site of one molecule is            blocked by contact with a wedge from the other            Specifically the turn part of the helixturnhelix            motif is inserted into the active site which maintains            the WpD loop in the open state   In other            phosphatases   the WpD loop undergoes a            conformational shift upon substrate binding which            appears to be crucial for catalysis Thus it is very            likely that the dimeric form of RPTP is unable to bind            tyrosinephosphorylated substrates rendering it            catalytically inactive The negative charge of two            adjacent residues within a highly conserved sequence in            the juxtamembrane region appears to be crucial for            inhibition    In RPTP these two residues are            negatively charged aspartates In type IIB RPTPs the            first residue is changed to an alanine in PCP and            RPTP and to a serine in RPTP  The second residue is            retained as either a glutamate in PCP and RPTP or            an aspartate in RPTP  These single amino acid changes            may indicate a somewhat weaker level of inhibition            This is supported by the examination of the crystal            structure of RPTP which shows that although a wedge            is formed catalytic activity is not inhibited by its            insertion into the active site on the adjacent monomer              However in the case of RPTP the first residue            is a glycine and the second is the large basic            residue glutamine Thus the RPTP juxtamembrane            catalytic region is likely to have a different            conformation to that of the other phosphatases and a            net positive charge making the regulation of            phosphatase activity by dimerizationinduced wedge            inhibition unlikely                                Phosphatase domains            Although the extracellular regions of receptorlike            phosphatases are highly variable the intracellular            tandem phosphatase domains appear quite closely            related The structure of the CD gene indicates that            both protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPase domains have            a very similar exonintron organization which probably            arose by duplication   In RPTP the first and            second phosphatase domains are encoded by exons             and  respectively Figure A The

somewhat anomalous in that            although the exonintron structure of the second            phosphatase domain is generally similar to that of the            other RPTPs exons in the first phosphatase domain are            fewer in number but greater in size The final exon in            all nine genes encodes the end of the second            phosphatase domain the short Cterminus and the entire            untranslated region            A striking similarity among the RPTP genes is the            conservation of exonintron junction  in the first            phosphatase domain In LAR CD and RPTP this            junction interrupts the highly conserved sequence            VHCSAGV part of the catalytic core of the phosphatase               Although this exonintron junction in the            IIB phosphatases corresponds exactly there is a change            in the last amino acid from a valine to an alanine            Interestingly an exonintron junction is not observed            at this position in the cytoplasmic PTPase PTPB              an observation that may indicate an early evolutionary            divergence of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane PTPases                         Although the exonintron structure of the two            phosphatase domains was remarkably similar in each of            the nine RPTPs examined there were variations in exon            size and number primarily in those close to the            transmembrane domain For example the third exon             nt in the first phosphatase domain of rat EspmOSTPTP            and RPTP is replaced by two smaller exons  and             nt in RPTP CD RPTP PCP RPTP and RPTP             Two smaller exons replace a single exon at the            Cterminal end of the first phosphatase domain of rat            EspmOSTPTP Similarly at the start of the second            phosphatase domain the first exon nt in RPTP            PCP RPTP RPTP and LAR is replaced by two smaller            exons in rat EspmOSTPTP RPTP RPTP and CD In            each case the total number of nucleotides in the two            smaller exons is virtually identical to that of the            single larger exon at the same position It is unclear            whether these changes in exon number resulted from            intron gain or exon fusion                                RPTP  untranslated region            Following the second phosphatase domain there is a            long  kb  untranslated sequence BLAST            comparisons identified a region on the KIAA gene            Genbank accession AB that showed  identity            to nucleotides  to  of the hRPTP sequence            Thus the UTR of hRPTP which is contained in exon             was identified as KIAA Polyadenylation signals            were found at  nt and  nt NM                                    Alternative splicing of mouse and human RPTP          genes          Comparison of the four RPTP type IIB RPTP RPTP          RPTP PCP

 determined if other members of the type IIB subfamily          also contain this exon or whether the region is unique          to RPTP          Comparison of xenopus mouse and human type IIB RPTP          nucleotide sequences indicated the possibility of a          fourth alternatively spliced region located  to exon           within the wedge domain This  nt segment is          present in the reported sequence of human RPTP           nt and in xenopus RPTP  nt It is          absent in the reported sequences of human and mouse          RPTP RPTP and PCP The exon  primers were          designed to amplify two potential products of  and           nt However only a single product of  nt was observed          in human and mouse brain regions data not shown This          sequence appears to be unique to human RPTP and xenopus          RPTP and is unlikely to represent an alternatively          spliced exon in any of the RPTP IIB genes          Both splice variants of exons   and a were          present in human and mouse brain at all ages and in all          brain regions examined Although the RPTP protein          products encoded by the alternatively spliced exons do          not appear to encode any known motifs different isoforms          of the phosphatase with as yet unknown functions are          likely to be present Alternatively spliced isoforms of          the related RPTPs LAR   and RPTP   are          spatially and temporally distinct in the central nervous          system and there is evidence that alternatively spliced          exons can influence ligand binding as is the case with          LAR                              Conclusions        We describe the cloning of the mouse RPTP cDNA the        genomic structure and alternative splicing of the mouse and        human genes and the presence of an  kb UTR in human        RPTP RPTP is the largest RPTP gene characterized to        date extending over more than  megabase pairs of genomic        DNA Its considerable length is due primarily to expanded        introns in the extracellular region The protein domains of        the extracellular segment are encoded by  to  exons        which form modules that are flanked by phase  introns The        majority of introns in the intracellular segment are in        phase  and are relatively small These data suggest that        the ectodomain and the phosphatase domain arose separately        by exon shuffling and duplication and fused at a later        evolutionary period The MAM domain the region        characterizing type IIB phosphatases possesses a unique        genomic structure common to all such domains when located        at the Nterminus The fourth fibronectin repeat in RPTP        is encoded by three exons an additional feature found only        in type II phosphatases At least two alternatively spliced        exons flank the transmembrane domain the region showing        the greatest variability between the four IIB phosphatases        An additional alternatively spliced exon precedes the        catalytic core of the first phosphatase domain Comparison        of the genomic structure of representative members of the        RPTP family types IV indicates that the intronexon        organization of both phosphatase domains is highly        conserved There is considerable variation in the length of        the  UTR in the RPTPs at  kb the RPTP  UTR is the        longest characterized to date Our results provide the        first characterization of the genomic structure of an RPTP        type IIB gene This information will facilitate future        studies of promoter and other regulatory elements        responsible for the tissue specificity of gene        expression
