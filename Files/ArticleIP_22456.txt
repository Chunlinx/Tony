now brought Nato possibly and Kosovo certainly to a catastrophe Heasked Why does a bloodstained shroud only have to wave over a Balkan villagefor otherwise intelligent people to take leave of their senses An opedarticle by David Buchan in the Financial Times of London stressed the threat to NATOsrelationship with Russia which is likely to go into the deep freeze Heconcluded Over the longer term the argument with Russia may cast a pall overfurther enlargement of Natocollateral damage of the operation againstSerbia before it started            But most editorials inthe papers of Britain and other NATO countries were almost unanimous insupporting the bombing of Serbia In Britain the conservative tabloid theDaily Mail called on NATO to strike relentlessly and hard theconservative Daily Telegraph said the alliance should be prepared to conduct anextended bombing campaign to be followed as in Bosnia by the introduction ofground forces and the London EveningStandard said it was

his uncertain power at home            In Madrid an editorial in El Mundo Wednesday tookPrimakov to task for justifying Russias opposition to the bombing of Serbia byciting the example of Basque separatism in Spain People arent bombing Spainbecause the Basque problem hasnt been resolved he said This is a verycrude comparison the paper commented The case of the Basque country withits advanced political autonomy has nothing in common with an open war andethnic cleansing against  percent of a territory            An editorial in theIndependentof London headlined This war at least is silly and unnecessary referred toa new trade war between the United States and Europe over the labeling ofAmerican exports of beef from cows that were fed a bovine growth hormone TheIndependent supported
