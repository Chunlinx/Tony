Washington DCOctober  The Honorable Robert F Bennett Ranking Minority Member JointEconomic Committee Congress of the United StatesDear Senator BennettThis report responds to your May  request that we study thepractices of organizations that successfully share sensitive ortimecritical information Information sharing and coordination arekey elements in developing comprehensive and practical approachesto defending against computerbased or cyber attacks which couldthreaten the national welfare Such attacks could severely disruptcomputersupported operations compromise the confidentiality ofsensitive information and diminish the integrity of critical dataComputerbased incidents such as the ILOVEYOU virus in May and the recent Code Red SirCam and Nimda attacks have causedsignificant disruptions and damage In addition the terroristattacks of September  illustrate the importance of having timelyinformation from others on threats and possible precursors to anattackThe importance of sharing information and coordinating theresponse to cyber threats among various stakeholders has increasedas our government and our nation have become ever more reliant oninterconnected computer systems to support critical operations andinfrastructures such as telecommunications power distributionfinancial services national defense and critical governmentoperations Information on threats and incidents experienced byothers can help stakeholders identify trends better understand therisks they face and determine what preventative measures should beimplemented Accordingly the federal governments strategy forprotecting the nations critical computerdependent infrastructuresectors includes efforts to establish information sharing andanalysis centers ISACs within both the federal government andindividual industry sectors Such analysis centers can usecomprehensive timely information on incidents to determine thenature of an attack provide warnings and advise on how tomitigate an imminent attackInformation Security Code Red Code Red II and SirCam AttacksHighlight Need for Proactive Measures GAOTAugust  To identify practices that could be adopted by federal agenciesand others to  promote successful sharing of information oncomputerbased vulnerabilities and incidents and  overcomerelated challenges we studied  organizations experienced indeveloping pertinent informationsharing relationships andprocedures Appendix I contains a description of our objectivesthe scope of our study and the methodology we used Appendix IIdescribes each organization covered by our reviewThe organizations identified a number offactors that they deemed criticalResults in Briefto their success in building successful informationsharingrelationships with and among their members All of theorganizations identified trust as the essential underlying elementto successful relationships and said that trust could be built onlyover time and primarily through personal relationships Othercritical success factors identified includedestablishing effective and appropriately securecommunication mechanisms such as regular meetings and secure Websites  obtaining the support of senior managers at memberorganizations regarding the sharing of potentially sensitive memberinformation and the commitment of resources and  ensuringorganization leadership continuity In addition to be successfulinformationsharing organizations provided identifiable membershipbenefits such as current information about threatsvulnerabilities and incidents information on lessons learned andfree member advice Without such benefits according to therepresentatives we met with members would not continueparticipatingAmong the challenges identified one of the most difficult wasovercoming new members initial reluctance to share informationOther challenges included  developing agreements on the use andprotection of shared information  obtaining adequate funding tocover the cost of items such as Web sites and meetings whileavoiding seeking contributions intended primarily to promote theinterests of an individual organizationmaintaining a focus on emerging issues of interest tomembers andmaintaining professional and administrative staff withappropriate skillsThe critical success factors and challenges described by theorganizations provide useful insights for other entities that aredeveloping informationsharing relationships to assist in criticalinfrastructure protection In addition as it did regarding theYear  computing challenge the Congress can play a key role byactively monitoring progress in meeting critical infrastructureprotection goals including improved information sharing and byassisting in clarifying the way federal agencies may use sensitiveinformation provided for critical infrastructure protectionpurposes In  Congress passed legislation intended to addressconcerns from privatesector entities about exposure to legalliability and antitrust law violations that might arise due tosharing information on Year  readiness The Congress iscurrently considering measures intended to address several of thepractices and challenges we identified pertaining to criticalinfrastructure protectionIn commenting on a draft of this report the participants of ourstudy agreed with the critical success factors and challenges thatwe identified Several provided additional supporting points andexamples which we have included in the report as appropriateOver the last decade our government andour nation have becomeBackgroundincreasingly reliant on computer systems to support criticaloperations and infrastructures such as telecommunications powerdistribution financial services emergency services nationaldefense and critical government operations Over the same periodcomputer interconnectivity experienced an unprecedented growthmost notably in the use of the Internet that has revolutionizedthe way our government our nation and much of the worldcommunicate and conduct business The benefits have been enormousin terms of facilitating communications business processes andaccess to information However without proper safeguards thiswidespread interconnectivity poses enormous risks to our computersystems and more importantly to the critical operations andinfrastructures they supportAttacks could severely disrupt computersupported operationscompromise the confidentiality of sensitive information anddiminish the integrity of critical data A significant concern isthat terrorists or hostile foreign states could severely damage ordisrupt critical operations resulting in harm to the publicwelfare Threats are increasing in part because the number ofindividuals with computer skills is increasing and becauseintrusion or hacking techniques have become readily accessiblethrough magazines computer bulletin boards and Internet Websites However the sources of and motives behind cyber attacksoften cannot be readily determined This is because groups orindividuals can attack remotely from anywhere in the world overthe Internet other networks or dialup lines and they candisguise their identity location and intent by launching attacksacross a span of communications systems and computers Figure provides an overview of the various types of risks tocomputerbased operationsThe federal government has recognized that mitigating risks toour nations critical computerdependent infrastructures many ofwhich are privately owned is a serious challenge requiringcoordination and cooperation among federal agencies public andprivatesector entities and other nations In  the NationalResearch Council studied the issue and reported that as computersystems become more prevalent sophisticated embedded in physicalprocesses and interconnected society becomes more vulnerable topoor system design accidents that disable systems and attacks oncomputer systems In July  the Presidents Commission onCritical Infrastructure Protection was established to investigatethe nations vulnerability to both cyber and physical threats Thecommissions October  report Critical Foundations ProtectingAmericas Infrastructures described the potentially devastatingimplications of poor information security from a nationalperspectiveIn May  in response to the commissions  report thePresident issued Presidential Decision Directive PDD  whichoutlined a strategy for combating the threat of cyber attacks byterrorists nation states criminals or others The directivetasked federal agencies with developing critical infrastructureprotection plansIn addition PDD  recognized the importance of establishingmechanisms for sharing information on system vulnerabilitiesthreats intrusions and anomalies so that both government andindustry could better prepare to warn and defend againstcomputerbased attacks Specifically it designated lead agencieswithin the federal government to work with privatesector andgovernment entities in each of eight infrastructure sectors andfive special function areas The eight infrastructures identifiedwere  information and communications  banking and finance water supply  aviation highway mass transit pipelinesrail and waterborne commerce  emergency law enforcement emergency fire services and continuity of government  electricpower and oil and gas production and storage and  public healthservices The five special function areas were  law enforcementand internal security  intelligence  foreign affairs national defense and  research and development The directivealso encouraged the creation of ISACs that could serve asmechanisms for gathering analyzing appropriately sanitizing anddisseminating information to and from infrastructureComputers at Risk Safe Computing in the Information Age theNational Research Council Page  GAO Information Sharing Practicessectors and the government Further it recognized the FederalBureau of Investigations National Infrastructure Protection Centeras a national threat assessment warning vulnerability and lawenforcement investigation and response centerInformation sharing and coordination among organizations arecentral to producing comprehensive and practical approaches andsolutions to combating computerbased threats Having informationon threats and on actual incidents experienced by others can helpan organization identify trends better understand the risks itfaces and determine what preventative measures should beimplemented In addition comprehensive timely information onincidents can help federal and nonfederal analysis centersdetermine the nature of an attack provide warnings and advise onhow to mitigate an imminent attackHowever we previously reported that progress in implementingPDD  including the establishment of informationsharingrelationships has been slow Although six ISACs in five industrysectors had been established as of March  three had been inexistence only since December  Further as we reported inApril  the National Infrastructure Protection Center had mixedsuccess in establishing informationsharing relationships withother government entities and private industryDespite this limited progress a number of government andprivate organizations have gained experience in establishinginformationsharing relationships These organizations range fromgroups that disseminate information on immediate threats andvulnerabilities to those that seek to facilitate informationsharing between public and private entities on industryspecificthreats to those that promote coordination across infrastructuresectors and on an international scale However developing theinformationsharing and coordination capabilities that could assistin effectively addressing computerbased threats and actualincidents has proven to be challenging as organizations grapplewith ways to ensure that useful and complete data are collectedappropriately analyzed protected from inappropriate disclosureand efficiently and effectively disseminated often in the form ofwarningsCombating Terrorism Selected Challenges and RelatedRecommendations GAOSeptember  Critical Infrastructure Protection Significant Challenges inDeveloping National Capabilities GAO April  Page  GAO Information Sharing PracticesFactors Critical to Successful InformationSharingThe organizations identified several critical success factorsthat they viewed as essential to establishing developing andmaintaining effective informationsharing relationships whichcould benefit critical infrastructure protection efforts Thesefactors included  fostering trust and respect  establishingeffective timely and appropriately secure communication obtaining top management support  ensuring organizationleadership continuity and  generating clearly identifiablemembership benefitsFoster Trust and Respect An underlyingelement to the success of informationsharing organizations wasdeveloping trusted relationships among the members and theorganizations staffs Several of the organizations hadprofessional and administrative staffs that provided analyticalcapabilities and facilitated their members participation in theorganizations activities Others were less formally structuredorganizations that relied primarily on members for such supportTrust was critical to overcome members reluctance to disclosetheir weaknesses vulnerabilities and other confidential orproprietary business information to other memberssome of whom werebusiness competitors In general members were reluctant to shareinformation due to concerns that an inadvertent release of thistype of information could damage reputations lower customerconfidence provide an advantage to competitors and possiblynegatively affect members businesses and lead to punitive measuresagainst an individual member or a member organizationAll of the organizations agreed that trust had to be built overtime and through personal relationships and they had taken varioussteps to facilitate the process such as the followingMost held regularbimonthly quarterly orannualmeetings or forums to discuss issues and establishfacetoface contact Beyond the time used to discuss technicalissues these meetings included time for members to build personalrelationships and contacts Many of the organizations and themembers stated that the personal relationships and contactsdeveloped through participating in informationsharingorganizations was as important if not more important indeveloping trust than the information received by attending anorganizations functionMany organizations encouraged consistent memberparticipation noting that trust was built most effectively whenmembers consistently attended and participated in theorganizations activities Also important was for members toconsistently send the same representatives and not rotate differentpeople as representatives to the organizations functions Tomaintain consistency some organizations did not allow alternateattendees when designated representatives could notattendMost followed established procedures or performedbackground checks to evaluate prospective members before allowingtheir participation For example some organizations allowednonmembers to participate only if the organization invited them oran existing member invited and escorted them Another organizationhad an official board that reviewed membership applications todetermine whether the applicant and the applicants organizationmet established membership criteria Also groups that servedspecific audiences had established lists of pertinent organizationsthat were allowed to participate as members and receive informationof specific interest to that groupMany attempted to establish an atmosphere of mutualrespect among the members so that each members issues andexpertise merited consideration regardless of the company theyrepresented or the individual representatives position in thatcompany Often each member was required to share information orin some cases time was set aside to give each member anopportunity to raise issues for discussion In addition manyorganizations encouraged members to subordinate individual orindividual organizations interests to the interests of the entireinformationsharing group For example one organization had simplerules of behavior Members were to support one another in improvingthe security posture of each others organization without regardfor their own selfpromotion or for the profit or publicity oftheir individual organizationAll had established procedures for handling violations ofthe rules because any violation of trust undermined theorganizations purpose and diminished members willingness to sharein the future The organizations had both formal and informal meansof encouraging compliance and sanctioning violators In some casesmembers were formally asked to terminate their participation amembers access was terminated or a members organization wasasked to replace its representative For example one organizationwould restrict access to a secure server thereby terminating theindividuals ability to share orEstablish Mechanisms For EffectiveTimely and Appropriately Secure Communicationreceive information Informally other members would no longerinclude a violator in sensitive conversations One participantemphasized that once the group lost trust in a member trust couldnot be easily restored Our study participants said that theirorganizations rarely experienced a violation of trust becausemembers did not want to jeopardize their ability to participateand thus lose the benefits of membershipThe organizations used a variety of mechanisms to ensureeffective and timely communication among members and with theprofessional and administrative staffs that some of theorganizations had established In addition the organizations wereconcerned about appropriately securing the information being sharedto maintain member anonymity when desired and avoidinappropriately disseminating sensitive or proprietary informationto nonmembersRegularly scheduled meetings were the primary method for sharinginformation as well as a method for building trust as previouslydiscussed These meetings offered a generally secure environment toshare information while also encouraging broader memberparticipation The organizations also adjusted the meeting timesand lengths to accommodate member needs and attempted to enhancethe meetings efficiency and effectiveness by limiting the time forpresentations approving most topics and presentations before themeetings and adjusting meeting times to maximize facetofacediscussions between membersTypically the meetings lasted  day to  days for the entiremembership and some meetings included separate sessions forsmaller groups to discuss specific technical or member issues Forexample one organization had quarterly day meetings the firstday of which was typically restricted to a small number of memberswith expertise pertinent to the specific topic under discussionThese closed meetings tended to be more technical than the openmeetings and include information and discussions that were moresensitive and detailed The second days meeting which was for allmembers of the organization included discussions about the latestsoftware tools and the latest technology and allowed time for anymember to openly discuss specific topics Another organization heldmore informal quarterly halfday meetings that includedpresentations about a wide variety of topics and allowedconsiderable time for members to develop personal contacts and havefacetoface discussions Beyond the regularly scheduled meetingsthree organizations had created committees to perform specifictasks such as policy setting that allowed for greater contactbetween some members and more topicbased information sharingVarious types of information technology provided importantcommunication mechanisms as well For example Web sites were usedto disseminate all types of information including alertsadvisories reports and other analysis  make databasesavailable to the members and  provide methods for members toask each other about particular incidents vulnerabilities orpotential solutions Many organizations had secure Web sites toshare sensitive information others used open sites to sharegeneral information with their members and the public Oneorganization established a secure telephone line that allowedimmediate contact with multiple parties thereby speedingcommunication of timecritical information In addition someorganizations used email to communicate less sensitive informationto the entire membership However members from one organizationdid not typically use email because of the lack of security andthe inability to control subsequent distribution This organizationrelied primarily on regular mail and telephone conversations todisseminate information about most things including meetingagendas and realtime problem solvingDue to concerns about the inadvertent release of sensitiveinformation membership lists and victim identification some ofthe organizations had implemented special security procedures Forexample several organizations carefully sanitized victimidentifiers from documentation or did not document discussionsabout specific vulnerabilities and incidents One organization tookspecial precautions to hide the identity of victims by limiting itsstaffs access to the information and segregating the informationon a special network Another organizations membership list wasmaintained by only one person and never generally released to allmembersSeveral representatives stated that an underlying requirementfor communications was establishing standard terms and reportingthresholds so that the magnitude of an incident could be easily andconsistently understood and members could quickly determine anincidents potential impact on them According to one officialsuch standardization helped to ensure that  members understoodthe level of risk imposed by the circumstance  information wasappropriately sanitized to protect the victims identity and solutions were easily understood One organization had developed anextensive policy that defined each members responsibility forreporting information the terms that would be used for thereporting and the thresholds that required reporting Also twoorganizations were developing reporting forms to standardize themechanism and language used to report incidents to the organizationfor further analysis and disseminationIn addition organizations sought member input in developing newsystems and mechanisms for communicating information therebybetter fulfilling member needs and giving the members a sense ofownership in the system or product For example one organizationsolicited suggestions about how to improve existing databases andwhat new databases were needed by the membersMembers told us that senior managementsupport for their participation in an informationsharingorganization was critical to their success in obtaining valuableinformation and contributing to the success of the entireinformationsharing organization For example management approvalwas needed before individuals could share information aboutpotentially sensitive incidents and vulnerabilities Without suchsupport members could not fully participate in theinformationsharing process Top management support was also neededto ensure that a member organizations representative could obtainfunding for travel and other resources For example twoorganizations charged membership feesone of which exceeded a yearand other organizations requested people to provide supportstaff and analystsObtain Top Management SupportEnsure Leadership ContinuitySeveral organizations were led by individuals who had spentyears building personal relationships with members and working tochampion the purpose and mission of their organizations In ourdiscussions with members these leaders were given considerablecredit for the quality and value of the information that themembers received and the success of the informationsharingorganizations These longterm leaders told us that to help ensurecontinuity and diminish reliance on a single individual theyattempted to institutionalize their roles by bringing in additionalpeople to assist in leading their organizations and performing suchduties as enforcing membership rules and keeping current on issuesand topics affecting their organizations membersGenerate Clearly Organizationrepresentatives said that generating clearly identifiable benefitswas essential for maintaining active member participation andIdentifiable MembershipBenefits support in their organizations Many representativestold us that due to members own resource and time constraintsmembers would not participate in informationsharing organizationsunless they received benefits Benefits the representatives citedincluded the followingMembers were provided access to current information aboutincidents threats and vulnerabilities that had been analyzed bytrusted experts Some of the organizations performed expertanalysis on incidents reported to them by members or the public andprovided analyses and alerts to the members that includedinformation on the incidents level of threat and any possiblemitigation techniques Another organization provided its memberswith a method for soliciting advice from the entire membership Inthis case a member would send a query to the organizationsexperts who would review the request clarify any questions withthe member and then send the request to the rest of themembership While the rest of the membership reviewed and commentedon the query the organizations experts continued to analyze theproblem eventually providing its final analysis which couldinclude a threat rating and potential solutions to the entiremembership Some participants stated that the amount of analysisperformed before informing the members had to be balanced with theneed to quickly warn the members about the potential threatSeveral participants stated that sharing information for the sakeof sharing was not valuable because information securityprofessionals need analyses that offer solutionsMembers were informed about emerging technology so thatthey could discuss or at least be aware of possible vulnerabilitiesand the associated risks These discussions were valuable tomembers because the information was useful in their employersplanning efforts For example several of the organizations hadrecently discussed or were planning to discuss thevulnerabilities surrounding the use of wireless networkingtechnologyMembers shared information concerning informationsecurity management practices including corporate governancepractices business risk management processes computing andnetwork contract provisions application development and supportdisaster recovery planning and performance measurement regardingcontrol effectivenessMembers shared lessons learned and offered free expertadvice on individual projects The opportunity to draw on a networkof experts gave members insight into their own problems and theshortfalls in proposed projects For example in many cases oneorganizations members were willing to help each other by reviewingthe requirement documentation for new systems development projectsor system enhancement projects and participate in meetings toexpose weaknesses and raise questions about a proposed projectAccording to one participant his employer had received hundreds ofthousands of dollars worth of free expert advice during a halfdaydiscussion of a proposed information system that his employer wasdeveloping The discussion led to the development of a better moresecure system The sharing of free advice also occurred moreinformallyMembers received realtime assistance in response toproblems For example one members entity experienced asophisticated network intrusion that was originating from a foreignInternet service provider Through the contacts made at one of theinformationsharing organizations the system administrator wasable to contact the Internet service provider and stop theintrusion According to an individual involved this incident wasstopped much faster than it otherwise would have been because ofthe trusted relationships developed through the informationsharingorganization that allowed open and candid discussions tooccurMembers established more cooperative relationships withlaw enforcement entities than would have otherwise occurred Of organizations  were sponsored by law enforcement entities andmost included members from the law enforcement community Althoughlaw enforcement organizations could not share certain sensitiveinformation including them in the informationsharing groups ledto trusted relationships between law enforcement organizations andthe others shared expertise about computer forensics and evidencegathering related to electronic crimes and thus awareness aboutthese topics which encouraged organizations to report crimesRepresentatives of one group told us that their members ability toproperly gather and protect computerrelated evidence hadfacilitated law enforcement investigations thus limiting the timeand resources that the victim and the law enforcement officersneeded to carry out an investigation In addition the trustedrelationships provided law enforcement with a greater pool ofexperts to use as expert witnesses or consultantsMembers developed valuable professional relationshipsthrough participation Many members that participated in our studystated that their exposure to other experts and cuttingedgetechnology was a valuable learning experience that increased theirown technical expertise In addition the large network ofcolleagues that members developed by participating assisted theiremployers in identifying potential professionals to fill openpositionsMembers told us that they believed that the informationsharing their organizations engaged in contributed to the overallsecurity of the nations critical infrastructuresan effort thatthey viewed as being in their own selfinterest as well as that ofothersIn addition to the critical success factorspreviously discussed organizations identified a number of relatedchallenges to effective information sharing These challengesincluded  initially establishing and maintaining trustrelationships  developing agreements on the use and protectionof shared information  obtaining adequate funding developing and retaining a membership base and  developing andmaintaining an organization staff with appropriate skillsChallenges to Building and Maintaining Effective InformationSharingInitially Establishing and MaintainingTrust RelationshipsAll of the participating organizations told us that initiallyestablishing trust among the original members was a challenge Thiswas because members were reluctant to share their organizationsproblems and vulnerabilities with outsiders some of whom werecommercial competitors Members stated that the first meetingsdiscussed broad subjects that individuals were concerned about orequally affected by such as computer forensicsIn some cases members initially participated because of anexisting trust relationship with individual leaders or sponsorsand it was a challenge to keep them returning until they saw valuein participating and had built trust with other members In suchsituations the persistence of trusted leaders in encouragingeffective member participation was essentialOver time this challenge diminished as members became familiarwith each other enthusiastic members moved past general topicsand rules of behavior were clarified In addition over timemembers began to better understand the perspectives of others Forexample discussions among members gradually led those from theprivate sector to gain anDeveloping Agreements on the Use andProtection of Shared Informationunderstanding of the law enforcement communitys approach toinvestigating crime Further some members from federal agenciessaid that it took time for them to determine how they could sharesensitive including classified information with nonfederalgovernment entitiesAnother challenge previously mentioned was the need toinstitutionalize trust rather than depend indefinitely on personaloneonone relationships Institutionalizing trust was especiallyimportant for large organizations and federal entities thattypically experienced a great deal of staff turnoverInformation sharing is impeded when there is a lack of clearlyunderstood agreements and expectations on how potentially sensitiveinformation will be used and protected by the recipients Toovercome this obstacle most of the organizations required membersto sign confidentiality or informationsharing agreements Theseagreements varied among the organizations some agreements weregeneral while others were specific Though many of theorganizations did not consider these agreements to be essentialrepresentatives of one organization considered them importantbecause they clarified and helped to institutionalize agreementsensured senior management understanding and support and fosteredacceptance of new members For example one organization determinedthat more formal agreements were needed when its membership wassignificantly expanded The more formal agreements helped ensurethat new members were familiar with the organizations practiceswhich had previously been informal and undocumented These newagreements described how the sensitivity of information would bedefined how shared information would be protected fromdissemination outside the group and what information could beshared with nonmembersNoting that informationsharing agreements cannot cover everysituation that may arise one organization emphasized theimportance of promoting an attitude of sensitivity to the concernsof others regarding disclosure of potentially confidential ordamaging information Officials from this organization described asituation in which a company had notified them of a newlyidentified vulnerability Before disseminating information on thevulnerability to its constituent members the informationsharingorganization worked with the company to develop a message thatwould provide the needed vulnerability information but not disclosesensitive details This collaborative effort helped ensure andmaintain trust between the organization and the companyRepresentatives of a few organizations said that members hadraised concerns about their potential liability for any damage thatoccurred as a result of the information they shared and the advicethey gave Specifically members were concerned that they might beheld liable if other members took their advice and experiencednegative results Officials from one organization were alsoconcerned that they might be held responsible if their adviceadversely affected a vendor To mitigate the risk of any suchliability some organizations addressed this issue specifically intheir informationsharing agreements stating that members who tookthe advice of others did so at their own risk In addition somemembers of federally sponsored organizations expressed the concernthat members potentially sensitive information voluntarily sharedwith federal entities could be required to be made publiclyavailable under provisions of the Freedom of Information Actdespite existing exemptions for sensitive or proprietaryinformationThe organizations also faced challengesobtaining adequate funding for various items including mailingsmeeting space technological enhancements and other administrativeactivities and when applicable salaries for permanent staff Theynoted that the funding must be reliable so that the organizationcould plan budget and remain consistent in its activities Forexample one organization had to stop development of a secure Website because the sponsor withdrew its support Representatives fromseveral organizations that relied on voluntary contributions frommembers emphasized however that such funding must beunbiasedthat is used for promoting open and honest informationsharing rather than furthering an individuals or organizationsstature in the community or for gaining clientsObtaining Adequate FundingDeveloping and Retaining the MembershipBaseMost of the organizations said that they had to work to overcomethe challenge of maintaining their memberships enthusiasm andparticipation so that members would use the communicationmechanisms maintain confidentiality and continue to sharerelevant information In addition organizations had to solicit newmembers to stay at their chartered number and to keep an influx ofnew ideasFor the organizations that strictly controlled their membershipor the number of members developing and maintaining theirmembership base was a formidable challenge For theseorganizations the loss of members eg due to the loss of themembers management support or difficultDeveloping and Maintaining AppropriateAnalytical and Administrative Skillseconomic times threatened their survival For one organizationthis meant that the leaders had to continually establish contactsin their industry and determine which prospective companies wouldprovide the most benefit to the entire groupIn addition the organizations that focused on the informationtechnology area faced the challenge of a very transient membershipbecause information technology professionals often moved fromorganization to organization When the individuals moved theinformationsharing organizations had to determine if they would beallowed to continue participating which was usually based on thecontributions and the enthusiasm of the individual Theorganizations usually allowed individual members who had changedemployers to continue participation However two organizationsspecifically did not allow individuals to continue participating ifthey changed employers and their new employer was not a member ofthe organizations because their membership was based on theorganizations not the individualsMost of the organizations faced the challenge of developing andmaintaining an organization with the appropriate operational skillsto facilitate the members participation and oversee administrativeactivities that ensured continued and effective informationsharing For example the organizations that had professional andadministrative staffs said that it was difficult to find and retainemployees with the level of skills and foresight that wouldcontribute to the organizations mission Staff members wereexpected to assist members in participating in information sharingby arranging meetings and travel maintaining the communicationsmechanisms and keeping abreast of current and emerging issuesFurther to build trusted relationships and gain the acceptance ofmember organizations staff needed to have pertinent skills andknowledgeBecause the job market was so competitive one of the sponsoringorganizations established flexible working arrangements for andgave competitive pay to their professional staff that supported itsinformationsharing organization Another organization recruitedstaff from its industry who had relevant technical experience andunderstood the organizations role in the industry In additionone of the organizations used contractors to maintain itscommunications mechanisms and analyze reported incidentsInformation on Critical Success Factorsand Challenges Can Benefit Critical Infrastructure ProtectionIn addition the representatives from organizations withoutprofessional and administrative staffs believed that an even moredifficult challenge was encouraging volunteers to donate additionaltime to perform the administrative tasks required to organizemeetings and further facilitate information sharing In oneorganization the leader had taken most of the responsibility forthese tasksInformation sharing and coordination among organizations areimportant aspects of producing comprehensive and practicalapproaches to combating computerbased attacks Information onthreats and incidents experienced by others can help anorganization identify trends better understand the risks it facesand determine what preventative measures should be implemented Inaddition comprehensive timely information on incidents can helpfederal and nonfederal analysis centers determine the nature of anattack provide warnings and advise on how to mitigate an imminentattackThe critical success factors and challenges described byorganizations experienced in sharing sensitive and timecriticalinformation and the lessons they have learned provide usefulinsights for other entities who are also trying to develop means ofappropriately sharing information on computerbased vulnerabilitiesand the related risks As the governments critical infrastructureprotection strategy evolves both public and privatesector entitiescan adopt the practices described toestablish trusted relationships with a wide variety offederal and nonfederal entities that may be in a position toprovide potentially useful information and advice onvulnerabilities and incidentsdevelop standards and agreements on how sharedinformation will be used and protectedestablish effective and appropriately securecommunication mechanismstake steps to ensure that sensitive information is notinappropriately disseminated which may require statutorychangesensure that benefits are realized by developing andmaintaining staff with the skills to support analyticalcapabilities and facilitate communication among informationsharingpartners obtain the support of senior officials in both federal andnonfederal entities and obtain adequate fundingThe Congress can play a key role in facilitating theinformationsharing aspect of critical infrastructure protectionas it did regarding the Year  computing challenge For examplethe Congress can actively monitor progress in meeting criticalinfrastructure protection goals including improved informationsharing and promote trust by assisting in clarifying the wayfederal agencies may use sensitive information provided forcritical infrastructure protection purposes Prior to  theCongress held important hearings on Year  readiness and in passed legislation intended to address concerns fromprivatesector entities about exposure to legal liability andantitrust law violations that might arise due to sharinginformation on Year  readinessThe Congress is currently considering measures intended toaddress several of the practices and challenges we identified Tworecently introduced bills S  and HR  includeprovisions that address the receipt care and storage of criticalinfrastructure protection information as well as specificexemptions from public disclosure of such informationImplementation of such provisions as well as other monitoringactions could facilitate information sharing and thus federaland private efforts to protect critical infrastructuresIn commenting on a draft of this reportthe participants of our studyParticipants Commentsagreed with the critical success factors and challenges that

Michael Gilmore Danielle Hollomon andCatherine SchweitzerSincerely yoursRobert F Dacey Director Information Security Issues AppendixIObjectives Scope and MethodologyOur overall objective was to identify informationsharingpractices that federal organizations and others can adopt toimprove their ability to understand anticipate and addresscomputerbased vulnerabilities and incidents Our specificobjectives were to identify  critical success factors inbuilding informationsharing relationships and  relatedchallenges and how to address themTo meet these objectives we studied  federal and nonfederalentities experienced in developing relationships and procedures forinformation sharing We identified these organizations bysoliciting suggestions from a variety of sources including ouranalysts familiar with informationsharing organizations andmembers of our Executive Council on Information Management andTechnology which is a group of executives with extensiveexperience in information technology management who advise us onmajor information management issues affecting federal agenciesThese sources recommended over  public and private organizationsAfter initial discussions and further research we narrowed ourfocus to  organizations that most closely met our criteria ofbeing a recognized competent informationsharing entity primarilysharing sensitive or timecritical information pertaining tocomputerbased vulnerabilities and incidentsThese  organizations included among their membershiprepresentatives from federal state and local governments privatecompanies of varying sizes and the academic community Theindividuals who were involved in the organizations had varioustechnical and business backgroundssuch as information securityspecialists computer scientists engineers auditors lawyers lawenforcement officers and medical professionals Each of the organizations covered by our review is described in AppendixIITo identify common critical success factors we researched eachorganization analyzed relevant documents interviewed pertinentorganization officials and knowledgeable members observed meetingsand other operations and compared their experiences forsimilarities To identify challenges associated with successfulinformation sharing we obtained the views of officials and membersof each organization and reviewed supporting documentation when itwas availableWe solicited comments from each of the eleven organizations thatwe studied Additional supporting points and examples wereincorporated asAppendix I Objectives Scope and Methodologyappropriate We conducted our study from May  throughOctober  in accordance with generally accepted governmentauditing standardsAppendix IIThe  Organizations That Participated inGAOs Study of Information SharingThe AgoraThe Agora is a Seattlebased regional network of over professionals representing a variety of fields includinginformation systems security law enforcement local state andfederal governments engineering information technologyacademics and other specialties The participants represent over commercial firms and  government entities located in  USStates and  Canadian ProvincesFounded in  the Agora formed to address the enormoussecurity challenges brought about by new computer network andInternet technologies The Agoras objectives are toestablish confidential ways for organizations to sharesensitive information about common problems and best practices fordealing with security threatsdevelop and share knowledge about how to protectelectronic infrastructuresestablish shared services that enhance participantsability to successfully perform their daily jobsprompt more research specific to electronic informationsystems securityshare educational opportunities andenjoy the benefits of the fosteredrelationshipsInformation sharing occurs primarily through quarterly meetingsthat typically include  Agora members In addition to thequarterly meetings informal meetings and teleconferences are heldamong members on an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arisesuch as assisting entities under attackCenters for Disease Control andPreventionThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC which isan agency of the Department of Health and Human Services isrecognized as the lead federal agency for protecting the health andsafety of people at home and abroad CDC seeks to accomplish itsmission by working with partners throughout the nation and world tomonitor health detect and investigate health problems conductresearch to enhance the prevention of diseasePage  GAO Information Sharing PracticesAppendix II The  Organizations That Participated in GAOsStudy of Information SharingPulseNetEpidemic Information ExchangeThe Data Webfoster safe and healthful environments and provide leadershipand trainingCDC uses several informationsharing computer systems to helpaccomplish its mission three of which were covered by our reviewand are described belowIn  CDC officially announced the establishment of PulseNeta national network of public health laboratories that helpsepidemiologists rapidly identify clusters of foodborne illness andalerts others in the surrounding geographic area and throughout thecountry regarding a possible outbreak By sharing information onoutbreaks quickly through computer systems connected to theInternet PulseNet allows CDC to very quickly notify public healthofficials and food regulators of the health threat and assistinvestigators in identifying and removing the food source of theoutbreak from distribution channels thus mitigating the healthrisks associated with such outbreaksIn November  the Epidemic Information Exchange system wasimplemented as an interactive secure Internetbased network thatprovides information on epidemic outbreaks toxic exposures andother health events as they occur Epidemic Intelligence Serviceofficers at CDC state and local laboratory personnel and otherpublic health officials use the system to securely conduct onlinediscussions about posted events communicate with public healthofficials and request both financial
