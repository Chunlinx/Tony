                hi Vicky   hi   uh been wondering what youve been wearing to work lately   well i tell you what my going to work clothes has changed over a period of years i used to work in an office and i would and i thought that i would have to have a lot of clothes because when you go and work around a lot of people for some reason i just felt the need to have a a nice variety and look and look different   uhhuh   now i work in an office in my home and im doing office work and i go out and call on people in their homes i sell insurance   uhhuh   so i could wear the same thing every single day and it really wouldnt make any difference so and sometimes i do that its just very very strange and different     thats that must be nice   its a different feeling i get up and i i dress as i would go out to an appointment even if im going to stay in my office for most of the day or half of the day i just get up and get dressed like i was going you know out   yeah   but it is this strange feeling to really realize that i really dont need a large wardrobe   thats right   and um that i can go and and i could wear the very same thing every single day   thats neat   how how do you do what   oh i usually wear dresses or suits i work as an engineer   yeah well i i wear dresses or suits too   and mine doesnt really vary that much from season to season uh i guess i wear a little less in the summer time a little more in the winter   right right   you know or with a suit i i tend to wear a sweater in the winter as opposed to a blouse in the summertime   umhum have you always lived in this area   no no i grew up in New Mexico and spent several years in Ohio going to school   umhum well it seems to me like maybe fifteen years ago ive always lived in this area and it seems like about fifteen to twenty years ago i would see more of a significant difference in the seasons and um i had a tendency to really buy wool clothes for the winter and really make a a definite change   uhhuh   and it seems like the last few years ive had a tendency to even though i want to continue that its just kind of been a pattern i have i really dont wear my wool clothes any more so ive really had to make a concerted effort to buy lighter weight clothing and and and now most of my suits will wear all all year around   yeah i think its a lot of that is because of the fabrics have changed so much   well it im i it i just wonder if its the fabrics or if if theres been that much change in in uh the seasons it seems to me like were not having as cold a weather in this area as we used to have many years ago   yeah well ive been in the Dallas area for about fifteen years and i remember some ice storms and there was nothing you could wear to be warm enough   right     but uh you know i ive got all these woolens from Ohio uh because well i wore a heavy coat and a scarf and gloves and a hat all that stuff   yeah yeah   long underwear when i was going to classes   right       well i just i had a trip to uh Colorado in December and i took really you know warm clothes in fact i bought a down jacket so that i would have something warm enough and i didnt need anything i mean it just happened to be the week that i was there it was just really nice and pleasant so   umhum   now ive got a nice new London Fog down jacket that ill probably never wear         unless i go back to to uh Colorado and the weathers bad   yeah well   i remember who you are now       yeah ive placed you   its hard sometimes isnt it   right right       but thats funny too i havent talked to as many of these calls as weve made i havent uh talked to anybody else in the Altrusa club before   i have i talked to Susan Linnstaedter   is that right ill be darned well um   yes but we didnt get to talk about clothing   yeah well right well um   hum   i was trying to think of something else that we might talk about about clothing   well do you do you i was wondering about when you dress for the day like if you have a club meeting that evening just keep wearing the same thing i usually do   yes i do too i just dont change uh and a lot of times i come in and in the evenings and i change directly to you know like what im sleeping in and my robe   yeah   thats terrible but i just it seems like theres only a few hours there and i just want to be totally relaxed of course if i know uh if i know i going to go out or run to the store or something well ill just ill put on something   i   you know jeans or sweats or something like that but normally i do that about three or four times a week is just come in and
