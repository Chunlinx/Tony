                                 Light and Dark            Martin Luther King wasbeatified because he died dramatically with his sins unknown and the civilrights movement still seen as an epic gathering of heroes Hero worshipdominated the story from the Montgomery bus boycott in the s through theReaganaut s when writers finally began to acknowledge that the civil rightsestablishment had just as many fakers as saints The inner workings of Kingsorganization have yet to be fully revealed But enough has been said to showthat the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was a cult of personality inwhich Kings lieutenants covered up his sexual peccadilloes and vied obscenelyfor his attention and the chance to succeed him in the public eye            The taleof the selfless prophets is giving way to a more realistic but no less amazingstory of how egoists hustlers and sensualists rose above their failings toremake the United States In his memoir Walking With the Wind  RepJohn Lewis DGa pushes this new openness a good deal further He speaksbluntly about the movements faultsand his ownduring his leadership of theStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the s SNCC was SCLCs chiefcompetitor and the principal operator in the dangerous voting rights campaignsin Mississippi and Alabama Lewis respected his civil rights forefathers butdid not worship them A decade younger than King and substantially moreaggressive he regularly dismissed the advice of bigwigs like King and theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples Roy Wilkins andThurgood Marshall pursuing a course far more radical than theirs in the deepSouth But what is freshest about Walking With the Wind is that Lewis isequally candid about the class conflicts that afflicted the modern civil rightsmovements from the very beginning Tensions between the uneducated rural poorand the urban intellectuals were glaringly obvious to AfricanAmericans butlargely invisible to the white press and the historians who succeeded them            Thirty years is less than the blink of an eye in humanhistory Yet it was that recently that black people in Alabama or Mississippiwere arrested beaten fired from their jobs and even lynched for trying tovote The campaign that overturned American apartheid was a potent form oftheater in which demonstrators embraced the opportunity to be shot gassedand thrashed in order to generate outrage against Southern racism The mostharrowing parts of this book tell of Lewis and the integrated teams of FreedomRiders who rode on buses through the South to test federal laws that forbadesegregation in interstate transport One bus was firebombed in Anniston AlaThe bus was surrounded by a mob that had lynching on its mind until anundercover policeman got off the bus brandishing his pistol A Freedom Ridersbus carrying Lewis had the unfortunate experience of arriving in MontgomeryAla The mob that came to savage them bore a striking resemblance to theflesheating zombies in the cult movie Night of the Living Dead             Andthen out of nowhere from every direction came people White people Menwomen and children Dozens of them Hundreds of them Out of alleys out ofside streets around the corners of office buildings  They carried everymakeshift weapon imaginable Baseball bats wooden boards bricks chains tireirons pipes even garden toolshoes and rakes One group had a woman infront their faces twisted in anger screaming Git them niggers GIT themniggers   And now they turned to us this sea of people more thanthree hundred of them shouting and screaming men swinging fists and weaponswomen swinging heavy purses little children clawing with their fingernails atthe faces of anyone they could reach  I could see Jim Zwerg now beinghorribly beaten Someone picked up his suitcase which he had dropped andswung it full force against his head Another man lifted Jims head and held it while others including women and children scratched at Jims face Hiseyes were shut He was unconscious  At that instant I felt a thud againstmy head I could feel my knees collapse and then nothing            SNCC pioneered the strategy of tradingfractured skulls for press attention and moral outrage This seemscoldbloodeduntil the reader considers that Lewis thrust himself into the mostdangerous confrontations Lewis admirers called it bravery Lewis called itredemptive suffering a concept he picked up from studying Gandhi amongothers But what it amounted to was putting yourself forward to be beatenpossibly to death day after day week after week month after month Whatwould drive someone to do this is still an enigma to me            Themethod succeeded to perfection when Alabama state troopers bludgeoned andteargassed the Selma march led by Lewis in  King had skipped the marchfearful of the violence But Bloody Sunday at Selma outraged the nation andgave President Lyndon Johnson cover to press for the Voting Rights Act Wildlysuccessful the Selma campaign nonetheless marked the beginning of the end forthe movement The civil rights coalition was tearing itself apart in disputesover tactics money and who would get the most exposure in the press            Egos were clearly at issue But so were the antagonismsthat had long separated middle and upperclass blacks from their sharecroppercousins A blatant elitism infested the movement for racial uplift from theoutset The first civil rights leaders were from the mulatto elite whichhistorically discriminated against darkerskinned blacks and held many of thesame ideas about them that whites did These antipathies mellowed intocondescension in WEB Du Bois a scion of the fairskinned elite acofounder of the NAACP and the first black man to earn a PhD from HarvardDu Bois racial philosophy emerged in his essay on the talented tenthassigned the task of lifting up the rest Du Bois wrote Progress in humanaffairs is more often a pull than a push a surging forward of the exceptionalman and the lifting of his duller brethren slowly and painfully to hisvantageground            Lewis hadlots of experience with snobbery from hightoned Negroes The NAACP inparticular was chock full of fairskinned members of the black middle classLewis by contrast was darkerskinned and had been raised in poor ruralAlabama His accent and modest even diffident manner led the Negro leaders toview him as much less than he was Lewis describes the civil rights elite asbourgeois folks who enjoyed fundraisers but had never known the billy club andtended to look down through a telescope at the little people Meeting withWilkins to plan the March on Washington in  Lewis found himself beingtreated like a hick            The most complex tensions were between Lewisand his close colleague Julian Bond whose father was a pillar of AtlantasNegro elite and a close friend of Du Bois Bond must have found it satisfyingto be accepted by a black person who had been raised hardand who was not fromthe affluent set The official line is that Lewis and Bond were fast friendswhen they were in SNCC together but fell out in  when they both ran forthe same congressional seat Walking With the Wind tells a differentstory Lewis hints at secret annoyance with Bond from the first mention inwhich he writes that Julian was like most of the Atlanta members more uppercrust than those of us from Nashville Lewis portrays SNCCs Atlanta branch asbeing made up of welloff Negroes who carped all the time            The split seemed to come in when Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia state Legislature and becamethe darling of the American lefts radical chic set Lewis advised Bond to stayat home in Atlanta build a political machine and run for Congress Bondrejected this advice But a quarter of a century later the two faced off in abitter campaign for the  th congressional district seat AndrewYoung Maynard Jackson and the mulatto elite dismissed Lewis and lined upbehind Bond Late in the book Lewis remarks bitterly on press coverage thatreferred to Bond as lightskinned dashing erudite articulate and to Lewisas short squat thicknecked balding dark scowling a sharecroppers sonInfluential blacks from around the country advised him to quit the race andleave the seat to the man many of them viewed as its rightful heir Stillangry Lewis writes Throughout my years in the movement  people had alwaysunderestimated me  often in the end to their dismay            Lewis brought to thecampaign the same intensity he had trained upon redneck troopers and sheriffsWhen he defeated Bond it was more than just a victory for himself It was avictory for the darkskinned dirt poor masses against the hincty Negroes whohad historically looked down on them
