suck the life out of established companiesAny discussion of the technology business is colored with the lurid vocabularyfound mainly in Quentin Tarantino films Observers who knew business only fromthese descriptions would reach one of two conclusions  Business is an epicand violent struggle fought by heroic and powerful men  They areoverhearing a bunch of preteen boys playing with action figures The secondoption is a lot closer to the truth            Titans ofindustry as overpaid Ninja Turtles Surely this isnt the case Business iswar Its leaders are strategic commanders who boldly snatch victory from thejaws of defeatand who perform other acts of derringdo This kind of talksounds great in the boardroom and for that matter in the bookstore wheredozens of authors counsel wouldbe corporate warriors Sun Tzu is alleged tohave written The Art of War some  years agoso he isnt personallyplying the seminar circuit but his translators and interpreters are alongwith those promoting other militaryhistory hall of famers like Attila the HunKarl Von Clausewitz and the  th century samurai who wrote ABook of Five Rings                        The first clue that something is amiss is that only deadgenerals seem to give business advice Live generals are experts on thespecialized killing of modern armiesefficient but lacking the cachet ofancient warfare Wheres the chivalry in a stealth bomber Besides modernexamples are obviously irrelevant to the next marketing plan Dead experts onthe other hand can opine on topics like swordsmanship which are so irrelevantthat they can be mistaken for a mystical metaphor            When Ifirst moved from theoretical physics to business I dutifully read thebusinessaswar books hoping to gain some insights I did learn a lot abouthow the ancient kingdom of Wu conducted foreign policy the virtue of a fewbeheadings to discipline the troops and how Von Clausewitz thought you shoulddeploy field artillery A decade later I must confess that Ive never deployedartillery and that the kingdom of Wu has yet to come up Nor have I had anopportunity to behead miscreant employees although in some cases it is apleasing thought This is true even though Ive served on the front lines ofthe purported battles famed in the lore and legend of the softwareindustry            Softwareindustry battles are fought by highlypaid and outofshape nerds furiously pounding computer keyboards while theyguzzle diet Coke The stakes arent very dramatic Life Liberty The pursuitof happiness Nope its about stock options The winners will be worthsomething the losers will negotiate new compensation deals with the nextemployer A great deal of intellectual effort goes into this competition butviolence or heroism Not that Ive seen Latenight pizza parties are about aswild as it gets            Thebigger the technological confrontation the more slowly it occurs Industrypundits have long predicted the death of the mainframe computer at the hands ofPCs and workstations Twenty years after this funeral dirge started it seemssafe to say the predictions were a bit premature For the first  years thepersonal computer had no direct competition with mainframesthey simply diddifferent things Utilities bills and payroll were not good candidates for aPC just as flyingtoaster screen savers were rare on IBM s More recentlya few mainframe applications have become feasible on PC servers and it isclear that one day the last mainframe will be turned off That day may beanother  years hence or perhaps only  Either way this clash of thetitans has been about as exciting to watch as a melting glacier Yet it is farmore typical of a technology change than the slambang predictions wouldsuggest            A new and fastgrowing technology is almost by definitionexpanding into a vacuum by operating in a new or unprecedented manner Itshard to take the world by storm and butt heads with entrenched competitors atthe same time Technological revolutions dont really overthrowanythingthey simply append a new and dynamic market to that which wentbefore The new appendages might grow faster than their predecessors and soeclipse them as the darling du jour of Wall Street However being upstagedisnt quite the same as being annihilated and it certainly isnt anything likewar Less frequently something is rendered totally obsoletebut usually onlyif it has been around a long time Records were replaced by CDs and lead typedied in favor of computerized fonts However each had a year ride ofpopularity so you cant feel too bad for them            Productsand companies do go headtohead in direct competition but it is rare that thechallenger stages an upset during the initial period of high growth Thefastest a competitor can win is in three or four product versionswhich is tosay over a period of four to six years Hardly a blitzkrieg When a winnerdoes emerge the victory is rarely equivocal Suicide rather than death inbattle is the proximate cause of every hightech demise I can think ofCompetitors bring pressure to bear on a company but the really damaging movesare invariably selfinflicted The immediate causes are many A disastrousacquisition drains cash reserves and defocuses management a crucial technologytrend is ignored attempts to diversify beyond the initial product line stallThe most common problem is that the company loses touch with the creativity andtechnical wizardry that were once its raison dtre often because of the exitof the founders and key technical staff No competitor or other external agentcan cause this sort of mortal damage to find the culprit senior managementneednt look further than a mirror            This perspective might seem selfserving sincepeople use the word domination more often when referring to my employer thanthey do in calls to  numbers Its rather amusing to conjure up this imageas I walk past colleagues clad in chinos and Birkenstocks Not exactly the garbyoud envision for world domination Perhaps my insiders view is biased butat least its informed unlike those of the many armchair experts opining onthe matter Be that as it may bellicose language and selfinflicted wounds arenot exclusive to those parts of the industry where Microsoft is involvedyoufind them everywhere            The storyof the technology business gets spiced up because the reality is so blandProfessional storytellers find this particularly vexing The business press iskeen on salacious sound bites because without such enhancement nobody wouldgive a damn Man Bites Dog is a great headline Dog Bites Man is a poorsubstitute but beats Man and Dog Work Really Hard Late at Night for a LongTime Until One of Them Screws Up The last has all the excitement of a game ofchess played via postcardsuntil it is recast as singlewarrior combat            Its easy to mock the shallow treatment of complextechnology issues in the press and the absurd opinions of selfproclaimedexperts analysts and other touts But the press only borrows the martialrhetoric that business leaders use themselves Its not hard to see why theyuse it In a culture where Xena and Hercules have hit TV shows its a lot morefun imagining that you are a valiant warrior doing businessasbattle than itis to admit that youre a pudgy functionary whose most daring deed is to drafta boldly worded memo Just ask me            Tough talk and the rhetoricof conflict help hide the basic truth that business leaders are in real lifemore contemplative than combative more sedentary than savage Leadership isabout being clever hardworking and drawing the best work from a team Comingto terms with this reality isnt easy especially for the largely malecontingent of senior managers and pundits whose personal machismo is on theline            Ever see a contemplativePower Ranger Little boys face a problem very similar to that of hightechexecutives Theyre steeped in a culture that honors power and conflict yetplainly dont yet have the physiques to match the myth So they compensatewith vocabulary animating their play with exaggerated violence and tough talksmashing kicking and zapping the imaginary bad guys The good news is thatthey are prime candidates for hightechnology managementthey only have to getolder not more mature
