                do you have any children   yeah i have two two boys twelve and sixteen   twelve and sixteen   umhum how about you   well i have three and uh theyre five and three and nineteen months   oh   so we kind of got a different ball game but uh   right   what uh do you feel like you have anytime  to spend with them     well   theyre probably at an age where they dont wanna spend anytime with their parents parents   thats true  you actually of course spend less time with them when they get older but its of course still really important um       right     i have a kind of a fortunate situation i think right now with my sixteen year old um  i work two nights a week at a im a librarian and i work two nights a week at the senior high school library they keep it open you know for kids to   oh uhhuh     do their work and he um  and then they the school district hires an aide you know to work for me well my son is my aide   right sure oh well thats nice   so two nights a week for four hours were stuck together  and theres usually not very much business i mean some nights its just real real quiet so   youre stuck together no i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part   yeah so we i have sort of a captive audience so i really do spend probably more time with him than than most you know but um of course im away from my other son those hours too but his dads at home   right and so that kind of gives him uh time with his dad then gives him a little bit of that individual time   pretty much that time yeah thats true yeah but but it is hard once they get that age i mean their friends are the most important thing there is   right and they want to be able to spend uh   thats right   well ive even noticed that with my five year old she started kindergarten this year and   umhum   everyday that shes not at school uh she thinks we need to have someone over and play   umhum   and that kind of  yeah its hard i think uh i find myself getting my little projects going and   yeah its kind of hard   not taking the time that i should im more worried about oh i didnt get this done i didnt get the kitchen needs to be cleaned this needs to be done and and i need to remind   yeah umhum umhum   remind remind myself to slow down and itll still be there tomorrow but thats kind of hard to do you know you dont see yourself getting   right yeah thats true yes it is hard to do right yeah well if youre kind of a person that likes things you know organized or neat or you know   umhum right   then i think it that it is hard its um i think one of the nice things about holidays is that you know it does give you the opportunity to spend more time   slow down a little bit umhum   yeah with family we have we often go to Illinois   uhhuh   for Christmas and were not this year and its just really nice because we can do you know the things you want to do and   you can do a lot more than   yeah just yeah thats right   than when you travel this is the first year were staying home too and uh  i think its going to be real quiet but uh thats an opportunity to get out the games and   yeah right we usually do that my my kids even have already gotten out um  my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasnt touched since last summer   right of course of course   but you know but every now and then i mean hes got a lot of those technical those hard kind you know and he wants to be an engineer so he still likes all that kind of building stuff and um we have the train and we havent had that Lego train together for years   oh yeah   and um so he sat down and i told him i really wanted him to build the train and we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together i wouldnt take it apart   cant wouldnt take it apart  after that   yeah and every year id have the Lego train under the tree   thatd be kind of fun   and um so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on Friday and um then his sixteen year old brother started helping too you know so you know it was just kind of things like during the normal       rat race  those kinds of things never happen but um   right right no no in fact in i think if a people would learn to turn off the TVs and  i think thats a lot of the breakdown of the communication   umhum yeah yes yeah   any communication that would take place in a family uh usually people are ending up sitting in front of that   which is umhum and theres always a few people in the family that when they stare at it  you know theyre totally turned off to everything else  the rest of     yes  you cant communicate while youre doing that right   no thats right   whereas uh im the type of person i could not sit sit still well i shouldnt say i could not but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something   yeah yeah me too  yeah i dont watch very much of it at all even to to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that people are     because they talk so much isnt that the   yeah they talk about TV shows and im huh you know dont you watch that you know  its the best show on i go no   but   youre kind of like what what are you talking about and uh you feel like youre a little bit out of it dont you they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us whats the
