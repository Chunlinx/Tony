                                 Veil of Tears            Last week I was in Istanbulvisiting friends and monuments and taking note of what everybody was wearingTurkey is  percent Muslim but it has put an end to theocratic rule Itsgovernment and public education system are secular and both emphasize equalityof the sexes Turkish women got the vote in   years ahead of women inFrance I was curious to see how traditional Muslim customs interact withmodern fashion in a city where East has been meeting West for so manymillennia Id already had some exposure to the mixture in Cairo but Egypt isa North African country  percent Muslim very far in spirit from TurkeyIstanbul for example is much closer to Odessa than it is to Baghdad            Islam isnotorious for veiling its women but such veiling was once universal Oldengravings show draped enveloping clothes for Muslim women that are not verydifferent from ancient Greek and Roman womens clothes or early medievalclothes and that are in fact similar to early forms of peasant womensclothing all over eastern Europe            Islamic women were then simply following standardancientworld custom which required that the head be veiled when the woman wasoutdoors and that the body never be exposed except in private All around theMediterranean modesty was considered the primary female virtue its publicexpression necessary for an ordered human society Female physical beauty wasviewed as an incendiary and corrupting influence that could lead tolawlessness social disorder and anarchy Only after European fashion hit itsstride in the  th century with women flaunting sculptured curlsrouged cheeks and exposed chests in public did the veiled Arab lady begin tolook so alien so alluring and eventually so infuriating to Westernsensibilities            In the erafollowing the Renaissance Western womens beauty was made to function both asa creative force and as a commodity in a Europe expanding through commerce andconquest Nude girls representing Truth and Virtue began to appear on publicmonuments Titian painted great ladies young and old saints goddesses andsuccessful prostitutes all equally delicious to look at The virtuous butlively daughters of Protestant capitalists were encouraged to show some ankleand make advantageous marriages Fashionprints were published and studiedWellplaced married ladies in low cut dresses ran salons manipulating socialforces and influencing literature and politics Female beauty helped tomodernize the world            Islam would have none of this Female influencewas potent and important but it functioned covertly Female beauty was valuedbut it was nobodys business Even today traditional Muslim women wear a longstraight dress with high neck and long sleeves and a folded head cloth thatwholly hides the forehead and hair the ears neck and bust            The lookof such traditional Islamic dress commands instant respect from a modernbeholder It has the authority of unselfconscious ancient custom and thecostume forms a fine visual contrast to the vagaries of fashion in moderncities The style is harmonious dignified and not impractical I saw gearmuch like it on Hindu women in Nepal who would wrap and tuck some of the veilaround the midsection carrying groceries the baby and other sundries in itsoverlapping folds The spirit of the outfit however is utterly alien toWestern assumptions            To presentday eyes expressions of extreme female modestyseem subversive a stumbling block to the sane ordering of human affairsKeeping women in the dark wrapping them up in public like so many identicalpackages is felt to corrode the social fabric not strengthen it to stuntnot nourish a countrys modern political life It feels that way in Istanbultoo Many women there display the range of hairstyles and cosmetics andphysical exposure found in any big city But many more women wear a new versionof pointedly Islamic costume Below the neck they wear modern clothes andshoes But on their heads they wear a modern silk scarf a Gucci lookalike ora Herms knockoff folded close around the face to hide a third of it alongwith the ears the whole neck and every scrap of hair This quasimodernIslamic veil makes a selfconscious religious point in a secular society            The effectis very disturbing This head scarf recently caused a furor in Turkish schoolsand universities when an old law prohibiting its use was suddenly enforced Asimilar prohibition was attempted a few years ago in Paris France hasuniversal religious tolerance as Turkey does and as part of their religionyoung Muslim Parisiennes were demanding the right to wear this samehybrid scarf in school Americans familiar with the Jewish yarmulke or eventhe Sufi turban have a hard time understanding why these two states would findthis harmless religious practice improper But they do            Looking at thousands of examples of it inIstanbul I came to see the problem Women wearing short skirts and smart shoeswho fold a modish scarf on their heads in the ancient veillike manner aretrying to have it both ways Unlike the yarmulke which is strictly symbolicthe folded scarf is functional Like the original veil it serves to create theconditions of female modesty            No wondermany hate it in France especially for schoolgirls who are meant to mix withothers on an equal footing in all respects and in determinedly modernizedTurkey too The girls who wish to wear the scarf in Turkey say it representsMuslim female empowerment and they consider themselves oppressed if itsforbidden They may claim this but their very appearance in these scarvescancels that interpretation Those who object to them seem closer to the markin fearing that the scarves signal a rising fundamentalist opposition to thesecular principles on which modern Turkey was founded The girls who believethe scarves mean freedom may in fact be blinded by them They may not realizetheir complicity in a movement that seems likely ultimately to take suchfreedom away            Every time I saw an Istanbul girl with a silk scarfpinching her head and reducing her face I would think heavens take it offlet me show you how to wear it becomingly with your nice suitand then I wouldremember that above the shoulders unattractiveness is the whole point It wasstartling to me how unnoticeable the attractions below the neck became withouta personality to avow them A tightly wrapped head with encapsulated eyesnose and mouth doubtless suited the publicly shrouded female of antiquitywhose intelligence flowered wholly unseen It seems suitable in Saudi Arabiafor example where women cant vote since it squashes public expression alongwith hair But in modern Istanbul the scarf completely depersonalizes theshapely legs and curving torso displayed in contemporary clothes below it Thewoman looks brainless an antique statue of Venus with no head            It is really too bad thatsuch inhibiting headgear a complex Islamic tradition has lately acquired thestatus of a strict religious law which it never was The modest Muslim veil isin fact betraying its ancient and honorable reluctance to take on theaggressive flavor of fanaticism Orthodox Judaism likewise devoted to thesuppression of womens hair has long since solved the problem another waywith fashionable wigs Islam has refrained from such an expedient Meanwhilethe ancient chaste Islamic veil and dress persist in countries where they havenever been challenged and they cohabit more or less with modern fashion ifthe two dont try to blend            In any case I was interestedto notice that no Hermslike silk scarves casually grazed secular femaleclavicles in Istanbul The sexy girls with terrific hair would dashingly toss acouple of yards of plain wool around their necks no sign of bright printedsilk Shiny stacks of beautiful scarves are sold in the Grand Bazaar forMuslim girls to wrench into veils and for tourists to flaunt in New York
