                                 Web Weather Today             A few nights ago I turnedon Channel  to watch the  pm weather forecast Or rather I turned onChannel  to watch meteorologist Bob Ryan It was a deeply satisfying sixminutes Bobs brow was furrowed his jaw was tense A cold front he warnedhad gathered strength in the Canadian Rockies and cut a swath across theMidwest It was now bearing down on Washington DCthreatening to wallop the Washington area with  to  inches of snowThen his mouth relaxed slightly He said that a highpressure system wasbuilding in the Southeast and would shoot a blast of warm air up theAtlantic coast Would it reach us in time to fend off the snow Bob washopeful            Americanweather forecasters like to say that the United States has the most excitingweather in the world Its biblicalfrom hurricanes to blizzards droughts tofloods and the occasional plague of locusts for good measure I dont know ifthe United States does have the most exciting weather but it certainly has themost exciting weather forecasts They too are biblical The ancient Greeksascribed lightning to Zeus we havent made much progress The weather forecastis still an epic a story of Gods war with man Hot and cold air massesclash storms strike and sweeping fronts ravage the nation The forecastis a tale of heroes the noble highpressure system savage villainsHurricane Andrew and omnipotent inexplicable deities El Nio the JetStream Im sure Im not the only one who feels a frisson when aforecaster announces that a cold front is descending from Canadaas if somemalevolent Arctic god were coming to exact revenge for the sins ofWashington            Weather in short is a crackling good story infused withenough drama to sustain local news broadcasts millions of watercoolerconversations and an entire cable channel So imagine my excitement when Istumbled upon the Web weather industry Here was a world ofweatherhoursaday weather personalized weather global weather fishingweather flying weather farming weather email weather graphics weathertext weather Its breadth boggles the mind CNN forecasts dayand night on its snazzy weather site So do USA TodayMSNBC and The Weather Channel which has claimed the best weather addresson the Web Other Web forecasters include weatherOnline INTELLICAST WeatherNet TVWeather AccuWeather Geocities Canadas The Weather Network BBC Weather and theNational WeatherServiceto name only the mainstream sites            There is of course something obviously ironicabout all this Web weather The Web doesnt have any weather unless you countthe hot air that envelops most newsgroups In fact you could argue that theentire point of cyberspace is to have no weather to liberate us fromthe mundane and inconvenient physical world But the Web will haveweather weather or not            IndeedWeb weather technology is as sophisticated as it gets The sites maketelevisions Weather Channel look amateurish or rather even more amateurishthan it already looks All the sites are constantly updated You never have towait for a forecast The sites are both easy to navigate and comprehensive Onmost a few mouse clicks will retrieve the fiveday forecast for any ZIP codeany city any state any nationcomplete with smiling sunfrowning raindropanimations You like satellite photos The Web lets you download currentsatellite images of any corner of the earth On several sites you can stringtogether the last few hours of satellite photos into a cloud movie Are youbig on ground radar Most sites offer pictures from more than  DopplersMany will let you monitor earthquake activity ozone levels humidity andflood threats            All the sites rely on essentially the same package of NWSdata satellite photos and Doppler images so they do have a certainlaundrydetergent quality same powder different box This monotony isreminiscent of sports Web sites which also draw from a single well of dataSo sites strive desperately to build brand identity Some make fourdayforecasts instead of fiveday forecasts Some dispense with jaunty graphicsdelivering temperatures in sober gray text Some nichemarket to pilotssailors or farmers CNN and the Weather Channel supply a weather newswireLight snow dusts the Dakotas West is dry An illustrated weatherencyclopedia accompanies USA Today s site

say displays all the mediums virtues EfficiencyConvenience Personalized service A rich supplyno a surfeit ofuseful information How extremely useful it is            Too useful actually Even the best Web weathersites USA Today  INTELLICAST The Weather Channelmanage to do what Ithought was impossible They make weather boring Following weather on the Webis like following baseball by reading scorecards The weather forecast is morethan rain You must also hear the story of the rain Where is it coming fromWhose fault is it Canadas The Great Lakes The Bermuda Highs What kind ofrain is it When it will arrive Will the Jet Stream protect us from it Is itmuchneeded or unwelcome You do need a weatherman to know which waythe wind blows            But theWeb dispenses with all that The cyberforecast is purely mechanical and purelyboring Even the Webs supposed innovationindividualized forecastsisdepressing We no longer make common cause against the weather god Now I havemy

the disaster sites that best capture the spiritof the weather Web Dozens and dozens of sites such as Eye on theWorld celebrate tsunamis typhoons hurricanes droughts andofcoursetornadoes Most are illustrated with brutal photos of beachedships downed trees and shattered houses These sites are I think themeteorological equivalent of snuff films They prove that even when all youcare about is
