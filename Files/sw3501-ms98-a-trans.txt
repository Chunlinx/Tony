                  um we have two pets at the moment we have a cat and we also have a bird thats a strange combination  i visit the cat is an an outdoor cat and   oh     um weve had him for four years its really a good cat when we first talked about getting one my husband isnt really fond of cats and   umhum   and we went ahead and got this one for my little girl from her greatgrandma and its turned out to be a very good pet she or he is   oh   um you know he stays outside he doesnt try and come in the house and trip you up and he just hes almost like a dog our cars will come down the road and and the cat will come running out from   oh   the fields we live in quite a rural little community and and he comes running he can hear our car  so he is more more you know like a dog its really a good animal   oh does your cat try to run away at all   no we havent had a bit of problem with that the only um incident we had about like that was when he was just a kitten um on Halloween we lost track of him and i dont know whether he followed some trickortreaters or you know they scared him or what but   umhum oh     he uh was gone and we thought for sure he was gone and he was gone three weeks and then he yes and then he came back and he had a crooked paw so apparently he had   three weeks oh   yeah apparently he had broken his foot somehow but he did come back so   well thats great   yes yes and how about you   we have a dog   oh   we have a three year old dog its about medium size and shes uh an indoor dog   oh uhhuh oh fun   and she is yeah shes like our baby   oh now is it is thats thats not still considered a puppy   not technically we consider her a puppy i she still acts like a puppy but     do you oh real active and   yeah oh very   oh whats oh whats her name   too active Sam Samantha   oh oh thats thats a nice name we um our cat is named we named it Duchess and then we found out it was a boy  but it was too late to change so  and now is is that the only pet you have   oh oh thats neat yes   oh the what kind of a dog is it   shes a mix between a German Shepherd and a Husky   oh pretty   yeah she is really pretty and shes a good watchdog we live in a one bedroom apartment and she will growl and bark at strangers walking by or she hears any footsteps   ah uhhuh oh oh thats good   yes it is good its nice to have   boy and your apartment apparently allow they allow pets   yes we it was hard to find um apartments out here we live in uh Penn State University and its hard to find apartments that take pets so were way on the outskirts of town   umhum oh oh   because and we have a ground floor apartment with like a private yard that we can just open up the door and we play Frisbee and ball and   uhhuh how nice   so that she gets some exercise we go for walks   oh boy that sounds ideal because yeah they do need especially  dogs they need to run and jump and oh well thats great i   umhum thats true   we had a um our little bird weve only had it for about six months and we got that for my son for his birthday and its named Buttercup a little yellow yellow parakeet  yeah they chose that and i one other pet we had had an experience with over the summer its a kind of a funny thing we   oh thats a good bird name   my neighbor had given her children each a a a a bunny rabbit for Easter   oh wow   yes and and then her kids had them for a couple of months and they you know kind of tired of them like kids do and and she said do you want these and so we said yes well take them and and take care of them for a while and she said now you know when you dont want them i know a man that just loves them and hell take them anytime you want and   oh   we were a little bit reluctant with the cat and the bird already to take on some more  but so we took these three rabbits from them   hm   and about two weeks later um my son went out to feed them and and he said mom i i think the white bunnys sick   oh no   and so yeah we went out immediately and lifted up the hutch lid and that mama rabbit the white one had had eleven babies  uh yeah eleven oh so that was quite a surprise and   how many oh my goodness     so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two weeks  but that i guess that was her first time being a mother and i im not real   oh my gosh   knowledgeable about bunnies but they all died and i they all did and she well she didnt take care of them and ive heard sometimes that with their first their first   oh they all did   you know litter that they do that but  yeah it was it was really a really hard experience   oh thats sad
