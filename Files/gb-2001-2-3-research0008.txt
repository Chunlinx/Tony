                    Background                Drosophila melanogaster is an        important model organism After more than  years of        study the anatomy of the brain is well described and many        brain functions have been mapped to particular        substructures          The adult brain is        composed of approximately  neurons which are        organized into discrete substructures The optic lobe        composed of the lamina medulla lobula and lobula plate        is primarily involved in the processing of visual        information from the photoreceptors and sending that        information to the central brain     The antennal        lobes are chiefly responsible for the processing of        olfactory information   The mushroom bodies are        involved in olfactory learning and memory and other complex        behaviors       A group of approximately        six neurons in the lateral protocerebrum are sufficient to        drive circadian rhythms in locomoter activity           The central complex although poorly understood appears to        be involved in motor coordination            Despite our increasing knowledge of         Drosophila brain anatomy and        function relatively little information is available        concerning the molecules expressed in the brain that        coordinate function and manifest behavior Classic methods        of identifying genes involved in neural function include        behavioral screening of mutagenized flies then rescreening        candidate lines for pleiotropic effects due to        developmental defects This process is both laborious and        time consuming To augment this genetic approach        sequencing of random cDNAs is proving effective in        identifying genes expressed in a specific cell type          Much information has been collected through the analysis of        expressed sequence tags ESTs      Using        this approach sequence information is gathered from one or        both ends of a cDNA and cataloged to determine the        complexity of an mRNA population Here we use a modified        EST approach and completely sequence novel cDNAs Others        have used a similar approach by shotgun sequencing        concatenated cDNA inserts    One goal of our work        was to begin to develop a catalog of transcripts expressed        in the brain These transcripts because of the location of        their expression are expected to contain a higher        proportion of clones that are involved in neuronal        function        Many         Drosophila head libraries have been        used to isolate cDNAs that correspond to genes identified        by genetic screens for their involvement in brain function        Several transcripts identified in this manner are expressed        at a relatively low level          dunce           CREB           dco           period           timeless           dissonance   The         Drosophila brain makes up only a        small part of head tissue approximately  dry weight        By eliminating nonbrain tissues we increase the relative        representation of rare neural transcripts in this unique        library        We began a catalog of the genes expressed in the brain        of adult         Drosophila in support of more        conventional methods of understanding brain function        Cataloging sequence information and publishing the data        through electronic databases has enriched molecular science        in general In a matter of a few minutes one can use        information from a single sequencing reaction to identify a        gene that was sequenced by another laboratory and one        maybe able to deduce the function of the isolated clone        This set of tools facilitates molecular work in virtually        every branch of biological sciences This report details        construction quality analysis and initial characterization        of a unique library created from adult         Drosophila brains Surprisingly we        discovered that   clones of the         Drosophila brain cDNA clones that        were randomly chosen for analysis are not matched with any        EST sequence generated in support of the         Drosophila genome project as of         October  Further the genes encoding  of these        novel ESTs are not predicted by algorithms used for fly        genome annotation From our analysis of ESTs that do not        correspond to one of the  annotated genes we predict        that the number of genes in the         Drosophila genome may be        underestimated by  approximately  to         genes                    Results and discussion                  Library quality assessment          Desiccated brain tissue from adult           Drosophila melanogaster was used to          construct a library using the Stratagene HybridZap          system This library was designed for protein expression          and therefore was constructed such that fulllength          cDNAs containing  untranslated regions are not likely          to be present The number of clones in the library and          the size of the clones were used to assess the quality of          the library The number of clones in the primary library          was determined by titering one of the five packaging          reactions The total number of clones in the primary          library is    that is all five packaging          reactions From the analysis of the fully sequenced          clones  novel and matched isolog clones reported in          this study the majority of the inserts  were          between  and  base pairs  base pairs   base          pairs average deviation Characterized clones from the          library range between  to  base pairs bp          including only  As of the polyA tail The insert size          for this library is as expected using the Stratagene          HybridZap kit given that the sizeselection column          retains DNA molecules larger than  bp Stratagene          technical support personal communication Of the           clones that were either completely or endtagged          sequenced approximately   clones did not contain          an insert Figure                           Clone selection          To try to maximize the discovery of novel transcripts          we investigated whether there was a correlation between          transcript abundance and the presence of the sequence in          a public database Specifically a reverse northern blot          experiment using radiolabeled head cDNA was performed to          determine whether hybridization level could be used to          identify frequently occurring transcripts We reasoned          that the abundance of these transcripts may increase          their representation in data banks when compared to less          abundant transcripts The data from this experiment are          shown in Table           The level of hybridization to the probe varied          considerably within a category In particular novel          transcripts did not uniformly have low levels of          hybridization which suggested that hybridization level          would not greatly aid in identifying novel clones          Therefore subsequent clones for this study were randomly          chosen for sequence analysis It is possible that          abundant transcripts may not be as well represented in          the database as a result of directed cloning of rarer          molecules or that cDNA abundance in this library may not          accurately reflect relative transcript abundance in the          fly brain                          Sequence data          We obtained sequence data for  independently          isolated cDNAs representing transcripts expressed in the           Drosophila brain Figure  Table           Of these  clones originally classified as either          novel  clones or matched isologs  clones were          completely sequenced Only endtag sequence data was          collected for clones classified as matched isolog          ribosomal protein sequences  clones known           Drosophila sequences  clones          and known           Drosophila ribosomal protein          sequences  clones All insert sequences or ESTs can          be obtained by searching GenBank with the appropriate          accession numbers listed in Table  Data for           mitochondrial S clones are not reported here because          mitochondrial expression is not the focus of this          study          We generated sequence data for            Drosophila genes that had been          previously sequenced from other organisms Isologs that          were identified in the brain library but which had not          been identified or sequenced in           Drosophila melanogaster are listed          in Table with the exception of ribosomal protein          genes An isolog is defined as a sequence that has a          high degree of similarity to genes identified in other          organisms but the functional relationship between these          genes has not been demonstrated   As expected we          recovered many previously identified           Drosophila genes Table  We did          not continue with full insert sequencing of these           Drosophila sequences but the EST          data for these clones was submitted to GenBank          Approximately  of the sequence data generated in          this study were originally novel according to sequence          analysis searches conducted at the beginning of this          project Since then much EST data has been added to          GenBank and the           Drosophila genome sequence has been          released Thus in October  the  previously novel          brain cDNA were again compared with fly sequence data          The percentage of transcripts that do not have          corresponding ESTs is reduced to  Table  of           clones  have no EST matches and are not predicted          genes following genome annotation and  have no EST          matches but are matched with a predicted gene Although          each of these  clones lacks an EST match each clone is          identified within the           Drosophila genome sequence recently          reported by Adams           et al   It is possible that          some of these clones represent the  ends of ESTs for          which only  sequence data is available Considering          that data for approximately  ESTs  ESTs from          adult heads alone are reported   and that our          analysis examined only  randomly chosen brain library          clones  is a surprisingly large number This          indicates that this library is a valuable resource for          generating sequence data that will facilitate genome          annotation specifically identifying regions transcribed          in the adult fly brain          From our analysis it is clear that EST data are          essential for accurate and thorough genome annotation In          particular using current genome annotation algorithms           of the  brain clones do not correspond to predicted          genes Table  Of these  clones however  have EST          matches with the Berkeley           Drosophila Genome Project BDGP          data Tables   Comparisons of the remaining  cDNA          sequences with the           Drosophila genome sequence show          evidence of RNA processing exonintron borders and          consensus splicing sequences for two clones and          presence of a polyA addition sequence AAUAAA  to           bp upstream of an extensive polyA region at the  end          of the insert sequence for seven clones Table b Ten          of the  clones were detected in reverse northern          experiments using either brain or body radiolabeled cDNA          Table  The distribution of detection by brain cDNA          body cDNA both or neither not detectable above          background for the  clones in this category is similar          to the distributions observed in the other categories          Tables a  and strikingly similar to the detection          frequency observed for the matched with an EST and a          predicted gene category Although these data suggest          that these sequences are transcribed additional          experiments are necessary to confirm whether this is true          for each clone None of the clones in this category is          predicted to encode a protein larger than  amino          acids It is possible that these sequences may correspond          to genomic DNA Alternatively these novel RNA molecules          may perform some unknown cellular function that requires          a conserved structure rather than a conserved          sequence          The           Drosophila genome is predicted to          contain  genes   Ifour observations are          representative and can be extended to the number of genes          in the fly genome then our analysis suggests that the          total number of genes may be underestimated by          approximately   of the  randomly chosen cDNAs do          not correspond to a predicted gene Thus approximately           genes may await discovery                          Transcript distribution analysis          A second hybridization study was conducted to          determine whether clones originally identified as novel          were detectable in the brain andor body of adult           Drosophila This data may offer          clues as to which transcripts are involved in basic          neuronal function as opposed to a function that may be          specific to the brain The           Drosophila central nervous system          CNS includes thoracic and abdominal ganglia and          therefore neural transcripts are often expressed          throughout the body Thus it was possible that few          transcripts would be brainspecific          To determine how the originally novel clones were          distributed in the animal plasmid templates from           novel clones were spotted on filters and hybridized with          radiolabeled cDNA from either brains or bodies minus          heads The results of this study are listed in Table           In this experiment cDNA probe is limiting and therefore          many transcripts that are in low abundance may not be          detectable In fact  of the clones were not detected          in either brain or body These clones may correspond to          less abundant transcripts Ideally hybridization probe          would be in excess in these experiments to determine          which clones are brain specific but           Drosophila brain cDNA is limiting          Approximately  of the clones were detectable only in          the brain and are candidates for genes involved in brain          function Clones that were detected in both tissues made          up about one third of the novel transcripts  About           of the clones were detected only in the body As the          library is made from brain tissue we did not expect to          recover many transcripts that would only be detectable in          the body as compared to the brain          We used published localization data from previously          identified transcripts to evaluate the data we collected          for the novel clones Table  Approximately   of           of the known           Drosophila genes listed are          neuralspecific and approximately  of novel          transcripts were detected only in the brain          Approximately  of the novel transcripts were          detectable in both brain and body tissues Known           Drosophila genes that were          localized in body and brain tissues accounted for            of  of genes for which localization data was available          Table  Clones detected in both tissues may indicate          that the gene product is needed in all cells Genes from          the nervous system would be expected to be expressed in          both tissues so transcripts detected in both cannot be          ruled out of this category but these transcripts are not          brain specific Approximately  of the novel clones were          detectable only in the body as compared to   of           of the known           Drosophila clones detected only in          body tissues These transcripts are apparently expressed          at a higher level in the body and at relatively low          levels in the brain It should be noted that localization          data were not specified for  of the   known          transcripts listed in Table  This analysis suggests          that this brain cDNA library is a rich source for          generating cDNA sequence information and for identifying          novel brainspecific cDNAs                            Conclusions        The initial analysis of an adult         Drosophila brain library is presented        here Somewhat surprisingly we observe no clear connection        between the abundance of a transcript and its appearance in        a sequence data bank However molecular screens that are        directed towards isolating rare transcripts may skew the        transcriptrelated data in sequence banks towards less        abundant molecules As shown in Figure and Table  we        have identified and sequenced  novel clones that do not        match with other known expressed sequences but do match        with fly genomic sequence information  clones that are        matched with EST data  clones that were previously        reported         Drosophila sequences  clones that        contain ribosomal protein sequences  clones that are        matched with genes previously reported for other organisms        isologs Table  and  clones corresponding to        mitochondrial sequences        Why did we recover such a high percentage of novel        sequences Libraries made from brain tissue are proposed to        have a higher complexity of transcripts than libraries made        from other tissues   Therefore EST screens of brain        libraries should yield larger numbers of independent        transcripts as a result of the increased transcript        complexity within brain tissues Another possible        explanation for the surprisingly large number of novel        cDNAs identified in our analysis is that our library is not        normalized It has been proposed that hybrids form between        polydA and polydT sequences during the        hybridizationsubtraction reaction and that these sequences        are subsequently lost          An ultimate goal of this project is to create a database        of all the transcripts expressed in the         Drosophila brain and to correlate        this information with their patterns of expression in the        brain This type of a database would be a valuable resource        and could be used in comparative studies with other        organisms Comparisons of transcripts from organisms with        relatively simple brains          Drosophila  to organisms with more        complex neural function humans may offer insights into        basic brain function and aid in the identification of        transcripts involved in higherorder brain functions The         clones that appear enriched in the brain may identify        proteins or RNAs that are involved in a brainspecific        function Transcripts identified in this library can be        directly tested for proteinprotein interaction using the        yeast twohybrid capability of the library making it a        good resource for many areas of study        Our analysis of this unique brain library demonstrates        that many transcribed regions of the         Drosophila genome remain        undiscovered and that approximately  more genes may        be identified Genome annotation efforts emphasize        identifying proteincoding regions   Thus it is        possible that some of the ESTs lacking a corresponding        predicted gene were missed during genome annotation because        an open reading frame or one of sufficient size was not        predicted        Complete genomic sequences are excellent resources and        extensive annotation of a genome makes the sequence        information even more powerful Current software is not        sufficient to identify all transcribed regions within the        genome As of the year  EST data for  clones        from adult         Drosophila head libraries is reported        and estimated to represent over  of all         Drosophila genes   Our results        confirm that not all transcribed regions of the genome are        identified and that EST analyses are essential for accurate        and complete genome annotation                    Materials and methods                  Tissue preparation          To produce the animals for the brain dissections          adult           Drosophila were entrained using           h light and  h darkness in temperaturecontrolled          incubators at C Entrained adult           D melanogaster Canton S flies          were collected  h after the lights were turned off          frozen on dry ice shaken to detach heads from bodies          and separated through a screen to isolate the heads          Frozen heads were incubated in prechilled C           acetone EM Science at C overnight to replace the          water in the tissue with acetone   Prechilling the          acetone prevents the heads from thawing when added to the          acetone Heads were dried at room temperature and brains          were removed using fine dissecting tweezers                          RNA preparation

constructed using a Stratagene          HybriZAP Library kit Firststrand cDNA synthesis was          primed from the  end of the polyA RNA using a polyT          primer that also contained an           Xho I restriction site and a GAGA          sequence          GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGTTTTTTITTTTTTTTTTT          methyl dCTP was used during firststrand cDNA synthesis          to protect internal           Xho I sites Secondstrand          synthesis was primed by the partially digested RNA that          resulted from RNase H treatment of the firststrand          synthesis reaction           Pfu DNA polymerase was used to          blunt the cDNA and EcoRI adapters were ligated to the          blunt ends The cDNA was digested with           Eco RI and           Xho I size separated retaining          molecules approximately  bp or larger ligated into          HybriZAP vector arms and packaged into phage heads for          amplification                          Determining the number of primary clones          The cDNA library was titered to determine how many          independent clones were recovered At the  dilution          there were  plaques per plate giving a total

  experiments                          Categorizing clones          Clones classified as novel had no obvious match to          nucleic acidprotein sequence information in GenBank a          score less than  Novel clones may contain blocks of          less than  bases that are matched with other          sequences but these small regions have no known          functional correlation and the similarity between the two          sequences was very low It is possible that some of our          novel clones could be part of an EST from the BDGP that          has not been fully sequenced Sequences categorized as          matched to EST data have a high degree of similarity a          score over  to reported sequence information but the          previously collected sequence data was not associated          with a known function Sequences categorized as known           Drosophila were a perfect match          with perhaps the exception of a few bases fewer than           with sequence information from           Drosophila Matched isologs are          sequences that have a high degree of similarity score of          over  at the protein level to a gene found in another          organism but a functional homology between these genes          has not been determined Ribosomal protein sequences were          categorized as known or isologs using the above          criteria Ribosomal protein and mitochondrial sequence          clones were categorized separately because these types of          transcripts frequently occurred in our library
