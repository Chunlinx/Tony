        do you feel about the issue of uh random or spot drug testing     well im im for it based upon my experience uh in taking uh drug tests my uh my past experience in the military   umhum   plus uh my current occupation working uh for a defense contractor here in Massachusetts uh i feel that its uh there is some opinions whereas the uh uh people of the mind that uh its a right to privacy that you know its a its a bodily function involved and that um um people should have a right to protect themselves and so forth but i dont agree i think that um its important particularly for some jobs and some jog occupations job occupations that um people can be screened for uh should be screens for uh for drugs through uh drug testing   yeah i i tend to believe that that its its important for those jobs where uh where the the person has the safety of other people uh in their own hands or within their control then i think it should be mandatory   umhum   you know the the airline industry the transportation industry um you know the uh   right   the defense and military you know any any application like that i think it should be mandatory   yeah so i think were in agreement that that uh uh that its a good uh its a good idea in some circumstances the one reservation i have though in that from my experience ive taken many urinalysis many drug tests   right umhum   some of them random some of them um scheduled uh and every time you take one of those tests you know when youre submitting a sample   yeah   theres always in the back of your mind well how are you know people conducting the test the labs that are performing the test how adequate uh are those facilities and uh is is always it is it always a chance i know that what they call um the i think its called the chain of custody   right   of the uh the specimens themselves i know in the military in the military particularly they theres a they go to great lengths at protecting the samples before they get to the labs   umhum right   but my concern is and i think that that that what needs to be further investigated is the uh the standardization and to have some hundred percent insurance that the test thats given uh the the the lab that performs the uh the analysis is uh validated in some way you know some standardization because ive heard some horror stories   right   you know   yeah you you you know you can easily envision the one one mistake could you know ruin a a career that couldnt be uh you know couldnt be resurrected     Sixty Minutes did an article on this whole subject subject a few uh a few years ago and there was a Air Force Captain who uh you know took the test and it came up positive  and the guy swore on a stack of bibles   yeah   now in the military for a for a staff staff NCO which is a a noncommissioned officer but its a certain rank above i dont know if youre familiar with military military rank structure   no   its a its a high level of enlisted personnel and officers for those people who show up positive on one drug test theyre immediately discharged   yeah   now for certain ranks and below like sergeant and below if youre found positive or come up dirty in a drug on a on a drug test   yeah   you can be reduced in rank forfeit your pay or if its a repeat repeat offense uh offense   yeah   then they can discharge you but theres this Army this this Air Force Captain he swore up and down that he didnt do anything   right     and they went back and you know few months later to try to investigate the lab and the sample that he had given was destroyed   yeah right   so i i think you got to be careful with stuff like that thats thats my only concern about the whole issue i think   huh yeah definitely yeah i dont really feel like you know for any any of the just routine jobs that people should be subject to that kind of invasion of privacy   yeah   um only for the only for the ones where its critical   umhum uh yeah because theres a big thing in in the in the here on the east coast the Boston Police Department uh the Policemens Association took the uh the Boston Police Department to court because they were uh trying to institute drug tests for the cops here in Boston   right right   and um they won the Police Department the the Police Association won   and it it was a right to privacy type deal that they approached it and the courts agreed   yeah i i guess i would feel that the you know police   uh that the police should be one of those public uh safety issues where you know mandatory drug testing where it would be favorable   yeah oh yeah definitely well you know the thing is is in all these transportation accidents this   uh
