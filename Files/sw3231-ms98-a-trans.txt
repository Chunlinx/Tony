        do you or your husband work for TI or     im a contract person at TI in fact involved with uh data switchboard   oh are you oh i see well thats neat uhhuh   and uh do you work for TI uhhuh   so ive worked for them for several years like twelve now i guess   oh you sound very young like just out of college   well i try to i try to think of myself as young but uh well have you seen any movies recently   uh im trying to think we saw uh Dances With Wolves and uh have you seen that one   oh did you no i havent i have i have a hard time with movies that are real long i dont know   that was excellent well surprisingly enough i do too i get tired of sitting there and so does my husband but we both just thoroughly you know enjoyed it just really liked it   yeah yeah well ive heard a lot of good things about it   and uh im trying to think we went to see a uh a real funny one i cant think now what the name of it was ive gone blank   was it uh we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones we saw the Naked Gun Two and a Half   oh we have not seen that we want to see that one   yeah that was that was pretty funny and then we saw what was the spoof on Top Gun its   oh i havent seen that one   oh i cant think of what it was called  we saw that too that i was pretty disappointed in that one  yeah but uh so you know through the summer we have small children so we dont get to see too many but weve seen i guess two or three movies this past summer   were you my husband doesnt enjoy the shows as much going to them he likes to rent them and so we watch a lot of them you know at home as they come out and uh yes yes   uhhuh right have you seen Ghost yet i really i enjoyed that movie   did you now i i was real disappointed im a real big Patrick Swayze fan and uh i was really disappointed in it it was one i dont think it was as funny as what i was anticipating anticipating and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny   really uhhuh oh yeah now yeah   and uh and it wasnt you know at all it was it was more of a love story and uh so i was really disappointed in that because i like him real well we just got through watching one with uh   yeah umhum   uh is it Claude Van Damme   oh Van Damme yeah i think   yeah and uh enjoyed it i cant think of what the name of it was but it was a uh of course one of the typical you know kicking fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type move and and we enjoyed that and uh   right right   uhhuh   the uh uh the one with Jodie Foster did you see it yes wasnt that excellent   oh Silence of the Lambs yes i did yeah i really enjoyed that a lot   yeah that was one that that stayed with me you know for a month i just i kept thinking about it you know   uhhuh yeah well its amazing but really i mean when you stop and think about it uh Anthony Perkins didnt have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing   no oh it was excellent and and of course hes such a uh very good actor anyway and i think he made the movie   yeah yeah i do too i really do you know Jodie Foster was good too but i think i think Anthony Perkins was the one that that really made the movie i agree with you   you know is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins Hopkins uhhuh i know i know it uh well im not a real big Jodie Foster fan but i thought she was good in that   oh Hopkins im sorry Hopkins yeah i always get those guys mixed up well i i agree well i havent been im i saw her in The Accused and i thought that was a pretty good movie i thought she   no now i didnt see that one   that was that was a pretty uh interesting movie and uh but you know i i did i really liked the Silence of the Lambs that was really intriguing and it it didnt scare me all that much you know and i i dont like to go to movies to be scared thats not why i go   no no i like a good suspenseful story and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats in fact i want to uh rent it when it comes out for my husband to see because he didnt he wont go see that no i went with uh our daughter   so right and that one was oh he didnt see it oh uhhuh   and uh so you know saw it with her and uh enjoyed it my all time favorite is Weekend At Bernies did you see it   um oh really yeah ive seen it   oh ive seen it you know we saw it at the movies and then weve rented it several times and we just love it in fact we have a ten year old grandson that he and my husband and i we just sit there and cackle you know and just get hysterical   uhhuh uhhuh yeah ive seen that its pretty its pretty cute i guess you know as far as comedies go probably my favorite is Young Frankenstein i dont know i love that movie   uh yes yes my husband liked that   yeah so   uh hes a big Gene Wilder fan   yeah well Gene Wilder doesnt do that much for me but im a big uh Mel Brooks fan all his movies i really really enjoy   uhhuh uhhuh he has a new one out and uhhuh uh i have seen it advertised i dont know what the name of it is   he does oh is that the one with thats hes starring in oh yeah that came out like early in the summer or something i think yeah i havent seen that one either it   umhum umhum yes yes and my husband wants to see that one and uh did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the uh the sheriff   oh Blazing Saddles yeah uhhuh   Blazing Saddles oh thats my husbands all time favorite i think   oh uhhuh i like i like that one too but i thought Young Frankenstein was better yeah that that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie i just really enjoyed it   did you     and uh um im trying to think because we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie im trying to remember what it was because it you know its
