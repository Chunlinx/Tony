        okay um do you own a PC by the way im guessing you probably do      i dont have one in my home here my um parents have one and they live just about three miles away so we use that one and my inlaws also have one and theyre almost as close theyre in Richardson   oh i see right uhhuh uhhuh and what kinds of things do you use it for when when you use when you go to their houses houses to uh use them   um usually uh word processing something um such as oh forms for things uh also i have a nine year old that ive been home schooling for the last three years   yeah oh   and we got uh the one that my parents have is an Apple II E and i have a sisterinlaw who   uhhuh   is who works in the Fort Worth school district and so she got me copies of uh several of the Apple programs   umhum great yeah   for school programs and so we use those and theres some whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game so   oh sure   thats part of it um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things uh his resume uh his uh   yeah   letter hes been applying for jobs and things so that type of thing uh forms for his photography business and that kind of thing   uhhuh umhum yeah well i tell you once you get used to having them you you get spoiled really quickly um   yeah im uh my father had a software company and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that and were hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing here   huh uhhuh yeah   but um theyre kind of old older so im not sure that well be able to do get too many other programs for it   right yeah yeah um i know im a a writer by profession and uh when when i was first here in in Dallas or in Plano um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an IBM Selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because  i thought oh theyre so wonderful well then um   oh i have one of those yeah mines broken at the moment but   yeah  ours really needs to have some work done on it but but then my husband um worked at TI and i got a um this has been years ago he doesnt work there anymore but he got a um um the the TI Professional and brought that home and i learned WordStar on that and boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length on a typewriter   oh yeah i learned i i learned WordStar uh i did some typing for my father when he had the company and so i learned that on there too that was   uhhuh yeah have you ever used do you use WordPerfect ever have you ever used WordPerfect or   i havent thats the one that my father well i guess i have used it once or twice uh its the one thats on my fatherinlaws computer hes got an IBM and uh so thats the program that theyre using there   uhhuh right yeah yeah thats probably where youve used it uhhuh yeah um i have that on my uh computer here and also um i work do some work at UTD and um thats what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and and already know the language you know already know the the software and um i dont know from my own experience um WordPerfect just just so much better than than WordStar at least the version of WordStar that i used to have it may be improved by now but   thats what ive heard   yeah its uh WordStar was never very intuitive to me i mean you know you some of the commands just had nothing to do with what you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the computer computer but uh i mean like going um   uhhuh   forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didnt match with the kinds of keys you were using   yeah you had to memorize it and   yeah and but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful because it keeps track of all your footnotes   oh oh thats neat   and if you add it if you put a footnote in in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it you just change um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you   oh how wonderful   so you know its just   that i had heard that that was better that was a better one   yeah yeah and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper you had to go back and retype everything and uh it was just awful so um i dont know i think we have just become really spoiled but i think its a nice kind of way to be spoiled  so um well i have not really paid much attention to a clock although i think weve probably been talking at least ten minutes so um   yeah yeah i agree   if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with PCs   not too much what kind of what kind of things do you write   well um i was a technical writer for many years um and my husband and i actually met in a computer company um i was a tech writer and he was an engineer and uh so i did tech writing for a number of years   oh go talk to daddy about it   oh sure   excuse me  go on and talk to daddy about it tell daddy i unplugged it for you but you dont need to drag it down the hall   got a problem huh um   daddy daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that i had unplugged   oh oh trying to figure out what all that was about huh  but um i have um that that was the majority of my writing although um i have also done oh freelance magazine writing and some educational writing and   yeah   um for a while i had a um uh a partnership with a in an advertising agency with another woman who is a an artist so i did some advertising and PR but um   hum   now im actually actually im im not working anymore im a student im a graduate student so im doing a lot of writing but uh now all of the scholastic scholastic nature so  ive done a little a lots of different kinds but   yeah   i i just know right now that i couldnt have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so thats been really great and uh im so im real spoiled   yeah im anxious some day to have one here im they just talked to the other day other day about   yeah   setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon well at least have the word processing my nine year old ive decided to teach her how to type using the computer so yeah ive   uhhuh yeah good thats great yeah well those are skills that she certainly will is going to need early on and you know the and it seems like its getting earlier and earlier with the children so   thats right uhhuh   um i think that that would be a real a real uh advantage to to her to have that and uh do it early so uh do you do   yeah weve been weve been uh writing a story together and so i and i wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it you know   oh neat yes right oh great   and so i decided well if shes going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type  so well slowly learn to to type here and then then put the story in   right thats great well thats a thats a skill that she can use for the rest of her life so  might as well start now huh   yes yes i agree   well Nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly this is really going to be fun i think and um my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the   yeah
