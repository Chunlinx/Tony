                    Background        Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness that involves        loss of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of the        optic nerve     Glaucoma is usually associated with        high intraocular pressure IOP that results from an        increased resistance to drainage of the ocular fluid            Developmental disorders of the ocular anterior segment        including AxenfeldRieger syndrome are often associated        with elevated IOP and glaucoma      The developmental        sequence and structure of the human and mouse ocular        drainage structures are similar     and the same genes        are known to cause anterior segment dysgenesis ASD in        humans and mice Known genes that cause anterior segment        dysgenesis code for developmentally important transcription        factors These genes include         PITX PITX PAX FOXC previously        known as FKHL and FREAC         Foxc and         FOXE          Activity        levels for these transcription factors normally associated        with diploid gene dosage are important for normal ocular        development with heterozygosity for null mutations in most        of these genes causing anterior segment dysgenesis For         FOXC and         PAX both haploinsufficiency and        increased gene dosage due to gene duplication result in        abnormal ocular development        Similarly a        mutation in         PITX that results in increased        transcriptional transactivation causes ASD            Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are a large subclass        more than  members of the TGF superfamily Although        originally named because of their ability to induce bone        and cartilage formation     BMPs are involved in many        developmental processes including cell proliferation and        differentiation apoptosis and intercellular interactions        during morphogenesis                     Members of the bone morphogenetic protein family function        in a gene dosage dependent manner during development and        participate in ocular development               Therefore mutations that alter the level of BMPs or alter        the degree of BMP signaling are candidates to contribute to        AxenfeldRieger syndrome and other conditions involving        anterior segment malformation elevated IOP and glaucoma        Interestingly some BMPs modulate tooth morphogenesis           and AxenfeldRieger patients present with dental        abnormalities                Bmp and         Bmp are two members of the BMP        family closely related to         Drosophila dpp decapentaplegic         Bmp is expressed in multiple tissues        during embryonic development including the heart lung        kidney brain and eye      In the eye         Bmp expression is first identified        in the distal optic vesicle and overlying surface ectoderm        at the  somite stage and later in the dorsal portion of        the developing optic cup     Lens induction is absent        in homozygous         Bmp mutants and can be rescued by        exogenous BMP protein            The effects of decreasing         Bmp dosage on anterior and posterior        segment development have not been reported In this study        we analyzed mice heterozygous for a null allele of         Bmp          Bmp         tmlBlh     to determine if        decreased functional gene dosage contributes to ASD and        elevated IOP Heterozygous         Bmp mutant mice have a variety of        ocular abnormalities including ASD buphthalmia enlarged        eyes and elevated IOP This work functionally        demonstrates that BMP is a good candidate to cause human        ASD and developmental glaucoma                    Results                  Bmpexpression          Eyes of           Bmp           lacZneo heterozygotes on a mixed          background    were evaluated for galactosidase          expression at embryonic ages E E new born          postnatal ages P P and P Figure  Expression          was found in iris ciliary body and retinal pigment          epithelium at E and became more intense after birth          Expression continued at the same level at P Expression          was also demonstrated in the endothelial cells of          conjunctiva retina and orbit Importantly expression          was not present in the developing trabecular meshwork and          Schlemms canal ocular drainage structures or in          hyaloid vascular endothelial cells All other studies          described in the following sections were carried out on          mice with the           Bmp           tmlBlh targeted mutation             hereafter           Bmp  and are based on           Bmp and           Bmp mice Unless otherwise          stated the mice had a CBLJ B genetic          background                          Anterior segment dysgenesis          Slit lamp examination revealed a variety of anterior          segment abnormalities in           Bmp but not in           Bmp mice normal littermates          that were  to  months of age The specific phenotype          varied from mouse to mouse and eye to eye Figure          ABC Some affected eyes were relatively normal with          only an irregularly shaped pupil Most commonly however          there were abnormal iridocorneal attachments anterior          synechiae of variable extent large irregularly shaped          pupils that were often eccentrically located and a          displaced Schwalbes line Several eyes had peripheral          corneal thinning while others demonstrated scleralization          opacity of the peripheral cornea diffuse corneal haze          or peripheral neovascularization Figure C A few mice          had anterior subcapsular cataracts          Histological examination focused on the most severely          affected B background and confirmed and extended the          clinical observations Abnormalities were only detected          in           Bmp mice The severity of          lesions varied within individual eyes and between eyes of          the same mouse In most eyes the iridocorneal angle was          abnormal The iridocorneal angle contains the ocular          drainage structures trabecular meshwork and Schlemms          canal and is located at the junction of the iris and          cornea Abnormalities of the iridocorneal angle included          small or absent Schlemms canal SC hypoplastic or          absent trabecular meshwork TM that appeared compressed          and stalled in development and iris attachments to the          peripheral cornea synechiae Figure DEF Despite the          synechiae and abnormal pupils most           Bmp mice had generally normal          iris architecture The iris in some eyes however was          hypoplastic and malformed Figure F and occasionally          the malformation was extensive involving both iris and          ciliary body The peripheral cornea was often thinner          than normal with neovascularization There was abnormal          persistence of the anterior hyaloid vessels Figure F          Anterior subcapsular and cortical cataracts occurred in          most mice          To investigate the consequences of functionally          halving           Bmp gene dosage on iridocorneal          angle development in more detail we used transmission          electron microscopy In           Bmp mice the TM consisted of          robust trabecular beams with abundant organized collagen          and elastic tissue cores that were covered with          endotheliallike trabecular cells SC had a normal          appearance and was lined with endothelial cells In          contrast SC was often absent and the TM had developed          abnormally or was absent in           Bmp mice Even in places where          the TM was relatively normal there were fewer trabecular          beams and a paucity of extracellular matrix ECM          components including organized collagen bundles and          elastic tissue For example in the posterior trabecular          meshwork of wild type mice there are normally           trabecular beams     but           Bmp mice had only  beams and          these beams were nearly devoid of collagen Figure          GHIJ Further ECM abnormalities were present in the          peripheral cornea where prominent irregularity of the          normally regularly arranged collagen bundles explained          the peripheral corneal scleralization                          Intraocular pressure          To determine the effects of decreased           Bmp gene dosage on intraocular          pressure we compared the lOPs of age and strainmatched                    Bmp and           Bmp mice We initially assessed          the lOPs of  to  month old mice At these ages  out          of            Bmp heterozygotes had elevated          IOP defined as an IOP greater than two standard          deviations above the mean of the           Bmp mice To determine if the          incidence of elevated IOP changed with age we analyzed          groups of mice at the ages of  to  months and  to           months The incidence did not change appreciably with           out of  mice having elevated IOP at  to  months and           out of  having elevated IOP at  to  months Figure                     Bmp genotype had a significant          effect on IOP ANOVA P   whereas age and sex          did not          Due to the variability in both anterior segment          abnormalities and IOP we reasoned that histological          analysis of eyes with high versus normal IOP might          provide insight to the extent of abnormalities required          to cause elevated IOP The incidence of drainage          structure abnormalities and synechiae deemed severe          enough to significantly decrease or prevent aqueous humor          drainage was recorded by careful analysis of many          sections from different regions around these eyes see          Methods Our data suggest that IOP is normal even when           of the iridocorneal angle around the circumference of          the eye is severely abnormal Furthermore all four of          the studied eyes with high IOP also had severe          abnormalities extending over  or more of the analyzed          sections Figure                           Posterior segment abnormalities          Ophthalmoscopic analysis of           Bmp but not           Bmp mice revealed irregular          white patches in the vitreous and dense vitreous haze in          the majority of eyes examined Figure A The retinal          vasculature also was abnormal in           Bmp eyes Fluorescein          angiography showed that the main retinal vessels branched          close to the optic nerve and were irregularly arranged          compared to wild type mice In addition there was a          dense network of small tortuous vessels throughout the          vitreous that leaked fluorescein Figure C These          abnormalities were identified in the youngest  to           weeks old and oldest  months mice examined Severe          retinal detachments were observed as early as four months          and their incidence increased with age Although anterior          segment cloudiness often made ophthalmoscopy difficult in                    Bmp heterozygotes          abnormalities of the optic nerve head were frequently          present Combined intraorbital and intracranial          dissection of  randomly selected mice failed to detect a          grossly visible optic nerve in all but one mouse This          mouse had a nerve extending from the right eye but the          left nerve was absent Most dissected eyes had a small          white nub of tissue over the scleral foramen          Histologic analysis confirmed posterior segment          abnormalities in           Bmp heterozygotes but not in          genotypically normal mice In           Bmp mice the hyaloid vessels          disappeared around P as reported elsewhere               In contrast the hyaloid vessels in           Bmp heterozygotes persisted          throughout the  month period studied and increased in          number and size beyond that normally present at birth          Figure DEFG The abnormal vitreous vessels Figure          Eand G were frequently associated with the formation          of adhesions between the retina and lens capsule that          exerted traction on the retina resulting in retinal          detachment in approximately  of the           Bmp mice examined and occurred          as early as P Regression of the hyaloid vasculature is          mediated via macrophagedependent cell death     In          the first ten days after birth macrophages were abundant          in the vitreous of           Bmp mice usually localized          close to the hyaloid vascular system Figure F As the          hyaloid vessels disappeared the number of macrophages          declined In           Bmp mice macrophages were          rarely observed and never identified in the vitreous of          mice older than P          In agreement with the clinical examinations optic          nerve phenotypes in           Bmp mice ranged from normal to          absent Figure HIJK They were often severely          abnormal consisting of loose connective tissue with          absence of neural tissue Figure IJ Retinal          architecture also varied within and between eyes          Although areas of retina were morphologically normal in           Bmp mice the retinal ganglion          cell layer was estimated to on average contain          approximately  the normal number of cells and the          inner nuclear layer was unusually thin The retinal          phenotype was variable but present in mice of all          analyzed ages including  month old It did not correlate          with IOP being present in both high and normal IOP eyes          and was not obviously worse in old mice than in young          mice In contrast the photoreceptor layer typically          appeared normal though there may have been reduced          numbers of cells Figure K However there were foci of          retinal dysplasia characterized by rosette formation          Figure M Additionally there were small areas where          photoreceptor nuclei extended externally and were in          direct contact with the retinal pigment epithelium          Figure N A panel of retinal cell markers revealed          that all major retinal cell types including ganglion          cells horizontal cells bipolar cells amacrine cells          rod and cone photoreceptors and Muller cells were          present in           Bmp retinas and expressed          markers of differentiation Figure ABCDEF                          Electroretinography          We used full field electroretinography ERG to study          retinal function in            Bmp heterozygotes Eyes with          extensively opaque corneas or obvious cataracts were not          used for ERG assessment and mice with retinal          detachments were dropped from the study There was          variability in both severity and age of detectable          abnormalities Compared to normal mice some           Bmp eyes had normal responses          even at ages up to  months the oldest age assessed for          these eyes In other mice both           a  and           b  wave amplitude reductions were          seen due in part to poor pupillary dilation However a          prominent feature of the ERG waveforms to bright flashes          when detectable abnormalities were present was the          preferential loss of           b wave relative to the           a wave It is well established          that the           a  and           b  wave components of the bright          flash ERG in mice reflect the functional state of outer          and inner retinal cells respectively Our observations          of greater deficits of the           b wave extend our analysis to the          entire retina and are consistent with the histologic          abnormalities that are more severe in the inner          retina                          Effects of genetic background          The penetrance and severity of anterior and posterior          segment phenotypes was strongly influenced by genetic          background Table  On the B background both the          anterior and posterior segment were abnormal in most           Bmp mice with over two thirds          having bilateral clinical involvement In contrast on          the CHBLiA background approximately half of the           Bmp mice were clinically          affected and this was always unilateral On this          background the abnormalities were typically limited to          the anterior segment involving enlarged pupils and          buphthalmos On other genetic backgrounds few if any          heterozygous mice had clinically detectable ocular          dysgenesis                            Discussion                  Anterior segment dysgenesis          We provide evidence here that a null mutation of           Bmp results in dominantly          inherited developmental dysgenesis of the anterior          segment The abnormalities affect a variety of anterior          segment tissues including the drainage structures of the          iridocorneal angle and are similar to those reported in          human patients with ASD and glaucoma       The          absence of detectable           Bmp expression in the drainage          structures suggests that BMP produced by the ciliary          body andor iris may act as a growth and differentiation          factor during angle development The drainage structures          were often hypoplastic with little extracellular matrix          The defects in           Bmp mutant mice may involve          abnormal cellcell adhesion cell migration andor          delayed or abnormal differentiation of mesenchymal cells          in the iridocorneal angle including decreased production          of ECM All of these processes can be regulated by ECM               raising the possibility that BMP regulates          the production andor organization of ECM and that the          ECM abnormalities lead to or exacerbate the developmental          defects Alternatively BMP may direct expression of          cell surface receptors that participate in cellcell and          cellmatrix interactions affecting both cell migration          and ECM composition andor affecting cell fate          The nature and variability of anterior segment          phenotypes of           Bmp heterozygotes resemble          those we reported in mice with dominant mutations in the          forkhead box genes           Foxc and           Foxc     However the           Bmp haploinsufficient phenotype is          typically more severe The phenotypic variability both          between and within the eyes of genetically uniform mice          with           Bmp or           Foxc gene mutations indicates that          stochastic developmental events are important in          determining the phenotypic outcome The possible nature          of these stochastic events was previously discussed                                       Elevated intraocular pressure is caused by          extensive angle dysgenesis          In humans with ASD the phenotype is variable even          between patients with mutations in the same gene and the          severity of clinically observable dysgenesis does not          correlate with IOP The etiology of IOP elevation is not          well defined Different           Bmp heterozygotes had high low or          normal IOP Although           Bmp eyes of each IOP class had          some degree of drainage structure abnormalities only          eyes with severe drainage structure abnormalities          extending over  or greater of the analyzed locations          had high IOP The requirement for extensive iridocorneal          angle damage for IOP elevation agrees closely with          independent estimates from studies of human patients with          angle recession      Ocular trauma can damage the          iris and drainage structures in the angle in a manner          that is clinically obvious since the iris tissue recedes          posteriorly from its normal position Patients in whom          the angle recession extends for  to  degrees of the          angle circumference  to  frequently develop          elevated IOP and glaucoma whereas patients with less          extensive damage typically do not have high IOP although          their risk of progressing to glaucoma is increased The          major difference in most           Bmp eyes with low IOP was the          presence of severe dysgenesis of the ciliary body that          was likely to severely decrease aqueous humor production          Less obvious abnormalities in ciliary body tissues may          also affect IOP by altering the volume or composition of          the aqueous humor produced and possibly by altering the          drainage structures in a paracrine fashion     Thus          more subtle metabolic abnormalities in the ciliary body          may interact with the iridocorneal angle phenotypic          variation and contribute to variability in IOP elevation          between human patients                          Bmpaffects retinal vascular development and          hyaloid vascular involution                    Bmp heterozygotes have          abnormally arranged retinal blood vessels and abnormal          persistence of the hyaloid vasculature In wild type          mice the absolute number of hyaloid vessels actively          decreases between P and P and all vessels disappear by          P Elimination of the hyaloid vessels proceeds by          programmed cell death in both human    and mouse eyes               Furthermore this death of endothelial cells          and pericytes does not occur in the absence of          macrophages If macrophages are eliminated with toxic          liposomes    or in transgenic mice expressing          diphtheria toxin from a macrophage specific transgene              there is persistence of the pupillary and hyaloid          vessels The failure of capillary regression in the          liposometreated mice can be rescued by anterior          chamber injection of exogenous bone marrowderived          macrophages     In agreement with these findings we          observed that absence of macrophages in the vitreous of           Bmp mice is associated with          persistence of these vessels Additional studies are          needed to determine how BMP affects the presence of the          ocular macrophages required for vascular involution and          if BMP affects the production of trophic factors or          affects the macrophages themselves                          BMP has important roles in retinal and optic nerve          formation          Vertebrate retinal development is an intricate process          involving complex pathways that are not completely          understood           Although our cell          marker analysis indicates that all major retinal cell          types differentiate haploinsufficiency of BMP results          in a variety of retinal abnormalities The inner retina          is the most severely affected with substantially reduced          cell numbers in both the retinal ganglion cell layer and          inner nuclear layer of nearly all           Bmp mice on the B genetic          background Although elevated IOP likely results in inner          retinal cell death in glaucoma deficiency of inner          retinal cells in           Bmp heterozygotes is at least          partly a developmental phenomenon It does not correlate          with IOP being present in both high and normal IOP eyes          Cell numbers are reduced even in eyes of very young mice          and the phenotype is not obviously worse in old mice          Pressure induced cell death may occur but the wide          variability in severity between eyes may have hidden an          effect of high IOP on cell survival          The optic nerve did not develop normally and appeared          to completely lack neural tissue in most B           Bmp mice The nerve fiber          layer composed of retinal ganglion cell axons was not          evident even adjacent to the scleral foramen where it is          normally substantially thickened due to axon convergence          on the optic nerve Further experiments are necessary to          determine if BMP modulates retinal ganglion cell axon          sprouting elongation targeting or maintenance or if          BMP regulates events in optic nerve glia that affect          these processes BMPs have been implicated in neuronal          maturation and axonal targeting Exogenous BMP enhances          dendrite but not axon growth in embryonic rat sympathetic          neurons    and hippocampal neurons              Overexpression studies suggest a link between           Bmp and axonal targeting of          ganglion cells Ectopic BMP can lead to the upregulation          of           Tbx in the retina and           Tbx misexpression results in          altered retinal ganglion cell axon projections to the          tectum              In contrast to the inner retinal layers the          photoreceptor layer typically appeared normal At some          locations however there was retinal dysplasia or          disorganization of photoreceptor position Retinal          dysplasia is characterized by palisading outer retinal          cells that surround a central lumen     It occurs in          mice with a variety of genetic defects and in some          instances is associated with abnormalities of the retinal          pigment epithelium         Both during          development and in adult life the retinal pigment          epithelium is critical to retinal function     BMP          and  may act as negative growth regulators in the          retinal pigment epithelium     It is possible that          haploinsufficiency of BMP in the retinal pigment          epithelium may be responsible for focal retinal dysplasia          and displacement of photoreceptor nuclei                          Modifiers and candidate genes          As shown here haploinsufficiency of BMP causes a          variety of ocular abnormalities that are strongly          influenced by strainspecific modifier genes          Identification of the genetic modifiers that alter these          phenotypes may provide an important route to          understanding the cellular and genetic interactions          underlying various developmental processes involving          BMP          BMPs interact with target cells through a heteromeric          complex of type I and type II transmembrane receptors          coupled to an intracellular downstream pathway that          includes Smad transcription factors The activity of this          BMP signaling pathway can be modulated           in vivo by several different          mechanisms For example in the extracellular environment          numerous antagonists can bind to BMPs and inhibit their          interaction with receptors eg noggin chordin twisted          gastrulation while dominant negative receptor molecules          eg Bambi and inhibitory Smads eg Smad  and           interfere with signaling at the cellular level                  These evolutionarily conserved factors work          together to precisely modulate the level of BMP signaling          activity           in vivo The genes encoding these          factors are excellent candidates to modify the phenotypes          described here and to cause developmental conditions that          associate with glaucoma                            Conclusions        Wildtype levels of BMP are important for normal        development of the anterior and posterior segments The        importance of BMP depends on genetic background The        ocular phenotypes of         Bmp mutant mice show that         BMP is a strong candidate to        contribute to AxenfeldRieger anomaly and other        developmental conditions associated with human glaucoma        These mice provide a model to study these diseases and        various processes of ocular development                    Materials and Methods                  Animal husbandry          All experiments were performed in compliance with the          ARVO statement for use of animals

            Clinical examinations          Anterior chambers were examined with a slit lamp and          photographs were taken using a X objective lens An          indirect ophthalmoscope and a  or  diopter lens was          used to visualize the retinas and optic nerves For this          analysis pupils were dilated with a drop of           cyclopentolate     Strain B has an incidence of a          minor notch in the pupil that is clearly distinguishable          from the phenotypes described here    and was not          included as an abnormal phenotype here                          Histological analysis          Eyes were fixed processed and then embedded in          paraffin or Historesin Leica Heidelberg Germany More          than            Bmp mice were studied Paraffin          embedded eyes were sagitally sectioned at  m while          plastic embedded eyes were sagitally sectioned at  m          thickness Iridocorneal angle morphology was interpreted          from plastic sections For this  to  sections from          each of  to  different ocular locations typically more          than  sections per eye were collected stained with          hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed for each eye The          lens was used as a landmark in collecting these sections          Collected regions included temporal and nasal lens          peripheries central lens and regions on each side of          the lens center that were halfway towards the lens          periphery On grading the incidence of severely affected          angle locations the investigator did not know the IOP          values for the eyes The angles of every high quality          section were included and angles whose morphology          suggested drainage was not possible were rated severe

immediately          enucleated and fixed with  paraformaldehyde and           glutaraldehyde in  M phosphate phosphate buffer pH           at C The eyes were fixed for one hour and the          anterior segment removed and cut into  x  mm blocks          that included cornea iris trabecular meshwork and          ciliary body Fixation was continued at C for  hours          and the tissues were washed in phosphate buffer and then          postfixed with  osmium tetroxide dehydrated and          embedded in eponaraldite resin     One micron          sections were cut for orientation thin

period as were          CBLJ mice The lOPs of CBLJ are very consistent          over time and so these animals were interspersed with          experimental mice to ensure that calibration had not          drifted and that the system was functioning          optimally                          Immunohistochemistry          Four eyes each at P and P and eight eyes from P          CBLJ mice were
