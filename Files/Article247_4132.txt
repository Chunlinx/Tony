                                 Whos Afraid of an Internet Tax            Judging from the last two Republican presidential debates the new big issuein this campaign is taxation of Internet commerce Or rather since none of thecandidates wants to tax Internet commerce right now the issue is who ismost committed to extending the current congressional moratorium on taxingInternet commerce which runs out in  Writing in the Wall StreetJournal on Dec  John Simons and John Harwood identified Internettaxation as a  st century wedge issue for George W Bush whosays he wants to extend the moratorium but wont rule out Internet taxes in thefuture In the zany context of the Republican nomination race this makes Busha taxandspend liberal Heres how Simons and Harwood explained Bushspolitical dilemma                                             The issue pits traditionally Republican Main Street business proprietorsagainst the highflying Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have contributed moreto Mr Bushs campaign than any other It also pits the GOPs vocal band ofantitax economic conservatives against many of the Republican governors whomMr Bush is relying upon to support his primary campaign  The reason thatMr Bush and his gubernatorial backers are loath to support a permanent ban isthey tend to rely heavily on sales taxes to fund their stategovernments                                       The Republican governors of course have it exactly right Its totallyunfair that Internet businesses can sell their wares without making customerspay state sales taxes given that bricksandmortar stores are obliged to maketheir customers pay state sales taxes A reasonable alternative totaxing Internet commerce would be for all  states to eliminate sales taxesaltogether and make up the lost revenue with increased or new state incometaxes But dont hold your breath for Republicans or even Democrats toembrace that redistributionist solution anytime soon Indeed OrrinHatch and Alan Keyes are headed in the opposite direction They proposeeliminating the federal income tax and replacing it with a national salestax            In pressing for a taxfree Internet until the end of time Bushs detractorsare ignoring or minimizing whatever costs that would impose on traditionalretailers Check out this exchange from the Dec  Arizona debate on CNN betweenJohn McCain justly praised for being stirringly responsible on manyother issues in this campaign and Orrin Hatch                                             McCain Orrin you and I have worked on  the Internet tax moratoriumact As you know this was stoutly resisted by governors Republicans governorsas well Dont you think we ought to make the Internet tax moratoriumpermanent                                                      Chatterbox translates Orrin dont you think governors in generalespecially Republican governors of big states bordering New MexicoOklahoma Arkansas and Louisiana are taxloving jerks who would makebad presidents  I would never say such a thing of course but perhapsyoull do it for me                                              Hatch Yes I really do I really think that we ought to do it because Ithink its far overblown to think that the fact that people buy over theInternet is going to reduce mainstream USA I think mainstream USA can competevery very well                              I mentioned in the New Hampshire debate last week I asked my wifeabout that I said Elaine what would you do if you could order everythingright over the Internet and have it delivered right to your home She said Istill want to go to the stores I want to test things I want to look at themI want to enjoy it I think shes not alone                                                      Chatterbox translates Even though usually Im a big Internetbooster I am going to pretend now that Internet commerce will never amount tomuch And Im going to flatter bricksandmortar retailers by telling themtheyre so powerful that they can subject their customers to my new nationalsales tax and still trounce the taxfree Internet Whoopee Its a goodthing I have no chance of getting elected
