                                 Hollywood Shuffle            Soonafter taking over Columbia Pictures in  Peter Guber and Jon Peters gotdown to the business of establishing their importance in Hollywood Theyredecorated The producers particularly wanted to impress the studios newowner the Sony Corp in Tokyo so they redid their suite in a Japanese motifimporting Japanese workers to put up cedar paneling over a special kind of mudused in Japanese wall construction Unfortunately Hollywood humidity meltedthe mud and the floors buckled Guber and Peters fled to new offices shortlythereafter            The marriage of Japan and Hollywood worked outabout the same way Sony the electronics giant famous for inventing andmarketing products that consumers never knew they wanted shelled out whatVariety reported to be  billion for Columbia a figure that includedthe cost of severing Guber and Peters existing contract with Warner Everyoneelse in Hollywood was flabbergasted and jealous while the media dwelled onfears that a cultural treasure was being gobbled up In the end though it wasthe Japanese who were swallowed whole Five years after the purchase Sony hadto write off  billion on its investment one of the biggest losses inindustry history            In their book Hit and Run How Jon Peters and PeterGuber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood  Nancy Griffin and Kim Mastersoutline the colossal arrogance excess and selfdelusion that led to thedebacle Their steady stream of malicious if clumsily written anecdotes isnothing if not entertaining Jon Peters everyone knows began as BarbraStreisands hairdresser Here we learn that he also played a critical role inher sexual awakeningthat their marathon fights followed by sex freed thediva to experience a new assertiveness in bed At Columbia however he was ahottempered bully threatening at one point to break a colleagues jaw Onanother occasion after Streisand confessed that she had never seen anuncircumcised penis Peters ordered the couples driver to come over and drophis pants Peters also sent the corporate jet laden with flowers to a modelhe was courting and ordered his driver to call ahead to the studio so someonecould be poised to open his car door when he arrived            Gubera ponytailed lawyer and technology buff who rose through the ranks atColumbiarefused to be interviewed for the book Perhaps as a result he comesacross even worse than Peters Most damaging for his future job prospects isthe implicit suggestion that he cynically exploited Sony to advance his ownmovies and sybaritic lifestyle never caring much about the parent companyslongterm interests With a habit of disappearing during moments of crisis atthe studio Guber came across to friends as ambivalent at best about workingfor the Japanese They havent bought me he told a fellow studio executiveTheyre only renting me for five years The reader may be most amused bylesser players like Mark Canton the credithungry head of production atColumbia who pathetically asked the producers of A Few Good Men tothank him publicly at the premiere they did and implored Nick Nolte to thankhim if he got a Golden Globe award for Prince of Tides Nolte won butdidnt            There are plenty of problems with the way Hit andRun is told It relies too heavily on anonymous sources and the tradepress has begun complaining that some of its stories are bogus The editor ofVariety  for instance has indignantly denied the authors assertionthat he suppressed publication of financial documents embarrassing to ColumbiaPictures The books tone also is relentlessly caustic Can there ever havebeen a more loathsome collection of charlatans sycophants and backstabbersCome to think of it maybe not            But the books value liesless in the anecdotes than in what it has to tell us about how one of thebiggest entertainment deals went awry at a time when the industry wasconsolidating everywhere heading toward domination by a mere six or eightmultinational companiesall of which face the headache of competing fiefdomsThe SonyColumbia deal is a cautionary tale even though larger lessons are notGriffin and Masters forte            Onedoes wish that they had more to say about Sony and Columbia Pictures misplacedfaith in synergy since the search for that elusive ideal has run sospectacularly aground in other media deals It was especially disastrous in theacquisition of MCA Inc by Sonys electronics rival Matsushita which tookplace about the same time Matsushita later sold the majority interest of MCAto Seagram for  billion The MCA sale did not involve the same level ofplunder In both takeovers though the Hollywood side thought that by sellingit could tap into a bottomless well of capital with which to buy televisionnetworks record companies and the like The Japanese on the other hand werehoping for a new source of software ie movies and television shows fortheir digital televisions compact discs and other new products They countedon the studios to produce it in a reliable way            Like Guber Sony refused to cooperate with the authors ofHit and Run  so we dont get much insight into the thought processes ofthe Japanese Did they have a mole in the studio or not How much did theyknow about what they were getting into We never find out But we do getsnapshots of the mindset that allowed them to get sucked into the vortex offinancial losses At one point Norio Ohga the president of Sony joined agroup of executives from Tokyo to tour the set of Whos the Boss one ofthe studios more successful television shows All they did was look at thecameras and ask who made the video tape and what kind of lead density ithad            TheJapanese may have been confused but the Americans who supposedly representedtheir interests seem frankly guilty of misleading them If anything Griffinand Masters let these characters off too easily Both Peter G Peterson theprominent New York investment banker and Michael Ovitz thenhead of CreativeArtists Agency would seem to have been more interested in making money out ofthe Columbia deal than in warning their client Sony about the risks but theauthors are too polite to come right out and say so Also treated kindly isMichael Schulhof the miscast head of Sonys American operations he had nobackground in the movie business After backing Guber through a series ofdisasters Schulhof eventually admitted that he was unable to get the producerto change his management style But the authors do not hold Schulhofaccountable They do not ask what changes he had in mind other than gettingGuber to try harder to make better movies at lower cost                           Hit and Run is further undercut by parochialismespecially evident in its constant use of Hollywood jargon This is a book inwhich executives never approve a movie they greenlight it Even beyond theklunky language the authors fail to transcend their narrow context and explorewhat management success in the movie business might have entailed The onlyclear measure of Guber and Peters misjudgment is their overspending forantique furniture yachts slumber parties at Aspen and the like and anumbing succession of boxoffice bombs Actually some of the bombs werepretty good movies like Wolf and Remains of the Day while others like themuchmaligned Last Action Hero with Arnold Schwarzenegger were failures in aninteresting way            With theirbackgroundsGriffin is deputy editor of Premiere and Masters acontributing editor for Time and Vanity Fair the authors shouldhave been able to tell us a little more about why Hollywood movies are so badInstead they have written the story of a failure albeit one with importantconsequences for the industry today Hopefully people who read the story ofSonys lessthanexcellent adventure in Hollywood will look a little moreskeptically at the vaporous claims surrounding other megamergers in thecommunications business They will have less patience for optimistic talk aboutsynergy and the marriage of content with distribution As William Goldman putit when it comes to what works or doesnt in Hollywood nobody knowsanything
