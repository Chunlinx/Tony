                 well what magazines do you subscribe to Lori   well we have probably too many  weve got not enough to keep up i mean too many to keep up with we get uh Forbes Fortune Newsweek     yeah   Southern Living Texas Highways and National Geographic i think i think ive got them all   oh gosh yeah uhhuh well i i take um right now ive kind of a whittled mine down i just take Vanity Fair and uh Harpers and uh Houston City magazine   uhhuh   uhhuh   but you know how i used to subscribe to Texas Highways thats one of the best magazines for the money going   right   i mean its such a bargain what what i mean what is it like twelve dollars a year   it is something like that yeah   and then the photographys beautiful   it is   yeah its matter thats i thought about it not too long ago that uh  i had seen an issue and i thought gosh i ought to give my parents that for Christmas but i of course now its Christmas i havent done it so maybe next year   yeah   but i know i had i had uh found myself about i dont know two years ago in the in a situation where i i literally had more magazines coming in than i could read and i thought this is crazy so i   right you know its not so bad if theyre monthly publications but like Newsweek which i really enjoy um comes out every week and so its really hard to keep up with   uhhuh yeah well i i took Time for i guess ten years   uhhuh   and i enjoyed it and it and i it you know it has just you know a wealth of information i mean its therefore similar to Newsweek but whenever i got to the point that i just i just finally said this is just insane because i had so many magazines i let them all lapse   yeah   and then once they were all gone and of course that took a while i didnt realize how much i had paid up on some of them   uhhuh   and uh then i decided well i you know Vanity Fair offered me a special thing to come back at a reduced rate you know   uhhuh   and then Harpers did and so i you know little by little ive ive you know subscribed to a few more again  but uh i take the newspaper everyday   right uhhuh   so ive got plenty of reading material   yeah well we get the newspaper on the weekends and that seems to be enough   yeah yeah yeah   because well just turn on the news otherwise and see see what the latest is   well you sound though kind of like me though but i mean its im i have always plenty of reading material around my house   uhhuh   and when i go to visit my brother and sisterinlaw in Austin it drives me crazy because i i always have to be sure and put something in my suitcase to read because honestly i wonder these people dont ever read   oh is that right   yeah i mean their house just a you know its just its its appalling to me they have nothing to read   well maybe thats what you ought to get them for Christmas   yeah really well uh well actually i think one year uh several years ago i did give them a a subscription to Time and they never said a word about it you know and so i thought well maybe they werent   uhhuh oh really id theyre not into that   maybe they werent into it you know thats fine but its just its so different than   yeah   you know i just i require reading material thats all that is to it   right right yeah um you know one thing i hate i dont know if this is really on the subject but when they call you the different places call you to sign up   uhhuh   at this you know and they try to give you this big bargain and and youre like no we already subscribe to enough magazines at the time and   uhhuh   so   yeah well i um  you know i had as a matter of fact the the Vanity Fair whenever i let it lapse   uhhuh   they had sent me all these you know final notice things and i just you know didnt send them back in   umhum   and so finally once i did decide to subscribe again i sent in a a thing that said hey you know i mean it was whatever the the uh subscription rate was i think like fifteen dollars   uhhuh uhhuh   and  about a month later i got a thing in the mail saying well hey as a former subscriber you can now get it for twelve and they had a one eight hundred number i called up and i said hey i want three bucks back   oh right   so they extended they said they were gonna extend my subscription for three months but theyre pretty competitive   uhhuh yeah yeah but um i find at times i have numerous magazines piled up  and ill just sit down you know one weekend or something and try to catch up on them   yeah   but i mean i you know i enjoy it i guess you know um as far as comparing that to other media its so much easier to listen to either the radio or to watch TV to listen i mean to know whats going on rather than to read an article   oh it is it is and it just but at the same time you can  you can get information i mean there there   in a magazine   the variety and you can get different types of information and and you know television is is geared so much to   right right   the average Joe Blow and quite frankly i mean there there are items of interest to me that youll never find on television   exactly yeah thats true the other thing is um some magazines
