                 okay well have you bought anything recently and uh if so do you find it to your liking do you think its worth the money   i bought i havent returned it but i bought a i went down to San Marcos to the Coach Store and bought a Coach handbag   uhhuh   and ive had it now for two months and i have owned Coach products before thats why i love them so much and uh i am going to have to take this back to have it repaired after two months i am so peeved   oh really yeah i can imagine   i i think its   because theyre not cheap   no theyre not not even at twenty five percent off so um i just uh and ive owned many before im just really not a bit happy with it i dont know if theyve gotten too big or too popular or or what but you expect when you   well i know that in going out and and looking at clothes uh even going to expensive stores       the clothes look to me so sleazy  any more i dont know whether its the type of materials theyre using   yes   is it you know is it supposed to be you know crepe or what and or if its a case now ive seen Dillards in an area   umhum   and they hadnt even theyd hung the clothes out but they hadnt even pressed them so they didnt look good to begin with and uh you know and they looked cheap and they were you know they werent cheap they were hundred and thirty nine hundred hundred and fifty   i saw that umhum   you know you dont buy find cheap dresses any more even at Penneys   no   especially at Penneys theyve upgraded considerably   exactly   and uh the only thing that i know that we have uh uh televisions   umhum   we have have gotten real good televisions we have had real good luck with televisions and i just wanna i think that their i think their quality is better   but to see you can buy you could you could you pay the same price for a new television as you do for a new suit a mans suit you know   well thats true thats true thats true you do you you can buy a portable cheaper than you can buy a mans suit   oh you exactly i was uh i had i bought something the other day and i thought well ive been wanting this new whatever and i did this this is my new brand i know what it was i was wanting this new television and this is this is my new TV and it was like three pairs of shoes and a you know       and ive gone to the outlet to buy the shoes so so   i know well i know that uh our son for Christmas we usually for Christmas we will give him a suit and we try to you know stay around two hundred and something on them we you cant find a suit any more for two hundred and something   umhum huh even even at uh the Mens Warehouse and things like that   umhum umhum you know i could you know for what some of the suits cost they had just moved into a new house i could buy them a a small new refrigerator almost as cheap as what the suits are   exactly   and thats utterly ridiculous clothing has just gotten totally out of sight and i hate to spend you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a dress thats made in Taiwan   that the you have to pay five dollars to have cleaned every two times you wear it or something and   yes yes yes very definitely so uh   i just   you know i i other than the TVs uh TVs i i do think here are made pretty good uh but i dont think cars are made that well any more   hum i am real happy with my car   now what is it what car do you a Ford   a Ford yeah i i think everythings its oh four and a half years old and everything works on it and nothings fallen off or broken i know friends with Chryslers that havent had that luck and   oh thats good   Toyotas that havent had that luck and   umhum   but uh no i think i think youre right the electronics seem to be of decent quality   umhum i dont know whether competition is so stiff between Japan and and the US or i dont know what it is but you know the electronics seem to be you know pretty good value for their money   and going down in price too   yes yes definitely because i know the price of the big screen TVs you know theyre going down you know compared to what they were three years ago   oh and i bought a little camera about six years ago that i just thought was the the bees knees or whatever it just i mean just wonderful and now i can get it for fifty dollars less the same model and for the same price i can get one that does a lot more     same model umhum umhum the only thing im not seeing going go down that much is the camcorders the video tape recorders things   oh well not a lot no   uh uh theyve gone down a little bit we just bought one we kept thinking they would get much cheaper you know like somewhere around five or six hundred dollars but theyre still right up there around nine eight or nine hundred dollars   uhhuh umhum   you know which kind of surprised me because the how long have they been out now almost ten years   oh yeah my brother has an old one   you know uhhuh and uh so uh   theyve gotten smaller though and   thats true and maybe thats what it is maybe theyre just coming you know theyre constantly working on them and so therefore they keep changing and they dont have any reason yet to
