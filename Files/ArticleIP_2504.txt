                                 Permanent Bank Holiday            Old San Francisco longgaseous with selfregard selfesteem is for Oakland suffered a grievousdeflating April  when Bank of Americabanker to entrepreneurs andimmigrants builder of new industries capitalizer of the California Dreamfinancier indeed gallant financier of the Golden Gate Bridgeannounced itsmerger with NationsBank to form BankAmerica and its plans to move bankheadquarters from San Francisco to Charlotte NC            Thereis a loss of face in the move of the banks home office as well as a blow toSan Franciscos economy To many San Franciscans the rejection of the city isregarded as an insult to BofA founder AP Giannini Oldtimers recall thatGiannini who kept his desk on the banking floor itself made loans to workingpeople after inspecting their hands If the loan applicant had callused handsthat meant he was working and he got the loan            In the  years since Gianninis death theyearold BofA has discarded much of the old way but even today the banksupports urbanity high and low Last year it donated nearly  million togreater San Francisco including  to the San Francisco Opera Its SanFrancisco branches cashatpar public benefits checks without requiringrecipients to have bank accounts there            Whilethere was no run on the bank in the wake of the news so great was the shockthat the bank made grief counselors available to the stricken city HughMcColl No  at NationsBank and chairman of the combined operation sought toreassure the city koaning at a San Francisco meeting The headquarters iswhere we are Now were in San Francisco This afternoon well be in LosAngeles            Charlotte was bad enough but by suggestingthat the HQ is now also in much despised LA where San Franciscans say thedefinition of Old Money is someone whose checks clear the bank the first timewas a very bitter pill            SanFrancisco Mayor Willie Brown spoke for the city when he said Theyre stealingour bank And while it may not be an actual defalcation it certainly is anabscondment The deal talks worked out in only three weeks in the citysappropriately named Mandarin Hotel were carried out in utter secrecy Bank ofAmerica is an important institution in our cityit has been so throughout thecitys history Brown said Itll be a shock to our economy an economiccrisis            The most wired man in a wired city the mayorfirst learned of the merger at  am April  when a San FranciscoExaminer reporter called to tell him the deal was being announced then inManhattan            To oldSan Franciscans people whose hands have shaken the hands of those who came inthe Gold Rush the move is an act of lsemajest an impertinence rivalingonly that of Billy Ralston who chose to go for a refreshing swim in the harborone day in  when his mighty Bank of California was crashing rather thanstay at the office Ralston drowned Of course in financial circles McCollwho constructed the deal is believed to be able to walk on water            The deal is colossal The new institution which might aswell have been named TitanicBank will be the United States largest with billion in assets It will            be the No  bank in loansdeposits business lending large and small and ATMs             be the United States firstcoasttocoast bank operating in  contiguous states from Washington DCto Washington state            processone out of every four checks in the country            Currently the bank hasabout  branches and  employees While the branches are largelynoncompeting some will be closed and about  jobs are expected to beeliminated Staffers at the redundant former headquarters of BofA are believedto be the most vulnerable Lifeboats have been constructed for the top dozenemployees BofA executive H Eugene Lockhart barely on the job for a yearleft his job three days after the merger with a severance package including million and stock grants cashable for an additional  million            Although layoffs violate the Giannini ethosin the banks first  years therewere nonethe new masters were quick to invoke the founders blessing on thedeal This is a transaction I know AP would have done wrote BofA headDavid Coulter to staffers            Indeed Giannini dreamed of creating the firstnationwide US bank He started his bank in a former saloon in San FranciscosItalian North Beach under the name Bank of Italy It had no connection withany official bank of Italy though a large part of its business naturallyenough involved transfers to and from that country In the s he boughtbanks in New York to establish a beachhead but he was beaten back in athreedecade struggle by banking laws regulators and inhouse perfidy In he bought a small New York bank whose twin claims to fame were that ithad been founded in  and was named Bank of America Giannini quicklyrenamed his establishment            McCollsinsistence that the new banks headquarters are in perpetual motion swirlingaround him didnt satisfy many natives who wondered why one of the deals fewspecific stipulations was moving HQ out of San Francisco            That no compelling or even cantriddenexplanation for the move came forth made some wonder if it is a billiondollarslight born of City Attorney Louise Rennes longrunning feud with the bankRenne had said that BofA should place warning labels on its advertising Noaccurate records kept was one she suggested Last December Mayor Brown toldCalifornia government officials that he looked forward to a newspaper articleheadlined Local Jurisdictions Prevail Over BofA            Behindthe tirades are a set of lawsuits on behalf of San Francisco and  otherCalifornia government agencies charging BofA with mismanaging billions ofdollars from  California municipal bond issues Actual and punitivedamages could top  billion            BofA says it has acted in good faith havingalready returned  million in unclaimed funds and nearly  million inaccidental overcharges to the cities and state It maintains it continues toreview its handling of the bond issues many of which it inherited when itmerged with Security Pacific Bank            City officials were stunnedto think a multimilliondollar bank might have been stung by milliondollardarts But local investment banker Warren Hellman thought otherwise            Corporations are run by people and people have feelings Hellman told theSan Francisco Chronicle  Im sure Coulter doesnt appreciate publicofficials delivering diatribes against BofA            How is it asked San Franciscans on consideringthe news that it requires more public scrutiny to cut down a redwood than itdoes to uproot a bank            Its a curiosity of our agethat just as the press unable to find ideological or philosophical concerns inpublic life is obsessed instead with the puny private lives of the powerfulso also business freed of the obligation to consider the public interest inits dealmaking gives play to the purely personal            Of course this works bothways Shortly after BofA left the KnightRidder Co long established inMiami announced it is relocating its home office to Silicon Valley or as wein the city like to say the Bay Area            The news was greeted withhalfhosannas since it further establishes the fact that the real power inNorthern California is in Silicon Valley not San Francisco San Franciscocontinues to attract thousands of new residents however from the ValleyFourmillion dollar Victorians sell in a day            The real story of SanFrancisco may not be that it loses local headquartersalmost every city inAmerica outside New York is a branch managers town nowbut that it may be thefirst major American city to be primarily a bedroom community You can buysheets linens and furniture now in the great granite temple on Grant Avenuethat was once the headquarters of Security Pacific National Bank
