                why dont you go ahead with the fishing part     well uh i mostly do i fish for uh bass   okay   down here and uh i  dont get to do as much as id like to but uh i i really enjoy i dont like fishing on big lakes but uh   umhum sure   on the small ponds where you can pretty much cover the whole pond in an afternoon or something   sure for the different areas yeah   right   yeah and basically big lake small lake it doesnt matter to me um preference wise to fish for the best if youre going to eat what you are going to catch is pan fish um ive caught you know are northern and and pipes and uh northern pipes and other walleyes and things like that and preferably to me the meat isnt that great id rather have the blue gills the sunnies the crappies the perch um to me theyre better tasting so i always seem to go fishing for the smaller um smaller fish versus the big fish       but um when i was growing up my father kind of introduced me to fly fishing and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and im sure that part of me would like to go back and do that its kind of like for trout fishing   umhum   and im sure someday ill probably get back but uh at the current time the most if i go fishing its basically with the worm at the end of the hook and i you know try to catch the small fish its its not for the big try to try to get the biggie so   yeah yeah i use a fly  quite a bit uh when i go bass fishing   umhum   when theyre hitting on the top of the water i i really like enjoy i ive never   sure its kind of fun i i mean its a continual movement and versus uh   yeah yeah   uh when you put that uh worm at the end of the hook you sit there and you wait and you wait and then you may move it a little bit just to say that hey you know theres something there but uh   umhum   uh with fly fishing youre constantly uh moving that uh you know your line and youre continually keeping it up and keeping it back down so   yeah and theres a skill in getting it to right where you want it   exactly exactly   so i really enjoy that   it takes a lot of patience and a lot of time to learn how to do it so   yeah   um but uh with my family uh  when we do got fishing uh my my daughters real small and she has not experienced fishing yet so id rather   umhum   you know get her into fishing with the worm at the end of the hook and hopefully catch some uh fish so   uhhuh yeah i had a chance to go to uh Alaska for six weeks last summer and did some salmon fishing up there and that was really uh   oh gosh yeah oh what an experience huh   yeah yeah that was and and it was   now that i wouldnt probably i im sure that they probably were very delicious tasty   oh yes um we we uh i think the best way i had it prepared was smoked   umhum umhum   and uh it was really good really good   yeah yeah   but they have   and it seems like   quite a few different varieties and uh um some are some are better than others   sure in the  in the salmon   yes   umhum   yeah   well ive also noticed i dont know the best time of the year for fishing uh in this area is right after the winter and the ice is been on and its real cold water   umhum   but it seems like if you go fishing like in the middle of the summer when its hot and humid uh the fish tastes  tastes fishy versus um when the water its just opened up from the ice and the water temperature is extremely cold   umhum   its almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you go ice fishing or when uh you know you go right towards the early spring part uh before summer hits because after summer whether the ponds here arent that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more people are out on the lakes and less maybe water like in the spring we have lots of rain coming in um theres a big difference in you know fishing too   umhum   which brings up another point point too as far as ice fishing thats uh way up here in the north here   yeah   thats uh thats a big thing too and i havent done that in a long time but thats enjoyable if you have the right setting and you have a little house to sit in there and uh   umhum   a little heater then its then its its good but uh if you have to sit out there in the blowing winds its not so great on a lake   yeah i bet   but anyway it was really good talking to you and uh have fun fishing   yeah i i didnt know uh i didnt know i thought they were only recording male voices they must have changed that   you know this is kind of funny um ive had nothing but male callers   uhhuh   um every time that ive placed a call its been with a male and im not quite sure if theyre taking uh   umhum   i think what theyre trying to do is get a lot of men and some women together  i was chosen the first time i went through in   umhum hum
