                                 Man on the Dark Side of the Moon                        I agree about one thing Bradley is one of the most compelling arguments forthe NBAs cancellation of the OldTimers Game Actually since the debateoccurred around twilight on this coast I experienced most of it on the radioand I thought Bradley was responding to coaching that he be slightly morepunchy in his delivery On the other hand when the subject of religion cameup he told precisely the same story in precisely the same words that he hadused on his oneonone on MSNBC the day before I know thats my fault forpaying attention            Im an admirer of Jim Carrey and Milos Forman I enjoyed Flynt aswell but mother nature hasnt made enough wild horses to get me to see a movieabout Andy Kaufman Having both seen him as an audience member and sharedstages with him I became convinced that he washow shall we put thisgentlymentally ill and that charging money to see him alternately irritateand infantilize his audiences was the modern equivalent of Bedlam Why theposthumous cult of Andy in Hollywood Heres a theory Kaufman acted out inarguably interesting ways the hostility toward the audience that most peoplein show business feel but try with varying degrees of success to conceal Heseemed to me to be part of the wave of people in comedy who learned the wronglesson from Albert Brooks In his standup and Tonight Show work Albertdemonstrated how you could delay the laugh really prolong the suspense andget a much better laugh at the end Andy and some of the SNL people tookthis to mean you could postpone the laugh forever            Man did you open a can of worms Now as for Hollywoods penchant forreleasing the classy movies as close to Oscar time as the rules and thecalendar allow I agree that the ravages of memory have a lot to do with itTheres also the fact the industry has developed a code that you cant releaseanything short on special effects in the summertime so adults and movies thatappeal to them arent welcome in the plexes until at least OctoberSemiserious or intelligently funny like Galaxy Quest  movies aroundthe Christmas break is at least a better cultural tradition than the one inBritain where Christmases are rated by whether the BBC had a good slate ofspecials and whose awful record made the Christmas No  list            See you at Andys Harry
