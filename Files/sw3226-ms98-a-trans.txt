                okay the topic of the conversation is national health insurance and the pros and cons and do i do we think that the government should finance it what is your opinion   i say yes   you say yes   yes mother lives in Florida and there are in her subdivision there are fifty percent Canadians who wont give up their Canadian citizenship because of the health insurance   i have heard someone else uh say that uh the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent   its wonderful   and one of the ways that theyre financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes   oh  well   this is evidently evidently this is one of the ways that theyre paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they dont have to pay out as many uh benefits on like lung cancer and things like this   well even if thats so you know really when you look at it they have full coverage they have HMO which you know after you get used to it its not too bad and uh everything is covered   yeah if   and we have so many people in the United States that we spend well in my family alone we spent four thousand dollars in July on medical bills   oh my word Lynn   insurance didnt cover a penny yeah   thats horrible   yes it is horrible   well were fortunate in that we so far knock on wood most of us have been relatively real healthy so we dont have a lot of medical bills   yeah but if uh if youre healthy its fine but i had two kids in the hospital in July   yeah but what worries me is the fact that i dont like the government telling me who i can see and who i cant see   yeah but you know Richardson School District has the HMO and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list   umhum are they   yeah   well i know that Greg uh James had it   McCullum is   i beg your pardon   McCullum is   yeah yeah i know that when James was with Continental Steel McCullum was part of that and and thats good but i also heard for instance like uh a friends daughter was on it through Texas Instruments and she was on that Kaiser Permanent   uhhuh   and they had screwed up her appointment and when she went in she had to take whichever doctor was available and they she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted   well but thats   but then again i guess you can even do that in McCullums   thats a screw up in an appointment you know im thinking going back to the days when i was pregnant   umhum   and i had two doctors and one was my favorite personality wise   uhhuh   but when i delivered Ronnie he was not on call the other guy delivered him   umhum well thats true and that still goes on   you know and that and you know if um i go to Townsend hes got a new partner   umhum   i go to both of them now you know i have no choice   right   you know because when i want to go if Doctor Howe or whatever his name is is on duty i go to him      well you know it uh how do you think were going to pay for it more and more taxes   well no we need to cut some of our spendings cut some of the fat off the top and whittle it down to the rest of us   i know that its getting to the point that the insurance doesnt pay that much on catastrophic illnesses   no   they dont pay anything on uh implants or transplants   no   and you know people are needing these and the average person cant afford you know a heart or a kidney on just their own   yeah but you known Ronnie in Austin went to a program and went to a social worker   uhhuh   and at the same token there is something because he can get his pills for two dollars when im paying fifteen on my medical insurance   good grief   and he can get free medical care but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing David   umhum   and so again you know we went through it Ronnies home tonight and we talked about it and said you know is it worth it yeah you know he pays forty five dollars a month for his prescriptions where he could pay six dollars   hum umhum umhum   so there are programs you know if you get on Medicare or Medicaid or one of those   thats very true well i know they have the Medicaid you know for those that have trouble and i know that like we have the uh prescription cards which thats helped bunches   yeah   and wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health or wonder if theyre wanting it   thats what i read   that they are wanting
