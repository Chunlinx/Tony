advertisements suggesting thathomosexuality is a curable disorder are distasteful to most voters agreealmost all the commentariat Conventional wisdom is that the conservatives whofunded the campaign intend to mobilize conservative voters and to raise moneyfor conservative candidates Kristol notes that the ads are correct in onesense A small number of people have indeed practiced then left the
