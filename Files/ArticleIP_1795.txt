                                 Forgive and Forget            The dress the dress Holdyour horses for the dress Ill get to it later            First the new Flytrapmotto brought to you by kindly inquisitor Sen Orrin Hatch We are aforgiving people            AsFlytrap II enters Week II it is segueing gracefully into the second stage ofscandal The initial glee of Clintons enemies has matured into thoughtfulmagnanimity The sound of young conservatives baying for DNA has subsided Iflast weeks theme was high dudgeon this weeks will be highmindedness TheRepublicans new strategy seems to be Possibly Forgive and MaybeForget            The strategy which Hatch Sen Arlen Specter Bob Novakand others hinted at over the weekend seems to go like this            Thepresident is trapped and everyone else is embarrassed The only remedy is apresidential mea culpa or rather since the ones pushing theculpa are not the person who would actually apologize a tuaculpa  If Clinton admits his affair to the grand jury and the Americanpublic explains that he lied to protect his daughter and wife and apologizeswith sufficient breadth andthis is importantabjectness then well wellprobably forgive him and call off the dogs On Meet the Press  Hatchsaid that he and House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde who would superviseimpeachment proceedings are inclined to be forgiving unless of course thereis evidence of other high crimes Other Republicans he implied could also bebighearted            Any time I find myself agreeing with Hatchand Novak I grab my wallet and the cynic in me says this magnanimitymay have been arrived at only after much jujitsu with public opinion polls TheForgive and Forget strategy has this virtue for Republicans It is the only waytheyre going to win a clean PR victory The polls are impossible for themSurveys have been jiggered and rejiggered to find some way any way  percentof Americans would back impeachment No luck The best effort so far was aWall Street Journal poll that found that  percent of Americansupfrom  percent last monthwould favor holding impeachment hearings ifClinton had an affair and perjured himself This is a number made absurd by thefact that  A  percent rise is hardly a tidal wave  in no universe is percent a majority  impeachment hearings are not impeachment and  similarpolls registered impeachment support at  percent or  percent This does nota winning issue make            The onlypoll that Ive heard about that makes any sense which may be the one the GOPis reading is the ABC News survey I think saying that  percent ofAmericans would clear Clinton if he makes a clean breast of it            Whether theyve reached their conclusion for cynical oridealistic reasons Hatch and Co do seem to have hit on the only solution tothis mess the only outcome that will punish Clinton adequately satisfy hispersecutors enough to quiet them and save us from two more years of thishorror All this assumes the allegations are true Insert usual caveats heretill Aug  DNA testing by the FBI unreliable witness etc            Why would Clinton agree toapologize             It would shock no one anddisappoint few to find out that Clinton and Lewinsky did have an affair despitehis earlier claims             Clinton has the rhetoricalgrace to pull off such an apology in a way that doesnt seem phony hell blameit on his own big heart his fierce desire not to hurt wife and child            And mostimportant  An apology cuts off Starrs investigations at the knees Withoutan apology Clinton is doomed to enervating fratricidal interminableimpeachment hearings An apology would prevent them The Flytrap investigationis the only part of Starrs work that America a understands and b actuallycares about Would an admission of lying about Monica weaken Clintons claimsin the other Starr matters I doubt it After a mea culpa  the public orCongress are unlikely to muster much enthusiasm for chasing Clinton through thedull impenetrable thickets of Whitewater Travelgate and Filegate Even ifRepublicans decide later that they dont actually forgive and forget it may betoo late An apology could wipe away all the scandals but campaign finance            There is no sign yet that the administration istempted by mea culpa Forgive and Forget All leaks out of the WhiteHouse suggest that the president is sticking to his denial Lanny Davis theclosest thing to an official source who is talking deflected the idea of anapology when quizzed about it But if the administration isnt buying itsallies are Democrats are matching Republicans big heart for big heart BarneyFrank the presidents best friend in the House has suggested that Clintonshould fess up if he had an affair as has Leon Panetta On This Week George Stephanopoulos all but implored his former boss to cut his losses andapologize            Will the White House comearound If I were a betting man I would wager that during this week otherprominent Democratsas they did when Clinton hesitated over Starrssubpoenawill make increasingly obvious pleas for Clinton to apologize Andunless the dress is a red navy blue herring I would wager that Clinton willlisten Surely hes willing to tarnish the legacy he cares so much about inorder to save his presidency            Tomorrow more on thedress
