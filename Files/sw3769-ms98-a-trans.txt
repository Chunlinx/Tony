        okay its pressed are you still there okay     im ready   so whats uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner   oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere   umhum   and of course good food thats always thats always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something   um um that sounds pretty   just to relax you know because i dont really go out to dinner that much so   yeah umhum well we dont go out to dinner that much either we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that but   uhhuh   i definitely want to go to a place thats nice and clean you know   right   um ive been to some thats been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and   oh   everything you know but i try to get one thats nice and clean and then i like to you know good food and good service   yeah   so   yeah where you dont feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want and   yeah right right right so is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano   well nearby were almost in Dallas were just north of Dallas   umhum   so we have quite a bit between us and there its about ten miles   umhum umhum   and there is all kinds of restaurants and i had one that was a favorite for a long time and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and then it finally went out of business   um   so but it was really nice it had a fireplace and   um that sounds beautiful   yeah it was really nice they had entertainment sometimes and you you could just really relax there and enjoy it   umhum umhum umhum umhum well  this is only a little small city um we have uh   but its gone   excuse me i didnt think my coughing would come back anyhow we have only like one uh restaurant thats kind of nice you know they have prime rib on uh weekends   uhhuh   and then then they have about six miles from here is called a little city called Wesley and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food and the atmosphere there is really really nice   oh thats nice   so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away   uhhuh right   but uh we dont have any fast foods here in this small city   thats probably very fortunate for you do you have kids     do i have kids well i have a son but hes grown up   yeah oh because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know and now shes graduated to two cheeseburgers so somethings happened here but but um   umhum   you know McDonalds is definitely at the top of her list and i hate these places   yeah all the kids seem to love McDonalds dont they you know   so uhhuh they do and i dont think theres an ounce of nutritional value in  anything they have so   no no im sure there isnt   so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and its really its tempting when you come home from work and youre tired and   umhum   you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and its not healthy and   i know its   i i really got into that habit for a while but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy   yeah yeah umhum   so   well lets see what else can we talk about   well hows California today   oh its foggy and cold here   is it thats what ive heard yeah   umhum umhum yeah its   yeah have you always lived there   i came from Iowa when i was sixteen   oh   so ive lived out in California for a long long time yeah i like it real well   and you like it yeah weve been   we used to live in Oakland so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there   oh yeah   you know but uh then i quit work and everything and i moved bought a house i had a condo in Oakland so right in Chinatown so we went to a lots of restaurants and Chinese restaurants   uhhuh oh that would be fun   and they were really good i really miss them   yeah do you miss living there   you know uh no i really dont miss living there i just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while you know   no yeah yeah   but um as far as missing living there no its close enough if i wanted to go there to San Francisco for dinner or something why you know   hum   an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but uh   yeah uhhuh   have you ever been to California   oh yeah i i go all the time   oh really   yeah well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she um is world champion twirler   um umhum   and her coach is in California so she went there for six years   um   so i went out a lot with her   umhum umhum   and uh yeah i know California pretty well and i love it   umhum yeah i guess   and we tug back and forth whos gonna move but i think hes gonna move because im the person with more to lose here i have my twelve year old in school   umhum umhum   and shes happy shes always lived here in the south and ive had my house so   umhum   ive too much to lose
