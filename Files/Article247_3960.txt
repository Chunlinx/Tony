                                 Fallout From the Microsoft Trial                        Some quickly jotteddown thoughts on Judge Thomas Penfield Jacksonsfindings of fact in the Microsoft antitrust trial a ruling handed down aboutan hour ago             The press is treating Jacksons chief conclusionsthat Microsoft hasmonopoly power in the PCoperatingsystems market that Microsoft has used thatpower to harm competitors in other markets and that using its power in thatway has harmed consumersas surprising But the real surprise may be thatanyones surprised given Jacksons attitude and behavior throughout the caseWhile the trial was going on in fact you would have been hardpressed to finda single reporter covering it who thought that Microsoft was going to win Butsince the trial has ended the media was apparently seized by the convictionthat Jackson would be temperate in his decision He wasnt             The stock market on the other hand seems to have been taking theimplications of this decision into account for some time Even as the Nasdaqhas rallied strongly in the last couple of weeks Microsofts stock has beentreading water In fact its trading about where it was back in April Now inthe wake of the ruling the stock did sell off a bit in afterhours tradingbut markets are all about anticipation and the stock market appears to havealready anticipated something like the ruling Jackson produced             Thats not to downplay the onesidedness of the findings of factAlthough Jackson did credit Microsoft with helping accelerate the expansion ofthe Internet and with benefiting consumers via innovation in other cases theweight of his ruling is on the side of the government In particular hisruling treats Microsoft as a textbook example of the idea that a monopolist canuse its control of one market to give itself control over another and that itcan use the profitsimmense profits Jackson calls themreaped as a resultof its monopoly to fund the domination of another            These happen to be ideas that many academic economists are deeply skepticalof since if it makes longterm economic sense for Microsoft to expand intosay browsers it should also make longterm economic sense for someone else tofund Microsofts competitors But Jackson is essentially saying that Microsoftis too powerfulbecause of its control of the operatingsystem marketand tooprofitable for anyone else to enter the fray against it In fact near the endof his ruling he explicitly says that Microsofts power has limitedtechnological investment that would otherwise have taken place             Without sounding like a Microsoft shill here and yes                  Slate                is published by Microsoft the findings offact do seem as if theyre describing a world that doesnt quite exist anymoreThe advent of Linux the continued penetration of Java the merger between AOLand Netscape and the rapid growth in PDAs and nondesktop applications All ofthese are phenomena that dont fit into the picture of a computing world inwhich domination of the PC operating system translates into dominationelsewhere Jacksons ruling was of necessity backwardlooking since he hadto decide what had happened But insofar as he remains guided by a PCcentricdefinition of computing its not clear whatever remedies he suggests willreally conform to the way things are rather than the way things were            One of the odd things about the centrality of the browser war to theantitrust trial in fact is that the browser itself now seems about asimportant and distinctive as something like Wordpad which is to say not veryimportant at all Once it seemed like he who controlled the browser wouldcontrol the Internet Now if anyone controls the Internet its the portalsThe unanswerable question of course is whether this would have happened hadthere been no antitrust trial             As everyone is pointing out the findings of fact do not tell us howJackson will read the relevant laws in the case thats Phase  or whatremedies he may prescribe Phase  And it certainly seems possible thatMicrosoft and the Justice Department will reach a settlement Some have evensuggested that Jacksons strong language was intended to spur just anagreement although one might have thought a more balanced opinion would havehad a better effect in that direction            Nonetheless there is at least one thing worth thinking about going forwardYou could read Jacksons ruling as essentially implying that Microsoftsmonopoly over the PC operating system means that any expansion into othercontiguous marketsand most computing markets can still be construed as insome way contiguous to the PCis an unacceptable exercise of monopoly powerthen what kind of business can Microsoft legally pursue Does Jackson secretlythink that Microsoft shouldnt ever have been able to branch out into desktopapplications like Word and Excel In other words does control of theoperatingsystem market really preclude a company from seeking to compete inothers If Jacksons answer to that last question is really yes which wouldbe I think a startling answer then we may in fact be talking about theATT decision all over again And that really would be a surprise Butthen ATT settled And after this ruling Microsoft may decide its betteroff in the appellate courts after all
