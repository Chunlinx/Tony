                                 Folk Jews            Bernard Malamud was a writerwith a real genius for evoking the cosmic and the transcendent but reading hisComplete Stories makes me think that transcendence has its limitsMalamud was born in Brooklyn in  and died in  and he grew up in thekind of immigrant environment in which little children because they are thenativeborn half of a foreignborn neighborhood are obliged to shield theirvulnerable elders from the contempt of the outside world It was a backgroundas I imagine it that led naturally to the Malamudian insight that visible lifeis a veil behind which can be glimpsed by means of sympathetic insight avaster and more beautiful reality            Theheroes of his early stories from the s and s tend to be poorinarticulate shopkeepers and workers tailors grocers shoemakerscensustakersMalamud almost always identified his characters by professionin a bow to the proletarianism of the s New York Jews mostly whose roughouter appearances suddenly fall away to reveal inner souls of the purestlyrical passion Or else he writes about strange griefstricken lonely soulsperhaps halfmad who seem to have been picked up like leaves by someinexplicable wind and blown around the world until they attach themselvesrandomly to the first unlucky person who comes their way Sometimes the authorhimself seems to float upward on a gust of wind into the airy zones of fablewhich seem to have been his instinctive home            In The Jewbird a melancholy black bird named Schwartzlands on the balcony of a New York family and insists on being taken care ofasad nuisance of a talking bird fleeing God knows what tragedies the birdsays Gevalt  a pogrom and complains about antiSemeetsto whichone of the family members replies What kind of antiSemites bother a birdA Talking Horse in the story of that name turns out to be a halfman orcentaur named Abramovitz cruelly disguised as an authentic horse and forced toentertain circus audiences with pathetic jokes The fabulist images arewonderful and mysterious precisely because in Malamuds hands they seemperfectly believable an effortless demonstration that the grotesqueries ofworkaday existence are merely masks            Hesketches his stories usually with a few bold colors and fewer details as in aRaphael Soyer painting His language is notable mostly for theoniony taste of Yiddish when it is appropriate Who comes on Friday night toa man that he has guests to spoil him his supper But you come away fromthese colors and tastes with the feeling that Jewishness for Malamud is morethan ethnic that the weird little events in his tales correspond to unseendoings in the cosmos of an Old World folkJudaism In one of his later storiesThe Silver Crown from  a high school teacher visits a raggedywonderrabbi in the rundown Bronx who builds a miracle crown for nearly And though the schoolteacher concludes that the wonderrabbi is a con artistwe ourselves the readers are not so sure The talking Jewbirds and centaursthe wonderrabbis and the magic silver crownsall seem to hint at largertranscendent truths            But where can these larger truths be foundSometimes Malamud pointed to art especially to painting and sculpture whichhe elevated into an ideal He devoted a number of his later stories to anartist named Fidelman who goes to live in Italy which move occasions all kindsof theorizing about art and its meaning But the effect is gassy            Form may be and often isthe content of Art            You dont say            I do indeed            Other times he looked tolove and tried to put a little flesh on his spiritual creations in an effortto endow his poor suffering Jews with at least a few shreds of a romanticlife            But inthese stories especially the later ones he seems to have been unable to getbeyond his own commonplace fantasies about prostitutes and s miniskirtsFidelman takes up with a prostitute in A Pimps Revenge a student confessesher hooker past in A Choice of Profession a father trails after hisstreetwalker daughter in Gods Wrath a doctor imagines his neighbor as asemiprostitute in the story In Retirementit gets to be a little muchThe writing leers for want of any better way to conjure a sexual attractionMalamuds daughter Janna Malamud Smith has just now brought out a book calledPrivate Matters In Defense of the Personal Life  in which she saysthat coming across a sexual scene in one of her fathers novels she put thebook down in embarrassment out of daughterly modesty But even a nondaughtercould feel that way I reached a point in reading The Complete Storieswhere the arrival of a new young woman in any given story made me roll myeyesnot because Malamuds masculine reveries are particularly scandalous butbecause the reveries seem scandalously inadequate to the cosmic hintings of hisother stories            One of his first stories of love The First Seven Yearsfrom Partisan Review in  strikes me as nearly perfect though Apoor immigrant Jew works as an assistant shoemaker patiently waiting for themaster shoemakers daughter to grow old enough to marry The assistantshoemaker is another of Malamuds weirdly insistent lonely soulsimpelledwho knows why to devote himself to a hopeless love still wincing from thehorrors of Europe which he has not entirely escaped inarticulate yetbursting with passion if only his boss the master shoemaker will deign tolisten            You are crazy the bosssays to him about his love for the girl She will never marry a man so old andugly like you But she will of course which is going to be too bad Thestory is moving It arouses wonder Biblical overtonesthe tale of Jacob andLabanbubble up from Malamuds simplicity In his introduction Robert GirouxMalamuds editor quotes Cynthia Ozick who said of Malamud Is he an Americanmaster Of course Which is rightsometimes            It was inevitable thatMalamuds editor would bring out a Complete Stories  Completeness is notalways a virtue though The lesser stories in the Complete edition casta wrong light on the greater ones Malamud the true American Master wrote inmy estimation a volume slightly different from The Complete Stories and the name of that slightly different volume ought to be more cautiouslySelected Stories
