                    Background        Respiratory syncytial virus RSV belongs to the        Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxovirodae family of        enveloped singlestranded negative sense RNA viruses RSV        infection of the lower respiratory tract cells results in        cell death and sloughing into the lumen of the respiratory        tree Worldwide RSV is the leading cause of infant        mortality from respiratory infections and is so highly        contagious that by age two nearly all children have been        infected RSV infection in infancy cause severe        bronchiolitis and pneumonia and may predispose children to        the subsequent development of asthma the most common        chronic illness of childhood     Many studies have        indicated that chemokines can play an important role in the        onset and severity of asthma and it has been shown that RSV        infection of lung epithelial cells increases chemokine        production although the mechanisms involved are largely        unknown               The chemotactic cytokines or chemokines compose a        large superfamily of small structurally related        polypeptides that play important roles in host defense by        recruiting specific subsets of leukocytes to sites of        inflammation and injury     Chemokines have been        associated with a number of inflammatory diseases and        conditions including asthma sepsis inflammatory bowel        disease and adult respiratory distress syndrome              The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two major        groups based on the position of the first two of        fourconserved cysteine residues at the amino terminus        which are either adjacent CC subfamily or separated by        one amino acid CXC subfamily The CXC chemokines such as        IL were originally identified as potent activators and        chemoattractants for neutrophils whereas the CC chemokines        such as MCP and RANTES mostly attract monocytes and        eosinophils respectively     Chemokines are secreted        in a stimulusand cell typespecific manner                 and are regulated primarily at the level of gene        transcription           The        transcriptional promoters of IL RANTES and MCP contain        binding sites for the redoxresponsive transcription factor        NFB which has been shown to be important for their        regulation by viral infections and cytokines                               We previously demonstrated that the chemokines IL        MCP and RANTES are differentially regulated in A        airway epithelial cells        To further        elucidate the mechanisms of chemokine expression in A        we have compared the induction of IL MCP and RANTES by        RSV infection with that of TNF Our findings suggest that        RSV induction of chemokine gene expression involves a        redoxsensitive NFB signaling mechanism that differs from        that mediated by TNF and involving predominantly the Rel A        subunit of NFB                    Materials and methods                  Materials          Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium DMEM fetal bovine

      As shown in Fig  RSV infection of A epithelial          cells induces the production and secretion of the          chemokines IL MCP and RANTES In A epithelial          cells substantial MCP was constitutively expressed          whereas little or no spontaneous IL or RANTES was          detected However upon RSV infection MOI   a          significant increase in chemokine production and          secretion was observed  hr postinfection for each of          the chemokines          To determine whether the chemokine induction was          mediated by increased chemokine gene expression we          assessed the kinetics of mRNA synthesis by chemokine          specific RNase protection A cells were infected with          RSV MOI   or stimulated with TNF  ngml and          total RNA isolated at various times posttreatment over a           hr time course As shown in Fig  RSV rapidly          induced IL and MCP with steadystate mRNA readily          detected as early as  hr and continued to increase over          the  hr time course In contrast RANTES mRNA was not          detected until  hrs post infection after which its          expression rapidly increased also reaching a maximum at           hrs The RSV induction kinetics differed dramatically          from the induction kinetics for TNF in the same          experiment Whereas RSV induction of the chemokines did          not reach a maximum until  hrs TNF induction was          maximal between  and  hrs and was either unchanged or          lower at  hrs postinfection          The magnitude of induction also differed between TNF          and RSV infection In general TNF was a stronger inducer          of chemokine expression This difference was also          reflected in the amount of chemokine secreted from the          cells data not shown Together these data indicate          that RSV infection of A epithelial cells induces          chemokine expression with distinct kinetics suggesting          the mechanism of RSV induction differs from that of          proinflammatory cytokines                          NFkappaB inhibitors differentially effect RSV and          TNFalpha induction of chemokine expression          IL MCP and RANTES gene expression are regulated          by the redox responsive transcription factor NFB                             The          NFB signaling pathways have been shown to be          differentially affected by antioxidants and          glucocorticoid steroids     To determine whether RSV          and TNF induction of chemokine expression might be          mediated by different NFB signaling pathways we          pretreated A cells with the glutathione precursor          NacetylLcysteine NAC or the synthetic glucocorticoid          dexamethasone DEX Twentyfour hours post infection          total RNA was isolated and steady state mRNA expression          analyzed by chemokine specific RNase protection As shown          in Fig  the two inhibitors had very different effects          on chemokine gene expression Most strikingly RSV          induced chemokine expression was more sensitive to NAC          whereas TNF induced chemokine expression was conversely          more sensitive to DEX Thus NAC preferentially inhibited          chemokine expression induced by RSV while DEX          predominantly inhibited chemokine expression induced by          TNF                          Differential inhibition of TNFalpha and RSV induced          NFkappaB          NFB binds to the chemokine promoter as either homo          or heterodimers composed of Rel A p and NFB p          Initially we detected TNF and RSV induction of NFB by          EMSA KA Roebuck and LR Carpenter unpublished data but          because multiple gel shift complexes were induced it was          not possible to distinguish the individual contributions          of Rel A and p to the formation of these complexes          Therefore to assess the induction of the Rel A and p          subunits individually in A nuclear cell extracts we          used a subunit specific NFB binding ELISA system that          utilizes antiRel A and antip antibodies As shown in          Fig  Rel A and p subunits of NFB are          differentially expressed and induced in A epithelial          cells In untreated cells no Rel A solid bars was          detectable whereas in resting cells constitutive levels          of p were observed open bars suggesting that          unstimulated A epithelial cells contain p          homodimers which with regard to transcriptional activity          have been shown to be functionally inert or inhibitory          In contrast cells stimulated by TNF Fig A or          infected by RSV Fig B markedly induced Rel A the          transcriptionally active subunit of NFB In addition          TNF was also able to induce p by about fold whereas          RSV increased the constitutive p level by only about           The induction of Rel A and p were specific since          competition with either wild type or mutant consensus          NFB oligonucleotide respectively inhibited or not the          RSV and TNF induced binding activity These data          demonstrate that TNF is a potent inducer of both Rel A          and p whereas RSV primarily induces the Rel A subunit          of NFB          To determine whether RSV and TNF activate NFB          differently we examined the effects of NAC and DEX on          Rel A and p binding activity As shown in Fig  Rel A          and p subunits are differentially inhibited by NAC and          DEX which have been shown to inhibit NFB by distinct          mechanisms Both NAC and DEX were unable to inhibit TNF          induction of either Rel A or p In contrast in RSV          infected cells both DEX and NAC inhibited Rel A and p          binding activity However the inhibitory effects were          most striking for Rel A suggesting the inhibitors          primarily target the RSV induction of Rel A          The differential effects of NAC on TNF and RSV          induced NFB binding activity correlated with its          effects on chemokine gene expression Fig  and protein          secretion data not shown suggesting that RSV induces          IL MCP and RANTES through redoxsensitive NFB          binding complexes DEX also showed differential effects          on NFB binding activity with DEX preferentially          inhibiting RSV induction of NFB However the effects          of DEX on NFB binding induced by TNF did not correlate          with its effects on chemokine expression suggesting in          TNF activation of chemokine gene expression DEX targets          another mechanism of chemokine induction not involving          NFB                            Discussion        In this study we examined the role of NFB in the        activation of chemokine gene expression in response to TNF        and RSV infection The inhibitor studies correlating        chemokine gene expression and NFB binding activity        indicate that RSV in contrast to TNF induces IL MCP        and RANTES expression in A epithelial cells through a        redoxsensitive NFB signaling pathway that appears to        involve predominately Rel A IL MCP and RANTES are        known redox regulated genes and our results are consistent        with the findings that oxidant tone can regulate chemokine        gene expression in RSV infected airway epithelial cells                     NFB activation is controlled by its inhibitory protein        IB which when phosphorylated on ser and ser marks it        for degradation by the S proteosome complex Thus IB is        a potential regulatory target for the differential        induction of NFB Although we have not directly examined        the role of IB Fiedler         et al     have reported        differential effects of RSV and TNF on IB activity in        A epithelial cells In addition Bitko and Barik           have demonstrated that another IB protein IB may        also contribute via a redoxsensitive pathway to NFB        activation by RSV        In addition to NFB dependent regulation there appears        to also be NFB independent activation of chemokine        expression since DEX inhibited TNF induced chemokine        expression but not NFB binding activity Along these        lines it has been shown that RSV activation of chemokine        gene promoters involves multiple inducible transcription        factors including AP      which is also a redox        sensitive transcription factor important in chemokine gene        expression       AP can also be inhibited by DEX        and has been shown to cooperate with NFB to mediate RSV        induction of IL             The differential effects of NAC and DEX on chemokine        gene expression and NFB activation suggest that the        mechanisms of RSV and TNF activation of NFB and        chemokine expression differ possibly involving distinct        NFB signaling mechanisms TNF rapidly and potently        activates Rel A and p subunits of NFB through a        kinasemediated phosphorylation cascade involving a high        molecular mass signaling complex called the IKK complex            TNF activation of the multiprotein IKK complex        results in the serine phorsphorylation of IB and the        subsequent activation of NFB            Consistent with the idea of RSV and TNF activating        distinct NFB signaling pathways we found that the NFB        inhibitor NAC had differential effects on chemokine gene        expression In contrast to TNF RSV induced chemokine        expression was sensitive to NAC particularly the Rel A        p subunit NAC is an antioxidant thiol that raises the        intracellular pool of glutathione the major redox        regulating mechanism in the A epithelial cell line            Interestingly it has been reported that NAC can have        differential effects on NFB binding activity suggesting        only a subset of NFB binding complexes are redox        sensitive     Moreover it has been shown that NAC        inhibits Rel Ap heterodimers but not p homodimers and        can inhibit NFB binding to only certain variant B        elements which presumably interact with distinct redox        sensitive NFB binding complexes     These        observations are consistent with our findings that indicate        NAC predominantly inhibits Rel A homodimers since that was        the major NFB subunit induced by RSV infection of A        cells        Consistent with RSV and TNF inducing functionally        distinct NFB binding complexes AP was recently shown        to be the preferential cooperative partner with NFB in        RSVinduced IL expression     whereas in        TNFinduced expression NFB cooperates preferentially        with NFIL       Apparently the        stimulusspecific gene regulation of chemokines is complex        involving differential cooperativity of redox sensitive and        redox resistant NFB complexes with other transcription        factors to form unique higher order transcription        complexes                    Conclusions        Taken together our data indicate that RSV in contrast        to the cytokine TNF activate NFB and chemokine gene        expression through a redox sensitive NFB signaling        pathway involving predominately Rel A                    Competing interests        None declared
