                                  Lose One for the Gipper            During the past few yearsRepublicans have dallied with social conservatism libertarianism andGingrichian revolutionary conservatism Now they are flirting with a neworrather an olddoctrine nostalgism            The GOP has been tryingto recapture Ronald Reagans magic ever since Reagan went west in  So itsnot surprising that at this moment of low ebb Republicans are again evokingthe Gipper They have placed two early s Reagan issues at the heart of theirplatform acrosstheboard tax cuts and a national missile defense            The tax cut notion enthralls the partys top echelonespecially conservatives Senate and House leaders pushed a  percent incometax cut as the centerpiece of their legislative plan until they abandoned theidea Monday Last week Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott trekked to MacombMichthe wellspring of Reagan Democratsto flog the tax cut Presidentialcandidate John Kasich is touting the income tax cut as the key to his campaignSteve Forbes Gary Bauer and Bob Smith are equally enthusiastic Someone hasalso wound up the Jack Kemp doll which declares the  percent proposal timidand pitiful Tax rates Kemp says should be cut back to Reagan levels DanQuayle too is dissatisfied with  percent off He would slash rates percent Even as I write this a letter from the Heritage Foundation has beendropped on my desk It says the tax cut idea harkens back to the supplysidedays of President Ronald Reagan And not a minute too soon            The national missiledefense has similarly claimed a top spot on the GOPs agenda Conservativesbegan talking about the Star Wars revival last summer when a blueribboncommission concluded that the United States was increasingly vulnerable tomissile strikes by rogue states The enthusiasm has mushroomed since NorthKorea shot a test missile over Japan Lott calls missile defense one of ourmost critical legislative priorities Bauer is making it one of his leadissues When I saw him speak at a conservative conference in January themissile defense exhortation was his biggest applause line Quayle and Smithtoo are making missile defense a campaign priority The Republican NationalCommittee is obsessed with the topic berating the Clinton administrationweekly for failing to deploy a shield            The clinging to these two ides fixes is in someways a Republican failure to accept victory Reagans tax cuts and tax reformwere Republican triumphs They lowered marginal rates from ludicrously highlevels to more reasonable ones and they spurred the economic expansion of thes as well as the deficits of the s Star Wars helped win the Cold Warconvincing Mikhail Gorbachev that the Soviet Union could not compete            This Reaganitefundamentalism is not ideology It is faith If he believed it it mustbe so But the problem with ides fixes is that they are fixed Tax cutsand missile defense circa  are not wrong ideas They are insignificantones Like the Democrats of the s who campaigned on the New Deal Republicans are refurbishing bygone notions for an age that doesnt want themIn  Reagan cut taxes to spur consumption and revive a sickly economyToday Americans are consuming voraciously and the economy could hardly befitter In  Reagan funded Star Wars to intimidate the Soviet Union Todaywe dont need a national missile defense to defend against Russia Nor is amissile shield a wise investment in the battle against rogues Terrorists aremore likely to park a bombfilled truck on Pennsylvania Avenue than lob amissile Better to spend the billions on intelligence and nonproliferation            What must be especially frustrating to GOP strategists isAmericans indifference to this Reaganism Republican dogma says you can nevererr by offering to cut taxes But Americans have greeted the tax cut schemeswith a shrug Democrats have successfully and accurately painted theacrosstheboard tax cut proposal as regressive Clinton has countered it withtargeted interest group tax cuts child care senior care health care offsetby targeted tax increases tobacco Republicans would spend much of thesurplus on a tax break Clinton would spend it on Social Security debtrepayment and Medicare Only about  percent of Americans favor spending thesurplus on a tax cut while about  percent favor spending it on SocialSecurity or debt repayment Polls have found that when it comes to taxesAmericans trust Democrats formerly tax and spend Democrats far morethan Republicans and Clinton far more than congressional Republicans Clintonand the Democrats have won the tax issue so completely that congressionalRepublican leaders have now abandoned the  percent tax cut plan Instead theyare pushing marriage penalty tax relief The presidential candidates ofcourse are still clutching to the acrosstheboard cuts            On missile defense too Clinton has outfoxed theGOP He killed Star Wars in  but the budget he introduced several weeksago proposes  billion for missile defense research This is part of anenormous proposed increase in military spending The missile defense money haspulled the rug out from under Republicans leaving them with the flimsiest ofcriticisms The president has delayed the decision on whether to actuallydeploy a missile defense until June  The administration wants time toconduct R  D and renegotiate the ABM treaty with Russia The treaty bansnational missile defenses Republicans have been reduced to insisting thatClinton declare now that he will deploy a defense In essence the GOPargument is that we need to decide now instead of  months from now whetherto deploy something that doesnt exist today wont exist in  months andprobably wont exist until  This is hardly enough to base a presidentialcampaign on            There is another reason besides nostalgia whyRepublicans started talking about tax cuts and missile defense Clinton hasalready coopted Republicans on welfare family values the death penaltycrime etc Taxes and missile defense were among the few issues he hadntstolen But now hes the one whos got the tax plan Americans likeHes the one who has set aside billions for a missile defense that wontwork No wonder archReaganaut Paul Weyrich is urging conservatives to give upon politics They cant even outReagan Clinton
