                                 CIA Home Videos            The CIA made headlines twicelast week The first wave of publicity was of a familiar and negative typeDeclassified documents revealed new details about Operation Mongoose thecampaign to murder and otherwise annoy Fidel Castro Besides the infamous toxiccigars and powder intended to make the dictators beard fall out the agencydeveloped a killer scuba suit and poisoninjecting pens None of it worked            Thesecond wave of publicity was more novel and positive It was about a video theCIA released as the FBI concluded its criminal investigation into the TWAFlight  disaster The minute film was intended to bolster the FBIsconclusion that the explosion was not the result of a terrorist attack byexplaining why eyewitnesses might have mistaken the airplanes midairdisintegration for a missile attack            Here then were the two CIAs the ineptly diabolicalagency of old vs the chastened competent and versatile one of today Thefolks at Langley whose run of luck in recent years has resembled that of theMir spacecraft must be hoping for just such a contrast to form in the publicmind But while the agency certainly has changed for the better it would bepremature to quit worrying about what its up to The new userfriendly CIAgives pause in new ways            Watch thedocudramastyle video and youll understand why At the beginning the CIAgreat seal appears and dissolves Spooky music is heard of the type most oftenused as background for cheesy shows about paranormal phenomena An anonymousnarrator recounts the facts of the July  disaster and says that FBIinvestigators were especially concerned with dozens of eyewitnesses who thoughtthey saw a missile At the request of the FBI CIA weapons analysts lookedinto this possibility the narrator explains Onscreen is a windowless roomfull of CIA officials One in a tie and vest motions toward a display boardThe others in shirtsleeves look on attentively The CIAs conclusion Theeyewitnesses did not see a missile the narration continues What theseeyewitnesses saw was in fact the Boeing  in various stages of crippledflight With animation the film recreates the way the analysts think theairplane disintegrated It then reconciles this scenario with the testimony ofwitnesses            This account is probably the best explanationfor the inevitable discrepancies in the evidence about what happened to Flighta subject with which I have no obsession But the video is nonetheless abizarre artifact on several levels Consider the several scenes of CIAanalysts working on the case There are two possibilities here Either theseportrayals are unacknowledged dramatic simulations or the CIA spent a lot oftime and money documenting its own inner workings The former alternativesuggests that old habits of deception die hard The latter suggests that theCIAs publicrelations goals for the Flight  assignment were fullyintegrated into the investigation itself In fact both things are probablytrue            Thestrangest thing about the film is that it is supposed to dispel paranoidtheoriesand that the CIA made it From the outset of the investigation theFBI has been saying convincingly that a missile hit was a nearimpossibilityMost journalists and outside experts accept this When Pierre Salinger proposedthat the US military shot the plane down he was widely assumed to be off hisrocker The CIA video is directed then at the small minority of conspiracybuffs who do not accept the official explanation In other words it isdirected at the last people in the world who would ever believe anything theCIA said At Flight  sites on the Web as you would expect the video hasmerely added fuel to the fire Getting the CIA to reassure paranoiacs is likehiring Michael Milken to run the Securities and Exchange Commission            More troublesome is the CIAs unprecedented role aspurveyor of the official government line Since its creation in  theagency has always had a dual function It is half neutral analyst providingbackground for policymakers and half clandestine arm of US foreign policyThis split is built into the structure of the agency which separates itsdirectorate of intelligence from its directorate of operations The CIA wantsthe film to look like a product of the analysts Its slick production valueshowever suggest something of a debt to the operations directorate which haslong experience at spreading disinformation abroad Because this is the CIAwell never know for sure or at least not for  years But it is alarmingto say the least if agents trained in lying abroad are now moonlighting athomeeven if theyre telling the truth this time The Voice of America andRadio Free Europe are prohibited from broadcasting to the United Statesspecifically because Congress didnt want the governments propaganda resourcestrained on Americans The oftviolated CIA charter forbids it from spying onAmericans It fails to ban domestic propagandizing only because no one everenvisioned such a role for the agency            So why isthe CIA doing this The answer goes beyond the urge for selfpromotion Sincethe Soviet Union fell apart the agency has been increasingly desperate tojustify its continued existence Though its side won the Cold War it didntget much credit As Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan has emphasized CIA analystswildly overestimated the Soviet economy and missed the impending Communistcollapse Meanwhile Aldrich Ames and Harold Nicholson were running amokMorale is reportedly low and career officials have been resigning in drovesThe CIA has been through five chiefs since             The latest director George Tenet hopes toprotect the agencys  staff and its billion budget a number onlyrecently declassified by orienting it around new internationalthreatsnarcotics trafficking terrorism and nuclear proliferation There aredebates about whether the CIA has an appropriate role in any of these areasThe military may be better suited to dealing with terrorists and weaponsNarcotics enforcement is primarily the role of the FBI and the Drug EnforcementAdministration In calling in the CIA to help on Flight  the FBI was makinga peace overture in a bitter ageold rivalry After seeing the video it mayregret this gesture James Kallstrom who directed the Flight investigation indicated at a press conference last week that he had somemisgivings about the film            You dont have to beconspiracy nut to worry about a huge organization with hightech espionagecapabilities and a criminal record looking around for something to do Thefriendly new CIA may mean well but it sort of makes you nostalgic for thespooks from the bad old days Right about now theyd be sending Saddam a boxof exploding berets
