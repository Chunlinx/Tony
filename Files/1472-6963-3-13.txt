                    Background        Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in        the United States    Each year more than         Americans experience new or recurrent myocardial infarction        or fatal coronary heart disease CHD About onethird of        these events will be fatal and approximately  of        these events will be a first myocardial infarction The        direct and indirect costs of CHD and stroke are estimated        to be  billion for     Fortunately there are a        number of interventions that can reduce the risk of CHD        events in patients with no previous history of CHD        including smoking cessation counseling hypertension        treatment aspirin prophylaxis and treatment of lipid        disorders               Systematic reviews and recent trials have found that        lipidlowering therapy with HMG coA reductase inhibitors        statins can reduce the relative risk of future CHD events        by approximately  and that this relative risk reduction        appears to be similar for patients with different levels of        CHD risk     These findings suggest that the absolute        benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the        patients baseline level of CHD risk Patients with a        previous history of cardiovascular disease CVD are at        high risk and generally warrant aggressive treatment        patients with no previous CVD history have a wide range of        underlying CHD risk and hence require individualized        decisions for optimal care In order to make effective and        efficient decisions about whether a patient without prior        CVD should receive lipidlowering drugs providers must        implicitly or explicitly consider the patients risk of        future CHD events        Previous research examining providers ability to        estimate cardiovascular risk has shown that providers        generally overestimate the absolute risk of CHD events but        are more accurate in their assessment of relative risk        reductions        If providers overestimate the        absolute risk of CHD events prior to treatment their        estimates of the absolute benefit of therapy may also be        inaccurate Previous studies examining this question have        only studied risk prediction for a limited number of        patient care scenarios making it difficult to examine how        specific patient characteristics or the degree of baseline        risk low medium or high risk affect risk prediction and        the amount or degree of overestimation        We sought to examine physicians ability to predict the        risk of CHD events and the effect of pharmacological        lipidlowering therapy for a wide range of primary        prevention scenarios by asking physicians at three academic        medical centers to complete a survey of  hypothetical        scenarios concerning patients with different levels of CHD        risk                    Methods                  Questionnaire Development          We used the Framingham risk equations    to          develop  primary prevention scenarios with year risk          of CHD events defined as new onset angina nonfatal or          fatal MI or sudden death from  to  per cent The          scenarios were balanced with regard to gender  male          patients  female patients and included  lowrisk          scenarios less than  risk of CHD events over  years           medium risk scenarios year risk of  and           highrisk scenarios year risk  Six of the          scenarios had one or no additional risk factors not          including age gender or lipid levels while the other           scenarios had  or more additional risk factors          The hypothetical patients were explicitly assumed           to not be taking aspirin or lipidlowering agents at          baseline  to not have responded to a trial of a          lowfat diet  to not be overweight and  to not          have a family history of early myocardial infarction We          did not specify the patients ethnicity as we did not          wish to examine its effect in this study          The questionnaire was pilot tested in two different          groups of primary care providers and preventive medicine          residents at one of the study sites and was revised based          on their feedback                          Study Subjects and Administration          In the fall of  we administered the survey to          residents fellows and attending physicians at three          university sites Potential respondents were invited to a          lunch meeting in which they would complete a survey on          preventive care They provided informed consent and then          completed the survey over the course of the next           minutes Subjects were not allowed to use decision aids          or other external information The protocol was          considered exempt by the UNC Institutional Review          Board                          Outcome Measures          For each scenario we first asked subjects to estimate          the year risk of CHD events without any therapy then          to estimate the year risk if the patient were taking a          lipidlowering agent We used a year time range rather          than the year range used by some risk estimation          tools because trials examining the benefits of          lipidlowering therapy were performed over a mean of           years making estimates of treatment effectiveness over          this time period most robust Finally providers were          asked to indicate on a point Likert scale if they would          recommend that the patient take lipidlowering therapy          with responses ranging from strongly recommend therapy          to strongly recommend against therapy For these          analyses strong or moderate recommendations for therapy          were considered as positive                          Analysis          Data from completed surveys were entered and analyzed          using STATA  Stata Corporation College Station Tx          and Microsoft Excel Microsoft Redmond WA Univariate          frequencies are presented as proportions means and          medians We measured the accuracy of CHD risk prediction          by dividing the subjects estimate of risk by the risk          obtained from the Framingham model and considering          results from  to  to be accurate The accuracy of          physicians estimates of CHD risk after therapy with          lipidlowering drugs was examined by calculating the          relative risk reduction RRR defined as the baseline          risk  risk after therapy divided by the baseline risk          and comparing it against a value of  derived from a          metaanalysis of primary prevention trials             Relative risk reductions between  and  were          considered to be accurate To examine patient factors          that may be associated with the accuracy of risk          estimation we compared the mean relative          overestimations for scenarios using patients with the          factor compared with scenarios of patients without the          factor using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for univariate          analyses and linear regression for multivariate          analysis          We did not attempt to compare the risk prediction          ability of residents compared with attendings or          cardiologists compared with generalists because of the          small numbers of participants in each subgroup                            Results                  Accuracy of risk estimates          Across all  scenarios risk estimates were accurate          a response between  and  times the actual value          for only  of the responses Most physicians          overestimated the year risk of CHD for all scenarios          combined  of responses were overestimates defined as           times greater than the actual value For the           individual questions the proportion of physicians          overestimating risk ranged from  to   Fewer          providers underestimated risk  responses were          underestimates less than  times the actual value          For the  individual scenarios the proportion of          physicians underestimating risk ranged from  to           When an alternative definition of accuracy estimates          within  percentage points of the true value similar          patterns were noted                          Estimation of relative risk reduction          Physicians were more accurate in their ability to          estimate the relative risk reduction that would be          associated with lipidlowering therapy  of estimates          were accurate By scenario the range of accurate          calculated RRR was  to                           Treatment recommendations          Most physicians over  in scenarios    in          scenario  and  in scenario  recommended treatment          with statin drugs The two scenarios with lower treatment          recommendation rates were the two of the four lowest risk          scenarios                          Patient factors affecting degree of risk          overestimation          The mean degree of overestimation expressed in          relative terms was larger for lowrisk scenarios mean          physician estimate  times Framingham estimate          intermediate for medium risk scenarios  times and          smaller  times for highrisk scenarios Table shows          univariate analyses of the median degree of          overestimation for scenarios with and without specific          patient characteristics Physicians were more likely to          overestimate risk for patients with very high cholesterol          levels total cholesterol   mgdl than for          patients with more modest elevations Scenarios in which          the patient had other CHD risk factors produced smaller          overestimations than when those factors were absent          Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed similar          patterns of results data not shown                            Discussion        In this scenariobased study academic physicians        overestimated the risk of CHD events across a range of        patient risk profiles encountered in primary prevention        Scenarios with young patients female patients and very        high lipid levels led to the highest degrees of        overestimation Their estimates of the relative risk        reduction associated with therapy using lipidlowering        drugs were more accurate but their estimates of the        absolute risk reductions were also inaccurate because of        their overestimation of baseline CHD risk Perhaps because        of the overestimation of risk and the potential benefits        of treatment most physicians recommended treatment in most        scenarios even those with relatively low risk        Our study provides additional insight into the ways in        which providers misestimate risk It appears that providers        are more likely to overestimate risk in young adults and        women after adjusting for other risk factors and are less        likely to make such overestimations when other risk factors        are present These findings suggest that providers        heuristics may be systematically inaccurate Whether        feedback of these particular errors could improve risk        estimation has not been examined        Although we did not study actual provider behavior our        study suggests that efforts to improve the low utilization        of statin drugs in highrisk patients cannot rely solely on        educational efforts aimed at increasing the awareness of        risk or the benefit of treatment Knowledge of risk or the        advantages of treatment do not appear to be important        barriers in the decision to prescribe lipid lowering agents        among physicians at academic medical centers        Our findings are consistent with previous research that        has examined physicians ability to predict the risk of CHD        events and found that physicians misestimate absolute risk        Friedmann et al used a mail survey to measure         physicians estimates of risk for three CHD risk scenarios        one of which involved lipidlowering therapy    They        found that cardiologists were more accurate in their        perceptions of the underlying risk of CHD than general        internists and family physicians but that estimates of        relative risk reduction were generally accurate for all        specialties Cardiologists recommended treatment more often        than generalists even though they perceived the benefit to        be smaller        Grover surveyed  Canadian physicians about their        estimates of year risk of CHD in two hypothetical        scenarios one involving a  year old male and the second        involving a  yearold female patient    The mean        estimates of risk were higher than actual risk in both        scenarios but the degree of overestimation was larger for        the  yearold male patient They also overestimated the        potential years of life saved for a series of CHD        interventions        Chatellier et al provided clinical information about         patients to  physicians and asked the physicians to        estimate the patients CHD risk Physicians had widely        varying estimates of risk in comparison with        Framinghamderived estimates The agreement between the        Framingham estimates and physicians estimates were only        moderately better than chance for  of the  physicians                  McManus examined the ability of practice nurses and        general practitioners in central England to estimate risk        using actual patients identified from computerized records        Providers subjective assessments and risk calculations        from  risk assessment tools were compared against        Framingham estimates The subjective assessments were less        accurate than those estimates generated from properly        completed risk tool calculations with relatively equal        number of overestimation and underestimation           Montgomery and colleagues evaluated the cardiovascular        risk prediction ability of  general practitioners and         practice nurses in the United Kingdom Providers were asked        to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events for a series        of older patients ages  with hypertension who were        being seen in the practice for a blood pressure check           Estimates were compared to the Framinghamcalculated        risk Estimates were accurate in  of cases  were        underestimates and  overestimates The large number of        underestimates stands in contrast to our study and others            that mainly identified overestimation errors This        difference may result from the generally high risk of the        patients included in the study by Montgomery and colleagues         had a  year risk greater than  It is less        likely although plausible that the use of real patients        may produce systematically different results than the use        of hypothetical vignettes        Our study like several previous studies in this area        is limited by the use of hypothetical scenarios completed        outside of usual practice Actual patterns of risk        estimation and treatment recommendation may differ from        these examples However studies suggest that vignettes        provide accurate information about actual physician        practice     Our use of a convenience sample of        physicians limits the generalizability of our results To        limit the effect of our sampling strategy on the validity        of our results we did not inform potential subjects of the        specific nature of the study prior to their decision to        participate Our choice of a relative measure for degree of        inaccuracy may have increased the apparent degree of        inaccuracy for lowrisk scenarios However alternate        analysis using absolute measures found similar patterns        Our decision to use  year risk rather than the more        commonly used  year risk could have led to inaccurate        risk estimation We attempted to limit this effect by        reinforcing verbally and in writing that we were asking for         year estimates Finally we did not vary the order of the        scenarios Subjects may have become fatigued or may have        learned from answering the earlier scenarios but we could        detect no such pattern                    Conclusion        Despite these limitations our findings suggest that        physicians overestimate the risk of CHD events        particularly when the patient has very high total or LDL        cholesterol levels and in lowrisk scenarios particularly        those involving women younger patients and those without        other CHD risk factors Providers difficulties in        estimating CHD risk should not be surprising since        accurate estimation requires integration of several        different pieces of clinical information some of which are        categorical smoking versus no smoking and others of which        are continuous age blood pressure Findings from the        field of cognitive psychology suggest that when faced with        complex questions people including health care providers        utilize simpler rulesofthumb or heuristics to make        decisions    In some cases these heuristics serve        quite well in other cases they may lead to common        reproducible errors in judgment Inaccurate estimates of        CHD risk could lead to prescription of lipid lowering drugs        to patients in whom their net benefit has not been        established           Inaccurate risk estimation and overprescription of        riskreducing therapies can also have economic        consequences Costeffectiveness analyses suggest that the        cost per lifeyear saved and total costs rise dramatically        as treatment is extended to lowerrisk patients           Accurate risk assessment is crucial for making rationale        treatment decisions Fortunately several easy to use and        accurate CHD risk prediction tools are now available           They can improve the accuracy of risk predictions           are becoming more widely disseminated and may improve the        quality of treatment decisions although further research        on their effect is required                    Competing interests        After the completion of this research Dr Michael        Pignone has
