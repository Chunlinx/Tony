                                 In God He             Press mavens wring theirhands when news organizations are caught being brutal or irresponsible But thetruth is that newspapers were at their ballsiest and most outrageous  yearsago Anything they dared to print today would seem pantywaisted in comparisonNewspapers that once policed corporations have been absorbed by the samecorporations and have lost the taste for barefisted combat In some placesstories that might threaten advertisers no longer see the light of dayReporters once cast as inkstained paladins have morphed into bankerlookalikes and celebrities As news organizations have waned the corporationshave waxed hiring fleets of workers who shape the news often by spoonfeedinglazy reporters            Thisscenario owes a great deal to John D Rockefeller Sr  sire of theStandard Oil monopoly patron saint of the modern corporation and in his timethe most detested man in the United States Rockefeller hired one of the firstcorporate flacks to counteract the blistering hostility generated by themuckraking journalist Ida Minerva Tarbell who laid out in detail how Standardconspired to help its allies and ruin its competitors Rockefellers flack dida yeomans job of placing warm stories about this scourge of the corporate highseas But the irony that emerges from Ron Chernows hefty new biographyTitan  is that Rockefeller helped create the modern corporate relationsdepartment too late to help himself After three years of fire fromMcClures magazine Tarbell had painted a bullseye on Standards backBy the time the flack was in place hordes of attorneys general andtrustbusters were closing in for the kill            Why did Rockefeller wait so long to return Tarbells fireThe first reason is that he underestimated Americas hatred of his corporateoctopus Standard Oil The second and most illuminating reason is that hethought God was on his side If youve got God why on earth would you need apublic relations man            Insideevery fat book is a slender one struggling to get out The fat book heresurveys the hundreds of books and articles already written about Rockefellerand reexamines transactions business partners and supporting characters inskillfulthough excessivedetail The slender book dispersed throughout thefat one is a fascinating meditation on the monopoly capitalists morallifeand the role that evangelical Christianity played in it Rockefellersharsh Baptist upbringing made him the perfect instrument of the marketplacebut it also set up a tortured cycle inside him He coveted cash as hisGodgiven right felt sinful about wanting it so badly and was desperatelycompelled to give it to charity which he did with anguish In wealth aselsewhere religion was his staff and his scourge            The Protestant Reformation provided divinesanction for making money earning profits and engaging in commerceRockefeller extended this sanction to collusion secret agreements corporatespying bribery and extortion Simply put rivals were told that if they didnot sell out to Rockefeller Standard would bankrupt them with a pricing warThe Standard as he called it used this strategy first in the ClevelandMassacre of  wielding a contract with the railroads that promisedpreferential rates and taking over  of  competitors in the blink of an eyeThen it marched like Sherman through the rest of nation Before he was Rockefeller controlled all but a pittance of the countrys oil His brutalityand success led directly to the Sherman Antitrust Act of  which wascreated specifically to dismember the Standard system of interlockingcorporations that disallowed genuine competition Standard resisted until when the Supreme Court approved the governments plan            As usualRockefeller laughed last The stock soared when the companys newly createdsubsidiaries appeared on the market making the richest man in the world thatmuch richer The deluge of cash angered President Teddy Roosevelt who hadhoped the breakup would bring the monopolists only pain But it is a testamentto Rockefellers skills both as an industrialist and as a deal maker thatStandards offspring dominated both US and world oil for the rest of thecentury The offsprings names by the way are Exxon Mobil Amoco ChevronSun and Conoco            The Titan saw nothing wrong with bankrupting companies thatresisted his advances He viewed the process of smothering the weakestcompanies and swallowing those that remained as a thoroughly Christianactivity While trustbusters called him the devil Rockefeller looked uponhimself as a saver of corporate souls who consolidated an unruly business anddid away with redundancy This was true of the kerosene market whereRockefeller turned a crappy unreliable product into one that was consistentlygoodand cheaper to boot But in so doing of course he drove hiscompetitors out of business            Reviewersof Titan have found it impossible to speak of Rockefeller withoutreferring to the Microsoft Corps Bill Gates especially since the USJustice Department began scrutinizing charges that Microsoft employs predatorypractices to maintain its monopoly on computer operating systems and to pushits own Internet browser The governments questions are legitimate but thecomparisons between Rockefeller and Gates are less precise than they could beRockefeller cornered the market on a natural resource simply by wrenching itout of other peoples hands Gates and Microsoft are selling intellectualproducts that they thought up and that could eventually be eclipsed by othersThe two men are similar however in that both severely misjudged publicsentiment Like Rockefeller  years ago Gates came to the national attentionwith a pugnacious imperial style that irritated government lawyers who neededno provocation to do what they were hired to do            In later years when Rockefeller was rebukedfor his tyrannies he sang the monopolists equivalent of Onward ChristianSoldiers It was right before me and my God  If I had to do it tomorrowI would do it again the same waydo it a hundred times This messianiccorporatism originated in Rockefellers childhood in western New York stateHis father William Avery Rockefeller sometimes called Devil Bill was aflimflam man and a bigamist who left his wife and children alone for months ata time while he fleeced the populace with bogus medical cures Rockefellersmother Eliza reacted to Devil Bills criminality by putting the fear of Godin her threadbare children whom she marched to church with unfailingregularity            Rockefeller grew up ashamed of both his poverty and his neerdowell fatherand obsessed with the twin themes of frugality and organization He kept apersonal ledger in which he recorded all the money he spent even the  hepaid for his wifes engagement ring which he listed under Sundry ExpensesHe wanted mightily to accumulate money but he worried constantly aboutbreaking the moral code against covetous behavior Worth billions he reviewedevery grocery bill and prowled the hallways turning out lights He bit the headoff a streetcar conductor who once charged him two fares thinking thedistinguished gentleman was paying for his traveling partner as well            Rockefeller was deeply conflicted about giving away moneyHe recognized a Christian duty to charity but was gripped by a fear that hischarity would be wasted thereby incriminating him in sin He overcame thisfear enough to give away billions more by far than even Andrew Carnegie andcreated the University of Chicago Rockefeller University and his ownfoundation But giving drove him near to nervous collapse This story is toldwell in Chernows chapter Captains of Erudition which describes the hellishwrangling between Rockefeller and the freespending William Rainey Harper thefirst president of the University of Chicago In the throes of givingRockefeller wrote to an associate            I am in trouble MrGates The pressure of these appeals for gifts has become too great forendurance  I am so constituted as to be unable to give away money with anysatisfaction until I have made the most careful inquiry as to the worthiness ofthe cause These investigations are now taking more of my time and energy thanthe Standard Oil itself            Chernowattributes this attitude to Rockefellers uncommon respect for the dollarBut what we see is a man caught between the Christian imperative to givegenerously and a nearpathological cheapness The tension between the two drovehim to distraction Chernow attributes Rockefellers poor relations with Harperto the fact that the college president was a spendthrift But building auniversity from scratch is far from cheap Rockefeller wanted a great collegeand he went to great trouble to lure Harper from Yale to the nascent Universityof Chicago With Harper in place one gets the sense of Rockefeller seizing upon the issue of money eventually forbidding Harper to even discuss it in hispresence This is Rockefellers double bind The sight of his money flowingliberally unnerved him deeply even when it flowed to something he valued            Rockefeller was caught up in this anguishedgiving when Avenging Angel Tarbell began to rend his flesh in McCluresTarbell had grown up in the Pennsylvania oil regions and saw firsthand whathappened when the Cleveland Massacre rolled east Her religious upbringing waseasily a match for Rockefellers but it manifested itself in a substantiallydifferent way Her part series was an enormous undertaking that still standsas the signal work on the Standard monopoly The series maintained an evenalmost clinical tone But a final twopart profile was unvarnished opinion atits most brutal Few people had seen Rockefeller up close until Tarbellambushed him at church She found him leprous and reptilian and saw in himconcentration craftiness cruelty and something indefinably repulsivePainting a harrowing portrait of the ageravaged face she wrote MrRockefeller may have made himself the richest man in the world but he haspaid Nothing but paying ever ploughs such lines in a mans face ever set hislips as such a melancholy angle            Chernow argues with Tarbellthroughout this book crediting her work and pointing out her mistakes andemotional lapses Tarbell was occasionally over the top But she was also apassionate and harddriving journalist who spoke a sometimes crushing truth toone of the most powerful men in the world Dealhungry monopolists will be withus always But with journalism fixated on gossip and entertainment there maybe no Ida Tarbells to bring them down
