                so have you had to think about uh nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life   nah not really my parents are still pretty young my fathers forty five mother about the same age   uhhuh oh thats very young   yeah um so that really hasnt been an issue for me   uhhuh   how about yourself   uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh   umhum   seventy and my mother must be about sixty five   umhum   so im starting to think about it but i havent had to do anything about it yet uh my grand   right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or   no im pretty sure they dont um they have some income from pensions and social security um   umhum   but no i dont think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing   yeah well ive heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what ive heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home       so it tends to be kind of useless anyway   yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something   umhum   you know special you cant handle it anyway uh   right yeah   i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us   umhum   but there are certain health you know certain health conditions that we wouldnt be able to handle and i think weve just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard   yeah right yeah i dont know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to to have a nurse come into the home periodically   that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars   yeah dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time   yeah yeah what the heck   yeah   yeah   and certainly more dignified than uh   yeah its   than warehousing them   it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and   right   uh   yeah   yeah   its its kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know its its uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight   yeah   and uh you know they just really cant take care of them very well the budget and staffing especially if its a state run   i saw something on Sixty Sixty Minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in Texas that was a real you know horror piece   umhum yeah it seems like every time i see something on television its not good   yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before wed end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could   yeah yeah   put away enough money to handle it ourselves   yeah it seems that way   huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left   yeah i sure do theyre theyre pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when theyre theyre in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead   well thats could be worse i think   yeah i think you know thats pretty good way to go   if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead id probably   id be happy   yeah i i think that might be sufficient might be sufficient   yeah thats thats the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh   umhum   heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they cant really help themselves so they have to be cared for     yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that youd need more help than ever to uh   right   to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesnt seem like those people are getting it   yeah i mean it seems like theyd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree   well its always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not   yeah yeah well it seems to me its a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least theyve lived a life   you would think yeah i mean youd think hey the clocks bound to run out at some point   and uh yeah yeah its something its something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life   yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh   so uhhuh   the things that people are put through the so heroic measures theyre put through when theyre very sick some of them are very old and some arent that uh   right umhum   everyone really knows isnt going to make a real difference but theyre sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do   right yeah seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if theyd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldnt have been interested in heroic measures and   yeah my wife has certain certain wishes that she doesnt want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they are  it comes time to deal with it   if thats the case then umhum   yeah well i dont know my wifes a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh Journal of the AMA and American Medical News thing and it seems like that physicians unless theyre in writing or video tape or something   uhhuh umhum umhum   that theyre kind of in a
