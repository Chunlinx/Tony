                                 Not Taking the Initiative            The New York Timesleads with the Supreme Courts ruling that the voter referendum process shouldbe maximally free of governmentimposed obstacles a story that also makes theWashington Post and USA Todayfronts The WP leads with word that President Clinton has sent an check to Paula Jones as settlement in full of the sexual harassmentsuit she had brought against him None of the other papers runs this story onits front which makes sense since the decision to pay was reached two monthsago the only real news coming with the actual check is that nearly half of themoney was Hillarys USAT puts it on page  thereby enabling it toget on instead with Day Two of Michael Jordan is God and God is Dead with notjust a combination lead and cover story but also an page pullout keepsakeand two other stories inside The Los AngelesTimes goes with an impeachment runup story            The NYT points out that twentyfour states mostly in the West andmidwest provide for voter referenda and that they have been a particulareffective vehicle for pursuing socially controversial positions Suchcontroversy explains the paper had led several states including Colorado totry to stem their use But yesterday reports the Times  the Supremesstruck down Colorados laws requiring that circulators ofinitiative petitions be registered to vote in the state and wear identifyingbadges and have their name address and pay on file The mostly  rulingargued that such regulations conflict with the First Amendment value ofuninhibited communication with voters            The LAT lead titled Senate Braces for Days of Judgement inMomentous Trial is mostly such desiccata as that one hundred senators willsit as both judge and jury and Starrs investigation of possible crimesbecame a yearlong running national soap opera And in an apparent Iron EyesCody memorial moment it claims that last week when Sen Patrick Leahy firstheard the articles of impeachment formally presented a single tear coursedhis cheek Note to readers if a storys headline is built around words likeanticipates expects awaits or braces odds are good theres not muchactual news in it But the second half of this story does include someobservations that drive home the oddity of the looming process one of theprosecutors Rep Asa Hutchinson is the brother and apartment mate of one ofthe jurors Sen Tim Hutchinson and one juror Sen Barbara Boxer is relatedby marriage to the accused            Another sports story getting prominent play today is the auction of MarkMcGwires th home run ball Four of the majors say it fetched just upwards of million while the LAT says  million            The NYT and LAT fronts report that Planned Parenthood andseveral doctors have brought a private federal civil suit against theproprietors of an antiabortion Web site that suggests abortion providersare like Nazis and groups the names and faces of some doctors providing theprocedure on a Wanted Posterstyle list it calls the Deadly Dozen Includedin this list was the name and likeness of a doctor shot by a sniper last fallin upstate New York This is the first such lawsuit brought under the federal law that prohibits force or threats of force against abortion clientsand providers and the first to wrestle with what exactly on a Web siteconstitutes an illegal threat            A piece inside the WP asserts that a speedy impeachment trial willprobably not disrupt Congress legislative agenda because the Senate rarelydoes much in the first few weeks of a new session But why not go further anduse some of the Post s research horsepower to actually document thisideawith a chart covering recent sessions that graphs Congress legislativeoutput against the months of the year            An AP dispatch in the WP states that a new study in JAMA showsthat in  an estimated  people in the US got salmonella from alfalfasprouts An epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isquoted as suggesting therefore that consumers should consider this danger whendeciding whether to eat alfalfa sprouts Now what exactly is the cash valueof that guidance Does one dare eat the stuff or not Newspapers should avoidpassing along scary information nobody can do anything with Todays Paperssays either get the experts to come across with more info or pass on thestory            At the very bottom of the LAT s Commentary page is a smallprintitem For the Record stating that in a previous article on the page theRadical Reconstructionist Thaddeus Stevens was incorrectly described But nomore detail is given about this Not explicitly stating previous mistakes insuch correction notices is LAT policy But this seems illadvised Inthis case for instance the reader is left wondering what horrible goof isbeing suppressed when actually its just that congressman Stevens ofPennsylvania was mistakenly described as a senator from Massachusetts            The National Security Agency has according to the WP  identified andresponded to a new potential threat to its supersupersupersecret spyoperations Henceforth headquarters are offlimits to Furbys Spooks who havealready brought the toys into their offices are advised to contact the StaffSecurity Officer for guidance
