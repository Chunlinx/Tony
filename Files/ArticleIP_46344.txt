                                  Fight Clubbed                           Fight Club  a movie about a fictionalorganization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp has provokedmore than its share of media handwringing particularly diatribes aboutHollywoods infatuation with violence and Faludiesque ruminations about theemasculated American male Fight Club  however has not sparked aniota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and beat eachother to pulp the Ultimate Fighting Championship UFCs flameout from nationalsensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy of American sports a cautionarytale of prudishness heavyhanded politics and cultural myopia            UFC began in  as alockerroom fantasy What would happen if a kickboxer fought a wrestler Akarate champion fought a sumo champion Promoters built an octagonal chainlinkcage invited eight top martial artists and set them loose in noholdsbarredbareknuckles fights There are no rules bragged an early press releaseContestants would fight till knockout submission doctors intervention ordeath UFC allowed even promoted all notions of bad sportsmanship kicking aman when hes down hitting him in the groin choking Fourhundredpound menwere sent into the Octagon to maul guys half their size Only biting andeyegouging were forbidden            The gimmick entranced thousands of people well men Whathappens when a pound sumo champion fights a pound kickboxer AnswerThe kickboxer knocks him silly in  seconds They tuned in for bloodshedthedamage as fans like to call it UFC fights could be horrifying Tank Abbottan illtempered pound street fighter knocks out hapless opponent JohnMatua in  seconds Then before the ref can intervene Abbott belts theunconscious Matua in the head sending him into a fit limbs quiveringuncontrollably blood spurting from his mouth Abbott naturally became a culthero and won a guest spot on Friends  Matua walked out of the ringSoon UFC was selling out huge arenas and drawing  payperviewsubscribers for its quarterly competitions            But a subtle sport wasemerging from the gimmicks and carnage My passion for ultimate fighting whichis also called extreme or noholdsbarred fighting began when I saw thefinals of UFC IV Royce Gracie a pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist wasmatched against a pound beast named Dan Severn one of the top heavyweightwrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over In  secondsSevern had grabbed Gracie flung him to the canvas and mounted him For thenext  minutes Severn pummeled and elbowed and headbutted the smaller manGracies face grew drawn and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severns bombardmentThen all of sudden Gracie still lying on his back saw an opening wrappedhis arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked the giant intosubmission            UFCs caged matches revolutionized the idea of fightingNursed on boxing and Hollywood Americans imagine fights as choreography adance of elegant combinations roundhouse kicks clean knockouts The UFCpunctured this Boxers floundered Experts in striking martial arts such askarate and tae kwon do who fancied themselves the worlds greatest fightersfound themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters who pulled them to the groundand slowly choked or leglocked them UFC immediately debunked a lot of mythsof fighting of boxing karate kung fu It showed the reality of what works inan actual fight says Dave Meltzer editor of Wrestling Observer             Instead of beingcarnivals of gore UFC fights looked strangely like  sex Almost all fightsended on the ground one man mounting the other in missionary position thepair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five  even minutes There were few spectacular knockouts The refereeyes there wasalways a refereestopped many bouts and in most others fighterstapped out surrendering to mildlooking but agonizing chokes and jointlocks It was not barbarism It was science            The UFC spawned a new breed of mixed martial artistsWorldclass wrestlers learned to kickbox Champion kickboxers learned tograpple The karate experts learned to stay home They became without doubtthe best fighters in the world Click for more about the fighters Mike Tysonwouldnt last  seconds in an ultimate fighting match When Olympic gold medalwrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC a fighter named Frank Shamrock KOd himwith a submission hold in  seconds Ultimate fighting schools began sproutingup all over the country replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martialarts with techniques that actually work            UFCs promoters predictedthat it would supplant boxing as Americas martial art Instead it fell apartThe collapse began in  when Sen John McCain RAriz saw a UFC tapeMcCain a lifelong boxing fan was horrified at the ground fighting kicks andhead butts It was barbaric he said It was not a sport He sent lettersto all  governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting The outcry againsthuman cockfighting became a crusade and like many crusades it was foundedon misunderstanding            UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fightis In countries such as Brazil and Japan where noholdsbarred fighting has along history it is popular and uncontroversial But Americans adhere to theMarquis of Queensbury rules A fight consists of an exchange of upperbodyblows that halts when one fighter falls            Any blood sport can be barbaric whether itsboxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting It is impossible to draw a brightline between ultimate fighting and boxing If anything ultimate fighting issafer and less cruel than Americas blood sport For example critics pilloriedultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles To a nationaccustomed to boxing gloves this seemed revolting an invitation to braindamage But its just the reverse The purpose of boxing gloves is not tocushion the head but to shield the knuckles Without gloves a boxer wouldbreak his hands after a couple of punches to the skull Thats why ultimatefighters wont throw multiple skull punches As a result they avoid theconcussive head wounds that kill boxersand the longterm neurological damagethat cripples them            Similarly thechainlink fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque Critics have demandedthat UFC install ropes instead But ropes are a major cause of death and injuryin boxing Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against theropes because nothing stops their heads from snapping back The chainlinkfence prevents hyperextension            When I tell people Im an ultimate fighting fan theyinvariably respond Dont people get killed all the time doing that But noone has ever been killed at the UFCthough boxers are killed every year Noone has even been seriously injured at the UFC On the rare occasions when about has ended with a bloody knockout the loser has always walked out of thering            But this does not impressboxing fans who are the most vigorous opponents of extreme fighting McCainsat ringside at a boxing match where a fighter was killed When I asked him toexplain the moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting he explodedat me If you cant see the moral distinction then we have nothing to talkabout Then he cut our interview short and stormed out of his office            But logic has not served the UFC well Where McCain led aprudish nation followed George Will opined against UFC The American MedicalAssociation recommended a ban New York state outlawed ultimate fighting asdid other states The Nevada Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC boutsbarring the UFC from the lucrative casino market One public TV stationrefused a UFC sponsorship ad The only other organization the station everrejected was the Ku Klux Klan Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all overthe country forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees The UFC wasexiled from megaarenas to eversmaller venues in ever more outofthewaystates Louisiana Iowa and Alabama The match I attended in October  washeld in the parking lot of a small Mississippi casino            The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow Inearly  McCain became chairman of the commerce committee which overseesthe cable industry In April  the president of the National CableTelevision Association warned that UFC broadcasts could jeopardize the cableindustrys influence in Washington Time Warner TCI Request CablevisionSystems Viewers Choice and other major operators stopped airing UFC eventssaying they were too violent for children Never mind that  UFC only aired onpayperview so children could not see it unless their parents paid for itand  the same cable outfits carried boxing matches R and NC movies andprofessional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC The UFCs addressableaudiencethe potential number of PPV subscribersshrank from  million atits peak to  million today            It was a very cheap wayfor the cable companies to portray themselves as antiviolence It did not costthem much and it made them look good in Washington says Carol Klenfnerspokeswoman for UFCs parent company SEG            The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its owncause The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus ofcarnage Its early ads emphasized extreme fightings potential for death UFCfolks accused McCain without any evidence of opposing the sport as a favor tocampaign contributors Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from theother ultimate fighting operation the nowdefunct Battlecade were arrestedfor violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought on an Indianreservation outside Montreal            In the past two years anincreasingly desperate UFC has been trying to assuage its critics Thecompetition which had been gradually adding safety rules since the firstfight imposed even more It institued rounds and a point must scoringsystem It banned head butts and groin strikes You can no longer kick a downedman or elbow someone in the back of the head Fighters are required to wearthin martial arts gloves a purely cosmetic change The UFC imposed weightclasses ending the DavidandGoliath mismatches that made early fights socompelling            None of this soothed the cable operators who have kept UFCoff the air The payperview audience has plunged from  per show to UFC can no longer afford its best fighters Some are fighting overseasOthers notably Ken Shamrock Franks brother have become pro wrestlersFights have deteriorated UFC is limping along but it has been reduced toscheduling events in Japan and Brazil            Sports fans want to grow with the sport saysformer UFC fighter David Beneteau They want to recognize the athletes Theywant to see the same fighters come back When you compare UFC now to what itwas the fighters are not the same the rules are not the same The fans haveno story to follow            Even as it disappears from public view ultimatefighting is returning to its roots Away from the scrutiny of the major mediastate legislators and McCain kids are still learning mixed martialartstechniques and smalltime promoters are quietly staging events You can seeKage Kombat competitions at Dancing Waters nightclub in San Pedro Calif Youcan watch the Warriors Challenge at a small Indian casino outside SacramentoTexans compete in Houstons Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship Tribalcasinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration tournaments The ExtremeFighting Challenge is popular in Iowa The money is low the crowds are smalland theres not a TV camera in sight Ultimate fighting should have becomeboxing Instead it has gone underground It has become Fight Club
