          okay is uh that a sport you like to participate in   no actually im a spectator and im a second hand spectator as a result of my first husbands or my late late husbands interest in golf   uhhuh my husband likes golf also hes uh i guess hed be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it  but he he limits it pretty good i um       have tried to go out and play golf he would love it if i would go out and play with him but i stand there and swing and swing and i cant even hit the ball  yeah i dont either   umhum   i cant even play miniature golf well  well there are just some things that were good at and other things that were not but i am very good at watching it on television   right umhum   and he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments he could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held and what the nature of the hole was and   oh so hes really into it  wow   oh yeah he was a good golfer and as and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while   oh   but uh golf tended to be so i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players   yeah right more because of their personalities than their sportsman   uhhuh well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship another part of it was id pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for so  you know the competitor and i became involved in following his career     right   and uh i know that that my husband Tom Kite was his fair haired boy and he thought he was spectacular i said whoa im not going to im not going to stay interested in him so   oh   i decided Andy Bean was good competition any time they both played why he was just real excited when Tom was you know shown on the television and   uhhuh     i followed Andy Bean   uhhuh   we both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors   oh hes interesting i like to watch him yeah   he is he is a character not just a golfer but hes quite a character   yeah   and there are some really really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models   yes yeah i think youre right   and i think its critical its critical to have a good role model   yeah   in any field any sports   yeah yeah i like to watch those skins games do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amount you know for each hole they win they get the money for it i think those are pretty exciting   uhhuh uhhuh well i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf you hit a little ball you chase it you go find it and then you hit it again and lose it again     uhhuh   and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger itd be easier   yeah   oh really  i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves  when they dont do well     oh i know oh yeah   my husband and his buddies are not very good they play like maybe once a month or less and uh so they all hit like in the low nineties and they think theyre having a really good game  so   umhum umhum oh yeah well my husbands average ran in the mid seventies so he wasnt bad   wow yeah that is good   he was pretty good but as far as influencing young people i think that that is uh that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age you cant play football at fifty five   right   but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle and uh anything can be warped   yeah   but i think that that is one of the sports thats a good healthy way to to move into maturity safely umhum umhum   uhhuh something to stay active at and for a long time   thats right thats right and a lot of seniors a lot of elderly people dont even take up golf until theyre you know in their later years   yeah yeah yeah and they can still get good at it   thats right thats absolutely right and its something that   yeah well maybe thats what ill do when i have time later on   yeah when youre too old to do anything else go play golf yeah  but its its also something that husband and wife can participate in     yeah umhum   or you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles   true   you know you can go to the country club together you can play with your friends he can play with his friends but youve both been out and exercised and you have enjoyed the day   right yeah or my favorite just ride around in the cart with him       go somewhere really nice like Hawaii and just  look at the golf course   you bet you get a lot of exercise that way umhum well ill tell you what if if theyre not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long     oh yeah no my husbands pretty tolerant so hes not too bad to watch   umhum oh mine had a very short fuse if he did something bad hes liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it hes replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls i mean just get so mad hed just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal     oh no yeah gosh now my husband has a temper but he doesnt seem to show it on the golf course hes because hell talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature immature he thought it was and stuff so i guess hes real laid back about it   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   he hell come home though and i mean hell shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds and hed tell me what a great day he had and about this great shot he made and everything i try not to laugh yeah this one on this one hole   uhhuh well i shot in the hundreds but i made this one good one     did you have to listen to long stories about how on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way  those are its hard for me to  act nice about that when he goes on and on   umhum   well the one thing that is a is a drawback about it i think is the cost   yes   membership in the clubs is expensive the equipment is very expensive requires special shoes requires special you know special equipment theres so many   right and then they want to play another course thats not theyre not a member of and other fees it really is high   thats right thats right thats right it it can get very expensive and i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if youre going to try to go pro because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing   yeah oh yeah yeah   and they dont give those sessions away and nor do they give uh instructions away     right   as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought id be interested in g olf i said i dont know ill have to try it and see ive always watched it and he said well fine he said well just take you over to the course he lives near Brookhaven   uhhuh uhhuh   well just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it if you do then we can go golf together   uhhuh   i said oh whoa great i get to walk all around a little green field all day       but those kinds of things happen though you you get a little taste of it and you say hey this is not bad   uhhuh   and you really begin to develop an interest in it but i am not an athlete at all uh you know im always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball and   me either     and uh hung hung hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball so i am not an athlete maybe golf is a forgiving sport i dont know     yeah at least youre just competing youre competing against yourself i guess more than everybody else out there yeah   it doesnt appear to be umhum i really i i havent really acquired an interest in it but im open to try anything you know   yeah thats kind of the way i feel   the one thing that is also detrimental as far im concerned my skin is very fair so im going to have to golf in the evening or im going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me and i dont think   oh right
