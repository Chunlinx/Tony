                    Background        DNA topoisomerase I TOP is a ubiquitously expressed        protein that relaxes DNA supercoils generated during many        transactions of DNA including replication transcription        repair and chromatin condensation and remodeling TOP has        been shown to interact with many proteins including        components of the holo TFIIIC complex     TFIID            p     SV large T antigen     nucleolin            the RING finger protein topors     the RNA splicing        factors PSFp nrb    and SFASF     the cell        cycle regulatory protein ARF     RNA pol II complex             and HTLV type  tax oncoprotein     TOP        also interacts with a variety of unidentified proteins        involved in its phosphorylation ubiquitination and        sumoylation                We used the core domain of TOP lacking the Nterminal        highly charged region the coiledcoil linker domain and        the Cterminal active site domain as bait in two hybrid        screens for TOP interacting proteins We obtained multiple        independent cDNA clones coding for BTBD and BTBD two        uncharacterized BTB domaincontaining kelchlike        proteins The interactions of HeLa cell TOP with the BTBD        proteins was confirmed using GSTpulldown and was further        suggested by their intracellular colocalization                    Results                  Identification of TOPinteracting proteins using          twohybrid assays          The core domain of human TOP from residue  to           was used as the bait in twohybrid screens                This region of TOP lacks the Nterminal  of the          protein that is highly charged and the Cterminal domain          containing the active site and the coiledcoil linker          The resulting polypeptide comprises  of the TOP          sequence A screen of a HeLa cell library yielded           colonies that tested positive in the two hybrid assays          growth on plates lacking histidine or uracil lack of          growth on plates containing fluoroorotic acid and          induction of           lacZ resulting in blue color when          assayed with Xgal Nucleotide sequence analysis of           of these clones revealed two cDNA contigs of  and           that predict proteins whose sequences are  identical          The proteins were named BTBD and BTBD according to a          recent analysis of their genomic sequences     The          clones of each contig differed in the amount of           sequence present  and  of BTBD and BTBD          respectively had different  ends In the twohybrid          growth assays and galactosidase assays each of the          clones tested as positive as the control for strongly          interacting proteins the interaction of cFos with          cJun ProQuest Life Technologies Another twohybrid          screen using a different twohybrid system Matchmaker          Clontech also yielded  clones identical to the contig          of  clones BTBD                          Characterization of BTBD and BTBD mRNA          The longest BTBD cDNA clone obtained from twohybrid          screening  bp contains an ORF that encodes a  aa          protein starting with an ATG that is preceded by an          inframe stop codon Sequences in GenBank confirmed our          sequence One was obtained by the oligocapping method          FLJ and another assembled from partial cDNA and          RACE fragments              The longest BTBD cDNA obtained from twohybrid          screening  bp contained an ORF starting at the           end To obtain the missing  cDNA a nested PCR strategy          was used to amplify the sequence from four independent          cDNA libraries but no extended sequences were obtained          RACE Life Technologies also failed to produce longer          clones This difficulty to obtain longer cDNA clones was          seen by others     The GC richness at the  end           nucleotides are  GC may form secondary structures          that block reverse transcriptase Analysis of the BTBD          gene immediately upstream of the  end of our cDNA          predicts an ORF that begins with an ATG and encodes           amino acids inframe with the ORF of our longest BTBD          clone however the  nucleotides encoding these          inframe amino acids sequence are  GC rich To          determine if this sequence might be part of the BTBD          mRNA RTPCR followed by nested PCR was used Two          antisense primers complementary to exon  were used to          prime reverse transcription Sense primers for PCR          amplification were located within predicted exon  Fig          A Amplified products of  and  bp that are          predicted from the mRNA template resulted Fig B If          genomic DNA had been the template products greater than           kb would have been obtained Furthermore sequencing          of the  bpamplification product confirmed it to be          the predicted mRNA Fig A The cDNA starting at the          predicted start codon was deposited in GenBank          AF                          Northern blotting and in silico expression          analysis          Northern blotting was used to determine the tissue          distribution and sizes of the mRNA encoding BTBD and          BTBD Fig  Poly ARNA from human tissues           glane was probed with BTBD BTBD or TOP cDNA Each          mRNA was detected in all the tissues tested BTBD mRNA          was highly expressed in testes heart and skeletal          muscle BTBD was more highly expressed in skeletal          muscle Only a single message size was detected for each          BTBD  kb and BTBD  kb          BTBD and BTBD cDNA were found in libraries from the          following tissues amniotic aorta bone brain bone          marrow colon ear embryo foreskin gall bladder germ          heart kidney lung muscle ovary pancreas          parathyroid placenta skin spleen stomach testis          thymus tonsil and uterus LocusID  and           respectively     BTBD and BTBD was also expressed          in a large number of tumor types and normal tissues          present in SAGE serial analysis of gene expression          libraries SAGEmap                              Mapping of the regions of TOP and the BTBDs that          interact          BTBD and BTBD were mapped by deletion analysis to          identify amino acid sequences required for interaction          with TOP In twohybrid assays Nterminal deletions of            of BTBD  aa or  BTBD  aa did not          eliminate binding to TOP Fig AB In contrast          Cterminal deletions of  and  aa of BTBD and BTBD          respectively eliminated binding to TOP in the          twohybrid assays Thus sequences very close to the          Cterminus are required for the interaction with TOP by          this analysis          Twohybrid analysis was also used to map regions of          the TOP core domain that interact with BTBD The region          upstream of aa  and downstream of aa  were not          required for binding BTBD Fig C The fragment of          TOP from amino acid  to  was capable of binding to          BTBD This region includes  aa of core subdomain I          all of core subdomain II and  amino acids of the second          section of core subdomain I                          GSTpulldown assays confirm twohybrid deletion          mapping          Truncated fragments of BTBD and BTBD were tested in          GSTpull down assays for their ability to bind TOP in          nuclear extracts of HeLa cells The GSTpulldown assay          confirmed the positive interactions seen in the          twohybrid deletion mapping Fig  In addition we          found that two Nterminal truncated BTBD and BTBD were          able to coprecipitate TOP from nuclear extracts BTBD             BTBD             although they were negative in the twohybrid assay          Since truncated fragments may be unstable in yeast and          may not accumulate to levels sufficient to produce a          positive result we used roughly equal amounts of each          truncated protein to test for binding to TOP in nuclear          extracts Taken together the results of the twohybrid          and GSTpulldown assays narrow the interacting region of          BTBD and BTBD to roughly the Cterminal half of each          protein with critical residues within the last           residues                          Effect of GSTBTBD on TOP activity          To test the effect of BTBD on the supercoil          relaxation activity of TOP HeLa cell nuclear extracts          containing TOP were incubated with GST or GSTBTBD aa           GSTBTBD slightly inhibited the supercoil          relaxation activity of TOP increasing the time required          to completely relax the supercoiled DNA by about twofold          as compared with GST alone Fig A The DNA cleavage          assay was also used to determine if BTBD affected TOP          activity This assay measures the ability of TOP to          cleave endlabeled DNA substrates in the presence of the          anticancer drug camptothecin which blocks the ligation          step of the cleavage religation reaction of TOP A           bp DNA containing a single strong TOP cleavage site             or a  bp restriction fragment    was used as the          substrate GSTBTBD addition produced a slight          inhibition of TOP cleavage activity relative to GST          alone Fig B on the smaller substrate and had no          detectable effect on cleavage activity or cleavage site          selection by TOP on the larger substrate C                          Cellular localization of BTBD and colocalization          with TOP          To determine the localization of BTBD in cells we          transiently transfected HeLa cells with expression          plasmids encoding either myctagged full length BTBD          mBTBDF or a truncated BTBD having the Nterminal          half of the BTB domain removed mBTBDT The full          length BTBD localized entirely to cytoplasmic bodies          Fig B mBTBDF The truncated BTBD localized          predominantly to nuclear bodies with a minor fraction          localizing to cytoplasmic bodies Fig C mBTBDT          The localization of full length BTBD to cytoplasmic          bodies was surprising because the cytoplasm is separated          from the nucleus where endogenous TOP resides and          transfected GFPTOP localizes                  Because TOP and BTBD are not predominantly found in the          same compartments they may interact transiently or they          may interact only under specific conditions when they may          be in the same compartment We therefore analyzed mitotic          cells but did not observe colocalization of TOP and          the BTBDs not shown We then tested for colocalization          in transfected cells Though the truncated mBTBDT          localized to distinct nuclear bodies its colocalization          with endogenous TOP could not be determined against the          background of endogenous TOP diffuse nuclear staining          However in cells cotransfected with GFPTOP and          mBTBDT the mBTBDT staining was nuclear diffuse as          well as in nuclear bodies indicating that mBTBDT          interacts with GFPTOP which localizes throughout the          nucleus not shown          To determine if TOP colocalizes with BTBD in the          cytoplasm GFPTOP lacking an NLS    was          cotransfected with full length BTBD mBTBDF or          truncated BTBD mBTBDT GFPTOP lacking a NLS          GFPpTI localizes diffusely within the cytoplasm          Fig Aand     In cells transfected with both          GFPpTI and full length mBTBDF the diffuse          cytoplasmic GFPpTI significantly decreased and          GFPpTI colocalized with mBTBDF to cytoplasmic          bodies Fig D In cells transfected with GFPpTI and          truncated mBTBDT truncated mBTBDT was not in nuclear          bodies as when transfected alone rather it colocalized          with GFPpTI to cytoplasmic bodies Fig E Thus          when cotransfected with GFPTOP lacking a NLS both          full length and the Nterminal deleted BTBD colocalized          with TOP to cytoplasmic bodies                            Discussion        Twohybrid screens have identified BTBD and BTBD as        proteins that interact with the core domain of TOP BTBD        and BTBD were isolated as  and  independent clones        respectively and in twohybrid assays they interacted as        strongly as the control for strongly interacting proteins        cFos with cJun BTBD and BTBD also bound HeLa cell        TOP  kDa in nuclear extracts by GSTpulldown assays        Nterminal truncation studies showed the Cterminal  to         of the BTBD proteins are sufficient for binding TOP        Cterminal deletions of either protein eliminated binding        to TOP Cterminal truncation of  aa of BTBD or  aa        of BTBD in the twohybrid assay or a Cterminal        truncation of  aa of BTBD in GSTpulldown Truncation        of the BTB domains demonstrated that they were not required        for interaction with TOP The region of TOP sufficient        for binding BTBD was narrowed to residues    in the        cap region core subdomain II     Catalytic        activities of TOP were affected slightly or not at all by        coincubation with GSTBTBD suggesting that the        interaction does not regulate enzyme activity directly        We cloned the full length BTBD cDNA from a HeLa cell        library This sequence is  bp and the start codon is        preceded by a stop codon  nucleotides upstream GenBank        FLJ Our sequence is comparable to two others in        GenBank one of which was obtained by the oligocapping        method suggesting that it begins at the  cap                    Our repeated attempts to clone the  end of the BTBD        by library screening and the RACE method were unsuccessful        We tested sequences directly upstream of the longest cDNA        in the BTBD gene for their presence on the mRNA RTPCR        and sequencing of the RTPCR product demonstrated that this         nucleotide  GCrich sequence is present on the        BTBD mRNA and that it shares predicted polypeptide        sequence with BTBD homologues and orthologs        The BTBD proteins contain an amino terminal BTBPOZ        domain as well as a Cterminal region that is related to        proteins that contain the kelch domain Neither of these        regions yields unequivocal information for functional        classification The BTB domain is a highly conserved         amino acid hydrophobicrich proteinprotein interaction        domain that mediates homodimerization and        heterodimerization of a large number of proteins with        diverse functions     The three dimensional structure        of one BTB domain    has been characterized through        structurefunction studies     Proteins containing BTB        domains are currently categorized into three groups             DNAbinding proteins often containing zinc fingers in        the Cterminal region  actin binding proteins that        contain a kelch repeat of  residues that terminate in a        pair of glycine residues    and  proteins that have        neither an actinbinding domain nor a DNAbinding domain        The BTBD proteins belong to the last category although        they are distantly related to kelch proteins         identical over  aa they lack the residues that are        characteristic of kelch repeats a double glycine sequence        and a tyrosine separated from a tryptophan by precisely         residues             BTBD and BTBD are closely related sharing         identical amino acid sequence They are one of eleven genes        in p  p with close homology to genes in q         q that have apparently resulted from duplications of a        common ancestral gene     Both BTBD and BTBD are        widely if not ubiquitously expressed in human tissues The        predicted promoter regions are highly GCrich and lack        canonical TATA boxes suggesting that they may be        housekeeping genes             Close mammalian relatives of BTBD and BTBD include the        mouse orthologs that are  and  identical        respectively as well as highly similar rat and bovine        partial sequences     Sequence relatives in lower        organisms include a         C elegans sequence with         identities with BTBD  residues  gaps FH and        a         D melanogaster sequence with         identities  residues  gaps CG The human        genome encodes two proteins with   residues         gaps CAC and   residues  gaps AF        identities compared with BTBD These proteins comprise a        small family whose members have not been functionally        characterized and are evidently specific to animals because        putative orthologs are not present in available fungi and        plant sequence databases        We have demonstrated an interaction between BTBD and        TOP by twohybrid GSTpull down and intracellular        colocalization analyses Studies are underway to        functionally characterize BTBD and BTBD and understand        their interaction with TOP                    Conclusions         Fifteen and nineteen independent cDNA clones of BTBD        and BTBD respectively were isolated from twohybrid        screens and found to interact as strongly as cFos        interacted with cJun in the twohybrid assays         The interactions of TOP  with BTBD and BTBD were        confirmed by deletion mapping using twohybrid and        GSTpulldown assays         Less than the Cterminal half of each BTBD protein        lacking the BTB domain is sufficient for binding to TOP        TOP from aa  to  interacted with BTBD         GFPBTBD localized to cytoplasmic bodies         BTBD had little effect on the supercoil relaxation or        DNA cleavage activity of TOP in vitro         Cotransfected BTBD and TOP colocalized         The BTBD message contains  nucleotides that are         GCrich and are predicted to encode the Nterminus of a         amino acid protein         BTBD and BTBD mRNA were detected in all human        tissues tested BTBD mRNA was highly expressed in testes        heart and skeletal muscle BTBD was more highly expressed        in skeletal muscle Only a single mRNA species was present        for each BTBD and BTBD         Putative orthologs of BTBD and BTBD are found in         C elegans  identities         residues  gaps FH and         D melanogaster  identities         residues  gaps CG         Two paralogs of BTBD and BTBD are present in the        human genome CAC and AF                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmid construction          To construct the bait

Isolation of the BTBD coding region          The longest BTBD cDNA obtained from twohybrid          screening  bp contained an ORF starting at the           end To obtain the full coding region four independent          cDNA libraries were screened using a nested PCR strategy          with upper primers complementary to the vectors and two          nested lower primers complementary to BTBD          TCGTCCGAGTAGAGAAAC and          TCCACGTCGGGCAGCTCAATCTCC RACE Life          Technologies was also used to try to identify longer          clones using several different lower primers Reverse          transcription was also performed at C using the          thermophilic           Tth polymerase with magnesium as          the cofactor to enable it to use mRNA as a template None          of these
