        so well youre youre youre you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose   i suppose i do because ive seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last generation well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well   uhhuh   take it back thirty years  im going back too far from my parents generation when mom stayed home   yeah   period and and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married   yeah   and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it   yeah   until the kids you were little   yeah you you werent supposed to want a job   yes there was not theres not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day   umhum yeah   and then and then of course today its supposed to be all the other way youre supposed to only want the job and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are   yeah umhum   who are totally prepared to teach to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and   yeah but but   and uh well see how the generations go huh   but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than youre going to make at the job   yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did ive i was an engineer with uh   yeah   mechanical engineer with T I and uh i did it for six years and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old and and it just drove me crazy   did you   i could not do either well enough i couldnt put in enough overtime that was necessary or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays   umhum   as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country   oh yeah   also with uh with work for like three months and and   so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well thats the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if youd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when theyre going to be there   yeah yeah it might have been better yeah   but uh if youre going to be more professional professional oriented then youve got to have this to be able to perform well on the job youve got to have the flexibility that that doesnt really go with the family   yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once   umhum so you figure one of these days youre going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think   well actually ive found out that im not going to go back to being an engineer  im im im a photographer now   oh yeah oh okay youve found something else   i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldnt support myself if i decided to be a photographer   umhum yeah   that it would just have to be a hobby and im im very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else   yeah yeah i mean you figure theres got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child   to do yeah and its its great while theyre really little but as they get older   umhum   and theyre more independent and theres things to do then its good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a mothers day out program now once a week both of my kids do   yeah umhum   and so theyre getting they they get the socialization with other kids and you you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society   yeah and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides   yeah i think they do too   the same person every day   and i need it for the break  so   yeah well thats the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someones got to do it and be able to do it right and   umhum and enjoy it thats thats the whole thing   and if its not if its not mom then then dad or somebodys got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it   yeah yeah i think thats the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing were going to see coming up in the next ten years even in the even now theyre starting to do it but i think its going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that theres going to be a lot of women and theyre going to have to work it out to working part time   umhum   because if if i if i had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy   yeah umhum   and now with the photography thats you know its working thats what im doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the the thing that im doing is taking school pictures   yeah uhhuh   in day cares and in mothers day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids   yeah umhum   can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if its you know and and when hes at home can take care of them   yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible   i think theyre really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well   umhum yeah   its going to have to be both   well so so thats another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the fathers attitudes about you know whose whose job is this   yeah   well its its his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesnt take as much time as it used to so uh   you know its just convincing your husband thats important or that that that its important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom   to me yeah to yeah to me yeah well   doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then its hard to think of it   umhum yeah   in that other you know uh that i should do it or that or just to think about doing it rat her than having someone  tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help   and you you you yeah you talk yeah yeah umhum   and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now no   yeah and and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and thats a very hard attitude to change   yes and yeah and without and and its just they dont look at things most men dont walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it   umhum   they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the  on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be done this is the time this needs to be done but   hm uh umhum yeah and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someones got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas   thats right yeah umhum yeah   to so that they know that uh you know  male and female are both responsible for doing this and   umhum   and uh   and i think thats thats going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls its not theyre not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much   uhhuh umhum   this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were   yeah yeah   needed to be done theyre going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because its a womans job or a mans job but because its dirty and it needs to be cleaned   umhum yeah umhum yeah but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didnt learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didnt move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility and i i think thats happened in a lot of cases   and its gonna its gonna yeah some kids are really having it If theyd been in day care the entire time and it wasnt yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college   yeah umhum um you know some time day care is really good but sometimes its just its baby sitting its someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any   yeah yeah yeah   relationship with the adults to say you know heres whats right and heres whats wrong and and heres what we expect of you   yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little   yeah   you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because i its you know when you when you if you if you teach them when theyre little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older   umhum   but if no one does anything when theyre little then its twice as hard as i think as they get older   yeah im im saying this as im trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something   yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls     yeah well shes usually in bed by this time but shes staying up late tonight but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know my my dad was a very traditional dad and when i was a child i didnt really know my dad very well and i miss that     yeah thats the thing if womans role like we said if womens roles change drastically mens roles will too and a lot of its for the better some of the some of the womens roles i think are almost for the worse because were losing out on some things going back to work   and i want yeah the men have to be convinced of that   but i think if we can if we can expand the mens roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didnt very often i know i know mine almost never did   no
