                                 Long May It Wave            The perpetual hair crisis isnever over Hair produces  times the anxiety clothes ever stir upnobodyadmits to having a bad clothes day for example Fashion in coiffure naturallyrelates to whats cool below the neck but since we mostly grow our hairourselves its visual life has a stronger meaning than that of pants andshirts A man I know a distinguished professor of philosophy at adistinguished university has just had his short lightbrown hair dyedplatinum blond What made him do that He wanted he told methis mans careeris based on deep thinking and he lives in amorous harmony with a womanto looklike a gay weight lifter So he does sort of His new hair produces a fineambiguous effect a notsoeasilyreadable physical presence that can blend inwith several wayward forms of nonacademic company It also gives just theslightest salutary fright to colleagues and students            Noteverybody pinpoints his own wishes as accurately as my friend but since thedeath of compulsory hats men and women have allowed their personal fantasiesto focus on hair even more than on clothes Clothes are public husks theyshift on and off your body and in and out of fashion and your life you canhide your alternate selves or your mistakes in the back of the closet Buthair is only partially public Since it stays with you continuously even whileyoure naked your hair adorns your most intimate identity just as your facedoes and only secondarily supports the roles you play in life What you dowith it has to satisfy in both realms Not so easy in our hyperconscious andfractional modern world            The hard thing is that the comforting fantasy you realizeon your head may seem like quite another thing to the world You cut your hairvery short to feel young and free your audience sees the look of a pluckedturkey Your haircut imitates a movie stars in it you resemble aschoolteacher In fact hair fantasy is mostly unconscious and so is theresponse to it Our personal failures count as such only if we feel that ourhidden hair agenda fails us Most others dont notice anything            Thepublicity of private hair is a long story it figures in the willingly shavenheads of ancient priests and modern skinheads in the punitive shearing of maleconvicts and female French collaborators in huge powdered wigs and elaboratelyextended curls or braids Politically charged hair doubtless dates straightback to humanitys first racial conflicts perhaps preceded by its earliestsocial conflicts Its the hair of the enemy that marks him as such as withthe flowing tresses of royalist Cavaliers effete tyrants and the cropped hairof parliamentary Roundheads crude thugs during the English Civil WarPartisan passion about hair has been keenest in gender politicsexpressedmainly by women cutting off their hair and by men growing itsince hair isuniversally erotic and has no function except as a vehicle of pleasure andmeaning The idea that men and women must wear differing coiffures goes verydeep since visible hair is what should reveal the invisible difference betweenthe bodies This shows up in pictures of Adam and Eve before the Fall wherehis hair is always rather short and hers is always very long and noticeable asif God had personally styled them that way from the beginning            For some years now women have been wearingdisorderly hair as a rulethe more chic the messier An insouciant infantilecarelessness seems to be the desired effect even if a welltailored suit iscovering a welltended body below the helterskelter head This custom suggestsnew stages in the old rebellion against religious strictures which oncedemanded that female hairdivinely ordained to be long and seductivebecovered up lest it incite lust In the modern West progressive slackening ofthose rules came to permit naked hair for women but only under visiblecontrolnot hidden but very welldressed in public Even short hair waseventually acceptable for women too but visibly careful grooming was stillthe rule for fashionable female heads until the last  years or so            Sincethen weve been having the mop and the shag and the mane and the haystack withstraight and curled long and short versions of each sometimes untidily caughtup in clamps and clasps and elastic bands Hair in historical movies is oftenthe same never mind the elaborately coiled and oiled evidence of history Itwould seem that the more powerful modern women feel the less they want theirhair to look submissiveand that includes neat By contrast the complexsystems of braids worn by many black women seem like elegant reincarnations ofancient Egyptian or Minoan practice a civilized display of effort madeprecise care taken beauty manifestly pursued and achieved in the most augusttradition            This idea is even fashionably acceptable for the chic faceand body and for certain clothes but not for modish hair Heaven forbid thatthe old teaseandspray routines should appear habitual to CarolynBessetteKennedy or the supermodels The look of money spent yesmops andhaystacks do actually need a constant attention that braids dont andelaborate processes for streaking and tinting and correctly disarranging themcan rack up a very noticeable tab But the overall impression must remain thatof no trouble taken whatsoever even to make a straight part so that the hairlooks as if sun and wind and some tumbling in bed were all it ever gotAnything too processed might smack of oppression or repression pretension orhypocrisy maybe acknowledged alliance with reactionary values the MargaretThatcher effect Coiffed hair is desirable for TV anchorwomen and politicalcandidates as a proper concession to masculine convention but not whenoffduty            Men have aharder time with their hair Censure for hairstyles has mostly fallen on mensince male appearance has forever mattered so much at war and work Detailedrules have much more often been applied to male rather than to femalearrangements As a result men are much more afraid of looking ridiculous thanwomen are since female fashion has risk built into it For mens hair thecosmic risk is the possible baldness haunting them all and that only adds tothe high tension attending male choices            Modern men have been saddled with an image ofstrong simplicity the neat suggestion of an upperclass sporting and militarymilieu That Ralph Laurenish note blends quite well with proletarian chic orthe skinhead aesthetic The visual keynote is sharp clarity so that theoverall norm is neat short hair give or take a few inches Long and flowingis occasional really messy is exceptional But dreadlocks aside modernpareddown male looks even daring ones will not permit any deliberatelyornamental curling and braiding and powdering and adorning of hair That mostlyleaves creative topiary with shearing and partial shearing included for thefantasy life of male hair            Flagrant dyeing for men isalso becoming more common following female practicebut not in themainstream out of which my academic friend is so eager to keep At an earlierperiod this same adventurous
