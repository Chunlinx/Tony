                                 Exit Andy Grove                           Time s Man of theYear announces hell be stepping down as CEO of the most powerful chip companyon the planet and the market doesnt even blink In fact investors send thecompanys stock higher Whats wrong with this picture            Actuallythe picture is just fine In fact in a curious way the markets reaction toIntel CEO Andy Groves announcement is the best testimony to Groves managerialgenius one can imagine For what Grove succeeded in doing at Intel was this Hemade the company stronger than just him His superfluity in that sensebecomes the measure of his mastery            To be sure superfluity overstates the case since Grovewill remain at Intel as chairman of the board while Craig Barrett who willbecome CEO May  has already been running much of the companys daytodaybusiness as president and chief operating officer As chairman Grove plans tocontinue playing a role in shaping Intels longterm strategy presumablyincluding its heavy investment in companies that are pushing the technologicaledge Groves abdication of his throne also loses some drama from the fact thatin recent years his public image has become that of a longrange thinker ratherthan a handson manager Especially since theres no Mrs Simpson in thepicture            SinceBarrett was christened the heir apparent years ago the succession should gosmoothly and all indications are that hes a more than capable executiveStill Groves announcement was certainly a surprise There was no hint of itin the press and hes only a couple of years older than Barrett though Grovehas had a much publicized bout with cancer But there was nary a ripple of badnews out of Intel when the announcement was made and the sense of seamlessnessthat Grove and Barrett have projected has transformed the whole thing into anelegant passing of the torch ceremony            In fact theres something invigorating aboutGroves decision precisely because hes going out at the top of his game Formost of his career at Intel Grove was if not anonymous then certainlyovershadowed by Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce technological whiz kids whocofounded the company in  They were the visionaries he was thenutsandbolts guy In the last three or four years though after Mooresretirement Noyce died in the s Grove was able to take on the visionaryrole even as he seems to have made a conscious choice to become a more publicfigure Magazines now wanted to know his thoughts about the future of computingand the Internet They became oddly fond of taking pictures in which his bodywas occluded by shadow while his face would be softly spotlit pictures thatmade Grove appear to be a mysterious man thinking very deep thoughts Which heprobably was            Thistransformation was also reflected in Groves writing In the late s hepublished an acclaimed engineering text Physics and Technology ofSemiconductor Devices  That one just missed getting on the bestsellerlist In the early s he published an exceptional book on managementtheory High Output Management  which combined a sophisticateddiscussion of the way companies should be organized with a surprisinglyconvincing analysis of how to evaluate and motivate workers Then two yearsago Grove published Only the Paranoid Survive  which lays out a kind ofSchumpeterian theory of major transformations in the business climate and triesto explain how to deal with them            Groves basic idea is that there are strategic inflectionpoints moments where the entire framework in which business has beenconducted is transformed and companies must adapt or die The arrival ofsuperstores in suburbia the introduction of the standalone PC the advent oftalkies in Hollywood All these were strategic inflection points In each casethose companies that recognized the changes and adjusted to them flourishedwhile those that didnt floundered and eventually went under            As mightbe expected Groves description of past strategic inflection points is moreconvincing than his recipe for recognizing such moments in the future Butwhats especially striking is the way in which the evolution of his booksfromengineering to management to theories of changetracks his evolution as apublic figure The Andy Grove of High                Output                Managementcouldnt have been Time s Man of the Year The Andy Grove of Only theParanoid Survive could            In that sense its hard to see what more Grovehad to accomplish as CEO of Intel The companys stock price isnt at itsalltime high but in every other way its among the most productiveprofitable and acclaimed companies in the world Its fourth onFortune s mostadmiredcompanies list And without giving too muchweight to Time  its not likely that a corporate leaderother than BillGates of courseis going to garner more mainstream attention than a Man ofthe Year cover Ted Williams retired after hitting a home run in his lastatbat Groves doing something similar except that thanks to thechairmanship he has the advantage of stepping aside gracefully without reallydisappearing            Still theres a certainirony in Groves ascent to elder statesman because the idea of him as shaperof the future makes it easy to miss how much Grove and Intel were products ofwhats now described as the corporate past Intel is not after all a virtualcompany It doesnt outsource all its production It doesnt have a brand nameas its only real asset It doesnt have  people in its corporate headquartersrunning the whole operation Its not what management theorist Tom Peters seesas the company of the future a floating networkcrap game Instead Intelmakes real things It builds enormously expensive plants that employbluecollar workers even if they are wearing bunny suits It invests heavilyin research and development And it is hugely productive which is to say thatit makes goods that are more valuablein a real sensethan the sum of thevarious things that go into making them            To say that Grove is aproduct of the past then is to say only that what Grove has done at Intel ismore like what Alfred Sloan did at General Motors than what CEOs of Internetcompanies or Silicon Valley startups think theyre doing today Intels successunder Grove though should give pause to advocates of this freefloatingnomanager noemployee justfreeagents new economy were supposedly livingin For what Grove has done exceptionally well is manage What has allowedIntel to dominate its many competitors who are perennially nipping at itsheels with computer chips that are supposedly faster or cheaper is that Inteldoes a much better job of making chips reliably and efficiently And what hasmade Intel such a stable company over the past decade has been Groves abilityto plan for change and adapt to it while holding the overall framework steadyThe ease of Barretts succession to CEO is the ultimate expression of this ofcourse As Noyce and Moore did before him Grove led Intel brilliantly withoutmaking it dependent upon him He helped fashion an institution bigger thanhimself And thats why theres nothing at all wrong with this picture
