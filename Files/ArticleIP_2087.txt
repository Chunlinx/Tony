                                 Is The Kiss Really So Awful            I blurbed The Kiss The book scared me not because it concerns incest or happens to be true butbecause of the malign figure of the father who reminded me of the characterplayed by Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter  I also appreciatedthe drugged cadence of the prose with a chasm between every two sentences andthe frozen stare of the insistent present tense I know Kathryn and ColinHarrison having encountered them professionally and socially we live in thesame neighborhood but literary New York is a small town anyway but I dontknow them well enough for it to carry gossip value I judged The Kiss asa book            ObviouslyI was well aware of the holyshit factor sufficiently high that it could swampall discussion and become the sole focus of criticism But I naivelyunderestimated its effect imagining a bunch of dumb reviews and one or twohandwringing oped pieces Instead came a flood of both with a tone that rosefrom shrill to vindictive People went out of their way to attack not just thebooksome candidly admitted they hadnt bothered to read itbut Harrisonpersonally and her husband her agent and her publishers for goodmeasure            Bad publicity is better than none of course but after atime you could no longer ignore an odor of smoke and it wasnt your usualbookchat roast It began to seem like a witch trial Harrison has been accusedof being a liar an opportunist a traitor to all segments of her family anunfit mother to have written the book solely for the money or theattentioneverything short of having fucked her father in order to write aboutit The Kiss has been called slimy repellent meretricious cynicalby Jonathan Yardley in the Washington Post  and things to that effect bysundry others The New Republic s teaser triumphantly reads JamesWolcott Smacks Kathryn Harrison in the Kisser            No tort istoo trivial for the prosecutors Take selfplagiarism a welldocumentedfailing among writers of all sizes In Harrisons case it became thecenterpiece of a multiplecount indictment handed down by Michael Shnayerson inthe February Vanity Fair  the fallout of which was that The NewYorker killed a scheduled excerpt The publisher attempting damagecontrol rushed the book into stores two months before the publication dateSelfplagiarism is usually a consideration for critics not feature writers atextual weakness not a matter of morals            Theres no question that the book is a long wayfrom perfect But literary matters are not of much interest to the peanutgalleryselfplagiarism is an exception because it sounds like a crimeComment has instead tended to focus on familial betrayal dubious motives andthe moral sink that is the memoir today            There arethose who fret about the effect on her two young children While this isreasonable it is worth noting that Harrison has said she wanted to publish thebook now before our children were any older and more aware of the mediaaround them She has a point The dogs bark the caravan passes The furorwill be over long before the kids are able to understand it the spotlightwould only be harsher if they were older and the subject itself would eithercome up or be repressed to everyones detriment            Some people are worried that Harrisons father is stillalive the book could hurt him These tend to be the same people who describethe relationship as consensual a word that could not occur to anyone who hasread the book Of course there are men who seem to think that rape is a sexact rather than an act of violence But the very notion of incest the lasttaboo unhinges readers and they transfer blame onto Harrison in effectaccusing her of having engineered her own defilement Shnayerson calls thebooks sexual inexplicitness either proper  or a tease Besides blamingthe victim this attitude is also provincial and illiterate if notdisingenuous            Weresitting at the tail end of the century of William Burroughs and GeorgesBataille and The Story of O  a century in which literature would seem tohave shed its last gratuitous prohibitions It is also a century in whichfatherdaughter incest continues all around and not just up in the hills Butyoud think judging from the press that recent authors of memoirs had calledincest or alcoholism or any number of species of abuse into being by writingabout them When the reaction is not fauxnaf it is censorious Shut upand sublimate  Practitioners of selfexposure are many these days ofcourse and none of them is JeanJacques Rousseau Literature might be betterserved if rage or remorse were diverted into parlor comedy Who knows Againthat isnt the point for many of your bienpensants  who fear mess andcomplication more than they care about the state of literature            Aknownothing cynicism is pervasive nowEverybody wants the inside scoop the shoddy truth that lies at the core of alldecisions Accordingly it is widely believed that books are always planned andwritten with marketing in mind Fortunately or not though calculation usuallyresults in failure and for most writers the foolproof concept that brieflyshone at conception looks like a mirage within three days at the keyboard Alsounderfoot is the venerable cousin Don theory of literatureyou know Yourea writer You should meet my cousin Don Hes got a story that will make youboth rich The cantmiss story is the Northwest Passage of letters a mythThere are only  possible plot situations as  th centuryplaywright Carlo Gozzi determined and we already know them all            And then there is the vexedquestion of memoir vs novel Critics are as frantic about saving their novelthese days as they were about killing it  years ago Their panic isreminiscent of the moral defenses of painting that were worked up whenphotography began to look like a threat That debacle should have taught theworld that media can coexist and that artists can even migrate between themdepending on the flavor they seek The analogy is imperfect because theresno fixed line of demarcation between fiction and nonfiction only a broad grayfield And anyway who cares whether your kitchensink epic features shortfat Mom and Dad or tall thin contract players As Andr Breton wrote offictionalization of actual events I do not regard such a thing as childish Iregard it as monstrous I insist on knowing the names on being interested onlyin books left ajar like doors I will not go looking for keys Fiction hasits glories but concealment is merely squalid            Kathryn Harrisons status asvoodoo doll has nothing to do with the actual merits or failings of her bookbut is entirely owing to how economically her case concentrates the fearsresentments misconceptions and idiocies prevailing right now It alsoreflects the fact that most cultural journalists are under constant pressurewhether from above or from within to whip up instant controversies tied tosome product on the shelf Theyre over quickly and forgotten by allexceptperhaps their often hapless targets In the meantime they dont tend toelevate discourse
