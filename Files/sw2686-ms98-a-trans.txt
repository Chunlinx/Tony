        so how do you keep abreast of the worlds happenings   when im driving to work i listen to a radio station which is twenty four hour news and thats how i get most of my stuff that gives me about uh thirty minutes thirty five minutes each way each day so thats about an hour and  hour and ten minutes worth of   what stations that   uh KRLD   KRLD i listen to uh ninety point one which is KERA   yeah   so uh thats the same way i do it i drive about thirty minutes to work twenty minutes actually so listen to that going and coming   yeah uh i dont usually watch the news at night time because uh im you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner its already over and   uhhuh what a deal   yeah   well do you feel like youre kept abreast   pretty much yeah because they have the uh CBS uh world news on on the hour on the radio so i get all of that stuff then plus i get all the local news   uhhuh well what do you think about the US telling the Iraqis to get out of their camp areas   uh what do you think i dont know thats pretty strange   its a its a different bold move i mean uh with still regardless if we won the war or not its still uh the country is Iraq   yeah you know i mean uh with with like with regard to the Soviet Union were telling the uh Soviets you know hey the Baltic States wanna separate go ahead and let us separate thatll be good you know what what if the American south wanted to separate like they tried to do in eighteen sixties would we be so forgiving and say ah sure go ahead form your own country   uhhuh exactly   you know i mean  seems kind of hypocritical hypocritical of us to to be telling other countries to like go ahead and let part of their country separate off you know and Gorbachev hes the one who wants to keep his country together which i can understand you know     umhum yeah   and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the Soviet Union i dont blame them either   umhum yeah its its an interesting uh kind of a catch twenty two   its not something thats something that they got to work out for themselves we shouldnt be involved in that we shouldnt even be talking about it you know the government should just stay away from them people and just let them figure out for themselves what they need to do   that that is uh that is a bit difficult   yeah Bush should not do anything but as as as for the rest of but though i dont you know we get the paper on the weekend   umhum   and ill ill flip through that you know once or twice but not  wont wont read it cover to cover   umhum   and uh   do you read T News at work   yeah   yeah thats uh i used to read that all the time   i do that all everyday so thats another way but thats mainly you know that doesnt have like a whole lot just a few things on there which is   uhhuh did you notice what TI stock closed at today i didnt either   huh i didnt see it   i hear its forty two though yeah no it well a couple of weeks probably about a week ago it was at forty seven   is that right is that up wow   but that was uh i believe because of the stockholders meeting   shouldve sold   yeah exactly exactly   the building i was in well it guess you work for TI too   pardon me   i guess you work for TI too   i did until December   oh   and uh thats how come i dont read T News anymore   yeah you got surplused i got i got surplused last year myself yeah   did you thats thats great  did you just find a a place in another   yeah another organization yeah they   another TI organization   they needed somebody just like me whereas before i was not even doing what i was supposed been doing but uh thats not thats not the topic i guess but uh     thats kind of interesting that they can you know say get out of here in one second and then the other side say come on over here   yeah   so that worked out pretty well for you i was talking talking to a guy from Colorado Springs yesterday who is   it did quite a bit better   implied or inferred definitely that he has been surplused from up there and he didnt know what he wanted to do hes been with TI for fifteen years   yeah oh gosh   so its uh and hes a nonexempt uh he doesnt know what hes gonna do theyre just shutting down the whole plant up there   yeah yeah its gonna be a tough time for all around the country i mean you look at the  look in the paper and you see all the stuff about you know layoffs here layoffs there and you think oh man whats gonna happen   exactly uhhuh   you know thank goodness General Dynamics got that big contract because thatll least bring some money to the area   right who who got the contract   General Dynamics and Lockheed and Boeing   oh well yeah i always get mixed up whos their partners with that late latest deal   Lockheed and Boeing on this   is it Lockheed and Boeing   yeah but Lockheed i used to work for Lockheed and at the time i was there they were developing the prototype for the uh that fighter   uhhuh   and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so   so GD didnt get it or is not associated     well theyre theyre in in partnership with uh Lockheed and and Boeing yeah its a its a threesome   oh they are okay so its i thought it was Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas or was that uh Northrop   no McDonnell Douglas lost out they lost the contract they were in partnership with Northrop and they lost the contract and so   okay yeah thatll be a biggie i wonder what they do with those planes now that theyve made as uh test   yeah   test plane   probably sell to somebody who wants to pay for i dont know   yeah becomes a new corporate jet   yeah there you go old Jerry can use that   there you go yeah exactly alrighty well its been good talking to you     yes have a good day bye   okay you too bye
