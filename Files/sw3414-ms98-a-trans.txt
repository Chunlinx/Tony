                 okay were on uh recycling and uh   yes   i am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does i know that we uh   umhum   they ask us to bundle our newspapers and we do that and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff   i see   but now Plano has quite an elaborate system dont they   yeah they do uh it started out several years ago when they put these uh collection sites   umhum   they uh near a WalMart near a the football stadium and the like and they just couldnt believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up these huge dumpsters were being filled up in a in a matter of a week so they knew that there was something going on here so they started looking into programs and what we have now it they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week   umhum   they make a collection on Monday for yard waste and the yard waste has to be put in the special bag thats a decomposable paper sack   uhhuh   its a pretty good size its maybe the size of two or three um grocery bags   oh   and we put that out by the street and they collect those on Monday and then on Wednesday we put out two containers that they gave us one containers a huge green monstrous thing that a uh a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck so and thats where you put your regular um garbage and trash   okay   and then also that same day you put out a small tub uh its maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide and you put just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper and then they   okay and then they recycle they separate it   exactly they have a big truck that has like ten uh not ten maybe five big doors on the side of it they throw the different stuff in the different doors   oh thats a neat system   yeah it is and apparently its you know it it went off pretty much without a hitch the trucks the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war   oh uhhuh   that the the trucks were being the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other but it it does work pretty well   well i know our son and daughterinlaw live in Plano and i know they have commented on the system i dont know that they know that it worked that way but they have the two separate containers and stuff   oh yes uhhuh i noticed something interesting the last time i guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up i happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the that tub stuff and the man who was doing the separating when he was done emptying the tub he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub so they must be collecting information about who does it and how often   oh that is interesting does i wonder if that means that if you dont do it   yeah umhum   you suppose they will  come and knock on your door and   i i dont know but i think thats a really interesting question   that that is interesting you know will you be penalized if you dont will you you know uh   yeah that that seems farfetched only because it it it theres no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs so there theres its possible that there is a person in Plano that doesnt buy any of those three things   right right   and therefore wouldnt have   thats true except that its hard to match and you know when you have uh cans you know from the the market and uh you know vegetable cans and et cetera and     right no they wont take vegetable cans just just the aluminum pop cans   oh they dont take vegetable cans this is just their aluminum cans well then yes it is possible thats interesting i wonder uh   yeah   huh   yeah what theyre doing with that   wouldnt you really like to know   i would someday im sure well find out     im sure you know if nothing else call the sanitation department say okay what are you doing reading you know   yeah umhum so tell me what your feelings on recycling is it do you think this is a good thing or silly   i think its a very good thing i think that uh i think it helps that the city is giving you a nudge to do it because i think there are a lot of people that dont do it and i cant say that my husband and i are real real conscientious we got started on the aluminum cans because our uh   yes   grandson was collecting them uh to raise money and uh stuff for an organization he was in so we started collecting them and now hes through so weve weve just weve kept on   huh yes yeah   and its interesting too that we have to drive we drive to Plano up Plano Road to uh just inside your city limits to you know turn them in to dump them in i sure theres bound to be some here in Richardson but we just havent really seen them advertised or you know something and   dump them off yeah and that is interesting right yeah well the Plano yeah the Plano newspaper each each day in fact has a a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things they publish it every single day   well thats interesting   yeah and phone numbers and and that kind of stuff   umhum well i havent noticed uh i havent noticed Richardson you know making that big a deal
