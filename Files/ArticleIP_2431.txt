                                 Cracking Gods Code            What would convince you thatGod exists A miraculous recovery from a fatal illness Or would that proveonly the astonishing resilience of the body An atheist friend struck bylightning Could be mere coincidence But how about scientificevidencerigorously tested peerreviewed unrefuted scientific evidencethatthe Bible prophesies events that occurred thousands of years after it waswritten            Thissounds preposterous of course like some latenight spiritual infomercial Andyet such evidence may exist A few years ago three Israeli scientistsconducted a computer experiment to test the existence of Torahcodessequences in the Bible that spell out hidden messages about futureevents When the statisticians crunched their data they reached an astonishingconclusion The hidden messages exist and their presence is not due tochance In  a distinguished journal called Statistical Sciencepublished their paper Now three years later the results still standundebunked Its an unnerving prospect If the study is true science hashinted at the existence of God has suggested that God wrote the Hebrew Torahand has undermined our notion of free will Either the experiment is flawed orthe world has experienced a revelation            Back when the natural sciences philosophy and theologywere one great intellectual hodgepodge proving the existence of God was arelatively commonplace exercise To the modern mind however science andreligion talk past each other Except for the few Biblical literalists whospout drivel about creation science most of us now scoff at the notion ofusing science to bolster religion            The search for the Torahcodes is rooted in the unfathomable theological premise that the Torahitselfa set of five books of limited lengthcontains literally all truth TheTorah a k a the Five Books of Moses consists of Genesis Exodus LeviticusNumbers and Deuteronomy This is not an overstatement The Torah in otherwords is supposed to containsomehow and somewhereeverything from yourSocial Security number to the names of all the people youve ever slept withas well as what you ate for breakfast the next morning            Accordingto Rabbi Daniel Mechanic an expert on the codes the belief that the Torahcontains encrypted messages dates to the medieval practitioners of theKabbalah a form of Jewish mysticism The Kabbalists believed that there were coding schemes in the Torah One of them was equidistant letter sequencesELSs Choose every  th letter from the first Hebrew T called aTaf in Genesis for example and youll find the word Torah Do the samein Exodus and youll find it again This ELS doesnt appear however in theTorahs other three books The current emphasis on ELSs stems from anobservation by a  th century rabbi that pairs of conceptuallyrelated words are bunched together in ELSs True believers have spent hourscounting out ciphers then trying to puzzle out the significance of therevealed codes            Not that the codes ever attracted much of afollowing Most Jews have never heard of them and most of those who havediscount them as embarrassing numerological hogwash Even many Orthodox Jewsregard the codes as a kind of parlor trick that is irrelevant to the essence ofJudaism Besides the codes claim is so fantastical that dismissing it as apiece of intellectual knavery may just be the most reasonableas well as themost comfortablesolution But what if they do exist            Ofcourse any text of sufficient length is riddled with accidental ELSs If youlook hard enough you can discover all sorts of hidden messages So EliyahuRips of Hebrew Universitys math department and two other scholars DoronWitztum and Yoav Rosenberg designed an elaborate experiment to test whetherthere are real codes embedded in the Torah They programmed computers to scourGenesis for ELSs naming  famous rabbis and their dates of birth or death Therabbis on the list were all born long after Genesis was written so no humanauthor could have deliberately encoded them into the text Moreover the rabbiswere chosen according to an arbitrary criterion so the scientists were notlooking for names they already knew to be present As a control the authorsperformed exactly the same experiment on a few scrambled versions of Genesison the book of Isaiah which while biblical is not a book of the Torah andon a Hebrew translation of War and Peace             If the phenomenon were due to chance the authors reasonedthey would be as likely to find an ELS naming Rabbi X near one identifying thebirthday of Rabbi Y as they would be to find Rabbi X near his own birthdayAnd indeed this is what they found in the control texts But it wasnt truefor Genesis Not only were most of the rabbis present in ELSs but theygenerally appeared closer to their own dates than to the dates of other rabbisWhen the scientists analyzed their data they found a in possibilitythat such a coding scheme could have occurred as a result of chance            They sent their paper toStatistical Science  where it was peer reviewed The editors puzzledover it and finally in  they published it The article attractedsurprisingly little public attention considering its potentially mammothsignificance The Associated Press ran a wire story and the magazine BibleReview published a longer piece and that was about it for media coverageBut the paper did not escape the attention of the faithful The Internet isfrothing with missionaries bent on using the codes to woo unbelievers Oneevangelical Christian site describes the codes as unrefutable scientificevidence the Bible is Gods word Another site claims somewhat more gentlythat the mysterious Hebrew codes have identified Jesus as the MessiahAccording to Mechanic the codes cannot be read as any sort of window on theTorahs inner meaning They have nothing to do with the religion nothing todo with spirituality All they can do is validate the hypothesis that theauthor of the Torah is not human            Acquaintances of mine have become Orthodox because of the codes I also know ofone man who waited until Statistical Science agreed to publish thearticle before circumcising his son            Statisticians continue to hope for a crack inthe experiment Robert Kass executive editor of Statistical Science suggests that the authors may have subconsciously biased their results byselectively reporting their findings Every statistician I know has reactedthat the most likely explanation is that some kind of selection or tuning ofthe method did take place though the authors may not be conscious of it hesays            But sofar the only serious challenge to the published work comes from an Australianmathematician named Brendan McKay who has replicated the experiment and claimsto have found defects McKays draft report notes that the effect described inGenesis does not appear to exist in the other four books of the Torah He alsoidentifies a number of highly technical problems with the experiment that hesays render it meaningless            McKays critique remains only a draft however and it hasnot yet undergone the rigorous peer review that the original paper withstoodStill his report raises potent questions about the Torah codes methodologyquestions even Rips acknowledges to be serious But Rips appears eager toaddress the challenge In a recent email message to McKay he welcomed thecritique and agreed that more prosaic explanations needed to be examinedbefore the Torah codes phenomenon could be ascribed to God            No matter how this discussionshakes out the Torah codes paper seems fundamentally unlike any previousattempt to use science to prove a metaphysical point No similar claim has everwithstood scientific examination as robustly as the Torah codes have            Whats more until someonepublishes a peerreviewed paper that demolishes them at least a smidgen ofdoubt remains a floating question mark What if God did write the Torah Thenwhat
