                                 What Is Hillarys Deal            Last week I was included ina group of journalists invited by Hillary Clinton for an offcamera butontherecord dialogue about the administrations plans for celebrating themillennium This session attracted an unusual amount of interest because itwas the first time the first lady was going to have to face questions fromreporters about the sex scandal As we filed into the Map Room familiar fromthe White House coffee videos we were told that she would entertain questionsthat didnt have to do with the millennium toward the end of the hour            The first lady arriveddressed in a pale but intense yellow suit and proceeded to circumnavigate theroom and greet everyone She then sat down at the head of the table and forabout  minutes explained with help from a few others what the White HouseMillennium Council has planned It intends to perform a number of good worksmostly historical in nature such as restoring the flag that inspired FrancisScott Key to compose The Star Spangled Banner and conserving the originalDeclaration of Independence and other documents At last Helen Thomas of UPIwho had been looking rather agitated piped up            How do you think thepresidents bearing up            I think hes doing verywell Helen the first lady responded a bit awkwardly            Is it hard            Wellwere working on a lot of very important things Hillary said Hes beenspending a lot of time speaking to leaders around the world and consulting withhis political and diplomatic and military advisers about the situation in IraqAnd thats the primary thing on his mind right now            The interview was going nowhere Although Hillary wasprepared to answer tough questions reporters didnt seem to have the stomachto ask themor at least I didnt To interrogate Hillary about the news ofthe daya report in the Washington Post that a Secret Service agent hadseen Bill and Monica alone together in the Oval Officewould have seemed toadd insult to the injury she presumably had suffered at the hands of herhusband already But then someone pitched her a softball that elicited what Ithink is the most inadvertently revealing thing she has said on the subject todate Hillary was asked whether she was surprised and perhaps gratified bythe publics response to the situation For her complete answer click             Thisanswer was most of all revealing for what Hillary in a lengthy discourse didnot say In explaining why the American people were supporting her husbanddespite plausible allegations of a sexual relationship with an intern andperhaps of a coverup she did not claim that it was because her husband haddone nothing wrong or that it was because the American people believed hisdenials Indeed the first lady did not even assert that she believedhis denials Rather she made a version of the point that many pundits havemade in recent weeks The country has thrived under Clintons leadership andthe American people are savvy enough to weighand here the argument remainedimplicithis character flaws against his record as president            This answer points to something many peoplehave long suspected that there is a psychological bargain if not a literalone involved in Hillarys continuing to stand by her man Reading a bit moreinto her answer one might understand that she is furious at her husband butstays with him out of respect for what he is capable of and out of calculatedselfinterest In other words Hillarys deal with her husband may resemblewhat has emerged as the American publics deal with him writ small            But whatstruck me during the interview is that for all the speculation nobody reallyhas any idea what she thinks Does Hillary Clinton believe her husbandsdenials Does she love him despise him or both Do they have an open marriagein which his extracurricular activity is accepted or is each new revelation apainful surprise to her We all project our own views and experiences onto theFirst Marriage But there is no indication that anyone including even closeClinton friends has any idea whats inside Hillarys head What she knows andwhat she thinks determines whether she is a victim or an accomplice alongsuffering spouse or a kind of coconspirator Remaining an enigma lets herretain the benefit of the doubt So long as we dont know we cant reallyjudge            The key question may be not what Hillary knew but when sheknew it She surely is aware that her husband was unfaithful to her before hebecame presidenthe admitted as much on national television She may havethought however that she was giving him another chance and that he waspromising in exchange to do better It may have come as an awful surprise toher to discoverassuming it is truethat her husband was still screwingaround after he was elected There are degrees of knowledge of course Hillarycould have known in detail known in general not wanted to know or truly hadno idea And she might not care be hurt but not surprised or be deeply hurtand surprised Here is a grid that expresses the four basic possibilities                         Lets consider each of these beginning in thenortheast corner and moving clockwise If she didnt know that her husband wasstill fooling around after his election in  but does care it seems to meshe is in the most sympathetic of the available positions She would be in thesame spot as many members of the press and public who thought that Clinton hadmade a tacit agreement to quit fooling around for the duration of hispresidency for the sake of common sense if not common decency On learningthat her husband had not lived up to his half of the bargain Hillary would bevery upset But she would also realize that she couldnt leave him while he wasin the White House in part because her tenure is coterminal with his If shemade a mistaken bet that her husband could reform she is now in the positionof a Siamese twin If his presidency dies her quasicopresidency dies withit            If onthe other hand she didnt know but also didnt much care that would suggestan immoral alliance  la JFK and Jackie In fact such a bargain might bedeemed much more ruthless in the Clintons case as the wifes reason fortolerating her husbands misbehavior would probably be less a desire to keep updecent appearances than a desire to gain and retain power herself If this isthe way it is Hillary has used her husband for the sake of her own career asmuch as he has used her to advance his This wouldnt leave much ground forsympathy            If Hillary knew what her husband was up to and didnt careher position is even worse If she knew her husband was going to continue tophilander and agreed to help him pretend that he had reformed and become a goodhusband she has been a party to a hoax If accepting a faithless husband washer price of power as Margaret Talbot recently argued in the NewRepublic  she would be his accomplice not only in a fraud on the publicbut also perhaps in what most people would recognize as sexualharassment            But whatif Hillary knew or at least strongly suspected that her husband hadntchanged and did care She would be both victim and accomplicefurious at himyet for reasons of the heart or reasons of power or both unwilling to bringhim to book She would be in the morally ambivalent position of the abusedspouse both deserving of sympathy and responsible for her own failure to actIf I had to guess Id guess that this is the contradictory position she isactually in But I repeat When it comes to what Hillary Clinton thinks no onereally has a clue            Was HillaryClinton surprised by the publics response to the situation Click for herfull answer
