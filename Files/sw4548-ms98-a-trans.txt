        well actually uh       i i dont think im in the uh uh majority of in in Texas i dont think i agree with no uh i wouldnt say that i think i would have said that a few years ago when i was younger i thought it was a   oh really you dont believe in it   a sign of a civilized society if you didnt have uh capital punishment but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion   yeah   im not thoroughly opposed to it i still think its sort of true that a a more civilized society wouldnt have to use capital punishment but im beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought   you sound a lot like a friend of mine a a girl i hang out with she has very   uhhuh   very black and white opinions you know theres no gray in her opinions you know she she probably would agree more with you but but i dont know i think i would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the  opportunity to get out and do it again ive never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what theyve done and we see that more and more like in our state right now theres a fourteen year old boy who   yeah   raped and then killed a seven year old girl you know thats fourteen years old whats he going to be doing when he turns into an adult   uhhuh yeah i certainly dont uh advocate turning people like that loose   yeah   im not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail but uh   no it doesnt but it costs less     yeah thats a factor   and yeah to me it is i mean i work and i pay my taxes and i lived out in Texas for a little while and theyre it thats a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia i mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in Georgia but even in Georgia thats the attitude for the most part if i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and wed get along just fine   uhhuh yeah   but when ive got to work to pay my dues and your dues   yeah   then i dont like you very much anymore   yeah well i the cost is something but its i think its relatively unimportant compared to whats the most effective way of dealing with crime and i guess uh i would like i dont know the European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment and they dont have a they dont have a crime problem either no you cant they dont execute anybody in Britain   oh really   or France and i dont believe they do in Germany or Italy either  and they dont have the crime problems we do i dont really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two   yeah   i guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when i see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing and the that that bothers me but it but uh   you might be right i mean i id hate to be the person to pull the switch you know i would never in a million years want that job but i do believe its necessary and i on the one hand i i guess i admire the person who has the     hum yeah   guts to do it because i couldnt i couldnt stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing and i couldnt pull the switch but i   huh well actually i what the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i dont really think it uh i dont really think its a subject um very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else i think it just becomes a uh  symbolic im tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so   yeah   i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh like i said some years ago i think i would have said theres no place for capital punishment in the   right   civilized western country now im im not so sure of that im i i wouldnt vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around   uhhuh what whats making you become more convinced that it might be a   uh i guess im im my view of   good way of punishing   uh my im beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh um executing people maybe its more a symbolic gesture that um um than anything else and uh   yeah   ive also never been a victim although i have some i have two friends whose wives were murdered and uh   oh gosh  yes if it ever touched my family   i can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
