                    Introduction        In recent years the incidence of breast cancer has        become one of the most rapidly increaing among malignant        tumours With progress in understanding of the nature of        breast cancer diagnosis and treatments have been improved        Chemotherapy has become more and more important and is        considered to be a major treatment to avoid the recurrence        of cancer after surgery   Although the remission rate        is higher in previously untreated patients relapse occurs        soon It has been reported that most initially responsive        patients acquire a multidrug resistance MDR phenotype        Some other patients show MDR even in their first treatment        In metastatic breast cancer the development of a MDR        phenotype is primarily responsible for insensitivity to a        new drug          Attention has been focused recently on the study of the        agents for reversing MDR Although hundreds of compounds        have been found         in vitro to be able to modulate the        MDR phenotype their clinical application was limited owing        to high toxicity         in vivo  The key to the clinical use        of reversal agents therefore lies in searching for agents        with low toxicity and high reversal activity   In the        past many progestogen compounds such as MG and        medroxyprogesterone have been shown to have reversal        effects         in vitro             Unfortunately the effective concentration to reverse drug        resistance         in vivo is very difficult to achieve          Nomegestrol NOM a derivative of megestrol MG        has very low toxicity There is almost no incidence of        liver lesions pituitoryinhibiting activity cortisollike        activity or oestrogenlike activity which are common in        other progestogen compounds   NOM might therefore be        suitable for clinical use        In many previous studies on MDR reversal by compounds        related to NOM attention has been paid to the modulation        of Pglycoprotein Pgp function The reversal mechanism        consists of for example binding directly to Pgp        inhibiting the transport function of drug efflux        increasing the intracellular accumulation of the drug and        changing lipid mobility in the plasma membrane             However different compounds have different        mechanisms No results on the reversal effect of NOM or on        its mechanism were available The present study was        directed to the reversal activity of NOM on MDR in        adriamycin ADRresistant MCFADR cells and to compare        NOM with classic reversal agents verapamil VRP        tamoxifen TAM droloxifene DRO and MG A possible        reversal mechanism was explored by studying the cell cycle        intracellular drug accumulation and the expression of mRNA        and proteins of MDR glutathione Stransferase Pi GST        MDRrelated protein MRP and topoisomerase II        TopoII                    Materials and methods                  Cell line and cell culture          The cell lines MCFWT ADRsensitive and MCFADR          were used in this study they were obtained from NCI            and maintained in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium          incubated at C in  CO             air at high humidity and          passaged every  days Cells

         without MTT was set up and subtracted from the test well          absorbance The absorbance of untreated controls was          taken as  survival and the percentage inhibition was

towards the          two cell lines In MCFADR cells treated with NOM  M          for  days the cell growth rate was normal compared with          control cells as judged by staining with trypan blue          The results showed that   and  M NOM significantly          increased the sensitivity of MCFADR cells to ADR the          degrees of reversal being fold fold and fold          respectively Fig b The reversal activity of            and  M NOM was markedly stronger than that of the same          concentration of DRO and MG Fig  and was similar to          that of the classic agents VRP and TAM In MCFWT cells          neither NOM nor other reversal compounds increased          chemosensitivity to ADR Table                           MDRrelated gene expression in NOMtreated          cells

The expression of both mRNA            species began to decrease on the second day              P  and             P   respectively and            reached the lowest level on the third day both

expression level of TopoII          protein MCFWT cells expressed a high level of TopoII          only Pgp and GST protein expression were undetectable          After treatment with NOM the expression

        whose TopoII protein expression was found before and          after NOM treatment in either MCFADR or MCFWT cells          The effects of NOM on the expression of drug resistance

ADR in MCFADR cells was much          less than in MCFWT cells Each cell line was treated          with   and  M NOM Marked increases in          intracellular ADR accumulation were found in MCFADR          cells the increases being fold fold and          fold respectively However NOM did not increase ADR          accumulation in MCFWT cells Fig  FCM analysis was          performed in MCFADR cells treated for  h with ADR          alone or in combination with  M NOM The results          showed that when the ADR concentration was increased from           M to  M only a small increase in arrested cells at          the G            M phase was found in MCFADR cells          treated with ADR alone However when ADR was used in          combination with  M NOM a marked arrest was seen NOM          alone failed to induce any change in the cell cycle Fig          and Table                             Discussion        The overexpression of Pgp in tumour cell membrane is        considered to be the major mechanism of MDR Pgp is able        to pump various anticancer drugs out of cells thus        resulting in a low intracellular drug concentration that is        insufficient to kill tumour cells   To use compounds        with low toxicity or with none at all to bind Pgp and        block its transport function is the most common method of        reversing MDR   Progesterone and MG belong to the        progestogen group Although progesterone is not a substrate        for Pgp it can directly bind to Pgp and block the        transport of drug efflux   MG is a strong reversal        agent its capacity to increase intracellular accumulation        of vincristine is fold that of progesterone          Previous results have shown that a daily dose of  mg MG        resulted in a plasma concentration of  M   however        to reverse MDR  M is necessary in theory Because high        doses of MG induce vomiting oedema dizziness and        androgenlike sideeffects the ideal effective        concentration is difficult to obtain         in vivo  Therefore the search for        new drugs with low toxicity is in progress to meet an        urgent need for clinical applications        NOM is a progestogen compound used in family planning        In recent years biological activities other than        contraception have been found   Animal experiments        have demonstrated that NOM has almost no toxicity Its full        chemical name is        diketomethylhydroxynorpregnadiene                 The present study has demonstrated that NOM        significantly sensitizes the MCFADR cell line to ADR in a        concentrationdependent manner but has no similar effect        on MCFWT cells The reversal effects of   and  M        NOM were fold fold and fold respectively The        enhancement of chemosensitivity to ADR by NOM was stronger        than that by MG a precursor of NOM at corresponding        concentrations          P  The reversal effect of        NOM was similar to that of VRP which is a classical        reversal agent with a high reversal activity NOM therefore        also has a strong reversal activity        Both TAM and DRO are antioestrogen agents TAM is a        firstline drug used in endocrinotherapy for breast cancer        Antioestrogens can inhibit Pgp function by binding it          In our study the effect of NOM was significantly        greater than that of DRO        The development of MCFADR cells was induced by        treating MCFWT with ADR Its MDR phenotype is not altered        after  months of serial passaging in drugfree medium           MCFADR cells have been demonstrated to        overexpress MDRPgp as well as the GST and MRP genes        They are therefore good cell models for studying the effect        of NOM on breast cancer MDR        Semiquantitative RTPCR analysis is a sensitive and        specific method    A variety of methods using        either quantitative or semequantitative RTPCR have been        used to determine relative initial target mRNA levels in        samples However in all of these methods undefined        variations in amplification complicated the interpretation        of results Most investigators use internal amplification        standards in an attempt to correct for variations between        tubes In the present study as in many other studies we        chose to use endogenous standards The reference mRNA and        target mRNA are usually processed together throughout the        experiments from RNA extraction until PCR amplification        This tends to minimize differences in RNA yields between        samples        It has been considered that the overexpression of        MDRPgp is a major mechanism of MDR in tumour cells          A few studies have reported that some reversal agents        can inhibit MDRPgp expression Stein         et al   have found that cytokines        such as interleukin interferon and tumour necrosis        factor were capable of decreasing the expression of MDR        mRNA in the colon carcinoma cell lines HCT and HCT Liu                et al   treated MCFADR cells        with the Chinese herb         Fructus psoraleae for  h and found        that Pgp expression became undetectable However no        results on whether or not progestogen can modulate the        expression of MDRPgp have been reported The present        study has demonstrated that NOM significantly inhibited        MDRPgp expression on the third day after treatment The        MDR mRNA expression level was very low and that of Pgp        almost ceased        It is worthy to note that on the fifth day after NOM        treatment the expression of MDRPgp began to increase        again This phenomenon was also observed when treating        colon carcinoma cell line with cytokines   Some        studies have also found that Pgp antagonists such as VRP        cyclosporin A and reserpine could induce MDRPgp        expression in the colon carcinoma cell line LSAd           A few papers have reported MDR expression after        treatment with progesterone Lee         et al   showed that progesterone        interacted with Pgp inducing its expression in the        granulose cell in preovulatory follicles to modulate        steroid efflux Our results show that NOM modulated the        expression of MDR in a timedependent manner Over  days        of treatment with NOM MDR expression became elevated        From these findings it seems that NOM and other progestogen        compounds show an effect of upregulated MDR expression in        longterm treatment It is unclear how NOM effects this        timedependent modulation of the expression of MDRPgp        If a similar modulation of the MDR phenotype occurs         in vivo  then the duration of        treatment with NOM becomes important It will be of prime        importance to verify the time course for modulation by        reversal agents and to design appropriate clinical        trials        In investigating the Pgpinduced MDR phenotype the        overexpression of some nonPgp MDRrelated proteins have        been demonstrated These proteins are important in drug        resistance in some tumour cell lines    We also        observed the expression of the nonPgp MDRrelated genes        GST TopoII and MRP We found that NOM markedly decreased        the level of expression of GST mRNA and protein with a        time course similar to that of MDRPgp The results        suggest that NOM possibly acts as a reversal agent of GST        MRP belongs to the superfamily of ATPbinding cassette        protein transporters Like Pgp MRP is located in the        plasma membrane of resistant tumour cells however the        mechanism of MRP might be fundamentally different from that        of Pgp The extrusion of several drugs by MRP requires        glutathione MRP might be identical to the GSX pump          MRPrelated MDR was not reversed by classic reversal agents        of Pgp such as VRP and cyclosporin A     Our        results suggest that NOM cannot modulate MRP gene        expression either        TopoII as a kind of nuclease is important in the        processes of DNA metabolism such as transcription        replication and chromosome partitioning during cell        division TopoII is present mainly in the S phase          TopoII in tumour cells is a target enzyme of some        anticancer agents If TopoII activity decreases or a        TopoII gene mutation develops TopoIIrelated MDR results                  Our results showed that TopoII expression in MCFADR        cells was weaker than in MCFWT cells Because TopoII is        a target enzyme of ADR MDR to ADR in MCFADR cells might        to some extent be related to TopoII However no change in        TopoII gene expression level was detected in NOMtreated        MCFADR cells indicating that the reversal effect of NOM        on MDR in MCFADR cells cannot result from modulating the        gene expression of TopoII        Pgp belongs to the ATPdependent transporters It acts        as a pump or hydrophobic vacuum cleaner effectively        increasing drug efflux and decreasing drug influx          Many studies have demonstrated that progestogen compounds        directly bind Pgp and block the function of the pump        efflux    We studied the effect of NOM on        intracellular ADR accumulation in MCFADR cells by using        FCM assays ADR can emit fluorescence its intensity        represents its accumulation   After  h of treatment        with NOM the intracellular fluorescence intensity of ADR        was markedly enhanced suggesting that NOM directly        inhibits the Pgp pump efflux function in the same way as        other progestogen compounds do        It has been reported that ADR induces dosedependent G          M arrest and that cells in this phase        are particularly sensitive to chemical drugs          Cellcycle DNA content assays by FCM suggest that NOM        enhances the blocking activity of ADR on the cell cycle        This enhancement of blocking activity might be partly        responsible for the reversal effect of NOM        In brief our results indicate that in MCFADR cells        NOM can significantly sensitize their chemosensitivity to        ADR downregulate MDRPgp and GST expression levels in        timedependent manner markedly increase intracellular ADR        accumulation and enhance the cell cycle blocking activity        of ADR At present although a variety of agents inhibit        the function of Pgp         in vitro  their clinical use is also        limited by the toxicity associated with the doses required        to reverse MDR Because NOM can be safely administered at        high doses it might be a good candidate for an MDR        reversal agent in clinics                    Abbreviations        ADR  adriamycin DRO  droloxifen GST  glutathione
