                    Background        Large DNA viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes have        complex life cycles with several distinct phases that        involve diverse virushost interactions An array of        regulatory systems mediate activation or repression of        expression of specific batteries of viral genes that are        required at different phases of the life cycle Other sets        of regulatory genes directly interact with components of        the host cell and modulate its response to the virus            Studies on these viral regulatory systems have        revealed a pivotal role of transcription and chromatin        organization in the control of gene expression and have        contributed to the basic understanding of these processes        in various model systems    Several viral DNAbinding        regulators have conserved domains that are shared with        cellular transcription factors The classic        helixturnhelix HTHdomain proteins which govern the        switch between the lysogenic and lytic pathways of        temperate bacteriophages and repressors containing the        MetJArc domain are wellknown examples of such regulatory        DNAbinding proteins in prokaryotic virushost systems              Large eukaryotic DNA viruses such as        poxviruses phycodnaviruses phaeoviruses asfarviruses        iridoviruses all of which form the recently identified        monophyletic clade of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses        NCLDVs   baculoviruses and herpesviruses also        encode a number of transcription factors Some of these        share domains with regulatory proteins of their eukaryotic        hosts for example the FCS zinc finger and the TFIISlike        zinc ribbon          Much less is known of the domain architecture and        evolutionary history of those viral DNAbinding regulatory        proteins whose cellular homologs have not yet been        identified For example the baculovirus repeat ORFs Bro        proteins are a family of DNAbinding proteins that may        regulate both viral and host transcription or chromatin        structure but no homologs cellular or otherwise have        been identified for these proteins    The        regulatory proteins of the poxviral variola DRShope        fibroma virus NR family have been shown to bind DNA and        probably regulate apoptosis of the host cell   All        these proteins contain a conserved aminoterminal domain        for which no homologs outside this family have as yet been        reported These proteins additionally contain a        carboxyterminal RING finger domain   and some of them        also contain a singlestranded nucleicacidbinding CCCH        domain between the aminoterminal domain and the RING        finger        During the comparative analysis of DNA viruses of the        NCLDV class   we observed that the aminoterminal        domain of the DRNR family and baculoviral Brofamily        proteins have a wide range of homologs in both DNA viruses        and cellular genomes Typically these domains were        identified in multidomain proteins that additionally        contained several previously undetected evolutionarily        mobile domains occurring in different contexts These        observations suggested the existence of a common        previously uncharacterized set of regulatory proteins        domains encoded by numerous eukaryotic and bacterial DNA        viruses as well as some of their host genomes        To gain a better understanding of the functions and        evolution of these regulatory proteins we initiated a        detailed analysis of their sequences using        positionspecificscore matrix searches sequencestructure        threading secondarystructure prediction and structure        comparisons Here we describe the functional predictions        and evolutionary history of these viral regulatory proteins        and their cellular homologs that were detected as a result        of these analyses The comparison of the domain        architectures of these proteins points to a major general        role for combinatorial shuffling of a small set of domains        in the evolution in transcriptional regulators of        eukaryotic and bacterial DNA viruses                    Results and discussion                  Identification of the KilAN domain in diverse          viral proteins and its potential relationship to APSES          and LAGLIDADG domains          To determine the evolutionary affinities of the          DRNR aminoterminal regions we initiated a PSIBLAST          search of the nonredundant NR protein database          National Center for Biotechnology Information which          was seeded with the sequence of the corresponding region          from the variola virus DR protein This search not only          recovered homologous proteins from almost all poxviral          proteomes but also previously undetected homologs from          the Chilo iridescent virus a variety of          proteobacterial temperate phages such as KilA of the          phage BPP and chromosomeencoded proteins from           Neisseria meningitidis Xylella          fastidiosa Salmonella paratyphi and           Clostridium difficile Table           Figure a The presence of this conserved region in the          amino terminus of the BPP KilA protein which is          involved in killing the host cells   with another          distinct conserved carboxyterminal region Figure           suggests that this region is a mobile domain that is          present in different proteins in independent contexts          Accordingly this domain was named the KilAN terminal          domain Table  In all proteins shown to contain the          KilAN domain it occurs at the extreme amino terminus          accompanied by a wide range of distinct carboxyterminal          domains other than the RING finger or CCCH domains that          are seen in the poxviruses Figure and see below          PSIBLAST searches seeded with the KilAN domains from          a diverse set of viral and bacterial proteins also          consistently recovered fungal transcription factors that          are involved in cellcyclespecific gene expression and          filamentation with Evalues of borderline statistical          significance  These hits precisely mapped to          the APSES DNAbinding domain which is shared by a range          of fungusspecific transcription factors such as MBPp          SWIp PHDp and SOKp from           Saccharomyces cerevisiae and          Stunted A from           Aspergillus nidulans   For          example a search initiated with the KilAN domain of           Pseudomonas phage D Orf          gi recovered the APSES domain of           Saccharomyces MBPp with an Evalue          of  in iteration  Reciprocal searches with the          profiles of APSES domains similarly recovered the KilAN          domain with borderline Evalues As an example a profile          seeded with the MBPp APSES domain and including all          APSES domains in the NR database detects the           N meningitidis protein NMA          gi with an Evalue of  in iteration           Given the availability of the threedimensional structure          of the APSES domain of the MBPp protein    we          investigated this potential relationship using the KilAN          domain sequences for sequencestructure threading of the          PDB database with the DPSSM PSIPRED and combinedfold          prediction algorithms Both DPSSM and PSIPRED gave hits          Evalue approximately  for DPSSM and probability of          matching approximately  for PSIPRED that implied a           certainty of the KilAN domain adopting the same fold          as the APSES domain PDB bmbm Additionally the          DPSSM threading also suggested that the LAGLIDADG          endonuclease domain   Evalue  approximately           certainty shared a common fold with the KilAN proteins          Threading with the combinedfold prediction algorithm          also gave the MBPp APSES domain as the best hit with a          very high Zscore Z   suggesting that the KilAN          domain was highly likely to adopt the same fold as the          APSES domain          Secondarystructure prediction using the Jpred method            with a multiple alignment of the KilAN domain          used as the input pointed to an    fold with four          conserved strands and at least two conserved helices          This predicted secondary structure of the KilAN domain          with a headtotail dyad of a strandhelix unit          Figure a is identical to the secondary structure seen          in the conserved core of the APSES domains Structural          comparisons using the DALI program   indicated that          the core fold shared by the KilAN and APSES domains is          more distantly related to the LAGLIDADG sitespecific DNA          endonucleases and the aminoterminal domain of the tRNA          splicing endonucleases TEN domain Figure b            Threedimensional superpositions of the three of these          domains for which structures are available aligned the          C atoms with a rootmeansquare deviation of  or          less for approximately  residues A search with the          APSES domain PDB bm using the VAST program            detected significant structural alignments with both the          LAGLIDADG and the TEN domains            p approximately   The          structural similarity between the TEN domain and          LAGLIDADG nuclease domain has been previously noted            but the connection of both of these with the APSES          domains has not been reported before to our knowledge We          noticed however that although the TEN domain is          related to the LAGLIDADG endonucleases the activesite          residues are not preserved in the former and the TEN          domain probably functions as a RNAbinding domain rather          than a nuclease These observations suggest that the          APSES LAGLIDADG and TEN domains together with the          KilAN domain define a novel nucleicacidbinding fold          with a conserved                         core Figure b Previously it had          been proposed that the APSES domains were related either          to the winged HTH or to the basic helixloophelix bHLH          domains     These connections are not          however recovered in any sensitive sequenceprofile or          structural similarity searches A direct comparison of          the structures also showed that the only domains that          share a similar topology and conformation with the APSES          domain are the LAGLIDADG and TEN domains This implies          that the previously proposed relationships for the APSES          domain are unlikely to represent the true evolutionary          connections          A comparison of the multiple alignment of the KilAN          and APSES domains showed that several characteristic          hydrophobicaromatic residues were conserved between the          two families Figure a suggesting that they have          similar functional properties The APSES domains          principally bind specific DNA sequences associated with          regulatory regions of numerous genes expressed in the G          to S transition of the cell cycle in yeast    The          sequence relationship with the APSES domain taken          together with the evidence of DNA binding by the DRNR          protein   suggests that the KilAN domain is a          previously undetected DNAbinding domain that is          prevalent in the viral world This prediction was also          supported by the evidence from mutations to the conserved          KilAN domain of NR that affected the localization of          this protein to viral DNAcontaining cytoplasmic virus          maturation complexes virus factories            The phyletic patterns of the KilAN and APSES domains          have interesting implications for the origin of the          fungal transcription factors Unlike several DNAbinding          domains conserved throughout eukaryotes such as the          homeodomain the bHLH bZip CH zinc finger and the RFX          domain APSES domains are restricted to fungi             Their closest relatives are the KilAN domains which are          widespread in diverse DNA viruses and prophage          derivatives from bacterial genomes This suggests that          APSES domains probably emerged early in fungal evolution          from a viral KilANlike precursor that was acquired by          the host cell An alternative scenario that the viral          KilAN domains were acquired from the fungal APSES          domain is also imaginable This appears less likely          however because the APSES domains show limited sequence          diversity in the fungi compared with the much greater          sequence diversity of the KilAN domain in a wide range          of DNA viruses that had probably already diverged by the          time fungi emerged Figure a Furthermore the viral          provenance of the APSESlike domains is analogous to the          recruitment of the transposonderived BEDfinger domain          in cellcyclespecific transcription factors such as          BEAF and DREF in the arthropods   Both viruses and          transposons are likely to derive selective advantages by          evolving transcription factors that regulate their genes          in response to the host cell cycle Hence from the above          observations it is not unlikely that the host cells          coopt the transcription factors of their genomic          parasites for their own cellcyclespecific gene          expression          The potential higherorder structural relationship          between the APSES and KilAN domains with the LAGLIDADG          sitespecific DNA endonucleases and tRNA endonuclease          aminoterminal domains has interesting implications for          their evolutionary affinities and origin A structural          comparison of these proteins indicates that the nuclease          active site of the LAGLIDADG domains is contained in a          specific aminoterminal helical extension packed          against the core                         domain common to all these proteins          Figure b   The KilAN APSES and TENterminal          domains lack the equivalent residues of the specific          activesite extension of the LAGLIDADG nucleases          suggesting that the former domains do not possess          nuclease activity Thus it appears plausible that these          domains evolved from an ancestral nucleicacidbinding          module that on one hand gave rise to the nucleases          through the acquisition of an aminoterminal helical          extension that provided the active site and on the other          hand diversified into distinct nucleicacidbinding          domains Like the KilAN domains that are mainly          associated with DNA viruses the LAGLIDADG endonucleases          are predominantly encoded by mobile genetic elements            Just as the APSES domain appears to be a derivative          of a KilAN domain captured by the cellular genome the          TEN domains appear to have been derived through the          ancient cellular capture of an inactive LAGLIDADGlike          domain   The common ancestor of this fold might have          emerged in a mobile genomic symbiont or parasite and          subsequently spread widely across viral and transposon          genomes                          Conserved domains in the Bro proteins          The baculovirus Bro proteins are encoded by a          multigene family and represent another class of          virusspecific DNAbinding regulators whose evolutionary          affinities are not yet understood The typical Bro          proteins that have been experimentally investigated are          BroA BroC and BroD from           Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis          virus BmNV   In addition to baculoviruses we          observed that the NCLDV class members such as poxviruses          and iridoviruses also encoded homologs of the Bro          proteins Proteins such as FPV from fowlpox virus and          three distinct proteins encoded by the entomopoxvirus AMV          showed similarity only to the carboxyterminal part of          the baculovirus Bro proteins whereas on their amino          terminus they contain a KilAN domain Figure  In          contrast another group of entomopoxvirus proteins such          as MSV from MSV and AMV from AMV showed similarity          only to the aminoterminal part of the baculovirus Bro          proteins Yet another set of viral proteins such as          MSV from MSV ORF from the phaeovirus ESV and          baculovirus proteins such as BroE of BmNV combine the          region homologous to the aminoterminal segment of the          typical Bro proteins with another distinct domain that          occurs in a standalone form in the phage T ORF          protein This suggests that the typical Bro proteins          contain distinct amino and carboxyterminal domains          BroN and BroC respectively that are present          independently of each other and in distinct contexts in a          variety of other viral proteins To uncover their entire          range of diversity we initiated PSIBLAST          sequenceprofile searches seeded separately with the          sequences of the BroN and BroC domains The BroC          domain was essentially restricted to the eukaryotic          viruses of the baculovirus and NCLDV classes Table           In contrast the BroN domain was more widely          distributed occurring in a standalone form or combined          with other domains in proteins from temperate phages that          infect Grampositive bacteria and           Myxococcus xanthus  and proteins          encoded in the genomes of proteobacteria and          Grampositive bacteria The P antirepressor protein          which regulates phage transcription    is one of          the previously characterized bacteriophage proteins in          which the BroN domain was observed          Studies on the BmNV BroA protein have shown that it          binds DNA with high affinity and associates with the          chromatin in the BmNVinfected cells   Additionally          it has been shown that the DNAbinding determinants of          the BroA protein map to the aminoterminal  amino acids          that correspond to the BroN domain defined above            Thus the BroN domain appears to define a distinct          superfamily of widespread viral DNAbinding domains          Multiple alignmentbased secondarystructure prediction          of the BroN domain reveals a core with two headtotail          units of a hairpin followed by an helix Figure           Thus the BroN domain adopts an    fold furthermore          the pattern of predicted secondarystructure elements was          similar to that seen in the KilAN domain and its          relatives Figure  The multiple alignment shows that          the BroN domains contain two highly conserved aromatic          or hydrophobic residues at the end of the second and          fourth conserved strands a pattern that is reminiscent          of similarly conserved residues in the KilAN and APSES          domains Figure  However sequence profile searches do          not detect any significant similarity between the BroN          and KilAN domains The sequencestructure threading with          the DPSSM method recovered the APSES domain structure          PDB bmbm as the best hit for the BroN domain          albeit with statistically insignificant Evalues Thus          given that the BroN domain is a DNAbinding domain it          appears plausible that it adopts a fold similar to that          of the KilAN domain although sequence analysis and          threading methods failed to provide strong support for          this                          Extensive lineagespecific expansion and domain          shuffling in DNAbinding regulators containing the KilAN          and Bro domains          There are several analogies between the KilAN and          BroN domains in terms of phyletic patterns intragenomic          distribution and domain architectures Both these domains          are widely prevalent in bacteriophages bacteria and          large eukaryotic viruses of the NCLDV and baculovirus          classes Both of them show expansions in particular viral          genomes for example KilAN in FPV and BroN in certain          baculoviruses and the entomopoxvirus MSV Phylogenetic          tree construction for the KilAN and BroN domains using          the leastsquares and maximumlikelihood methods showed          that multiple versions of these domains from a given          genome typically grouped together to the exclusion of          members from other genomes data not shown Thus KilAN          and BroN domains probably have undergone          lineagespecific expansions through amplification of a          single ancestral gene The genes encoding multiple copies          of these domains do not necessarily occur in close          proximity in the corresponding genomes indicating that          duplications were accompanied by extensive genome          rearrangement resulting in dispersion of the paralogous          genes          The KilAN and the BroN domains show additional          parallels in the domain architectures of the          corresponding proteins Both domains almost always are          located at the amino termini of these proteins and most          often are fused to another distinct domain at the          carboxyl terminus Figure  On many occasions the          BroN and KilAN domains are fused to the same          carboxyterminal domains Table  Figure  such as the          BroC TORF KilAC and MxPC domains          Additionally BroN domains show specific combinations          with certain domains such as HTH and the Vsrsuperfamily          endonuclease These architectures suggest that both the          KilAN and BroN modules are to a large extent          functionally equivalent and probably act as the principal          DNAbinding moiety that recruits a specific activity          purveyed by their carboxyterminal domains to the target          DNA sequences These carboxyterminal modules may be          enzymes such as the nuclease domains or might mediate          additional specific interactions with nucleic acids or          proteins Thus the principal function of these proteins          appears to be transcriptional regulation of viral or host          genes Consistent with this hypothesis these proteins          include antirepressors from phages such as BPP BPVT          and BPW          The majority of the domains with which the KilAN and          BroN domains combine in multidomain proteins are          restricted to proteins encoded by temperate          bacteriophages and large eukaryotic DNA viruses the          exceptions are a few domains that are common in cellular          proteomes such as HTH CCCH and RING finger In order          to identify the entire repertoire of domains involved in          these domainshuffling events we systematically explored          all domains that combined with the KilAN and BroN          domains and compiled a list of domains with which the          latter combined in other multidomain proteins Table           Figure a This information is represented as a directed          graph in Figure b in which each vertex corresponds to a          particular domain and the edges connect domains that          combine to form multidomain proteins The entire network          consists of  domains of which BroN and KilAN domains          show by far the greatest number of connections  and           respectively compared to other domains The RHA          ORFN and MSV domains while less versatile in          their connections tend to combine with the same domains          and in the same orientation as BroN and KilAN Figure          b which suggests an analogous function such as DNA          binding                            Conclusions        We show here that KilAN and BroN domains are two        DNAbinding domains that are widespread in large DNA        viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes At least the        former and perhaps even the latter appear to belong to a        large class of nucleicacidbinding domains that includes        the APSES LAGLIDADG endonuclease and TEN domains The        fungusspecific transcription factors containing the APSES        domain appear to have evolved through capture of a viral        KilANlike precursor early in fungal evolution KilAN and        BroN domains combine with overlapping sets of        carboxyterminal domains which in turn combine with        several additional domains resulting in an extensive        network of  domains that are predominantly specific to        large DNA viruses and six domains acquired by these viruses        from the host genomes      These observations        establish a major role for shuffling within a limited set        of domains during evolution of viral DNAbinding regulatory        proteins                    Materials and methods        The nonredundant NR database of protein sequences was        searched using the BLASTP program   Profile searches        were conducted using the PSIBLAST program with either a        single sequence or an alignment used as the query with a        profileinclusion expectation E value threshold of         and were iterated until convergence    If        wholelength proteins were used the searches were carried        out using the compositionbased statistics   in order        to prevent the detection of spurious matches that could        arise from lowcomplexity segments in the query or target        proteins In searches carried out with just the globular        domain of a particular protein the compositionbased        statistics was not used because this helps in improving the        sensitivity of searches without a major risk of corruption        of the profile with false positives   Additional        searches with hidden Markov models were performed using the        HMMER package    Previously known conserved protein        domains were detected using the corresponding        positionspecific scoring matrices PSSMs constructed        using PSIBLAST          Multiple alignments of protein sequences were        constructed using the TCoffee program   followed by        manual correction based on the PSIBLAST results Protein        secondary structure was predicted using a multiple        alignment as the input for the JPRED program          Sequencestructure threading was performed using the hybrid        foldprediction method which combines multiplealignment        information with secondarystructure prediction   and        the DPSSM method   Phylogenetic trees were        constructed using neighborjoining leastsquares and        maximumlikelihood methods    Species
