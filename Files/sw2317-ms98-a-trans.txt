ready to come down you have to you know you its more or less like letting the air out he can land more or less where he wants to its just that theres no like if he wanted to go one place he would have to know which way the wind is blowing   yeah uhhuh right yeah   but other than that thats the only fall back you know because the winds change he goes the other direction and and we we have to follow

balloons and all they do is just put the name of the bank or whoevers sponsoring that balloon that balloon yeah its pretty good   yeah and it looks so pretty when theyre all you know when theres a bunch of them that way   uh oh yeah and its so peaceful we went out to Texas Stadium one time for a Boy Scout jamboree   umhum   and we we was inside of the stadium like like i was thinking it the Astrodome   umhum   and they filled it up the football field   yeah   and inflated all the balloons   oh   and its it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top it looked like you could just dive off and and and bounce on a bunch of pillows you know  it was good it was fun i had fun   yeah   wow sounds fun   but that thats my thats probably my main hobby that sewing and reading books thats about it   oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like   do you really romance   yeah i like those i like mysteries i like murder mysteries too   uh um umhum   have you ever read any Dean Koontz   huhuh   hes hes sort of its he hes writes real good but usually its the kind though that you dont want to start if you have to put it down very soon   go anywhere yeah   yeah yeah the he does well theyre sort of scary you know but theyre theyre just really really good   uh uh   The Watchers you know they made a movie of The Watchers here not too long ago   uhhuh   and that was a book that he wrote that that was my favorite one its about this dog named Einstein and this it was he was an experimental government thing you know   huh uhhuh   and they were trying to do like like robotic stuff and everything   oh i seen that movie   yeah yeah well the the book was just ever so much better   yeah really   yeah it was great   i dont like i dont like scary books i cant  i cant read those i get paranoid     you like uh uh who is it uh Victoria Victoria Holt is that right   yeah shes one   yeah those are good i like those   but i like i im a Danielle Steele fan   oh really   yes   well thats i   i have every book the womans ever wrote   really   and two of her books have been on three of thems been on TV   yeah   and i got all three of them on tape and im fixing to tape this other one thats coming on Monday Changes yeah   oh what what what one is that   Changes   hum   and i had the book and i hadnt read it in so long so i read it the other day to see if i could so i can watch the movie   yeah yeah usually the the movies are not as good   the book is always the book is always better   yeah   you know but you know but because i know some of the stuff like that one Judith Krantz made that one they did that one really they did okay but i liked the book better   umhum   it was good   yeah thats usually the way it is   umhum   sometimes they just change them completely   yeah and you think its the same but its really not   yeah   umhum   like Jaws do you remember Jaws did you   yeah the book was different from the   yeah the book was a lot better i thought   oh yeah   but they just they just   umhum so what else do you like to do besides reading   well my dancing is i i like to belly dance   oh belly dance   yeah   you mean like those little thin in the little roll the bellies   yeah   i cant do that ive always tried to do that ive always wanted to though i didnt how people can get they stomach       well you know its its real funny because when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and shed been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun ill learn that in a couple of weeks ha   umhum yeah   yeah you know i mean you could just you could just take lessons forever forever i think   yeah right um   course im tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but its a lot of fun and its its a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you dont realize youre getting exercise you know its so much fun you dont really think about it   um   and exercising i mean lets face it exercising stinks   um   oh i go to aerobics classes and stuff but   i like that   do you   aerobics yeah i like aerobics   are you do do you are you at TI in Dallas so so you go to the fitness center   in Dallas no i go to jazzercise   no oh yeah yeah i well the only time i can go in too and all these classes that are available are like Saturday     oh really   yeah Saturday morning which is you know i i go to those when i can   oh they have them at night over here   yeah well they have uh the they have them like at six   umhum   you know here but i   no we have six and seven no six and then one is at seven ten or something like that   yeah   umhum   yeah   but i like jazzercise  i like it better than aerobics   yeah thats a lot of fun well yeah thats the same kind of thing like belly dancing you know you dont really realize that youre working as hard as you are   because youre having fun   yeah and its sort of cute too   and yeah i like jazzercise  ill tell anybody id go to jazzercise before id go to aerobics   yeah yeah well see i belong to the fitness center so i feel like i have to go to the aerobics class to get my moneys worth you know   yeah i used to belong i i but i stopped that because i never used it   yeah   you know the the fitness centers so  oh well thats a waste of money   umhum yeah well its so neat because its right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it so   yeah im thinking about it my husband wants he wants to go to and sign up for the weights   umhum yeah and yeah thats handy and theyre just there you know when you want to use them   so but umhum and theyre open till i think ten   umhum   yeah so   yeah and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too   i dont know umhum   do the weights   yep   hell hell he would never do an aerobics hed die before he in aerobics class   oh yeah   but  he likes the weights and the you know stationary bicycle and all that   umhum yep my husband likes the weights period thats it he wants to be up like he wants to he says im going to pump up i said uhhuh   body build huh     yeah because im always looking at those guys i love them   umhum   but i always ask him how come they dont ever have no hair because  ive never   i think they shave it   yeah they do and i told him i said well if you do it you cant shave your hair   yeah and put     im sorry i cant handle it   and then then oil up i think   umhum they do and then i dont know how they get because normally theyre not that pumped up and i
