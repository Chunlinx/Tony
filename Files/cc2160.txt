                    Introduction        Hypokalemia and many types of electrocardiographic ECG        abnormality are observed during the acute phase of        subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH       Among ECG        abnormalities a prolongation of the QT interval        especially when associated with hypokalemia deserves        particular attention because it is frequently observed in        those patients who develop lifethreatening ventricular        arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes              However the pathogeneses of these abnormalities during the        acute phase of SAH have not yet been fully        investigated        It is commonly believed that hypokalemia identified        during the acute phase of SAH is caused by a catecholamine        surge following SAH     In healthy male volunteers        Brown and coworkers    demonstrated that serum infused        adrenaline epinephrine caused excessive activation of the        sodiumpotassiumATPase Na K ATPase Na K pump as        a result of           adrenergic receptor stimulation this        resulted in trafficking of potassium ions from        extracellular to intracellular spaces leading to a        decrease in serum potassium levels        Recent work showed that there were some relationships        between serum catecholamine levels and QT intervals during        the acute phase of SAH      However one cannot refute        the possibility that the catecholamine surge may influence        the QT interval indirectly via hypokalemia because        hypokalemia as well as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia        can cause a prolongation in the QT interval                      In a previous preliminary study     we suggested        that women may be more prone than men to develop both        hypokalemia and prolongation in the corrected QT QTc        interval on the first day of SAH In the present        prospective study we assessed various possible risk        factors for the QTc prolongation that is observed in SAH        patients in order to examine independent risk factors by        means of multivariate analysis                    Patients and method                  Patients          We prospectively studied  patients admitted within           hours after onset of SAH to the National Defense          Medical College Hospital between January  and April           Of these  patients  were men and  were          women mean age on admission was    years with          a range of  years Neurologic condition on admission          was evaluated according to the Hunt and Kosnik          classification     and severity of SAH was assessed          according to Fishers classification     The          exclusion criteria included endocrinologic disease          heart disease renal failure previous SAH or          intracerebral hemorrhage young age  years          pregnancy pacemaker rhythm or taking any of the          following drugs digitalis quinidine procainamide          disopyramide and diuretics All patients had brain          computed tomography studies compatible with their          diagnoses Each patient underwent a cerebral angiogram to          identify a ruptured aneurysm except for eight patients          whose SAH were so severe that there was no indication for          cerebral angiography Patients with traumatic SAH or SAH          of unknown origin despite assessment by cerebral          angiography were also excluded from the study Informed          consent was obtained from the patients andor their          guardians                          Data collection          Standard lead ECG was performed immediately after          admission Two consecutive QT intervals were manually          measured for all  leads of the ECG with the assessor          blinded to the name and group of the patient The QT          intervals were measured from the beginning of the QRS          complex to the visual return of the T wave to the          isoelectric line and were corrected for heart rate using          the Bazett formula QTc  QTsquare root of RR          interval The mean QTc interval was calculated from all          QTc intervals measured The intraobserver coefficient of          variation was  and the interobserver coefficient of          variation was  Blood samples were obtained from the          patients at the same time as ECG and serum levels of          sodium potassium calcium adrenaline noradrenaline          norepinephrine dopamine antidiuretic hormone and          glucose were measured                          Statistical analyses          In order to identify potential risk factors for severe          QTc prolongation univariate analysis was conducted using          the  test Students           t test or MannWhitney U test The          model was reduced using manual back and forth procedure          with variable selection based on the statistical          significance of the estimates            P   Multiple logistic          regression analysis was then performed to identify          independent risk factors for severe QTc prolongation          Pearsons correlation coefficient was used to assess the          correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc          intervals Data are expressed as means  SD           P   was considered          statistically significant and all analyses were performed          using the StatView Version  statistical package SAS          Institute Inc Cary NC USA                            Results                  Univariate analysis          Univariate analyses demonstrated that there were          significant relationships between the category of QTc          interval and patient sex Table  Significant          relationships were also identified between category of          QTc interval and the serum concentrations of potassium          calcium or glucose Table  Severe QTc prolongation           ms or more           n   was more frequent among          female SAH patients            P   than among male          patients  The patients with severe QTc          prolongation had lower serum potassium levels             mmoll

   frequently found among SAH patients with hypokalemia                     P   than among SAH          patients with normokalemia  Patients with severe          QTc prolongation also had lower serum calcium levels             mmoll           P   as compared with          patients with a QTc interval of less than  ms             mmoll The concentration of serum glucose was          significantly

hypokalemia were independent risk factors for severe QTc          prolongation in patients with SAH In the first analysis          the serum potassium level was considered a continuous          variable analysis  Table  An increase of  mmoll          in serum potassium was associated with a relative risk of            confidence interval            P   for severe QTc          prolongation while female sex was associated with a          relative risk of   confidence interval                     P   as compared with male          sex A second analysis analysis  Table  revealed          that hypokalemia was associated with a relative risk of            confidence interval            P   as compared with          normokalemia while the relative risk with female sex was

Furthermore we evaluated the impact of sex          on the correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc          interval Among female SAH patients there was a          significant inverse correlation between serum potassium          levels and QTc interval            r             P   Fig c On the          other hand there was no significant correlation between          the serum potassium levels and QTc intervals            r   Fig b among male SAH          patients                            Discussion        The present findings suggest that female sex and        hypokalemia are independent risk factors for severe QTc        prolongation in patients with SAH Recent clinical        observations and experimental data indicate sexspecific        differences in various ECG abnormalities Several         in vitro and         in vivo experimental studies             have shown that female sex is a strong risk factor for        druginduced long QT interval and cardiac arrhythmias In a        study of healthy young individuals StrambaBadiale and        coworkers    demonstrated that females had a longer QTc        interval than did males Furthermore recent evidence        suggested that women are more prone than men to develop        torsades de pointes during administration of cardiovascular        drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization             However little is known about the mechanism responsible        for these sex related differences in the QTc interval or in        the occurrence of torsades de pointes Several studies have        indicated that sex hormones play an important role in these        sex differences Drici and coworkers    showed that        ovariectomy resulted in a shorter QT interval and high        doses of sex hormones lengthened the QT interval In        addition Haseroth and coworkers    demonstrated that        estrogen replacement therapy significantly prolonged QTc        intervals in postmenopausal women However several other        studies reported that sex hormones did not affect the QT        interval in healthy women      Various factors may        be involved in the sexspecific difference in ventricular        repolarization eg sexrelated differences in cardiac        ionic channels Female rabbit ventricular myocytes had a        significantly slower rapid component of the delayed        rectifier than did male cells which might contribute to        the gender difference in the QT interval     In fact        most drugs that prolong the QTc interval have been shown to        block cardiac potassium channels especially the rapid        component of the delayed rectifier             Women are more susceptible to hypokalemia especially        that due to diuretics     or SAH     Considering        that hypokalemia causes a prolongation in the QTc interval                the sexspecific difference in ventricular        repolarization described above might result from the        sexrelated difference in serum potassium levels It is        interesting that serum potassium levels did not affect QTc        interval among male SAH patients whereas there was a        significant inverse correlation between serum potassium        levels and QTc interval among female patients in the        present study        One mechanism that may account for this sexspecific        difference in serum potassium levels is a sexspecific        difference in the activity of the Na K ATPase Na K        pump as reported by Lasker and coworkers     Those        investigators found that Na K ATPase activity in red        blood cells was higher in females than in males thus        leading to a sexspecific difference in the Na K balance        in both the intracellular and extracellular spaces Another        possible explanation is a difference in the total        exchangeable body potassium Kleinfeld and coworkers           demonstrated that elderly women were more vulnerable to        hypokalemia and indicated that this was possibly due to        age and sexassociated differences in body mass        composition which might result in a physiologically low        total exchangeable body potassium        An inverse correlation between the serum catecholamines        and potassium levels suggests that a catecholamine surge        following SAH plays an important role in the pathogenesis        of hypokalemia during the acute phase of SAH Recent        evidence suggested that adrenalineinduced hypokalemia        resulted from stimulation of a adrenoceptor linked to        membrane Na K ATPase causing potassium influx             On the other hand there was no correlation between serum        catecholamine level and QTc interval in the present        series These findings indicate that a catecholamine surge        following SAH does not play a direct role in the        pathogenesis of the QTc prolongation in patients with SAH        Interestingly Reid and coworkers    showed that serum        infusedadrenaline caused not only hypokalemia but also a        prolongation in the QTc interval in normal volunteers        which appears to be highly consistent with the present        findings in patients with SAH        The therapeutic implications of the present findings are        clear When a patient with SAH is hospitalized during the        acute phase of SAH as a rule potassiumfree intravenous        fluids should not be used as initial fluid therapy        particularly in female patients Furthermore careful ECG        monitoring is needed to detect critical cardiac arrhythmias        as soon as possible and avoidance of drugs that prolong        ventricular repolarization quinidine procainamide and        disopyramide in patients with SAH especially female        patients is mandatory The findings reported here also        suggest an important new direction for further research        focusing on the detection of critical cardiac arrhythmias        in order to prevent sudden death at an early stage in        SAH        There are some limits to the conclusions that can be        drawn from the present study The study lacks data on ECG        changes after admission in the SAH patients which can only        be assessed by means of continuous Holter monitoring It        was therefore impossible to consider the influence of QTc        prolongation on the occurrence of critical cardiac        arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes Further studies        are required to investigate the pathophysiologic basis for        the QTc prolongation and to assess ECG changes after        admission in patients with SAH                    Competing interests        None declared                    Key messages         A prolongation in QTc interval is often observed        during the acute phase of SAH         Female sex and hypokalemia are independent risk        factors for severe QTc prolongation in patients with        SAH         The clinical implication of this is that when a        patient with SAH is hospitalized during the acute phase of        SAH as a rule potassiumfree intravenous fluids should not        be used for initial fluid therapy particularly in female        patients         In patients with SAH careful ECG monitoring is needed        to detect critical cardiac arrhythmias as soon as possible        and avoidance of drugs that prolong ventricular        repolarization quinidine procainamide and disopyramide        is mandatory especially in female SAH patients
