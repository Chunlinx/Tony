              okay have you participated in anything like that   well a little bit we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled   umhum uh we we have a pretty nice recycling center uh in our city now and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there theyre open like two days a week and you can just take it up there and drop it off its kind of fun and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when theyre taking their stuff in like theyre doing something good to   umhum yeah   help the earth i guess   and a lot of people complain because its really not convenient for them   yeah yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he says every time i turn around youre telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday i was telling him you have to youre supposed to squish the plastic jugs before you take them up there   youre supposed to what   every time he turns around im giving him some new rule that were youre supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs instead of taking them up there solid   but what are you supposed to do with them oh okay   and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags they wont take those we like to put our just put our newspapers in a paper bag you know and then carry them up there that way and we have to bring the paper bags back every time   uhhuh yeah   but they wont take them do you um take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up   we we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit and then we take them take them in   uhhuh we um we dont take our cans up to that center though our aluminum cans we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them   yeah we dont we dont um use aluminum cans so   uhhuh   we generally dont have those to do   yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth yeah worth bothering to go in and do do you um have any ideas on anything that would make   you know they they charge you you know its like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage   uhhuh   and i know a lot of people it would would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling   right   they they charged you by by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a landfill   yeah thatd be a good idea   that that might be a better way to do it and then people would would know that it was gonna cost them money to not sort their trash   yeah right yeah that would be a real good motivation for people   you know because then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i dont have to pay for them hauling it off   right yeah my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags like you buy your garbage bag from the city and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you dont pay any monthly fee or anything so however many bags of garbage you throw away thats how many you have to pay for   uhhuh oh yeah thats about the same kind of thing   yeah yeah that would be a real good idea im trying to think if theres anything else i could think of theyre talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city  Rowlett Texas do you know do you where that is   where do you live oh okay yes   and i dont know if they decided to do or not but i think they said it was gonna add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even break even point without charging people yeah   it seems like they would be able to   i dont know um i guess it just depends on how they manage it i dont know how much they get when they sell all that stuff the center that their got now where you take your stuff in i think i think that should be making some money   uhhuh     since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week   yeah   and they sell i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it   yeah   but i wish that uh uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i dont a lot of thats that recyclable steel and i dont know anybody that takes that   yeah thats true this   the my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum so we cant cant ever recycle those i think its a good reason to quit buying it   hm nah i didnt know that because we just usually if were gonna um buy sodas theyre in the the two liter bottles   yeah thats what we buy the most of unless were going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler   yeah   but well thats all i can really think about  for recycling it was good talking to you um bye   okay okay all right byebye
