                    Background        Glucocorticoids GCs are the effectors of stress and        necessarily impact multiple target tissues during normal        function Regulation of GC levels occurs through the        hypothalamopituitaryadrenal axis HPA Recent evidence        indicates that the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor        LIF and its functional binding to the high affinity        receptor a heterodimer between lowaffinity LIFR and        glycoprotein  LIFRgp are players within the HPA        cascade of events The ligands ciliary neurotrophic factor        CNTF cardiotrophin CT and a novel neurotrophin        set known alternatively as NNTBSF and CLFCLC also        function through the high affinity LIFRgp heterodimeric        receptor but require a third ligandbinding but        nonsignaling subunit        Oncostatin M OSM        utilizes LIFRgp as an alternative receptor complex for        OSM signaling in humans     but not in mice            Thus in mice LIFRgp is obligatory for signaling        induced by LIF CNTF CT and CLFCLC Signaling proceeds        through the Janus kinasesignal transducers and activators        of transcription JAKSTAT or the rasmitogenactivated        protein MAP kinase pathways for a review see                   LIF and LIFR are functionally expressed in rodent        tissues that are central to GC production the hypothalamus           and pituitary        LIF works in synergy        with corticotropinreleasing hormone CRH in the        hypothalamus to increase pituitary proopiomelanocortin        POMC and ultimately pituitary adrenocorticotrophin        hormone ACTH          LIF also stimulates        POMC gene expression directly in the pituitary               LIF upregulates pituitary prohormone convertase PC        Subsequently PC goes on to facilitate POMC processing to        ACTH    within the pituitary LIF promotes survival of        magnocellular vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus           which ultimately also positively influences ACTH        level Thus it is well documented in rodents that        signaling through the LIFRgp heterodimer in the        hypothalamus and pituitary leads to adrenal GC production        via elevated ACTH Other LIF effects that may influence the        stress response through actions in the rodent nervous        system are a LIF induced increase in acetylcholine           and LIF induced decreases in neuropeptide Y and tyrosine        hydroxylase     LIFRgp signaling has strong        effects in systems peripheral to but influenced by the HPA        including reproductive skeletal nervous neuromuscular        cardiovascular hematopoietic immune and metabolic        systems with influences on both development and adult        homeostasis for reviews see                  Animal models of LIF over expression and ablation have        confirmed importance in stress regulation Adult mouse LIF        over expression mediated by transfer of LIF over expressing        hematopoietic cells results in a lethal multisystemic        phenotype that includes small adrenals with a loss of the        innermost cortical layer     Pituitary specific LIF        over expression leads to a Cushings Syndromelike        condition of GC hyperactivity      LIF null adult        mice have normal or slightly reduced basal ACTH and GC        concentrations and are unable to respond to acute stress        by increased ACTH Basal POMC is reduced but inducible        upon stress     Thus an obligatory function of LIF        may be in the processing of POMC to ACTH during acute        stress        Null mutation of LIFR results in neonatal death and        defects in many systems including absence of glial cells        osteoporosis glycogen hypersynthesis placental defects           and loss of motor neuronal subsets that cripple        suckling ability     In all of the systems affected as        a biological consequence of LIFR loss an explanation of        the mechanism of action can be designed around direct        action of LIFR in each system However when considered as        a whole direct nonredundant obligatory LIFR function in        such diverse systems makes little evolutionary sense LIFR        function within the stress response system could be a        unifying element in many of the diverse biological        consequences of LIFR loss Among the defects seen upon        developmental LIFR loss all but the loss of suckling        ability and placental changes mirror reported effects of GC        excess in the adult This study explores the effect of        alteration of the GC environment during late gestation        with the expectation that suppression of GC effects will        improve the LIFR null newborn phenotype and identify LIFR        as an obligatory player in concert with the maternal GC        surge during late gestation development To link LIFR        function with GC function we have manipulated the late        gestation maternal steroid profile by maternal        adrenalectomy or RU administration to determine if the        maternal GC surge impacts fetal well being in the absence        of LIFR and functional LIFRgp signaling RU        administration during late gestation results in improved        development of bone skeletal muscle and glial cells in        LIFR null fetuses                    Methods                  Mice          The mice used in this study were first described in               Disruption of the first coding exon with a          promterless galactosidaseneomycin resistance fusion          cassette    created a null allele for           Lifr  AB ES cells on          aSSvEvBrd           Hprt           b            m background were used for          targeting           Lifr  The mice were sent to the          Induced Mutant Resource of the Jackson Laboratory in           from where one heterozygous            Lifr  male was received in           to reestablish the colony at the University of          Washington Since the initial germ line chimera the line          has been bred back to CBL for over  generations and          there have been several generations of sibling matings          Thus although exact records were not kept the mice are          on a predominantly CBL background  All work          was carried out following the Institutional Animal Care          and Use Committee guidelines within an Association for          Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care          approved specific pathogenfree facility                    Lifr  females were mated to           Lifr  males and the day of plug          E recorded Pups were either born naturally or          derived by Cesarean section Csection on E as          described     The E pups were placed in a dish          on ice to induce hypothermia and sleep followed by          euthanasia through decapitation Tail snips were used for          genotyping by polymerase chain reaction as previously          described                              Hormone manipulation          E was chosen as the starting point for each          treatment since no phenotypic differences among the           Lifr genotypes was detected at this          point Noticeable differences were seen beginning on          E     Also fetal feedback control of GC          production is established on E coincident with the          initiation of the maternal surge     Adrenalectomy          of E pregnant mice was performed as previously          described     Briefly adult mice were anesthetized          using ketamine and xylazine The site was prepped and a          small incision  cm made on the right side of the          spine over the upper kidney The adrenal gland was          located and excised with care taken to avoid damage of          blood vessels Following removal of the right adrenal          one suture was placed to close the muscle incision The          adrenalectomy procedure was repeated on the left side          The skin was closed using a  mm wound clip No hormonal          support was provided Pups were born following Csection          on E Two litters containing in total            Lifr             Lifr  and            Lifr  pups were studied Within          litter           Lifr  and  pups served as          controls since there has been no detectable gene dose          effect between           Lifr  and  at this stage of          development No mock surgeries were performed          Lyophilized RU National Hormone and Peptide          Program was dissolved to  mgml in ethanol and diluted          to  gml in peanut oil RU was administered as a          subcutaneous injection of  gmouse in  ml of          peanut oil on E and E Pups were born by natural          delivery on E Three litters containing in total            Lifr             Lifr  and            Lifr  pups were studied These          were compared with their littermates and to control          groups that experienced no hormone intervention          Csection delivery of untreated control animals was          performed on E Three untreated control litters          containing in total            Lifr             Lifr  and            Lifr  pups were studied          Comparisons were made between           Lifr  versus           Lifr  and  littermate          controls                          Histology          E fetuses were fixed in  paraformaldehyde in PBS          for paraffin sectioning Paraffin blocks were cut in           m sections deparaffinized and hydrated to water prior          to staining Sections were stained with hematoxylin and          eosin HE or by periodic acidSchiff PAS For          PAS slides were placed in  periodic acid Sigma for           minutes They were rinsed in water and placed in          Schiff reagent Sigma for  minutes washed and          counterstained with Gill  hematoxylin Sigma Slides          treated with diastase to digest sugars were compared with          untreated slides to control for specificity of PAS          staining Immunohistochemistry was performed using          antibodies to ACTH rabbit polyclonal antiACTH Chemicon          International or glial fibrillary acid protein rabbit          polyclonal antiGFAP Chemicon International Antibody          binding was visualized using the Universal Quick Kit with          NovaRed Vector          Skeletal preparations followed a combination of the          protocols of GendronMaguire et al    and Rijli et          al     Briefly the fetuses were eviscerated the          skin was removed and they were fixed in  ethanol for          four days followed by three days in acetone They were          rinsed with water and transferred to staining solution          which contained  volume of  Alizarin red S Sigma           volume of  alcian blue Sigma  volume acetic acid          and  volumes ethanol After staining for  days the          skeletons were rinsed with water followed by immersion          in  glycerol in  potassium hydroxide overnight at          C and held at room temperature until cleared At this          point they were passed through   and  glycerol          for storage          Only within litter mice were compared Following          detection of differences an array of slides and tissues          were presented to a pathologist blinded to genotype for          confirmation The numbers of pups observed for each          parameter are listed in Table                           Radioimmune assay RIA for corticosterone          Samples were run at a dilution of  using a kit          ICN in the recommended diluent using the kit protocol          The standards spanned  ngml All samples were          run in the same assay with high and low controls          Samples standards and controls were run in duplicate and          results averaged Blanks were run in quadruplicate and          results averaged The standard curve was calculated using          a fourparameter logistic curve fit All samples were          between  bound The coefficient of variance between          duplicate samples was  or less for all samples          standards and controls                            Results                  Consistent Phenotype          The phenotype due to LIFR loss has remained consistent          throughout the transition through three separate          institutions and between the transition from          SSvEvBrd           Hprt           b            m to greater than  CBL In          particular LIFR null mutation remains a neonatal lethal          with associated osteopenia and an absence of glial cells          in late gestation as described below                          Effect of Altered GC Action          Two approaches were used to attempt to reduce the          effects of the maternal GC surge on the fetus The first          approach toward manipulating the maternal GC surge was          maternal adrenalectomy on E without further GC          support Control           Lifr  pups could not be          identified by gross morphology or behavior           Lifr  pups from adrenalectomized          mothers were noticeably smaller than the littermates and          did not move vigorously The gross morphology and          behavior could accurately identify the            Lifr  pups following treatment          that presumably heightened the fetal exposure to GCs          Thus the impact of maternal adrenalectomy on the fetuses          appeared to have a selective negative effect on the          development of the           Lifr  pups          The second approach was to administer RU on E          and E to block the effects of the GC surge at the GR          in the mother and in the fetus following placental          transport     We wanted to find a dose of RU that          allowed litters to be born on E by natural delivery          since E is the earliest day of natural birth seen in          unmanipulated pregnancy A dose of  g per mouse          generally but not consistently caused abortion on          E Pups were born after E following a dose of           g RU per mouse per day A  g per mouse dose          induced birth on E However response throughout was          individual          A pregnant mouse was treated with RU on E and           Following natural delivery on E the one           Lifr  pup was indistinguishable          from the littermates both by size and vigor but          succumbed to the soporific effect of hypothermia before          its littermates Subsequently a further four litters          similarly treated with RU were born by natural          delivery and left with their mothers for four weeks Of          the  pups that survived to weaning none were           Lifr  No pups were excluded          from the litters on the day of birth however the          remains of dead pups were found the following day Only          one pup found dead on the day after birth was of          sufficient quality to genotype and as expected it was           Lifr  Two more litters of RU          treated pups were born by natural delivery on E          These litters were taken on E for analysis The          mothers accepted all the pups into the litters Four pups          had not suckled as evidenced by the lack of milk in          their stomachs while the other  had All were otherwise          clinically normal Of the four with no milk three          succumbed to hypothermia more rapidly than the rest          These three proved to be           Lifr  The one additional pup          with no milk in its stomach but that resisted the effect          of hypothermia the longest of the four was           Lifr  All the littermates that          had suckled and had detectable milk in their stomachs          were           Lifr   pups or           Lifr   pups Consequently          RU allowed the           Lifr  pups to survive natural          delivery and maternal culling although they apparently          succumbed due to an inability to suckle                          Bone          There was no loss of density at the growth plate          following any of the treatments in the           Lifr  and  animals Figure          ACE The expected loss of density was seen at the          growth plate in the untreated control and maternal          adrenalectomy exposed           Lifr  pups Figure BD          Fragility may be increased in the adrenalectomy group as          evidenced by broken mineralized bone at the growth plate          presumably due to osteopenia combined with handling post          mortem Of the            Lifr  pups from pregnancies          where the mother was adrenalectomized  had broken bones          once the staining was complete whereas no stained bones          from the           Lifr  and  littermates were          broken In addition all bones from both control and          RU exposed litters remained intact throughout the          staining process RU treatment of the mother          noticeably protected           Lifr  pups from bone loss          Figure F although modest thinning could still be          seen suggesting that protection was incomplete                          Glial Cell Formation          Consistent with previous findings no GFAP positive          cells could be detected in the spinal cord of either of          the           Lifr  untreated control animals          Ordinarily very few GFAP positive cells are seen at this          stage of development in wild type animals making          detection of GFAP positive cells dependent on particular          spinal cord section viewed Seven control           Lifr   control           Lifr   RU exposed           Lifr  and  and  RU          exposed           Lifr  spinal cord sections were          immunolabeled GFAP became detectable in the sections          from the two E           Lifr  animals analyzed when the          mother was given RU on E and  of gestation          Figure  Although immunolabeling was reduced relative          to that seen in wild type GFAP immunopositive cells          were often associated with blood vessels in the spinal          cord Although staining was relatively spare in all          sections complete absence of any labeling near vessels          was apparent in the control           Lifr  spinal cord Figure          B                          Skeletal Muscle          Skeletal muscle integrity appeared compromised in the          control           Lifr  animals relative to wild          type Figure Aand B This was evidenced by a frayed          granular appearance with loss of staining intensity of          muscle fibers in           Lifr  untreated controls On          closer examination the individual muscle fibers          contained fine vacuoles formed within the sarcoplasm          Figure B arrows           Lifr  pups treated with RU          completely lacked this phenotype and appeared normal The          characteristic appearance of skeletal muscle in           Lifr  mice may be due to altered          metabolism as evidenced by glycogen accumulation Modest          but inappropriate glycogen accumulation was also seen in           Lifr  periodic acidSchiff          stained skeletal muscle Figure B Glycogen was barely          detectable in comparable tissues from           Lifr  or  littermates Figure          A                          Pituitary ACTH          Immunostaining for ACTH in the pituitary showed no          profound difference due to LIFR loss Figure Aand B          Treatment with RU resulted in apparent pituitary ACTH          upregulation as evidenced by increased immunolabeling          regardless of genotype Figure Cand D The strongest          ACTH immunolabeling was seen in the pars intermedia of          the anterior pituitary with scattered labeling in the          pars distalis This was an appropriate pattern for the          corticotroph population Thus the corticotrophs did not          seem altered by LIFR loss using this method of          assessment GCs induce negative feedback regulation on          pituitary ACTH production as a mechanism for protecting          against GC overproduction Because RU is a GR          antagonist it is known that administration can cause          increased pituitary ACTH production     RU          exposure increased pituitary ACTH levels in both the           Lifr  and  animals as judged          by the apparent increase in labeling density through          immunohistochemistry Increased pituitary ACTH indicates          that in the absence of LIFR pituitary ACTH could still          be induced However this will require measurement of          POMC by quantitative methods                          Lung          Lung development in all the pups looked normal as          viewed on HE stained thin sections The lungs had          inflated and were indistinguishable between treatments          and genotypes Figure                           Serum Corticosterone          Corticosterone levels in blood collected from          untreated control pups or pups from pregnancies where the          mother was adrenalectomized on E had no evident          correlation to           Lifr genotype as evidenced by the          trial results from serum collected from only a few pups          Table  Pups in the control and adrenalectomy groups          were born by Csection on E and the blood collected          within one hour of birth The two pups in the RU group          were born by natural delivery and were ex utero for          greater than one hour prior to euthanasia and blood          collection                            Discussion        The results implicate excess fetal GC response in late        gestation as the reason for the multisystemic phenotypes        in the absence of LIFR Maternal adrenalectomy worsens the        osteopenia while maternal hormone suppression through        RU improves the presumed GC related phenotypes        osteopenia skeletal muscle integrity and glial        development This was an improvement over the poor        prognosis for         Lifr  newborns described initially            In that study         Lifr  pups rarely survived natural        delivery but when they did they were excluded from the        litter and died at variable times beginning one hour        following birth No pups survived through the night        following birth The survival of         Lifr  pups following RU        treatment was similar to the phenotype seen in CNTFR null        mice where neuronal development was disrupted which        disallowed suckling     This indicates that at least        some of the problems encountered with neuronal development        that affect normal suckling were not ameliorated by RU        Neither adrenalectomy nor RU treatment impact the        apparent wellbeing of the         Lifr  or  littermates Excess        GC activity due to LIFR loss is an unexpected result since        LIF gainoffunction mice develop a Cushingslike syndrome             Thus if the relationship were simple loss of        LIFR function would predict development of GC        insufficiency The observed GC activity excess suggests        that LIF and LIFR are integral to GC regulation but that        the relationship is complex and that alterations in GC        response are likely to result from altered balance of the        GC response cascade induced both by gain and loss of LIFR        function        There is a maternal GC surge beginning on E where        E is the day of vaginal plug following mating A primary        function of this surge is to allow development to switch        from growth to maturation of a number of systems that will        allow the pup to survive on separation from the mother        Lung surfactant synthesis and connective tissue maturation        allow the lungs to become distensible and capable of coping        with high surface tension In addition the maternal GC        surge effectively leads to fetal glycogen accumulation in        the liver for energy demands at birth increased fetal        bioavailable triiodothyronine from thyroxine to allow for        an increased metabolic rate and thermogenesis required at        birth maturation of the fetal small gut to prepare for        digestion heightened fetal adrenal medullar catecholamine        release for control of the above processes maturation of        fetal kidney function and a switch to bone marrow        hematopoiesis from the fetal liver reviewed by            The timing of this maternal surge suggests that LIFR        function is required at this point in development as a        moderator of the consequences of excess GC level        Mock adrenal surgeries were not performed on the mice        Therefore we do not know if stress of surgery alone is        enough to impact wellbeing in LIFR null mice Progesterone        was administered in peanut oil following the same regimen        as RU but resulted in bone loss reminiscent of the        results following adrenalectomy unpublished observation        Thus peanut oil alone is not responsible for the        improvements seen in the RU group and the effect of        excess progesterone provides further evidence that the LIFR        phenotype can worsen through endocrine manipulation        We previously reported that placental integrity is        disrupted at the LIFR null maternalfetal interface            In that study the maternal response to disorganized        fetal placental tissue was sufficient to protect the fetus        from malnutrition since there was no detectable disruption        of fetal erythropoiesis However what this meant for        relative transport of RU or maternal mediators of fetal        hormone balance upon adrenalectomy is unknown Maternal        adrenalectomy on E was a nave approach toward blocking        the maternal GC surge It likely had the effect of        increasing maternal ACTH levels    that would in turn        act on the fetal adrenal to synthesize corticosterone This        may have been the source of the modestly elevated        corticosterone level seen among the         Lifr null pups in the adrenalectomy        group Although anecdotal it would appear the RU        exposed wildtype animal cleared residual late gestation        corticosterone following birth more effectively than did        the         Lifr  littermate Previous studies        measuring circulating insulin and glucose levels in        Csection derived E pups bore no apparent correlation        to         Lifr genotype unpublished        observation At the time it appeared that plasma        measurements in pups immediately following Csection were        an unreliable reflection of individual condition and were        likely to be a reflection of maternal levels An accurate        picture of corticosterone levels will probably require        separation from the mother for several hours        RU was first explored as a GR antagonist and        subsequently found to be both a GR and progesterone        receptor PR antagonist with mild antagonistic effects on        the androgen receptor In certain cases it can function as        a mild agonist RU can bind to the hormonebinding        domain of both GR and PR Although still able to localize        to the nucleus it prevents subsequent transcription of GC        and progesterone responsive genes It does not directly        antagonize the mineralocorticoid receptor MR reviewed by                   Because RU along with antagonizing the GR        antagonizes the PR some of the RU benefit may be due to        antagonism of progesterone effects Progesterone is        integral to the hormonal milieu It is processed to GCs        through the actions of  hydroxylase and  hydroxylase           and it is an antiGC        and an        antimineralocorticoid MC        Therefore PR        antagonism by RU could increase GC and MC effects        although this is the opposite of the phenotype seen        Progesterone interacts synergistically with estrogen in        bone remodeling     while GC excess is implicated in        osteoporosis LIFR is known to be important in the balance        between bone resorption and bone formation acting directly        on osteoblasts       Bone loss in the untreated        control         Lifr  pups suggests a heightened        response to GC rather than a heightened response to the        boneremodeling effects of progesterone Whereas        protection by RU implies antagonism of GR mediated bone        loss rather than antagonism of PR mediated bone        remodeling In addition a progesterone receptor knockout        mouse model affects only female mice with reported effects        limited to organs of reproduction causing anovulation        uterine hyperplasia and inflammation limited mammary        development and impaired sexual behavior     There was        no noticeable difference in phenotype in the         Lifr  pups due to gender following        any of the treatments data not shown Since apparent        defects due to LIFR loss arise during the late gestation GC        surge while maternal progesterone levels are declining in        anticipation of birth and because phenotypes that have been        attributed in the literature to GC excess are lessened        through RU and the apparent heightened GC response in         Lifr  mice affects both sexes        equally it is likely that RU attenuation of associated        phenotypes is primarily mediated through GR antagonism        However the interconnectedness of hormone action may also        include RU mediated PR antagonism as a means of        impacting the extent of GRrelated effects        The primary clinical utility of RU is PR antagonism        to induce early pregnancy abortion Since the data were        collected from pups that were born early by natural        delivery E versus E following RU        treatment of pregnant females it can be assumed that the        RU used was an active PR antagonist and by        association an active GR antagonist The effective dose        used in this study was somewhere between  and         ggramday for two days The dose was not administered by        weight since litters vary in size and will have a large        impact on maternal weight in late gestation         ggramday has been reported to induce abortion in  of        mice during early gestation following  days of        administration     The dosage used in this study was        able to induce preterm birth by natural delivery at a time        when the pups were able to survive ex utero E but        was well below the dose used to achieve clinical        abortion        The apparent GC hyperresponsiveness in LIFR null pups        is probably not directly due to excess circulating        corticosterone in the absence of LIFR Instead expression        of GR and subsequent GR induced transcription may be more        relevant than circulating GC level Another consideration        is that the benefit of RU administration may be either        central within the HPA or can be due to peripheral GR        antagonism Cardiac dysfunction has not yet been explored        in the LIFR null model However many of the defects caused        by gp loss are shared by mice with a null mutation of        LIFR reflecting the heterodimeric relationship of LIFR and        gp for functional LIFRgp signaling A recent cardiac        muscle specific gp knockout model develops normally            Whereas nontissue specific gp knockout results in        hypotrophic cardiac muscle apparent by E     This        suggests that the effect of gp knockout on cardiac        development is mediated outside of cardiac tissue and the        primary developmental defect is peripheral to the heart        Given the improvement in skeletal muscle noted in this        study following RU it would be reasonable to explore a        central HPA defect following gp loss as the mediator of        hypotrophic cardiac development        Muscle regeneration begins through the muscle precursor        satellite cells Activation is followed by proliferation        and fusion with other satellite cells to form new myotubes        Muscle regeneration is a dynamic process necessary in the        maintenance of muscle integrity LIF and CNTF stimulate        muscle regeneration in vivo      as do other growth        factors such as insulinlike growth factor      The        power of LIF to regenerate muscle is seen in dystrophin        null mdx mice where exogenous LIF regenerates atrophied        diaphragm muscle     LIF induced signaling appears to        be essential in muscle development as seen by muscle        atrophy in the absence of LIFR on E In the absence of        LIFR muscle atrophy may be caused by GC induced alteration        of metabolism which leads to glycogen accumulation        inhibition of protein synthesis and stimulation of protein        degradation      Because low levels of RU can        fully protect         Lifr  fetal muscle from the late        gestation GC surge the balance between hormone function        and muscle integrity appears both delicate and direct        GR expression is specific but widespread within neuronal        and glial cell populations LIF is also responsible for        increased GFAP expression     while signaling through        LIFRgp is critical in fostering the differentiation of        neuronal precursors into astrocytes    mediated through        STAT        Glial cells respond to GC which        in turn can affect transcriptional control of GFAP level        either positively or negatively     The present study        shows that GCs can play a critical role in hindering        astrocyte development in the absence of LIFR as seen        through the partial abrogation of this defect following        exposure to RU in         Lifr  mice RU crosses the        bloodbrainbarrier and is present at only  of levels        seen in the serum     Perhaps glial development would        be further improved in the presence of higher levels of        RU were these levels not abortive The RU effect is        not likely to be mediated through PR in the         Lifr  astrocyte precursors since        astrocytes have low levels of PRs that are only detectable        in females            The vigor displayed at birth by RU treated         Lifr  pups is striking and        suggests sweeping improvement in wellbeing Pups of all         Lifr genotypes are able to breathe        well at birth and         Lifr  and  pups thrive with no        apparent lung handicap This indicates that the improvement        due to RU is implemented through modest alteration in GC        regulation since complete loss of GR function leads to        incomplete lung development at birth and impaired survival        through atelectasis     The neural compartment may        have been underprotected by RU due to partial exclusion        by the bloodbrainbarrier while bone and skeletal muscle        tissues exposed to higher levels of RU were clearly        protected Hypothalamus and anterior pituitary are also        protected by the bloodbrainbarrier Elevation of ACTH in        response to RU was apparent Consequently very low        levels of RU appear to mediate partial neural        normalization Loss of neuronal subpopulations integral to        suckling need to be explored in the RU late gestation        pups but the data suggest that the health of this        population is not directly influenced by altered GC        response                    Conclusions        In conclusion many of the multisystemic defects during        late gestation brought about by LIFR loss were attenuated        using maternal RU administration Osteopenia is reduced        muscle integrity is normal and glial cells are forming The        mother can no longer detect abnormalities in the LIFR null        pups severe enough to stimulate culling behavior However        motor neuron deficit appears functionally unaffected and        the newborn pups still succumb through inability to suckle        These results indicate that signaling through LIFR        utilizing the LIFRgp heterodimer is essential for an        appropriate GC response during development                    Authors contributions        CBW conceived of the study and participated in all        aspects including coordination mouse husbandry tissue        collection genotyping
