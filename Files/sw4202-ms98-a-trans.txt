        well Doug what are they doing in your community in Pennsylvania about recycling     okay well some stuff i go to Penn State up here and the town recycles quite a bit actually they collect curbside   uhhuh   gone the day that the garbage goes and they recycle um tin and aluminum cans and glass and newspaper basically   uhhuh so the the people have to separate it out is that   um no actually the um garbage crew does that you just put a you know plastic plastic recycling bin out on the curb every week and now except for having the paper bundled people dont really separate at all   oh yeah how about at Penn State do they recycle things like uh computer paper and that sort of thing   um yeah they do although theres just recently been a problem with them uh like saying that they werent able to afford recycling everything anymore so that they um they stopped recycling newspaper on campus for instance   oh yeah   they stopped recycling glass so theyre only doing cans and white paper now which i think is kind of insane   oh   because its really not that expensive   well what ive uh learned about recycling is that its almost impractical to recycle newspapers   umhum   which is sad and and as a matter of fact im member of a civic organization where we had someone from the city of Dallas come talk to us about recycling and the whole key to recycling is demand   yeah umhum   the supply is there people are willing to do it   yeah   but for example until they figure out how they can strip the inks off of  used newspapers effectively cost effectively   umhum   then its not gonna happen   yeah   and and there are whole huge warehouses in Dallas full of used newspapers       and i think they actually are building some sort of a plant in Texas where they can strip the ink off   umhum i see   i know at work we recycle white paper and cans like you said   umhum   uh the city of Plano is actually doing quite a bit they recently started picking up um glass aluminum and and they will take newspapers too   okay   and it apparently doesnt have to be sorted they havent quite reached my neighborhood yet but theyre doing all sorts of smart things uh   i see     they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash   um yeah thats definitely good   yes if you want to bag you know if you if if you dont want the clippings left on your lawn you can bag them in biodegradable bags which means paper   umhum   which you can buy from the city   yeah   and and theyre great until it rains and then they start biodegrading   umhum   but they are uh contracting with someone to turn all these clippings into mulch   oh  thats great   and i dont know whether i dont know whether itll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i dont know i guess it really doesnt matter   umhum     but its uh uh since they wont take any yard waste its thats in plastic bags its a little bit annoying when youre you know pulling up your vegetable garden at the end of the season and that sort of thing   umhum   and you dont have any of the their special paper bags on hand because you havent bagged your clippings at all you just let them recycle themselves   yeah i she see     but uh i dont i this for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community   umhum uh is it happening much in towns like it in Texas   um i dont know about statewide i think i think in the Dallas area there are few other uh suburbs Planos a suburb that uh are doing things about recycling   yeah umhum   but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i wont have i wont buy paper unless its recycled   right right right because   i mean   right the plan of the state college originally was that the recycling would pay for itself and all that and the peoples garbage rates would actually go down and of course if hasnt happened that way
