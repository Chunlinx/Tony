                                 I Was Wrong            Nathan Glazer the Harvardsocial scientist and core member of the group known as the New YorkIntellectuals appears to be haunted by second thoughts This may be a sign ofirresolution In a review of Glazers latest book We Are AllMulticulturalists Now  in the Weekly Standard  Dinesh DSouzaaccuses the author of cowardice of mollycoddling the multicultural left inorder to make life in Cambridge tolerable Its true that Glazer is not thecombative soul that say Norman Podhoretz or Irving Kristol is Glazer is agentleman always ready to concede at least rhetorically the sincerity of hisopponents feelings He wrote a nice review of my book City on a Hill in the New Republic  But Glazer is also too honest to disguise his ownmisgivings and his new book painful and awkward and sometimes confused isthe record of a realitythe reality of race and racial identitythat hasresisted the categories he has tried to impose on it throughout his career            Like therest of the crowd that gathered around the fabled Alcove  in the City Collegecafeteria in the s Glazer started out as a Trotskyist His radicalismhowever did not last long In the afterglow of the war and the recovery fromthe Depression Glazer and most of the other New York Intellectuals came to seeAmerica as a great success story At the heart of their optimistic liberalismwas the recognition that the country had opened itself to impoverished Jewishimmigrants like themselves and that the immigrants had in turn embraced thedemocratic values the secular rituals and the faith in individual achievementthat made them Americans The complete identification of the overwhelmingmajority of persons in each group of Americans in spite of discrimination isassured Glazer wrote in a  article in Commentary  one of thefavorite journalistic forums of the exradicals            Glazer expanded on this theme in his bestknown workBeyond the Melting Pot The Negroes Puerto Ricans Jews Italians andIrish of New York City  published in  and coauthored by Daniel PatrickMoynihan The books central point was that contrary to both the fears and thefaith of the s mass culture was not eradicating ancient distinctions ofreligion and ethnicity Its unspoken premise was that every ethnic group untilthen had found its own distinctive path to success Blacks had in effectrecently arrived at the head of the line they had problems but so had theIrish and the Italians New York will very likely in the end be an integratedarea Glazer wrote            Then the world turned upsidedown There were riots and the brutal reception of Moynihans report on theblack family and the Ocean HillBrownsville teachers wars and openadmissions at City College In the foreword to the  edition of the bookthe authors admitted they had assumed that blacks would behave as and seethemselves as one ethnic group among many They hadnt imagined that blackswould want to be treated as something wholly new a racial group The authorswrote that they were saddened and frightened by the implications of thischoice and they blamed the white intelligentsia for legitimizing it            It wasrace along with revolt on campus that pushed Glazer and his crowd to theright In  Glazer published Affirmative Discrimination EthnicInequality and Public Policy  a book in which he attacked affirmativeaction and decisively broke with contemporary liberalism Affirmative actionwith its promise of government intervention to overcome the effects ofdiscrimination represented a willful refusal by blacks to accept the mainpattern of American history the pattern of everexpanding inclusiveness Butwhen the book was reissued in  Glazer wrote an introduction full of ruefulreflections It was becoming clear he wrote that blacks werent beingassimilated as others had been Perhaps affirmative action wasnt so verywillful after all The underlying force that keeps the system of numericalquotas and goals strong is the actual condition of blacks he wrote Glazerdidnt think affirmative action was the answer but he cautioned against anallout assault on the policy            We Are All Multiculturalists Now should be readas a booklength postscript an agonized reconsideration Glazer is the lastperson one would expect to applaud the kind of ethnic chauvinism andmythmongering that often go under the name of multiculturalism and hedoesnt I feel warmly attached to the old America that was acclaimed inschool textbooks he writes But Glazer concludes that his side haslosthence the title He cites the ubiquity of the multicultural curriculum inthe schools and the blithe acceptance of it even by teachers and administratorswith no ethnic or ideological ax to grind Multiculturalism he finds thoughwith only the most anecdotal evidence has been institutionalized Glazerappears to be conceding that the postwar liberal faith was misguided and thatthe pluralistic community he envisioned in Beyond the Melting Pot hasnotand perhaps will notcome to pass            Butthats not quite so Glazer observes that while the multicultural curriculum isbeing propagated in the name of the new wave of immigrants the immigrantsthemselves want to succeed on more or less the same terms as the Europeannewcomers of  years ago We Are All Multiculturalists Now has a hiddensubject it almost seems hidden from Glazer himself Toward the end of thisshort book Glazer observes that it is blacks not immigrants who have pushedhardest for the multicultural curriculum And when Glazer asks why this is sohe finds not the obscurantism of black academics like Leonard Jeffries or AsaHilliard but the hard fact of black experience and the fundamental refusalof other Americans to accept blacks despite their eagerness as suitablecandidates for assimilation            This is for Glazer an almost subversive conclusionConservatives including Glazer himself have routinely called on blacks tobehave like immigrants Now he is saying that blacks want to follow the ethnicpattern but cantand that multiculturalism is the result of thatfrustration It is this recognition that accounts for the strange air ofpassivity and gloom that dominates the book Glazer has reached a culdesacHes no more comfortable condemning multiculturalism than he is condemningaffirmative action though he believes in neither He is forced to sayinstead that multiculturalism isnt the end of the world Thats certainlytrue and its a useful corrective to all the apocalyptic literature on thesubject But it puts Glazer in the bizarre position of accepting the teachingof selfesteemenhancing myths such as the claim that the Iroquois federationsignificantly influenced the framers of the Constitution Glazer is right tothink that even a steady diet of ethnic special pleading wont lead toBalkanization and intergroup warfare but hes also right to wonder if he takestoo extreme an outcome  as a test against which to estimate the likelyeffects of multiculturalism Multiculturalism is guilty of plenty of midsizewrongs including bilingual instruction which often keeps Spanishspeakingstudents locked in their own form of isolation and the reduction of history totherapy as Arthur Schlesinger put it            But Glazers underlying pointis that abolishing the multicultural curriculum even were it possiblewouldnt do much to diminish racial isolation the dynamic works the other wayaround This is not for Glazer a problem with a solution It is atragedy Glazer is still the neoconservative who wrote The Limits of SocialPolicy  He doesnt believe that any largescale policy can increaseresidential or educational integration or raise the low level of racialintermarriage He doesnt believe that racism is the cause of black isolationso he doesnt suggest that enlightenment is the answer Its not easy to arguewith either of these propositions But Glazers own logic leaves him withnothing to offerexcept the admittedly specious comforts of multiculturalismWe Are All Multiculturalists Now is thus the opposite of Beyond theMelting Pot a putatively neutral book with a profoundly discouragingsubtext And in the arc that connects the two one can read the downfall of whatwas once a sustaining faith
