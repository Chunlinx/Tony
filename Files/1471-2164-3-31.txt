                    Background        Gene expression profiling using complementary DNA cDNA        microarrays is being applied for multiple purposes such as        defining the taxonomy of different molecular subtypes of        human breast and other cancers             and        discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets             A limitation of the use of this technology is that small        specimens of human tissue such as obtained by core needle        or fine needle aspiration FNA biopsies may not be        sufficient for microarray hybridization using direct        labelling protocols Typical microarray labelling        procedures require  g polyA RNA or  g total        RNA per cDNA microarray This amount of polyA RNA or        total RNA can be obtained from samples of human tissue that        weigh greater than  mg However core needle biopsies        of breast cancers for example weigh in the  mg range        and yield only  g of total RNA Small tumors        identified using early detection strategies may thus be too        small to excise a specimen with enough RNA for microarray        analysis A pilot study by Assersohn         et al    showed that only  of        FNA samples from human breast cancers produced sufficient        mRNA for expression array analysis One approach to low        specimen RNA input has been to use indirect labelling        techniques to increase fluorescence signal intensity such        as with aminoallyl nucleotides Although less expensive we        and other colleagues have found that indirect labelling        techniques are not always reliable compared to direct        labelling methods For valuable tumor specimen reliability        is paramount A very recent report used amino CdTmodified        random hexamers to prime cDNA synthesis in conjunction with        aminoallyldUTP and increased fluorescence intensity enough        such that as little as  g of total RNA from cell lines        gave sufficient signal for cDNA microarray hybridization            The reliability of this method with human tumor        specimen warrants further testing        RNA amplification techniques have been developed to        address the need for sufficient RNA from tiny specimen for        microarray hybridization Other examples of specimen        requiring amplification for genomewide characterization of        gene expression include purified populations of cells        obtained by either flow cytometry laser capture        microdissection breast ductal or bronchial lavage or        microendoscopy Although one group has used unamplified        total RNA extracted from    microdissected cells for        hybridization on  clone membranebased arrays            most groups perform RNA amplification for this purpose              especially when using highdensity slidebased        arrays        The most commonly used mechanism for RNA amplification        is a T based linear amplification method first developed        by Van Gelder Eberwine and coworkers       This        method utilizes a synthetic oligodT primer containing the        phage T RNA polymerase promoter to prime synthesis of        first strand cDNA by reverse transcription of the polyA        RNA component of total RNA Second strand cDNA is        synthesized by degrading the polyA RNA strand with RNase        H followed by second strand synthesis with         E coli DNA polymerase I Amplified        antisense RNA aRNA is obtained from in vitro        transcription of the doublestranded cDNA ds cDNA        template using T RNA polymerase Several protocols based        on this mechanism have been developed and used in        microarray analyses                   In spite of the increasing use of T based linear        amplification techniques in the study of human disease        systematic evaluation of the fidelity and the        reproducibility of amplification mechanisms has been        limited Such information is important to determine how        well the amplified sample resembles the unamplified sample        and the validity of applying this technique to the study of        human tissues A study by Wang and Miller         et al    described a T based        amplification protocol modified with a templateswitching        TS primer used to theoretically generate a fulllength ds        cDNA The gene expression of amplified total RNA from        melanoma cell lines hybridized to  gene microarrays was        compared to that of unamplified total or polyA RNA using        cluster analysis and determining the number of outlier        genes between single experiments Approximately  of        genes were discordant outliers when analyzed using fold        or greater expression ratios in at least one hybridization        and compared between total RNA mRNA and different amounts        of input aRNA Hu and coworkers    compared amplified        and unamplified samples using total RNA obtained from human        glioma cell lines and  clone microarrays printed with        duplicates on the same array to evaluate a similar T        based protocol with a TS mechanism adopted from Wang and        Miller         et al     Their results were        based on nine microarray experiments and showed concordance        between amplified and unamplified samples verifying four        expressed and two differentially expressed genes using        Northern and Western blotting and immunohistochemical        assay        Since there are multiple T based amplification        protocols in use questions remain regarding the effects of        differences between these protocols and how these        differences translate when applied to solid tumors rather        than cell lines on a genomewide scale A study from Incyte        Genomics    examined gene expression of kidney vs        placenta RNA and RNA from matched normal and tumor renal        tissue using their own T based amplification kit not        employing a TS primer and  clone cDNA microarrays        They found that a differential expression ratio cutoff of        greater than or equal to fold produced excellent        correlation between samples amplified with different        amounts of input polyA RNA but that a fold        differential expression ratio threshold should be set for        comparing ratios between amplified and unamplified mRNA        Decreasing the input of tissue lysate increased gene        expression discordance between amplified and unamplified        samples As more human tissues were tested single round        amplification produced a  to fold yield lower than        the fold yield originally found in their study and        lower than yields reported in amplification studies using        cell cultures        The differences between several T based linear        amplification protocols are mainly the following         whether a templateswitching mechanism is used in the        synthesis of second strand cDNA  what enzymes are used        in the synthesis of second strand cDNA  how ds cDNA is        purified cleaned up prior to in vitro transcription        and  how in vitro transcription is performed Information        regarding the effects of these differences on the fidelity        or reproducibility of amplification should help eliminate        both unnecessary procedures and those actually detrimental        to amplification Determination of the range of input total        RNA necessary to achieve reasonable fidelity and        reproducibility is crucial for researchers dealing with        very small specimens of human tissue        To answer these questions and to define an optimal        protocol for T based linear amplification we carried out        a series of amplification reactions under different        conditions using total RNA isolated from primary human        breast carcinomas The amplified samples were compared to        unamplified samples on highdensity cDNA microarrays        containing  clones We evaluated the effects        of TS primer in second strand cDNA synthesis DNA ligase        activity in second strand cDNA synthesis column        purification of ds cDNA and in vitro transcription time on        the fidelity and reproducibility of amplification and the        yield of aRNA The effect of diminishing amounts of input        total RNA was also tested                    Results and Discussion                  Variation in cDNA microarray analysis of gene          expression using unamplified polyA RNA          In order to assess the reproducibility of microarray          hybridization using standard methods polyA RNA was          isolated from both primary breast carcinoma BC and          Universal Human Reference total RNA Stratagene  The          BC polyA RNA labelled with Cy and the reference          polyA RNA labelled with Cy were hybridized on five           clone cDNA microarrays  clones had a signal          greater than  above background on all five arrays          Three hybridizations were done on the same day using          arrays from the same print batch and the average          correlation coefficient between any two hybridizations          was    demonstrating a high reproducibility          between parallel hybridizations done on the same day          Another two hybridizations were performed using polyA          RNA isolated from BC total RNA three months later and a          different print batch of microarrays The correlation          coefficient between these two arrays was  similar to          the average correlation coefficient of the first three          arrays However when the unamplified polyA RNA arrays          performed weeks apart from different print batches were          compared the average correlation coefficient dropped to             indicating that experimental variations due          to differences in microarray printing polyA RNA          isolation and RNA labelling and hybridization contribute          a small but detectable change in results          In order to minimize experimental variations we          created a virtual polyA RNA expression array that          idealizes the gene expression of sample BC by using the          average expression level of each clone over multiple          hybridizations By expression level we mean the          normalized log base ratio of signal intensities of Cy          experimental sample to Cy reference fluorescence          The idealized expression profile from the polyA RNA          virtual array is used as our unamplified gold standard          for data analyses involving BC The correlation          coefficient between each individual polyA RNA array          and the gold standard ranges from  similar to          that observed between hybridizations performed on the          same day The gold standard virtual array therefore          represents wellmeasured gene expression in the primary          tumor and minimizes individual experimental          variations                          Templateswitching does not affect the fidelity of          amplification          As previously mentioned a protocol based on T based          linear amplification published by Wang Miller and          coworkers    incorporated a TS mechanism    in          the synthesis of second strand cDNA at the  end in          order to generate fulllength ds cDNA This was          speculated to be of advantage in the hybridization of          unmapped sequences spotted on arrays and to enable higher          temperature cDNA synthesis that would enhance sequence          specificity However no experimental evidence was          provided to support the idea that the TS mechanism          increases the fidelity of amplification          To determine whether the addition of TS primer          improves the fidelity of amplification we compared gene          expression profiles of aRNA amplified in the presence or          absence of TS primer with expression profiles of          unamplified polyA RNA Total RNA isolated from primary          breast carcinoma BC and reference total RNA were          amplified with or without TS primer using the WangMiller          protocol     except that aRNA was purified using an          RNeasy kit Qiagen  A virtual gold standard polyA          RNA array was created for BC using the average          expression level of four hybridization replicates of          unamplified polyA RNA A virtual correlation          coefficient for a given amplification protocol was          obtained by comparing the virtual amplified array          averaged expression level for each clone from multiple          amplified samples to the virtual gold standard          unamplified array for BC To determine the correlation          between individual amplified samples and the gold          standard an average correlation coefficient for a          given amplification protocol was also calculated the sum          of correlation coefficients of individual amplified          samples with the gold standard divided by the number of          amplified samples tested for each condition          As shown in Table  using aRNA amplified from total          RNA as reference the expression profiles obtained in the          absence of TS primer correlated with the gold standard          slightly better than in the presence of TS primer          although the difference was not statistically          significant When polyA RNA rather than total RNA was          amplified as reference the correlation with the gold          standard was slightly but not statistically          significantly better with TS primer Table  The          correlation coefficient using aRNA amplified from total          RNA as reference is higher than using aRNA amplified from          polyA RNA as reference regardless of whether TS primer          is used This suggests that when total RNA from a tumor          sample is amplified for microarray analysis the          reference RNA should also be amplified from total          RNA          The yield of aRNA amplified from BC total RNA using          different protocols is shown in Table  Assuming  of          the total RNA is polyA RNA a  and fold          amplification was observed in the presence and absence of          TS primer respectively The yield of aRNA amplified from          total RNA which are generated from cultured cell lines          was  to fold higher than when the primary tumor total          RNA was amplified data not shown          These experiments demonstrate that the TS mechanism          does not increase the fidelity of amplification and          therefore can be eliminated from the protocol The          reasons for the limited effect of the TS mechanism on the          correlation coefficients probably are  the second          strand cDNA synthesis primed by the TS primer probably          represents a small fraction while the majority of the          synthesis is selfprimed or primed by small pieces of RNA          generated by RNase H and  adding a few base pairs to          the ds cDNA prior to in vitro transcription does not          change the aRNA significantly enough to affect the array          hybridization                          DNA ligase activity is not required for          amplification          Amplification protocols that do not include DNA ligase          in second strand cDNA synthesis generate the same length          aRNA ranging from  kb to  kb data not shown as          generated from a widely used T based amplification          protocol developed by Affymetrix     which uses           E coli DNA ligase The correlation          coefficient between amplified and unamplified sample and          the yield of aRNA amplified without DNA ligase are high          enough to suggest that DNA ligase activity is not          necessary for RNA amplification in microarray analysis          For confirmation we omitted DNA ligase from the protocol          developed by Affymetrix and compared the expression          profiles of the resulting aRNA to aRNA obtained using the          standard Affymetrix protocol that includes DNA ligase          The correlation coefficient between amplified and          unamplified samples is slightly higher in the absence of          ligase Table  supporting our previous conclusion that          ligase is not required for total RNA amplification in          cDNA microarray analysis However the yield of aRNA is          higher when ligase is used suggesting that ligase may          play a role in improving the efficiency of          amplification                          Column cleanup of ds cDNA does not improve the          fidelity of amplification but decreases the yield of          aRNA          In the WangMiller protocol     ds cDNA is          purified using a Bio column BioRad A drawback to          this method is that the cDNA is eluted with a large          volume and needs to be concentrated into a much smaller          volume by lyophilization prior to in vitro transcription          This is a timeconsuming step especially when large          numbers of samples are processed To eliminate the          lyophilization step from the protocol we used an          alternative columnthe Sephadex G columnto filter          out free nucleotides from the ds cDNA after completion of          the second strand synthesis reaction The ds cDNA is then          precipitated following phenolchloroform extraction and          resuspended in proper volume for in vitro transcription          The correlation coefficient between amplified and          unamplified samples and the yield of aRNA using this less          timeconsuming modification are similar to that using the          WangMiller protocol Tables and           We further explored the question of what effects the          ds cDNA column cleanup step itself had on amplification          We amplified total RNA from tumor BC either with or          without the cleanup step of Sephadex G Seven          amplifications were done on different dates with the          Sephadex G column and five amplifications were done          without this cleanup step Both the virtual and the          average correlation coefficients using the column are          slightly lower than without it Table  suggesting that          the column cleanup does not improve the fidelity of          amplification Moreover the yield of aRNA is          significantly higher without the column purification of          ds cDNA suggesting some loss of ds cDNA on the column          Since the column had a negative effect on amplification          by decreasing the yield of aRNA without improving the          fidelity of amplification we eliminated this step from          our protocol                          Effect of in vitro transcription time on the          fidelity of RNA amplification          To determine the effect of in vitro transcription time          on amplification duplicate reactions were performed at          C for     and  hours Two additional hour          incubation reactions were stored at C overnight to          determine the effect of low temperature incubation on          amplification The virtual correlation coefficient is          slightly higher for the hour incubation at C Figure          A However in vitro transcription for  hours at C          plus overnight incubation at C gives the highest yield          of aRNA Figure B Since the yield of aRNA at any time          point is sufficient for multiple hybridizations we          decided to use hour incubation at C for all          subsequent amplifications                          Evaluation of the fidelity of T based linear          amplification protocols          To systematically evaluate the fidelity of T based          amplification we compared the correlation coefficient          obtained from four different protocols The correlation          coefficients of individual samples amplified using          different protocols with the gold standard range from           Figure  The scatter plots comparing the          gene expression of the virtual amplified samples for each          protocol with the unamplified gold standard are shown in          Figure  with the virtual correlation coefficients          ranging from  The differences in correlations          obtained using different protocols are not statistically          different by Students           t test demonstrating that          differences in gene expression for samples amplified          using different protocols are minor          Our results also suggest that the level of bias          introduced into gene expression profiling by          amplification is relatively low expression profiles          obtained using aRNA provide a close approximation of the          true expression profile of the original sample To assess          the biases of amplification quantitatively we calculated          the number and percentage of genes with expression level          change by  or fold after amplification The biases of          amplification by different protocols are similar          Specifically less than  of  genes           genes changed their expression level by fold or          greater and less than   genes changed          expression by fold or greater after amplification With          the Jeffrey lab protocol less than  of genes showed          changes in expression level by fold or greater Of the          genes that changed  genes and  genes changed their          expression in all four protocols in the same direction          greater than fold and fold respectively Also the          virtual correlation coefficients between different          protocols are high average  Figure  suggesting          that slight differences in protocols based on T linear          amplification mechanism do not affect the correlation of          amplified samples to unamplified samples These results          suggest the conclusion that aRNA provides a close          approximation of the true expression profile of the          original sample          We present here a components of variance model for          explaining the different sources of variation in the          amplification protocols see Statistical Appendix          additional file  The expression measurement for a gene          for a specific arrayprotocolsample can be broken down          as          Additional File           Statistical Appendix          Click here for file          X  Z  e where          X is the measured expression value          Z is the true expression that does not change under          replication and          e is the measurement error that does change under          replication          While we cannot estimate Z and e directly we can          estimate their variances from the data For the four          different amplified protocols and the unamplified arrays          the relevant variances are estimated in Table  The          variance of the true expression Var Z ranges from           for the amplified protocols and is  for          the unamplified arrays The variance of the measurement          error Var e ranges from  for the amplified          protocols and is  for the unamplified arrays The          estimates of Var Z were obtained by averaging the          pairwise covariances of the replicates within each          protocol and the estimates of Var e by using the          withinprotocol variance While the variance of a          collection of numbers measures how much they vary about          their mean the covariance of two sets of numbers          measures how much they vary with respect to each other          See Statistical Appendix for more details We notice          that Var Z for unamplified polyA RNA is larger than          all of the others indicating a dampening effect on gene          expression by amplification Measurement error variance          is lowest for the Jeffrey lab protocol          The covariances between the different Zs for the          different methods estimated from the virtual arrays are          shown in Table  The offdiagonal elements of Table are          the covariances the diagonal elements are the variances          of the virtual arrays We notice that covariances among          the amplified protocols which range from  to           are higher than their covariances with the unamplified          arrays which range between  and  Furthermore          the variances of the amplified protocols  to           are lower than that of the unamplifed           This suggests the following further breakdown          Z  Zc  Zs where          Zc is a common expression component with variance          about  and          Zs is a specific expression component with variance          about  for the amplified arrays and  for the          unamplified arrays          Therefore the amplified expression values for genes          on an array are largely the same as on the unamplified          array The component of variation in which they differ          appears to be common for all amplified protocols and          shows a much higher variance in the unamplified arrays          The effect of amplification can be summarized by saying          that it has a dampening effect on the true expression of          some genes decreased variance in gene expression  see          Figure           A recent report compared amplified expression profiles          of different primary breast tumors using Affymetrix          arrays     Unger           et al found that correlation          coefficients between gene expressions in different tumors          revealed by aRNA ranged between  However gene          expression was not measured using unamplified polyA          RNA from these different tumors raising the question of          whether the observed fairly high correlation between          diverse tumors was due to amplification bias To answer          this question we compared the correlation coefficients          between gene expression profiles of different tumors          determined either with unamplified polyA RNA or aRNA          amplified using our protocol Table  The correlation          coefficients between BC and BC measured using polyA          RNA or aRNA are the same  Moreover the          correlation between differences in gene expression          between amplified and unamplified samples for different          tumors is weak Figure  suggesting that genes that          differ through amplification depend on the sample rather          than on systematic changes from amplification Our          results demonstrate that different primary breast tumors          are not closely related to each other in gene expression          profiles and amplification does not affect the          correlation of gene expression between different tumors          Amplification is therefore suitable for comparison of          gene expression profiles among large sample sets                          Evaluation of reproducibility of T based linear          amplification          Another important aspect of RNA amplification is the          degree of reproducibility To evaluate this we          calculated the correlation coefficients between          individual amplified samples The correlation          coefficients between individual hybridizations done on          the same day for polyA RNA averaged  and for aRNA          amplified on the same day averaged from  Table           The correlation coefficients between individual          hybridizations done on different days averaged  for          polyA RNA and  for aRNA amplified from total          RNA on different days The reproducibility of our          protocol is slightly better than that using other          protocols Notably when samples are amplified on the          same day the correlations are significantly higher than          when samples are amplified on different days In          addition samples amplified with protocols omitting          ligase activity give higher reproducibility regardless of          whether they are amplified on the same day or not                          The effect of the amount of input total RNA on          amplification          To determine the effect of the amount of input total          RNA on single round amplification we amplified different          amounts of total RNA  g  g  ng  ng  ng          and  ng using different amounts of T primer according          to the quantity of input total RNA Table  When the          input total RNA is lower than  ng the yield of aRNA          for is lower than the standard quantity required for one          hybridization  g At amounts greater or equal to           ng the correlation coefficients between amplified and          unamplified samples and among amplified samples remain          about the same The fold of amplification increases with          smaller quantities of template RNA but the absolute          yield of aRNA decreases Therefore within the range of           g total RNA decreasing the input RNA does not          affect the fidelity and reproducibility of          amplification          All

   In conclusion T based linear amplification generates        high fidelity aRNA for gene expression profiling using        highdensity cDNA microarrays The average correlation        coefficient between amplified and unamplified samples is         with less than  of genes showing changes in        expression level by fold or greater using the optimized        Jeffrey lab protocol The correlation to unamplified        polyA RNA increases to  when experimental        variability is minimized by configuring multiple amplified        samples into a virtual array Reproducibility between        samples amplified with this technique is high especially        when performed on the same day rather than weeks apart        Amplification produces a dampening effect on gene        expression variation                    Methods                  Tissue acquisition          Two primary breast carcinomas BC and BC in which          more than  of the breast epithelial cells were
