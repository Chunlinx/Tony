                what do you think about the benefits in jobs   um im im relatively relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive   uhhuh   id rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money but um you know thats thats my major complaint i guess what about you   yeah and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you paying for all of it   uhhuh or or maybe that its not understood what should be covered and what isnt   uhhuh yeah   yeah i   right the the health insurance i have is MetLife and if its the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay  ten dollars and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty   i see now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is what theyve been doing is they they poll somehow the area and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code   uhhuh   and so recently when when we had a claim um they didnt pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well thats because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because either there arent that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out or their you know their statistics arent very accurate   right and and theyre probably doing it to their benefit anyway so   yeah i would assume that you know whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in   uhhuh   but its its difficult What about other other benefits are there others that youre dissatisfied with      well i work for Sears and and um thats about the the only real benefit you have is health insurance   well you have vacation i mean   yeah yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like uh TI and some other places you know they have social recreational facilities and they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and   huh   i dont know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that   yeah im not familiar with that sort of thing but       but you know to me vacation  is is an issue and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume   uhhuh right   and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um um i dont know i suppose um sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you   uhhuh   um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill   right   right but um otherwise im not not aware of any problems with the benefits around here so maybe that covers the topic then   yeah well i dont know the working the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits some places arent very safe to work   uhhuh   and and some places dont compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under   uhhuh or maybe a benefit uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls   right uhhuh   um um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others   yeah i think so   and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules   uhhuh      but other than that i dont have much feeling for  for the benefits since like i said um i dont have a big problem with with them i   um Workmen Workmens Comp is a big thing now in in Texas because um        um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now   uhhuh   and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh and i dont know besides that but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing   oh i i didnt know that somebody could avoid Workmens Compensation   well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state   oh i see   so apparently it costs less that way   uhhuh uhhuh i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits its to the to to the benefit of the company   uhhuh   and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them   yeah thats what i what i think they they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are and how much profit theyre making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people   right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also   yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i dont see how they can save money   uhhuh uhhuh   you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them   thats right no i agree   yeah okay it was nice talking to you   well thank you for calling byebye   yeah byebye
