                                 A Millennium Report Card            In  President Jimmy Carter directed the State Department and the WhiteHouse Council on Environmental Quality to make a study of probable changes inthe worlds population natural resources and environment through the end ofthe century The result issued in  was Global   remembered perhaps a littleunfairly as the definitive expression of Carteresque malaise about the futureCopies of this report which made a huge splash at the time and sold more than million copies are amazingly hard to come by today The State Departmentlibrary no longer has a complete set and a receptionist at CEQ told Chatterboxit was inconceivable that a yearold report would be retrievable there TheMartin Luther King public library in Washington DC said its last copydisappeared from the shelves six years ago Stephen Moore anantidoomsaying scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute told Chatterboxthat six months earlier a research assistant hed asked to find a copy cameback emptyhanded Internet searches turned up no used bookstores in theWashington area where you could buy Global              Eventually however Chatterbox was able to procure a copy of the summaryvolume that was reissued by Seven Locks Press in  Chatterbox thenconferred with Moore and with Ronald Bailey editor of the antidoomsayingEarth Report  Revisiting the True State of thePlanet  which was funded by the Competitive Enterprise InstituteMoore Bailey Cato and CEI can all be fairly described as having anideological animus against the fretful liberalism of Global   but then much the same can besaid of the liberal establishments attitude toward Moore Bailey Cato andCEI While Chatterbox didnt always buy Moore and Baileys analyses heguessedcorrectly it turned outthat theyd prove quite knowledgeable andrigorous on the facts Besides nobody seemed to be around today at the WorldBank            The general outlook projected in Global  is neatly summarized at thebeginning                           If present trends continue theworld in  will be more crowded more polluted less  stable ecologicallyand more vulnerable to disruption than the world we live in now ie  Serious stresses involvingpopulation resources and environment are clearly visible ahead Despitegreater material output the worlds people will be poorer in many ways thanthey are today                                       For hundred of millions of thedesperately poor the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be nobetter For many it will be worse Barring revolutionary advances intechnology life for most people on earth will be more precarious in  thanit is nowunless the nations of the world act decisively to alter currenttrends                        Not exactly an invitation to break out the party hats on New Years Eve Howclose to the truth is it              Population                Global  predicts that the worldpopulation will grow from

that this means Global  is off by nearly  percentBailey attributed the error to anoverestimation of the total world fertility rate which his book documentshas nearly halved since the early s Chatterbox thinks Global  got this one pretty close tocorrect however and believes that with the least developed countries seeingvery little decline in total fertility rate since the early s

that said tropicaldeforestation rates were about  percent during the s Assuming the samerate of tropical deforestation in the s Global  would be off by a factor of atleast two Chatterbox continues toworry that the rainforest is disappearing but agrees the  percent figure isprobably too high                                             Grade                              Incorrect

scientific Chatterbox concludes thatGlobal                 s pessimism is overstated roughly  percent ofthe time and justified roughly  percent of the time In other words JimmyCarters commission was half right which is about par for the course when itcomes to predicting the future to test this proposition flip a coin severaltimes Another perhaps less parochial way to look at Global  isto observe that the millennium is proving to be about  percent as disastrousas Jimmy Carter predicted it would be This is either good news or bad newsdepending on your temperament
