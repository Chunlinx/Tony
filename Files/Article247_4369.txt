                                 John McCain FlagWaverer            My boss Michael Kinsley defines a gaffe as a politician accidentallysaying something truthful John McCain committed a classic one of these onSunday when he said on Face the Nation that the Confederate flag is asymbol of racism and slavery and that it is offensive in many many ways aswe all know After stating these obvious truths McCain spent the next coupleof days clarifying his position that the Confederate flag is not a symbol ofracism or slavery but rather of heritage and that theres nothing offensiveabout it at all            What explains this rather extraordinary flipflop As a Republicancampaigning in South Carolina where the flag flies controversially over theCapitol McCain has to know this issue cold At first blush it appeared thathe was doing that thing that makes him so rare and appealing as apoliticiantelling a powerful constituency within his party to get stuffed Aswe all know McCain does this rather gleefully on such issues as tobaccoethanol subsidies and campaignfinance reform Sacrificing the crucial SouthCarolina primary to make another such courageous point would have been an actof selfabnegation on par with his refusal to be released from prison camp inVietnam            But in fact I think the flag answer was the reflection of a different andless laudable tendency on McCains part his instinct to play up to the pressOn Face the Nation  Bob Schieffer had just finished telling McCain thathe didnt think his letters to the FCC on behalf of contributors werescandalous when McCain delivered an answer designed to warm every liberaljournalists heartespecially coming on the heels of Bushs pusillanimouskowtowing on the issue in the South CarolinaGOP debate McCain just couldnt resist charming an audience ofreporters            McCain does this on a daily basis on his campaign bus But the last time itgot him in serous trouble was back in August when he told the editorial boardof the San Francisco Chronicle that despite his year prolife votingrecord he didnt really support banning abortion Certainly in the shortterm or even the long term I would not support repeal of Roe vs Wade which would then force Xnumber of women in America to undergo illegal anddangerous operations McCain said As on the flag he was roundly attacked byconservatives and beat a hasty retreat to a more orthodox Republicanposition            I suppose there are two possibilities here The first is that McCain is asecret liberal trapped inside the voting record of a conservative The otherprobably more realistic is that the guy just hates to disappoint his pals inthe press
