        okay is it Mike do you repair your own car     yes i try to whenever i can ive always been a a i guess a product of a handyman father   well i tell you what thats your count your blessings because uh its really is good when someone can do some   the yeah   things to the the car themselves   yeah theres  although ill tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated and   well thats why i dont do as much as id like   right yeah   because they are i mean they got theyve gotten complicated havent they   yes one of my first cars was a fifty six Buick which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to   uhhuh is that right   yeah it it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and and uh since then you know and the closer a car is to a fifty six Buick the the more i know about it and then start getting into these Nissans and the like and i just cant keep up     yeah i i agree about all i ever i never was too mechanically inclined but i used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and  course they dont use uh points anymore   yeah thats right yeah   but they do still use plugs and uh now brakes ive always done a lot uh you know changing brakes  and i used to   yep yep umhum   do i could always do the alternator you know and starter i dont anymore but i have on a lot a lot of times   yes yes i understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and its one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy nine El Dorado took it to be inspected   uhhuh   and the parking brake failed so i got under there and messed with the the tension that um that adjustment to make it to tighten tighten it up and that didnt do the trick and i got there and tried to   uhhuh uhhuh it probably slipped loose didnt it   but we well actually that wasnt even eventually the problem i i did a lot of things that i i did everything that i could think to do   uhhuh   and eventually i brought it up to a a place called Just Brakes and it turns out that theres a the parking brake in in the rear theres a theres disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston   umhum   deal and because the parking brake hadnt been used in so many years the piston froze up so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them they   hm oh     were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid the so i ended up having to buy one and altogether all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done   umhum yeah well it really wasnt quite so as bad as you thought would it was it   yeah yeah actually i i think it was a lot of money but i guess i dont like i said yeah but i it got to the point where i didnt know what was going on so  thats right thats right   well it was a lot of money but you had to have the help didnt you yeah well do you still do much work on them now   i do that actually that actually that was just um in in in beginning of September and i whenever i can i do try i  actually actually id say this i ive gotten to the point where i dont change the oil anymore only because   disposal is a problem   well that is one problem but also these um these fast oil change places you just cant beat them for sixteen bucks theyll not only will they change your oil in ten minutes and do a fine you know  good a job as i can do but theyll uh lube too      thats true thats true right that that ive ive quit doing that myself and but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know   yeah yep thats right   and uh but but no i guess it that and the main reason that its         its quick
