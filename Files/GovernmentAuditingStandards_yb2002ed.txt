By the Comptroller General of the UnitedStatesJanuary Government Auditing Standards RevisionExposure DraftaGAOGUnited States General Accounting Office Washington DC January TO AUDIT OFFICIALS AND OTHERS INTERESTED IN GOVERNMENT AUDITINGSTANDARDSGAO invites your comments on the accompanying proposed changesto Government Auditing Standards GAGAS commonly known as theyellow book These changes propose revision throughout the entireset of standards except for the second general standardindependence which is being revised separately The proposedrevisions fall into three categories GAGAS framework consistentapplication of the standards where applicable to the various typesof audits and strengthening or streamlining the standards Thisletter describes the process followed in revising the standardssummarizes proposed major changes outlines the format of thisexposure draft and requests comments from interested parties onthese proposed revisionsTo help ensure that the standards continue to meet the needs ofthe audit community and the public it serves the ComptrollerGeneral of the United States appointed the Advisory Council onGovernment Auditing Standards to review the standards and recommendnecessary changes The Advisory Council includes experts infinancial and performance auditing drawn from all levels ofgovernment private enterprise public accounting and academiaPublic comment is requested on all draft revisions to thestandards This exposure draft reflects the Advisory Councilsadvice to the Comptroller GeneralTo assist you in developing your comments this letter discussesthe proposed GAGAS framework and encloses a listing of the proposedchanges to GAGAS made for consistent application of the standardsor for strengthening or streamlining the standardsThe types of audits and services and applicable standards areorganized by separate chapters for financial audits attestationengagements and performance audits in order to make the standardsuser friendly For example the financial audit and attestationchapters are directed at auditors with a financial audit backgroundand the required knowledge of the American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants AICPA Generally Accepted Auditing StandardsGAAS and Attestation Standards The performance audit chaptersare written to avoid use of terminology drawn from financialauditsThe financial audit presentation proposes retaining the currentformat of separate chapters for field and reporting standards Theterm financial audit is defined to include financial statementauditsGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftand other services covered by GAAS and the AICPAs Statements onAuditing Standards SASs which interpret the standards Theseother services are defined in the SASs and include areas such asspecial reports reviews of interim financial information lettersto underwriters and certain other requesting parties complianceauditing and audits of service organizationsAttestation engagements are defined as those services performedunder the AICPAs Attestation Standards and the related Statementon Standards for Attestation Engagements SSAEs which interpretthe standards As the proposed additional GAGAS standards are fewerthan for financial audits the field and reporting standards arepresented in a single chapterGAGAS proposes recognizing the overlap between attestationengagement objectives and performance audit objectives and allowingthe services that overlap to be performed under either set ofstandards Therefore GAGAS simply proposes to recognize thereality of current practice Namely performance auditors providethese services using performance audit standards and financialauditors are likely to provide these services using the attestationstandards We are not aware of any problems that have arisen as aresult of this practiceThe presentation of the financial audit chapters proposeseliminating the term financial related audits by specificallyrecognizing the services in addition to financial statement auditsthat are covered by the AICPAs Statements on Auditing Standards inchapters  and  or by the Statement on Standards for AttestationEngagements in chapter  The term financial related audits wasthe source of considerable confusion to the users of GAGAS Byspecifically recognizing the services covered by the AICPAs SASsand SSAEs we have proposed clarifying what in fact was intended bythis term but not always understood by the users of GAGASThe proposed changes related to performance audits retain thecurrent presentation of separate chapters for field and reportingstandards The Advisory Council has recognized that GAGASapplicable to the performance audit objectives of effectivenesseconomy and efficiency internal control and compliance are alsoapplicable to prospective analyses guidance or summaryinformation Therefore we have proposed including that latterobjective in the definition of performance audits as discussed inchapter  and in the presentation of field work and reportingstandards in chapters  and  applicable to the variousobjectives of performance audits We believe this is a more logicaland user friendly presentation than having a separate chapterdiscussing the field work and reporting standards for theseobjectives that would only tell the auditor to follow the samestandards applicable to other types of performance auditobjectivesChapter  of this exposure draft discusses nonaudit servicesprovided by audit organizations that are not covered by GAGASThese services generally differ from financial audits attestationengagements and performance audits in that auditors may provide information or data to a requesting party without providingverification analysis or evaluation of the information or dataand therefore the work does not usually provide a basis forconclusions recommendations or opinions on the information ordata or  perform tasks requested by management that directlysupport the entitys operations such as asset evaluationactuarial services or information system design services Auditorganizations are encouraged to establish policies for maintainingtheGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftquality of this type of work This exposure draft does notdiscuss the impact of the provision of nonaudit services on auditorindependence That issue was addressed in the May  exposuredraft and comments are currently being consideredAs previously stated we are enclosing a numbered listing of themore significant proposed changes made to the chapters forconsistent application of GAGAS and the proposed changes made tostrengthen or streamline GAGAS The enclosure includes a referenceto the applicable proposed revised paragraphs of GAGAS Theenclosure does not include the proposed reorganization of the orderof presentation to provide a more logical grouping of the standardsby function such as planning audit documentation report contentand the audit process This proposed type of change was primarilymade to the presentation of the performance audit chaptersGiven the extensiveness of the proposed revisions we plan toissue a new version of GAGAS that will incorporate existingamendments We expect this revision of the standards to supersedethe  revision including amendments  and  Thereafter weintend to continue our policy of issuing amendments addressingspecific issues as needed We anticipate this revision of thestandards when finalized will become effective for financialaudits of periods ending on or after January   and forattestation

contained in this documentoften referred to as generally accepted government auditingstandards GAGAS are intended for use by government auditors toensure that they maintain integrity objectivity and independencein planning conducting and reporting their work and are to befollowed by auditors and audit organizations when required by lawregulation contract agreement or policy  The work performed inaccordance with GAGAS is referred to as audits and attestationengagements This work which is described in this chapter and morefully in chapter  includes financial audits attestationengagements and performance audits Users of government audits andattestation engagements that are performed in accordance with GAGASshould have confidence that the work is objective andcredibleThe standards and guidance in this document are foraudits and attestation engagements of government entitiesprograms activities and services and of government assistanceadministered by contractors nonprofit entities and othernongovernment entities Adherence to GAGAS can help ensure thataudits and attestation engagements provide credibility to theinformation reported by or obtained from management throughobjectively acquiring and evaluating evidence WhenauditorsThis document addresses the standards that should be used bythe individuals conducting the broad array of work that isdescribed more fully in chapter  Accordingly the focus of thisdocument is not on the wide variety of titles that are used byindividuals conducting and reporting on this work but instead thenature of the work that is being performed The term auditorthroughout this document includes individuals who may be titledauditor analyst evaluator or a similar position description Requirements in GAGAS are identified by statements thatinclude the word should Auditors are expected to comply withthese requirements if they apply to the type of work beingperformed Auditors are strongly encouraged to comply with theguidance provided by GAGASHenceforth the term program will be used in this document toinclude government entities services and activitiesGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftperform their work in this manner and comply with GAGAS inreporting the results their work can lead to improved governmentmanagement decisionmaking and oversight and can assist infulfilling the governments duty to be accountable to the publicGAGAS pertain to auditors professional qualifications and thequality of their work the performance of field work and thecharacteristics of meaningful audit reporting This chapter describes the applications of GAGAS by auditorsand audit organizations This chapter also describes the concept ofaccountability for public resources and discusses theresponsibilities of managers of government programs auditors andaudit organizations in the audit processAPPLICABILITYGAGAS are intended to be followed in performing auditsand attestation engagements A number of statutes and othermandates require that auditors follow GAGAS Where a statute orother mandate does not exist auditors will find it useful to useGAGAS in work regarding the use of government funds If auditorshold themselves out as following GAGAS regardless of whether theyare required to follow such standards they need to justify anydepartures from themThe following laws regulations or guidelines requireuse of GAGASaThe Inspector General Act of  as amended  USCApp  requires that the statutorilyappointed federalinspectors general comply with GAGAS for audits of federalentities programs activities and functions The act furtherstates that the inspectors general should take appropriate steps toensure that any work performed by nonfederal auditors complies withGAGASbThe Chief Financial Officers Act of  Public Law as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of Public Law  requires that GAGAS be followed inaudits of federal departments and agencies financialstatementscThe Single Audit Act Amendments of  Public Law require that GAGAS be followed in audits of state andlocal governments and nonprofit entities that receive federalfinancial assistance OMB Circular A Audits of States LocalGovernments and Nonprofit Organizations which provides thegovernmentwide guidelines and policies on performing audits tocomply with the Single Audit Act also requires the use ofGAGASAuditors need to be alert to other laws regulations orother authoritative sources that could require the use of GAGASFor example state and local laws and regulations may requireauditors at the state and local levels of government to followthese standards Also the terms of an agreement or contract mayrequire auditors to comply with GAGAS Federal audit guidelinespertaining to program requirements such as those issued forHousing and Urban Development and Student Financial Aid programsmay require that GAGAS be followedEven if not required to do so auditors would find ituseful to follow GAGAS in performing audits of federal state andlocal government programs as well as in performing audits ofgovernment assistance administered by contractors nonprofitentities and other nongovernment entities Many auditorganizations not formally required to do so both in the UnitedStates and in other countries voluntarily follow GAGASAuditors may provide professional services other thanaudits and attestation engagements that consist solely ofgathering providing and explaining information requested bydecisionmakers or by providing advice or assistance to managementofficials GAGAS are not applicable to these other professionalservices which are described more fully in chapter  Howeverproviding other professional services mayaffect an audit organizations independence to conduct auditswhich is discussed in chapter Relationship between GAGAS and Other Professional Standards GAGAS may be used in conjunction with professional standardsissued by other authoritative bodies For example the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA has issuedprofessional standards that apply in financial audits andattestation engagements GAGAS incorporate the AICPAs field workand reporting standards and the related statements on the standardsfor financial audits unless specifically excluded as discussed inchapters  and  GAGAS incorporates the AICPAs general standardon criteria and the field work and reporting standards and therelated statements on the standards for attestation engagementsunless specifically excluded as discussed in chapter  To meetthe needs of users of government audits and attestationengagements GAGAS also prescribe additional requirements to thoseprovided by the AICPA for these types of work Other professional standards which may be used by auditorsare issued by such bodies as the Institute of Internal AuditorsCodification of the Standards for the Professional Practice ofInternal Auditing The Institute of Internal Auditors Inc andthe American Evaluation Association which has developed guidingprinciples for evaluators Guiding Principles for Evaluators areport from the American Evaluation Association Task Force onGuiding Principles for Evaluators These other professionalstandards are not incorporated into GAGAS but can be used inconjunction with GAGASACCOUNTABILITY The concept of accountability for public resources isinherent in our nations governing processes Legislators and othergovernment officials and the public want toGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftknow whether  government resources are managed properly andused in compliance with laws and regulations  governmentprograms are achieving their objectives and desired outcomes and government programs are being provided efficientlyeconomically and effectively Managers of these programs are oftenasked to render an account of their activities and related resultsto legislative bodies and the publicFinancial audits contribute to making governments moreaccountable for the use of public resources The auditor inproviding an independent report on whether an entitys financialinformation is presented fairly in accordance with recognizedcriteria informs users whether they can rely on the informationFinancial audits performed in accordance with GAGAS also provideinformation about internal control and compliance with laws andregulations as they relate to financial transactions systems andprocessesAttestation engagements also contribute to governmentsaccountability for the use of public resources and the delivery ofservices In an attestation engagement auditors issue anexamination a review or an agreedupon procedures report on thesubject matter or on an assertion about the subject matter basedon or in conformity with criteria that is the responsibility ofanother party Attestation engagements can cover a broad range offinancial or nonfinancial objectives and provide various levels ofassurance about the subject matter or assertion dependent upon theusers needsPerformance audits also contribute to governmentsaccountability for the use of public resources and for the deliveryof services The term performance audit is used to include avariety of objectives to meet users needs Performance auditsprovide an independent assessment of the performance and managementof government programs against objective criteria or an assessmentof best practices and other information Performance audits provideinformation to improve program operations and facilitatedecisionmaking by parties

program evaluationsprogrameffectiveness and results audits economy and efficiency auditsoperational audits and valueformoney audits Given the importance and complexity of government programsin providing a variety of public services auditors areincreasingly being called on by legislative bodies and governmentagencies to expand the variety of performance audits to includework that has a prospective focus or provides guidance bestpractice information or information on issues that affect multipleprograms or entities already studied or under study by an auditorganization This work may also include an assessment of policyalternatives identification of risks and risk mitigation effortsand a variety of analytical services to aid government officials inperforming their responsibilities

obligation to actin a way that will serve the public interest honor the publictrust and uphold their professionalism A distinguishing mark of aprofession is acceptance of its responsibility to the public Thisresponsibility is critical when auditing in the governmentenvironment Because the concept of accountability underlies GAGASthis need to serve the public interest is essential for all workdone in accordance with GAGASAuditors need to make decisions that are consistent withthe public interest in the program or activity under audit Thepublic interest is defined as the collective wellbeing of thecommunity of people and entities the auditor serves In dischargingtheir professional responsibilities auditors may encounterconflicting pressures from management of the audited

financial audits attestation engagementsand performance audits These general standards concern thefundamental requirements for ensuring the credibility of auditorsresults Credibility is essential to all audit organizationsperforming work that government leaders and other users rely on formaking decisions and is what the public expects of informationprovided by auditors These general standards encompass theindependence of the audit organization and its individual auditorsthe exercise of professional judgment in the performance of workand the preparation of related reports the competence of auditstaff including their continuing professional education and theexistence of quality control systems and external peerreviewsThese general standards provide the underlying frameworkthat is critical in effectively applying the field work andreporting standards described in the following chapters inperforming the detailed work associated with the assignment and inpreparing related reports and other products Therefore thesegeneral standards are required to be followed by all auditors andaudit organizations both government and nongovernment performingwork under generally accepted government auditing standardsGAGASSee chapter  for an additional general standard auditorsshould follow when performing an attestation engagementGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure DraftINDEPENDENCERefer to Amendment No  Independence The following paragraphnumbers will change accordinglyPROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT The second general standard isProfessional judgment should be used in planning and performingaudits and attestation engagements and in reporting theresultsThis standard requires auditors to observe the principlesof serving the public interest and maintaining the highest sense ofintegrity objectivity and independence in applying professionaljudgment in all aspects of their work This standard also imposesa responsibility upon each auditor within the audit organization toobserve GAGAS If auditors hold themselves out as following GAGASregardless of whether they are required to follow such standardsthey need to justify any departures from themAuditors should use professional judgment in determiningthe type of assignment to be performed and the standards that applyto the work establishing the scope of work selecting themethodology determining the type and amount of evidence to begathered and choosing the tests and procedures for their workProfessional judgment also should be applied in performing thetests and procedures and in evaluating and reporting the results ofthe workProfessional judgment is synonymous with due professional careas defined in the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants AICPA standards While the principles of serving thepublic interest and maintaining the highest sense of integrityobjectivity and independence are not explicitly stated in theAICPAs due professional care standard these principles serve asthe framework for all AICPA rules and standardsGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure DraftProfessional judgment requires auditors to exerciseprofessional skepticism which is an attitude that includes aquestioning mind and a critical assessment of evidence Auditorsuse the knowledge skills and experience called for by theirprofession to diligently perform in good faith and with integritythe gathering of evidence and objective evaluation of thecompetency and sufficiency of evidence Since evidence is gatheredand evaluated throughout the assignment professional skepticismshould be exercised throughout the assignmentAuditors neither assume that management is dishonest norassume unquestioned honesty In exercising professional skepticismauditors should not be satisfied with less than persuasive evidencebecause of a belief that management is honestThe exercise of professional judgment allows the auditorto obtain reasonable assurance that material misstatements orsignificant inaccuracies in data will be detected if they existAbsolute assurance is not attainable because of the nature ofevidence and the characteristics of fraud Therefore an audit orattestation engagement conducted in accordance with GAGAS may notdetect a material misstatement or significant inaccuracy whetherfrom error or fraud Accordingly while this standard placesresponsibility on each auditor and audit organization to exerciseprofessional judgment in planning and performing an assignment itdoes not imply unlimited responsibility nor does it implyinfallibility on the part of either the individual auditor or theaudit organizationCOMPETENCE The third general standard isThe staff assigned to perform the assignment should collectivelypossess adequate professional competence for the tasksrequiredThis standard places responsibility on auditorganizations to ensure that each assignment is performed by staffwho collectively have the knowledge skills and experiencenecessary for that assignment Audit organizations should have aprocess such as a human capital system for recruitment hiringcontinuous development and evaluation of staff to assist theorganization in maintaining a workforce that has adequatecompetenceThe competencies discussed below apply to the knowledgeskills and experience of audit organizations as a whole and notnecessarily to each individual auditor An organization may need toemploy individuals or hire subject matter experts who areknowledgeable skilled or experienced in such areas as accountingstatistics law engineering audit design and methodologyinformation technology public administration economics socialsciences or actuarial scienceTechnical Knowledge and Competence Staff members conducting audits and attestation engagementsunder GAGAS should collectively possess the technical knowledgeskills and experience necessary to be competent for the type ofwork being performed before beginning work on an assignmentAuditors should

standards GAGASincorporate the American Institute of Certified Public AccountantsAICPA generally accepted field work standards for audits and therelated AICPA Statements on Auditing Standards SASs unless theComptroller General of the United States excludes them by formalannouncement This chapter identifies the AICPA field workstandards and prescribes additional standards for applying theAICPA field work standards for financial audits performed inaccordance with GAGAS This chapter concludes with guidance thatauditors should give consideration to when performing financialaudits in accordance with GAGASFinancial audits consist of all work performed under theAICPAs generally accepted auditing standards and governed by theAICPA SASs which interpret the standards Such work performed in agovernment environment primarily includes audits of financialstatements The SASs also govern other types of services which mayalso be performed in a government environment such as complianceauditing issuing special reports audits of serviceorganizations reviews of interimTo date the Comptroller General has not excluded any fieldwork standards or statements on auditing standardsThe term financial statement refers to a presentation offinancial data including accompanying notes derived fromaccounting records and intended to communicate an entitys economicresources or obligations at a point in time or the changes thereinfor a period of time in conformity with an identifiable frameworksuch as generally accepted accounting principles GAAP or an othercomprehensive basis of accounting OCBOA Audits of financialstatements include all services governed by the AICPAs SASs forwhich the auditors are engaged to provide a level of assurance onthe fair presentation of financial statements in

competent evidential matter is to be obtainedthrough inspection observation inquiries and confirmations toafford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financialstatements under auditADDITIONAL GAGAS FIELD WORK STANDARDS GAGAS prescribe additional standards for applying the AICPAthree generally accepted AICPA field work standards which go beyondthe requirements contained in the AICPAs SASs Auditors mustcomply with these additional standards when citing GAGAS in theiraudit reports The additional GAGAS relate toaauditor communication see paragraphs  throughbconsidering the results of previous audits seeparagraphs  through cnoncompliance with provisions of contracts and grantssee paragraphs  through  anddaudit documentation see paragraphs  through This chapter concludes

safeguarding of assets seeparagraphs  through cinternal control over compliance see paragraphs through  anddprofessional judgment concerning possible fraud andillegal acts see paragraphs  through AUDITOR COMMUNICATION An additional standard related to auditor communication forfinancial audits performed in accordance with GAGAS isAuditors should communicate information regarding the nature ofservices and level of assurance provided to not only officials ofthe audited entity but also to the individuals contracting for orrequesting the audit services and the audit committee or otherequivalent oversight body AICPA standards and GAGAS require auditors to establish anunderstanding with the client and to communicate with auditcommittees GAGAS broaden the parties with whom auditors mustcommunicate with during the planning stages of a financial audit toreduce the risk that the needs or expectations of the partiesinvolved may be misinterpreted Auditors should use theirprofessional judgment to determine the form content and frequencyof the communication although written communication is preferredand should document the communication Auditors may use anengagement letter if appropriate to communicate theinformation Auditors should communicate their responsibilities for theengagement to the appropriate officials of the audited entitywhich may includeathe head of the audited entitybthe audit committee or board of directors or otherequivalent oversight body in the absence of an audit committeeandcthe individual who possesses a sufficient level ofauthority and responsibility for the financial reporting processsuch as the chief financial officer In situations where auditors are performing the audit undera contract with a party other than the officials of the auditedentity or pursuant to a thirdparty request auditors should alsocommunicate with the individuals contracting for or requesting theaudit such as contracting officials or legislative members orstaff When auditors are performing the audit pursuant to a law orregulation auditors should communicate with the legislativemembers or staff who have oversight of the auditee Auditorsshould coordinate communications with the responsible governmentaudit organization andor management of the audited entity and mayuse the engagement letter to keep interested parties informed In communicating the nature of services and level ofassurance provided auditors should specifically address theirplanned work related to testing compliance with laws andregulations andThis requirement applies only to situations where the law orregulation specifically identifies the entity to be audited suchas an audit of a specific agencys financial statements required bythe Chief Financial Officers Act as expanded by the GovernmentManagement Reform Act of  Situations where the audit offinancial statements mandate applies to entities not specificallyidentified such as audits required by the Single Audit ActAmendments of  are excludedinternal control over financial reporting During the planningstages of an audit auditors should communicate theirresponsibilities for testing and reporting on compliance with lawsand regulations and internal control over financial reporting Suchcommunication should include the nature of any additional testingof compliance and internal control required by laws and regulationsor otherwise requested and whether the auditors are planning onproviding opinions on compliance with laws and regulations andinternal control over financial reportingTo assist in understanding the limitations of auditorsresponsibilities for testing and reporting on compliance andinternal control over financial reporting auditors may want tocontrast those responsibilities with other audits of compliance andcontrols The discussion in paragraphs  andmay be helpful to auditors in explaining theirresponsibilities for testing and reporting on compliance with lawsand regulations and internal control over financial reporting toofficials of the audited entity and other interestedpartiesTests of compliance with laws and regulations andinternal control over financial reporting in a financial auditcontribute to the evidence supporting the auditors opinion on thefinancial statements or other conclusions regarding financial dataHowever such tests generally are not sufficient in scope to opineon compliance or internal control over financial reporting To meetcertain audit report users needs laws and regulations sometimesprescribe testing and reporting on compliance and internal controlover financial reporting to supplement coverage of theseareasEven after auditors perform and report the results ofadditional tests of compliance and internal control over financialreporting required by laws and regulations some reasonable needsof report users still may be unmet Auditors may meet these needsby performing further tests of complianceFor example when engaged to perform audits under the SingleAudit Act Amendments of  for state and local governmententities and nonprofit entities that receive federal awardsauditors should be familiar with the Office of Management andBudget OMB Circular A on single audits The act and circularinclude specific audit requirements mainly in the areas ofcompliance with laws and regulations and internal control thatexceed the minimum audit requirements in the standards in chapters and  of this document Audits conducted under the ChiefFinancial Officers Act of  as expanded by the GovernmentManagement Reform Act of  also have specific auditrequirements prescribed by OMB in the areas of compliance andinternal control Many state and local governments have additionalaudit requirementsand internal control in either of two waysasupplemental or agreedupon procedures orbexamination resulting in an opinionCONSIDERING THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS AUDITS An additional standard for financial audits performed inaccordance with GAGAS isAuditors should consider the results of previous audits andfollow up on known significant findings and recommendationsincluding those related to reportable conditions identified inprevious audits reports that relate to the objectives of the auditbeing undertaken Auditors should perform such followup to determine whetherofficials of the audited entity have taken appropriate correctiveactions In addition to following up on significant reportedfindings and recommendations from previous financial auditsauditors should consider significant findings identified inattestation engagements performance audits or other studies ifthese findings could materially affect the results of the financialaudit For example an audit report on an entitys computerizedinformation systems may contain significant findings that couldrelate to the financial audit if the entity uses such systems toprocess its accounting information In any event auditors need tomake judgments about the extent of followup needed and theappropriate disclosure of uncorrected significant findings andrecommendations from prior audits that affect the auditobjectivesSuch work is generally performed under the AICPAs Statementson Standards for Attestation Engagements See chapter  for adiscussion of the standards used when performing attestationengagements Significant findings and recommendations are thosematters that if not corrected could affect the results of theauditors work and users conclusions about those results Providing continuing attention tosignificant findings and recommendations is important to ensurethat the benefits of audit work are realized Ultimately thebenefits of audit work occur when audit findings are resolvedthrough meaningful and effective corrective action taken inresponse to the auditors findings and recommendations Officialsof the audited entity are responsible for resolving audit findingsand recommendations directed to them and for having a process totrack their status If officials of the audited entity do not havesuch a process auditors may wish to establish their ownprocessNONCOMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS AND GRANTAGREEMENTS The additional standard related to compliance withprovisions of contracts and grant agreements for financial auditsperformed in accordance with GAGAS isAuditors should design the audit to provide reasonable assuranceof detecting material misstatements of financial statements orother financial data resulting from noncompliance with provisionsof contracts or grant agreements that have a direct and materialeffect on the determination of financial statement amounts Ifspecific information comes to the auditors attention that providesevidence concerning the existence of possible noncompliance thatcould affect financial data significant to the audit objectives orthat could have a material indirect effect on the financialstatements auditors should apply audit procedures specificallydirected to ascertaining whether noncompliance has occurred or islikely to have occurred AICPA standards and GAGAS require auditors to assess therisk of material misstatements of financial statements due to fraudand should consider that assessment in designing the auditprocedures to be performed Auditors are also required to designthe audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting materialmisstatements resulting from direct and material illegal acts tobeTwo types of misstatements are relevant to the auditorsconsideration of fraud in an audit of financial statementsmisstatements arising from fraudulent financial statements andmisstatements arising from misappropriation of assets The primaryfactor that distinguishes fraud from error is whether theunderlying action that results in the misstatement in the financialstatements is intentional or unintentionalaware of the possibility that indirect illegal acts may haveoccurred Under GAGAS the term noncompliance however has abroader meaning than fraud and illegal acts Noncompliance includesnot only fraud and illegal acts but also violations of provisionsof contracts or grant agreements Under GAGAS auditors have the same responsibilities fordetecting material misstatements arising from other types ofnoncompliance as they do for detecting those arising from fraud andillegal acts Direct and material noncompliance is noncompliancehaving a direct and material effect on the determination offinancial statement amounts or could have a significant effect onother financial data needed to achieve audit objectives Auditorsshould design the audit to provide reasonable assurance ofdetecting material misstatements resulting from direct and materialnoncompliance with provisions of contracts or grant agreementsIndirect noncompliance is noncompliance having material butindirect effects on financial statements or other financial dataneeded to achieve audit objectives If specific information comesto the auditors attention that provides evidence concerning theexistence of possible noncompliance that could have a materialindirect effect on the financial statements or significant indirecteffect on other financial data need to achieve audit objectivesauditors should apply audit procedures specifically directed toascertaining whether that noncompliance has occurred or is likelyto have occurredAUDIT DOCUMENTATION An additional standard related to audit documentation forfinancial audits performed in accordance with GAGAS isAudit documentation should contain sufficient information toenable an experienced reviewer who has had no previous connectionwith the audit to ascertain from the audit documentation theevidence that supports the auditors significant judgments andconclusions Audit documentation that supports significantfindings conclusions and recommendations should be completebefore auditors issue their report AICPA standards and GAGAS require auditors to prepare andmaintain audit documentation The form and content of auditdocumentation should be designed to meet the circumstances of theparticular audit The information contained in audit documentationconstitutes the principal record of the work that the auditors haveperformed and the conclusions that the auditors have reached Thequantity type and content of audit documentation is a matter ofthe auditors professional judgmentHowever audits performed in accordance with GAGAS are subjectto review by other reviewers and by oversight officials morefrequently than audits done in accordance with AICPA standardsThus whereas AICPA standards cite two main purposes of auditdocumentationproviding the principal support for the audit reportand aiding auditors in performing and supervising the auditauditdocumentation serves an additional purpose in audits performed inaccordance with GAGAS Audit documentation allows for the review ofaudit quality by providing the reviewer documentation either inwritten or electronic formats of the evidence supporting theauditors significant judgments and conclusions Audit documentation for financial audits performed underGAGAS should contain the followingaThe objectives scope and methodology includingsampling and other selection criteria usedbDocumentation of the auditors determination that certainadditional government auditing standards do not apply or that anapplicable standard was not followed the reasons therefore andthe known effect that not following the standard had or couldhave on the auditcDocumentation of the work performed to supportsignificant judgments and conclusions including descriptions oftransactions and records examined that would enable an experiencedreviewer to examine the same transactions and recordsdAuditors basis for assessing control risk at the maximumlevel for assertions related to materialAuditors may meet this requirement by listing voucher numberscheck numbers or other means of identifying specific documentsthey examined Auditors are not required to include copies ofdocuments they examined as part of the audit documentation nor areauditors required to list detailed information from thosedocumentsaccount balances transaction classes and disclosure componentsof financial statements when such assertions are significantlydependent upon computerized information systems by addressing the ineffectiveness of the design andor operation of the controlsor  the reasons why it would be inefficient to test thecontrolseThe consideration that the planned audit procedures aredesigned to achieve audit objectives when evidential matterobtained is highly dependent on computerized information systemsand is material to the audit objective and the auditors are notrelying on the effectiveness of internal control over thosecomputerized systems that produced the information The auditdocumentation should specifically address  the rationale fordetermining the nature timing and extent of planned auditprocedures  the kinds and competence of available evidentialmatter produced outside a computerized information system and the effect on the audit report if evidential matter to be gathereddoes not afford a reasonable basis to achieve the auditobjectivesfEvidence of supervisory reviews of the workperformedUnderlying GAGAS audits is that federal state and localgovernments and other organizations cooperate in auditing programsof common interest so that auditors may use others work and avoidduplicate audit efforts In addition audits performed inaccordance with GAGAS are subject to quality control and assurancereviews Auditors should make arrangements to make auditdocumentation available upon request in a timely manner to otherauditors or reviewers Contractual arrangements for GAGAS auditsshould provide for full and timely access to audit documentation tofacilitate reliance by other auditors on the auditors work aswell as reviews of audit quality control and assuranceAudit organizations should establish reasonable policiesand procedures for the safe custody and retention of auditdocumentation for a time sufficient to satisfy legal andadministrative requirements If audit documentation is onlyretained electronically the audit organization should ensure thatthe electronic documentation is capable of being accessedthroughout the specifiedThis documentation requirement does not increase the auditorsresponsibility for testing internal control but is intended toassist the auditor in ensuring that audit objectives are met andaudit risk is reduced to an acceptable levelretention period established for auditdocumentation and is safeguarded through sound computersecurityADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR FINANCIAL AUDITS PERFORMED INACCORDANCE WITH GAGAS As discussed in chapter  financial audits contribute tomaking governments more accountable for the use of public resourcesand the delivery of services Because of the increasedaccountability associated with government audits auditorsperforming financial audits in accordance with GAGAS shouldconsider the following guidance related to audit risk andmateriality see paragraphs  and  internal control oversafeguarding of assets see paragraphs  through  internalcontrol over compliance see paragraphs  through  andprofessional judgment concerning possible fraud and illegal actssee paragraphs  and Audit Risk and MaterialityThe AICPA standards and GAGAS require that the work is tobe properly planned and auditors should consider audit risk andmateriality among other matters in determining the naturetiming and extent of auditing procedures and in evaluating theresults of those procedures Auditors consideration of audit riskand materiality is a matter of professional judgment and isinfluenced by their perception of the needs of a reasonable personwho will rely on the financial statements Materiality judgmentsare made in light of surrounding circumstances and necessarilyinvolve both quantitative and qualitativeconsiderationsIn an audit of a government entity or an entity thatreceives government assistance auditors may need to set lowermateriality levels than in audits in the private sector because ofthe public accountability of the audited entity the various legaland regulatory requirements and the visibility and sensitivity ofgovernment programs activities and functionsInternal Control Over Safeguarding of AssetsSafeguarding of assets is an internal control objectivethat is especially important in performing financial audits ofgovernmental entities or others receiving government funds Giventhe public accountability for stewardship of resourcessafeguarding of assets permeates control objectives and componentsas defined by the AICPA standards and GAGASAs applied to financial audits internal control oversafeguarding of assets constitutes a process effected by anentitys governing body management and other personnel designedto provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timelydetection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of theentitys assets that could have a material effect on the financialstatementsInternal control over the safeguarding of assets relatesto the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized transactionsand unauthorized access to assets that could result in losses thatare material to the financial statements such as when unauthorizedexpenditures or investments are made unauthorized liabilities areincurred inventory is stolen or assets are converted to personaluse Such controls are designed to help ensure the use of andaccess to assets are in accordance with managements authorizationAuthorization includes approval of transactions in accordance withcontrol activities established by management to safeguard assetssuch as establishing and complying with requirements for extendingand monitoring credit or making investment decisions and relateddocumentation Control over safeguarding of assets is not designedto protect against loss of assets arising from inefficiency or frommanagements operating decisions such as incurring expendituresfor equipment or material that proves to be unnecessary orunsatisfactoryAICPA standards and GAGAS require auditors to obtain asufficient understanding of internal control to plan the auditThey also require auditors to plan the audit to provide reasonableassurance of detecting material fraud including materialmisappropriation of assets Because preventing orAuditors should apply the guidance contained in this sectionto other types of financial audits to the extent it is applicableto the nature of the engagementdetecting material misappropriations is an objective of controlover safeguarding of assets understanding this type of control canbe essential to planning the auditControl over safeguarding of assets is not limited topreventing or detecting misappropriations It also helps prevent ordetect other material losses that could result from unauthorizedacquisition use or disposition of assets Such controls includefor example the process of assessing the risk of unauthorizedacquisition use or disposition of assets and establishing controlactivities to help ensure that management directives to address therisk are carried out Such control activities would includepermitting acquisition use or disposition of assets only inaccordance with managements general or specific authorizationincluding compliance with established control activities for suchacquisition use or disposition They would also include comparingexisting assets with the related records at reasonable intervalsand taking appropriate action with respect to any differencesFinally controls over safeguarding of assets against unauthorizedacquisition use or disposition also relate to making available tomanagement information it needs to carry out its responsibilitiesrelated to prevention or timely detection of such unauthorizedactivities as well as mechanisms to enable management to monitorthe continued effective operation of such controlsUnderstanding the control over safeguarding of assets canhelp auditors assess the risk that financial statements could bematerially misstated For example an understanding of the auditedentitys control over the safeguarding of assets can help auditorsrecognize risk factors such asafailure to adequately monitor decentralizedoperationsblack of control over activities such as lack ofseparation of duties or approval for major transactionsclack of control over computerized information systemssuch as a lack of control over access to applications that initiateor control the movement of assetsdfailure to develop or communicate adequate controlactivities for security of data or assets such as allowingunauthorized personnel to have ready access to data or assetsandefailure to investigate significant unreconcileddifferences between reconciliations of a control account andsubsidiary recordsInternal Control Over ComplianceGovernmental entities are subject to a variety of lawsand regulations that affect their financial statements or otherfinancial data which is a major factor distinguishing governmentalaccounting from privatesector accounting For example such lawsand regulations may address the required fund structureprocurement or debt limitations or authority for transactionsAccordingly compliance with such laws and regulations may have adirect and material effect on the determination of amounts in thefinancial statements of governmental entities Likewise entitiesthat receive government assistance such as contractors nonprofitentities and other nongovernmental entities are also subject toregulations contract provisions or grant agreements that couldhave a direct and material effect on their financial statementsManagement of both governmental entities and others receivinggovernmental assistance is responsible for ensuring that theentity complies with not only the laws and regulations but alsocontract provisions and grant agreements applicable to itsactivities That responsibility

statementsare free of material misstatements resulting from noncompliancethat have a direct and material effect on the determination offinancial statement amounts To meet this requirement auditorsshould have an understanding of internal control relevant tofinancial statement assertions affected by those laws regulationscontract provisions or grant agreements Auditors may find itnecessary to use the work of legal counsel in determiningwhich laws and regulations might have a direct and materialeffect on the financial statements  designing tests ofcompliance with laws and regulations and  evaluating theresults of those tests Auditors also may find it necessary touse the work of legal counsel when an audit requires testingcompliance with provisions of contracts or grant agreementsDepending on the circumstances of the audit auditors may find itnecessary to obtain information on compliance matters from otherssuch as investigative staff audit organizations and officials ofgovernment entities that provided assistance to the audited entityandor the applicable law enforcement authority AICPA standards and GAGAS require that auditors use theirunderstanding of internal control relevant to financial statementassertions affected by laws and regulations to identify types ofpotential misstatements consider factors that affect the risk ofmaterial misstatement and design substantive tests GAGAS extendsthis requirement to include contract provisions and grantagreements In applying this requirement the following factors mayinfluence the auditors assessment of control riskamanagements awareness or lack of awareness of applicablelaws regulations contract provisions or grantagreementsbpolicy of the audited entity regarding such matters asacceptable operating

professional judgment inpursuing indications of possible fraud and illegal acts so as notto interfere with potential future investigations legalproceedings or both Under some circumstances laws regulationsor policies may require auditors to report indications of certaintypes of fraud or illegal acts to law enforcement or investigatoryauthorities before extending audit steps and procedures Auditorsmay also be required to withdraw from or defer further work on theaudit or a portion of the audit in order not to interfere with aninvestigationAn audit made in accordance with GAGAS will not guaranteethe discovery of fraud or illegal acts or contingent liabilitiesresulting from them Nor does the subsequent discovery of illegalacts committed during the audit period mean that the auditorsperformance was inadequate provided the audit was made inaccordance with GAGASCHAPTER REPORTING STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AUDITSINTRODUCTION This chapter presents reporting standards for

GENERALLY ACCEPTED GOVERNMENT AUDITINGSTANDARDS An additional reporting standard for financial auditsconducted in accordance with GAGAS isAudit reports should state that the audit was made in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standardsThe above statement refers to all the applicablestandards that the auditors should have followed during theiraudit The statement referencing compliance with generally acceptedgovernment auditing standards should be qualified in situationswhere the auditors did not follow an applicable standard In thesesituations the auditors should disclose in the scope section ofthe report the applicable standard that was not followed thereasons therefore and how not following the standard affected orcould have affected the results of the auditWhen the report on the financial audit is submitted tocomply with a legal regulatory or contractual requirement for aGAGAS audit it should specifically cite GAGAS The report on thefinancial audit may cite AICPA standards as well asGAGASAn audited entity receiving a GAGAS audit report may alsoneed a financial audit report for purposes other than to complywith requirements calling for a GAGAS audit For example theaudited entity may need audited financial statements to issue bondsor for other financing purposes When a GAGAS audit is the basisfor an auditors subsequent report under the AICPA standards itwould be advantageous to users of the subsequent report for theauditors report to include the information on compliance with lawsand regulations and internal control that is required

same document on compliance with laws andregulations and internal control over financial reporting thereport on the financial statements should state that the auditorsare issuing those additional reports The report on the financialstatements should also state that the reports on compliance withlaws and regulations and internal control over financial reportingare an integral part of a GAGAS

on deficiencies in internal control auditorsshould identify those that are individually or in the aggregateconsidered to be material weaknesses Auditors should place theirfindings in proper

weakness as a reportablecondition in which the design or operation of one or more of theinternal control components does not reduce to a relatively lowlevel the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud inamounts that would be material in relation to the financialstatements being audited may occur and not be detected within atimely period by employees in the normal course of performing theirassigned functionsconsequences of these findings the instances identified shouldbe related to the population or the number of cases examined and bequantified in terms of dollar value if appropriate Auditors mayinclude such information in their audit report or may prepare aseparate report If auditors report separately the audit reportshould contain a reference to the separate report containing thisinformation and state that the separate report is an integral partof the audit and should be considered in assessing the results ofthe auditTo the extent possible auditors should present findingsto identify the elements of criteria condition and effect aswell as cause when problems are found In addition auditors shouldprovide recommendations for corrective action if auditors are ableto sufficiently develop the findings However the elements neededfor a finding depend entirely on the scope and objectives of thefinancial audit and as a result may not always have all of theelements fully developed At a minimum auditors should identifythe condition criteria and possible effect to provide sufficientinformation to federal state and local officials to assist themin taking corrective actionWhen auditors detect deficiencies in internal controlthat are not reportable conditions they should communicate thosedeficiencies to officials of the audited entity preferably inwriting If the auditors have communicated other deficiencies ininternal control in a management letter to officials of the auditedentity auditors should refer to that management letter when theyreport on internal control Auditors should include in their auditdocumentation evidence of all communications to officials of theaudited entity about deficiencies in internal controlREPORTING FRAUD ILLEGAL ACTS AND OTHER NONCOMPLIANCE An additional reporting standard for financial auditsconducted in accordance with GAGAS isFor audits of financial statements such information isgenerally included in the reports on compliance and internalcontrol over financial reportingAuditors should report fraud illegal acts or other materialnoncompliance In some circumstances auditors should report fraudand illegal acts directly to parties external to the auditedentityAICPA standards and GAGAS require auditors to address theeffect fraud or illegal acts may have on the audit report and todetermine that the audit committee or others with equivalentauthority and responsibility are adequately informed about thefraud or illegal acts The additional GAGAS standard does notmodify these responsibilities However AICPA standards do notrequire that this communication be written nor do they addresscommunication regarding other noncompliance violations of othercompliance requirements such as provisions of contracts or grantagreementsWhen auditors conclude on the basis of evidenceobtained that fraud or an illegal act either has occurred or islikely to have occurred they should report the relevantinformation Auditors need not report information about fraud or anillegal act that is clearly inconsequential Thus auditors shouldinclude in their report the same information about fraud andillegal acts that they have informed the audit committees aboutunder AICPA standards Auditors should also report othernoncompliance that is material to the auditIn reporting material fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance the auditors should place their findings in properperspective by providing a description of the objectives scopeand methodology used to conduct the work To give the reader abasis for judging the prevalence and consequences of thesefindings the instances identified should be related to thepopulation or the number of cases examined and be quantified interms of dollar value if appropriate Auditors may include suchinformation in their audit report or may prepare a separate reportIf auditors report separately the audit report should contain areference to the separate report containing thisWhether a particular act is in fact illegal may have to awaitfinal determination by a court of law or other adjudicative bodyThus when auditors disclose matters that have led them to concludethat an illegal act is likely to have occurred they should notimply that they have made a determination of illegalityinformation and state that the report is an integral part ofthe audit and should be considered in assessing the results of theauditTo the extent possible auditors should present findingsto identify the elements of criteria condition and effect aswell as cause when problems are found In addition auditors shouldprovide recommendations for corrective action if auditors are ableto sufficiently develop the findings However the elements neededfor a finding depend entirely on the scope and objectives of thefinancial audit and as a result may not always have all of theelements fully developed At a minimum auditors should identifythe condition criteria and possible effect to provide sufficientinformation to federal state and local officials to assist themin taking corrective action Auditors should also obtain the viewsof responsible officials of the audited entity regarding thefindings and include this information in the report asappropriateWhen auditors detect fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance that do not meet criteria for reporting in paragraph they should communicate those findings to officials of theaudited entity preferably in writing If auditors havecommunicated those findings in a management letter to officials ofthe audited entity auditors should refer to that management letterwhen they report on compliance Auditors may provide less extensivedisclosure of fraud and illegal acts that are not material ineither a quantitative or qualitative sense Auditors shouldinclude in their audit documentation evidence of all communicationsto officials of the audited entity about fraud illegal acts andother noncomplianceDirect Reporting of Fraud and Illegal Acts GAGAS require auditors to report fraud or illegal actsdirectly to parties outside the audited entity in twocircumstances as discussed below These requirements are inaddition to any legalFor audits of financial statements such information isgenerally included in the reports on compliance with laws andregulations and internal control over financial reportingParagraphs  and  provide guidance on factors that mayinfluence auditors materiality judgments in audits of governmententities or entities receiving government assistance AICPAstandards provide guidance on the interaction of quantitative andqualitative considerations in materiality judgmentsrequirements for direct reporting of fraud or illegal actsAuditors should meet these requirements even if they have resignedor been dismissed from the auditOfficials of the audited entity may be required by law orregulation to report certain fraud or illegal acts to specifiedexternal parties such as a federal inspector general or a stateattorney general If auditors have communicated such fraud orillegal acts to officials of the audited entity and they fail toreport them then the auditors should communicate such an awarenessto the governing body of the audited entity If the officials ofthe audited entity do not make the required report as soon aspracticable after the auditors communication with the entitysgoverning body then the auditors should report the fraud orillegal acts directly to the external party specified in the law orregulationManagement of the audited entity is responsible fortaking timely and appropriate steps to remedy fraud or illegal actsthat auditors report to it When fraud or an illegal act involvesassistance received directly or indirectly from a governmentagency auditors may have a duty to report directly if managementfails to take remedial steps If auditors conclude that suchfailure is likely to cause them to depart from the standard reporton the financial statements or resign from the audit then theyshould communicate that conclusion to the governing body of theaudited entity Then if officials of the audited entity do notreport the fraud or illegal act as soon as practicable to theentity that provided the government assistance the auditors shouldreport the fraud or illegal act directly to that entityIn both of these situations auditors should obtainsufficient competent and relevant evidence such as confirmationwith outside parties to corroborate assertions by management thatit has reported fraud or illegal acts If they are unable to do sothen the auditors should report the fraud or illegal acts directlyas discussed aboveUnder some circumstances laws regulations or policiesmay require auditors to report promptly indications of certaintypes of fraud or illegal acts to law enforcement orinvestigatoryInternal audit organizations do not have a duty to reportoutside that entity unless required by law rule regulation orpolicyauthorities When auditors conclude that this type of fraud orillegal act either has occurred or is likely to have occurred theyshould ask those authorities andor legal counsel if reportingcertain information about that fraud or illegal act wouldcompromise investigative or legal proceedings Auditors shouldlimit their reporting to matters that would not compromise thoseproceedings such as information that is already a part of thepublic recordVIEWS OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS An additional reporting standard for financial auditsperformed in accordance with GAGAS isIf the auditors report discloses significant deficienciesauditors should report the views of responsible officialsconcerning the findings conclusions and recommendations as wellas corrections plannedOne of the most effective ways to ensure that a report isfair complete and objective is to obtain advance review andcomments by responsible officials of the audited entity and othersas may be appropriate Including the views of responsible officialsproduces a report that shows not only what was found and what theauditors think about it but also what the responsible persons thinkabout it and what they plan to do about itAuditors should normally request that the responsibleofficials views on significant findings conclusions andrecommendations be submitted in writing Oral comments areacceptable as well and in some cases may be the only or mostexpeditious way to obtain comments Cases in which obtaining oralcomments can be effective include when there is a timecriticalneed to meet a users needs the auditor has worked closely withthe responsible officials throughout the conduct of the work andthe parties are very familiar with the findings and issuesaddressed in the draft product or the auditor does not expectmajor disagreements with the draft reports findings conclusionsand recommendations or perceive any major controversies withregard to the issued discussed in the draft report Auditors shouldprepare aGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftsummary of the officials oral comments and provide a copy ofthe summary to management of the audited entity to verify that thecomments are accurately statedComments should be fairly and objectively evaluated andrecognized as appropriate in the final report Comments such asa promise or plan for corrective action should be noted but shouldnot be accepted as justification for dropping a significant findingor a related recommendationWhen the comments oppose the reports

fair and objective manner Conversely the auditorsshould modify their report as necessary if they find the commentsvalid Auditors may wish to attach the comment letter to the auditreport to provide the reader with both points of viewPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION An additional reporting standard for financial auditsconducted in accordance with GAGAS isIf certain pertinent information is prohibited from generaldisclosure the audit report should state the nature of theinformation omitted and the requirement that makes the omissionnecessary Certain information may be prohibited from generaldisclosure by federal state or local laws or regulations Suchinformation may be provided on a needtoknow basis in a separatelimited officialuse report which is restricted to only personsauthorized by law or regulation to receive it The auditors shouldwhen appropriate consult with legal counsel regarding anyrequirements or other circumstances that may necessitate theomission of certain information Additional circumstances associated with public safety andsecurity concerns could also justify the exclusion of certaininformation in the report For example information related tocomputer security for a particular program should be excluded frompublicly available reports because of the potential damage thatcould be caused by the misuse of this information In suchcircumstances auditors may issue a limited officialuse reportcontaining such information and distribute the report only to thoseparties responsible for acting on the auditors recommendations

ofmanagement of the audited entityTo the extent possible auditors should present findingsto identify the elements of criteria condition and effect aswell as cause when problems are found In addition auditors shouldprovide recommendations for corrective action if auditors are ableto sufficiently develop the findings However the elements neededfor a finding depend entirely on the scope and objectives of theattestation engagement and as a result may not always have allof the elements fully developed At a minimum auditors shouldidentify the condition criteria and possible effect to

illegal actis likely to have occurred they should not imply that they havemade a determination of illegalityGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure DraftIf the auditors report discloses significant deficienciesauditors should report the views of responsible officialsconcerning the findings conclusions and recommendations as wellas corrections plannedOne of the most effective ways to ensure that a report isfair complete and objective is to obtain advance review andcomments by responsible officials of the audited entity and othersas may be appropriate Including the views of responsible officialsproduces a report that shows not only what was found and what theauditors think about it but also what the responsible persons thinkabout it and what they plan to do about itAuditors should normally request that the responsibleofficials views on significant findings conclusions andrecommendations be submitted in writing Oral comments areacceptable as well and in some cases may be the only or mostexpeditious way to obtain comments Cases in which obtaining oralcomments can be effective include when there is a timecriticalneed to meet a users needs the auditors have

conducting performance audits in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards GAGAS Thefield work standards for performance audits relate to planning theaudit supervising staff obtaining sufficient competent andrelevant evidence and preparing audit documentationPLANNING The field work standard related to planning for performanceaudits conducted in accordance with GAGAS isWork is to be adequately plannedIn planning the audit auditors should define the auditobjectives as well as the scope and methodology to achieve thoseobjectives Audit objectives scope and methodologies are notdetermined in isolation Auditors determine these three elements ofthe audit plan together as the considerations in determining eachoften overlap Planning is a continuous process throughout theaudit Therefore auditors should consider the need to makeadjustments to the audit objectives scope and methodology as workis being completedThe objectives are what the audit is intended toaccomplish They identify the audit subjects and performanceaspects to be included as well as the potential finding andreporting elementsthat the auditors expect to develop Audit objectives can bethought of as questions about the program that auditors seek toanswer See chapter Scope is the boundary of the audit and should be directlytied to the audit objectives For example the scope definesparameters of the audit such as the period of time reviewed theavailability of necessary documentation or records and the numberof locations at which field work will be conductedThe methodology comprises the work involved in gatheringand analyzing data to achieve the objectives Audit procedures arethe specific steps and tests auditors will carry out to address theaudit objectives Auditors should design the methodology to providesufficient competent and relevant evidence to achieve theobjectives of the audit Methodology includes both the types andextent of audit procedures used to achieve the audit objectivesAuditors may use different methodologies drawn from a wide varietyof disciplinesPlanning should be documented and shouldincludeaconsidering the significance of various

ormethodologies developed by other professional organizations whenperforming work under GAGAS the auditor should also apply thestandards in this chapter as appropriate Even if auditors do notfollow such other standards and methodologies they may still serveas a useful source of guidance to auditors in planning their workunder GAGAS However if auditors decide to perform their work inaccordance

The significance of a matter is its relative importance tothe audit objectives and potential users of the audit reportAuditors should consider the significance of a program or programcomponent and the potential use that will be made of the auditresults or report as they plan a performance audit Indicators ofsignificance andor use to consider includeavisibility and sensitivity of the program underauditbnewness of the program or changes in itsconditionscrole of the audit in providing information that canimprove public accountability and decisionmaking anddlevel and extent of review or other forms of independentoversight One group of users of the auditors report is governmentofficials who may have authorized or requested the audit Anotherimportant user of the auditors report is the entity being auditedwhich is responsible for acting on the auditors recommendationsOther potential users of the auditors report include governmentlegislators or officials other than those who may have authorizedor requested the audit the media interest groups and individualcitizens In addition to an interest in the program potentialusers may have an ability to influence the conduct of the programAn awareness of these potential users interests and influence canhelp auditors understand why the program operates the way it doesThis awareness can also help auditors judge whether possiblefindings could be significant to various possible usersUnderstanding the Program Auditors should obtain an understanding of the program tobe audited to help assess among other matters the significance ofpossible audit objectives and the feasibility of achieving themThe auditors understanding may come from knowledge they alreadyhave about the program or knowledge they gain from inquiries andobservations they make in planning the audit The extent andbreadth of those inquiries and observations will vary among auditsbased on the audit objectives as will the need to understandindividual aspects of the program such as the followingaLaws and regulations Government programs usually arecreated by law and are subject to more specific laws andregulations than the private sector For example laws andregulations usually set forth what is to be done who is to do itthe purpose to be achieved the population to be served and howmuch can be spent on what Thus understanding the laws and thelegislative history establishing a program can be essential tounderstanding the program itself Obtaining that understanding isalso a necessary step in identifying provisions of laws andregulations significant to audit objectivesbPurpose and goals Purpose is the result or effect thatis intended or desired from a programs operation Legislaturesusually establish the program purpose when they provide authorityfor the program Entity officials may provide more detailedguidance on program purpose to supplement the authorizinglegislation Entity officials are sometimes asked to set goals forprogram performance and operations including both outcome andoutput goals Auditors may use the stated program purpose and goalsas criteria for assessing program performance or may developadditional criteria or best practices to compare the programwithcInternal control Internal control often referred to asmanagement controls in the broadest sense includes the plan oforganization methods and procedures adopted by management to meetits missions goals and objectives Internal control includes theprocesses for planning organizing directing and controllingprogram operations It includes the systems for measuringreporting and monitoring program performance Internal controlalso serves as the first line of defense in safeguarding assets andpreventing and detecting errors and fraud Paragraphs  through contain guidance pertaining to internal controldEfforts Efforts are the amount of resources in terms ofmoney material personnel and so forth that are put into aprogram These resources may come from within or outside the entityoperating the program Measures of efforts can have a number ofdimensions such as costtiming and quality Examples of measuresof efforts are dollars employeehours and square feet of buildingspaceeProgram operations Program operations are thestrategies processes and activities management uses to convertefforts into outputs Program operations are subject to internalcontrolfOutputs Outputs represent the quantity of a good orservice produced by a program For example an output measure for ajob training program could be the number of persons completingtraining and an output measure for an aviation safety inspectionprogram could be the number of safety inspectionscompletedgOutcomes Outcomes are accomplishments or results ofprograms For example an outcome measure for a job trainingprogram could be the percentage of trained persons obtaining a joband still in the work place after a specified period of timeExamples of outcome measures for an aviation safety inspectionprogram could be the percentage reduction in significant safetyproblems found in subsequent inspections andor the percentage ofsignificant problems deemed corrected in followup inspectionsSuch outcome measures show progress in achieving the stated programpurposes of helping unemployable citizens get and keep jobs andimproving the safety of aviation operations Auditors should beaware that outcomes may be influenced by cultural economicphysical or technological factors outside the program Auditorsmay use approaches drawn from the field of program evaluation totry to isolate the effects of the program from these otherinfluencesInternal Control Auditors should obtain an understanding of the internalcontrol environment as well as specific internal controls thatare significant to the audit objectives including internal controlover compliance with legal and regulatory requirements andconsider whether the internal controls have been placed inoperation Auditors also need to consider whether any reliance willbe placed on internal controls in designing audit procedures Ifso auditors should includeGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftspecific tests of the effectiveness of internal control andconsider the results in designing audit procedures Management isresponsible for establishing effective internal control The lackof administrative continuity in government units because of changesin elected legislative bodies and in administrative organizationsincreases the need for effective internal control The following classification of internal control isintended to help auditors better understand internal controls anddetermine their significance to the audit objectivesaEffectiveness and efficiency of program

on the federalinternal control standards provides a systematic organized andstructured approach to assessing the internal controlstructureGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft Understanding the controls relevant to compliance with thoselaws and regulations that the auditors have determined aresignificant can help auditors assess the risk of illegal actsA subset of these categories of internal control is thesafeguarding of resources Controls over the safeguarding ofresources include policies and procedures that management hasimplemented to reasonably prevent or promptly detect unauthorizedacquisition use or disposition of resourcesAuditors can obtain an understanding of internal controlthrough inquiries observations inspection of documents andrecords or review of other auditors reports The proceduresauditors perform to obtain an understanding of internal controlwill vary among audits One factor influencing the extent of theseprocedures is the auditors knowledge about internal control gainedin prior audits Also the need to understand internal control willdepend on the particular aspects of the program the auditorsconsider in setting objectives scope and methodology Thefollowing are examples of how the auditors understanding ofinternal control can influence the audit planaAudit objectives Poorly controlled aspects of a programhave a higher risk of failure so they may be more significant thanothers in terms of where auditors would want to focus theireffortsbAudit scope Knowledge of the internal controlenvironment and the status

selected functionsThe term noncompliance includes not only illegal acts resultingfrom violations of laws and regulations but also violations ofprovisions of contracts or grant agreementssignificant instances of noncompliance See paragraphs through  for a discussion of evidence indicative of fraudillegal acts or other noncomplianceAuditors may find it necessary to work with legal counselto

find it necessary to obtain information oncompliance matters from others such as investigative staff otheraudit organizations or government entities that provided assistanceto the audited entity or the applicable law enforcementauthorityIt is not practical to set precise standards fordetermining if laws regulations or other compliance requirementsare significant to audit objectives because government programs aresubject to many laws regulations and other compliancerequirements and audit objectives vary widely However auditorsmay find the following approach helpful in making thatdeterminationaReduce each audit objective to questions about specificaspects of the program being audited that is purpose and goalsinternal control efforts program operations outputs andoutcomes

be appropriate to have experienced staff reviewmuch of the work of other staff with similar experienceEVIDENCE The third field work standard for performance auditsisSufficient competent and relevant evidence is to be obtainedto afford a reasonable basis for the auditors findings andconclusionsA large part of auditors work on an audit concernsobtaining and evaluating evidence that ultimately supports theirjudgments and conclusions pertaining to the audit objectives Inevaluating evidence auditors consider whether they have obtainedthe evidence necessary to achieve specific audit objectives Wheninternal control or compliance requirements are significant to theaudit objectives auditors should also collect and evaluateevidence relating to controls or complianceEvidence may be categorized as physical documentarytestimonial and analytical Physical evidence is obtained byauditors direct inspection or observation of people property orevents Such evidence may be documented in memoranda photographsdrawings charts maps or physical samples Documentary evidenceconsists of created information such as letters contractsaccounting records invoices and management information onperformance Testimonial evidence is obtained through inquiriesinterviews or questionnaires Analytical evidence includescomputations comparisons separation of information intocomponents and rational argumentsThe guidance in the following paragraphs is intended tohelp auditors judge the quality and quantity of evidence needed tosatisfy audit objectives Paragraphs  through  describe theelements of an audit finding Paragraphs  through  provideguidance to help auditors determine what constitutes sufficientcompetent and relevant evidence to support their findings andconclusionsAudit FindingsAudit findings often have been regarded as containing theelements of criteria condition and effect plus cause whenproblems are found However the elements needed for a findingdepend entirely on the objectives of the audit Thus a finding orset of findings is complete to the extent that the audit objectivesare satisfied and the report clearly relates those objectives tothe findings elements Criteria are discussed in paragraph and the other elements of a findingcondition effect andcauseare discussed in the following paragraphsCondition Condition is a situation that exists It hasbeen determined and documented during the auditEffect Effect has two meanings which depend on theaudit objectives When the auditors objectives include identifyingthe actual or potential consequences of a condition that varieseither positively or negatively from the criteria identified inthe audit effect is a measure of those consequences Auditorsoften use effect in this sense to demonstrate the need forcorrective action in response to identified problems When theauditors objectives include estimating the extent to which aprogram has caused changes in physical social or economicconditions effect is a measure of the impact achieved by theprogram Here effect is the extent to which positive or negativechanges in actual physical social or economic conditions can beidentified and attributed to program operationsCause Like effect cause also has two meanings whichdepend on the audit objectives When the auditors objectivesinclude explaining why a particular type of positive or negativeperformance identified in the audit occurred the reasons for thatperformance are referred to as cause Identifying the cause ofproblems can assist auditors in making constructive recommendationsfor correction Because problems can result from a number ofplausible factors or multiple causes the recommendation can bemore persuasive if auditors can clearly demonstrate and explainwith evidence and reasoning the link between the problems and thefactor or factors they identified as the underlying cause When theauditors objectives includeestimating the programs effect on changesin physical social or economic conditions they seek evidence ofthe extent to which the program itself is the cause of thosechangesTests of Evidence Evidence should be sufficient competent and relevant tosupport a sound basis for audit findings conclusions andrecommendationsaEvidence should be sufficient to support the auditorsfindings In determining the sufficiency of evidence auditorsshould ensure that enough evidence exists to persuade aknowledgeable person of the validity of the findings Whenappropriate statistical methods may be used to establishsufficiencybEvidence is competent if it is consistent with fact thatis evidence is competent if it is valid and reliable Inassessing the competence of evidence auditors should consider suchfactors as whether the evidence is accurate authoritative timelyand authentic When appropriate auditors may use statisticalmethods to derive competent evidencecEvidence is relevant if it has a logical sensiblerelationship to the issue being addressed The following presumptions are useful in judging thecompetence of evidence However these presumptions are not to beconsidered sufficient in themselves to determine competence Theamount and kinds of evidence required to support auditorsconclusions should be based on auditors professional judgmentaEvidence obtained when internal controls are effective ismore competent than evidence obtained when controls are weak

freely is more competent than testimonialevidence obtained under compromising conditions for example wherethe persons may be intimidatedeTestimonial evidence obtained from an individual who isnot biased or has complete knowledge about the area is morecompetent than testimonial evidence obtained from an individual whois biased or has only partial knowledge about the areafEvidence obtained from a credible third party may in somecases be more competent than that secured from management or otherofficials of the audited entityAuditors may find it useful to obtain writtenrepresentations concerning the competence of certain evidence fromofficials of the audited entity Written representations ordinarilyconfirm oral representations given to auditors indicate anddocument the continuing appropriateness of such representationsand reduce the possibility of misunderstanding concerning thematters that are the subject of the representations Writtenrepresentations can take several forms including having entitymanagement sign summary documents prepared by theauditorsThe auditors approach to determining the sufficiencycompetence and relevance of evidence depends on the source of theinformation that constitutes the evidence Information sourcesinclude original data gathered by auditors and existing datagathered by either management or a third party Data from any ofthese sources may be obtained from computerbasedsystemsData gathered by auditors Data gathered by auditorsinclude the auditors own observations and measurements Among themethods for gathering this type of data are questionnairesstructured interviews direct observations and computations Thedesign of these methods and the skill of the auditors applying themare the keys to ensuring that these data constitute sufficientcompetent and relevant evidence When these methods are applied todetermine cause auditors are concerned with eliminating rivalexplanationsData gathered by management Auditors can use datagathered by management as part of their evidence However auditorsshould determine the validity and reliability of these data thatare significant to the audit objectives and may do so by directtests of the data Auditors can reduce the direct tests of the dataif they test the effectiveness of the entitys internal controlsover the validity and reliability of the data and these testssupport the conclusion that the controls are effective The natureand extent of testing of the data will depend on the significanceof the data to support auditors findingsData gathered by third parties The auditors evidencemay also include data gathered by third parties In some casesthese data may have been audited by others or the auditors may beable to audit the data themselves In other cases however it willnot be practical to obtain evidence of the datas validity andreliability How the use of unaudited thirdparty data affects theauditors report depends on the datas significance to theauditors findings For example in some circumstances auditorsmay use unaudited data to provide background information howeverthe use of such unaudited data would generally not be appropriateto

transactionsthat could be indicative of fraud illegal acts violations of lawsand regulations or other noncompliance violations of othercompliance requirements such as provisions of contracts or grantagreements When information comes to the auditors attentionthrough audit procedures allegations received through fraudhotlines or other means indicating that fraud illegal acts orother noncompliance may have occurred auditors should considerwhether the possible fraud illegal acts or other noncompliancecould significantly affect the audit results If they could theauditors should extend the audit steps and procedures asnecessary  to determine if fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance are likely to have occurred and  if so todetermine their effect on the audit resultsAuditors training experience and understanding of theprogram being audited may provide a basis for recognizing that someacts coming to their attention may be indicative of fraud illegalacts or other noncompliance Whether an act is in fact illegalis a determination to be made through the judicial or otheradjudicative system and is beyond auditors professional expertiseand responsibility However auditors are responsible for beingaware of vulnerabilities to fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance associated with the area being audited in order to beable to identify indications that fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance may have occurred In some circumstances conditionssuch as the following might indicate a heightened risk of fraudillegal acts or other noncomplianceaweak management which fails to enforce existing internalcontrol or to provide adequate oversight over the controlprocessbinadequate separation of duties especially those thatrelate to controlling and safeguarding resourcesctransactions that are out of the ordinary and are notsatisfactorily explained such as unexplained adjustments ininventories or other resourcesdinstances when employees of the audited entity refuse totake vacations or accept promotionsemissing or altered documents or unexplained delays inproviding informationffalse or misleading information orghistory of impropriety such as past audits orinvestigations with findings of questionable or criminalactivityAuditors should exercise professional judgment inpursuing indications of possible fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance so as not to interfere with potential investigationslegal proceedings or both Under some circumstances lawsregulations or policies require auditors to report indications ofcertain types of illegal acts to law enforcement or investigatoryauthorities before extending audit steps and procedures Auditorsmay also be required to withdraw from or defer further work on theaudit or a portion of the audit in order not to interfere with aninvestigationAn audit made in accordance with these standards providesreasonable assurance of detecting fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance that could significantly affect the audit results itdoes not guarantee the discovery of fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance Nordoes the subsequent discovery of such acts committed during theaudit period necessarily mean that the auditors performance wasinadequate provided the audit was made in accordance with thesestandards Abuse is distinct from illegal acts and othernoncompliance When abuse occurs no law regulation contractprovision or grant agreement is violated Rather the conduct of agovernment program falls far short of societal expectations forprudent program management Auditors should be alert to situationsor transactions that could be indicative of abuse When informationcomes to the auditors attention through audit proceduresallegations received through a fraud hotline or other meansindicating that abuse may have occurred auditors should considerwhether the possible abuse could significantly affect the auditresults If it could the auditors should extend the audit stepsand procedures as necessary  to determine if the abuseoccurred and  if so to determine its effect on the auditresults However because the determination of abuse is sosubjective auditors are not expected to provide reasonableassurance of detecting itAUDIT DOCUMENTATION The fourth field work standard for performance auditsisAuditors should prepare and maintain audit documentation Auditdocumentation should contain sufficient information to enable anexperienced reviewer who has had no previous connection with theaudit to ascertain from the audit documentation the evidence thatsupports the auditors significant judgments and conclusions Auditdocumentation that supports significant findings conclusions andrecommendations should be complete before auditors issue theirreport The form and content of audit documentation should bedesigned to meet the circumstances of the particular audit Theinformation contained in audit documentation constitutes theprincipal record of the work that the auditors have performed andthe conclusions that the auditors have reached The quantity typeand content of audit documentation is a matter of the auditorsprofessional judgment Audit documentation serves three main purposes  toprovide the principal support for the auditors report  to aidauditors in conducting and supervising the audit and  to allowfor the review of audit quality This third purpose is importantbecause audits done in accordance with GAGAS often are subject toreview by other auditors and by oversight officialsAudit documentation allows for the review of audit quality byproviding the reviewer documentation either in written orelectronic formats of the evidence supporting the auditorssignificant judgments and conclusionsAudit organizations should establish reasonable policiesand procedures for the safe custody and retention of auditdocumentation for a time sufficient to satisfy legal andadministrative requirements If audit documentation is onlyretained electronically the audit organization should ensure thatthe electronic documentation is capable of being accessedthroughout the specified retention period established for auditdocumentation and is safeguarded through sound computersecurityAudit documentation should containathe objectives scope and methodology includingsampling and other selection criteria usedbdocumentation of the auditors determination that certainstandards do not apply or that an applicable standard was notfollowed the reasons therefore and the known effect that notfollowing the standard had or could have on the auditcdocumentation of the work performed to supportsignificant judgments and conclusions including descriptions oftransactions and records examined that would enable an experiencedreviewer to examine the same transactions and recordsanddevidence of supervisory review of the workperformed Underlying GAGAS audits is that federal state and localgovernments and other organizations cooperate in auditing programsof common interest so that the auditors may use others work andavoid duplicate audit efforts In addition audits performed inaccordance with GAGAS are subject to quality control and assurancereviews Auditors should make arrangements to make auditdocumentation available upon request in a timely manner to otherauditors or reviewers Contractual arrangements for GAGAS auditsshould provide for full and timely access to audit documentation tofacilitate reliance by other auditors on the auditors work aswell as reviews of audit quality control and assuranceThe nature of this documentation will vary with the nature ofthe work performed For example when this work includesexamination of managements records the audit documentation shoulddescribe those records so that an experienced reviewer would beable to examine those same records Auditors may meet thisrequirement by listing file numbers case numbers or other meansof identifying specific documents they examined They are notrequired to include in the audit documentation copies of documentsthey examined nor are they required to list detailed informationfrom those documentsGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure DraftCHAPTER REPORTING STANDARDS FOR PERFORMANCE AUDITSINTRODUCTION This chapter prescribes reporting standards and providesguidance to auditors reporting on performance audits in accordancewith generally accepted government auditing standards GAGAS Thereporting standards for performance audits relate to the form ofthe report the report contents report quality and reportissuance and distributionFORM The first reporting standard for performance audits isAuditors should prepare audit reports communicating the resultsof each auditThe form of the audit report should be appropriate forits intended use Auditors should use their professional judgmentincluding consideration of users needs likely demand anddistribution in determining the form of the audit report Inaddition to a more formal presentation of audit results such as achapter report or a letter report briefing slides may beconsidered audit reports Audit reports also may be presented onelectronic media that are retrievable by report users and the auditorganization such as video or compact disk formats However tocomply with these standards audit reports regardless of formshould comply with all applicable reporting standardsThis standard is not intended to limit or preventdiscussion of findings judgments conclusions and recommendationswith persons who have responsibilities involving the area beingaudited On the contrary such discussions areencouragedAudit reports  communicate the results of audits toofficials at various levels of government make the results less susceptible to misunderstanding make the results available for public inspection and facilitate followup to determine whether appropriate correctiveactions have been taken The need to maintain public accountabilityfor government program demands that audit reports beretrievable When an audit is terminated before it is completed auditorsshould communicate that fact to management of the audited entitythe entity requesting the audit and other appropriate officialspreferably in writing In the absence of an audit report auditorsshould also write a memorandum for the record that summarizes theresults of the work to the date of termination and explains why theaudit was terminatedREPORT CONTENTS The second reporting standard for performance audits isThe audit report should include the objectives scope andmethodology the audit results including findings conclusionsand recommendations as appropriate a reference to compliance withgenerally accepted government auditing standards the views ofresponsible officials and if applicable the nature of anyprivileged and confidential information omittedObjectives Scope and Methodology Auditors should include in the report the audit objectivesand the scope and methodology used for achieving the auditobjectives This information is needed by report users tounderstand the purpose of the audit and the nature of the auditwork performed to provide perspective as to what is reported andto understand any significant limitations in audit objectivesscope or methodology Auditors should also report the status ofuncorrected significant findings and recommendations from prioraudits that affect the objectives of the current auditObjectives Audit objectives should be communicated to knowledgeableusers by reporting the questions that were to be answered in theaudit in a clear specific and neutral manner that avoids unstatedassumptions In reporting the audit objectives auditors shouldexplain why the audit organization undertook the assignment andstate what the report is to accomplish and why the subject matteris important Articulating what the report is to accomplishnormally involves identifying the audit subject and the aspect ofperformance examined The reported audit objectives provide moremeaningful information to report users if they are measurable andfeasible and avoid being presented in a broad or general manner Toreduce misunderstanding in cases where the objectives areparticularly limited and broader objectives can be inferred it maybe necessary to state objectives that were not pursuedScope and Methodology In reporting the scope of the audit auditors shoulddescribe the depth and coverage of work conducted to accomplish theaudits objectives Auditors should as applicable explain therelationship between the population of items sampled and what wasaudited identify organizations geographic locations and theperiod covered report the kinds and sources of evidence andexplainSignificant findings and recommendations are those mattersthat if not corrected could affect the results of the auditorswork and users conclusions about those results GAOGGovernment Auditing Standards Exposure Draftany problems with the evidence Auditors should also reportsignificant constraints imposed on the audit approach by datalimitations or scope impairmentsTo report the methodology used auditors should clearlyexplain how the audit objectives were accomplished including theevidence gathering and analysis techniques used in sufficientdetail to allow knowledgeable users of their reports to understandthe work This explanation should identify any significantassumptions made in conducting the audit describe any comparativetechniques applied describe the criteria used and when samplingsignificantly supports auditors findings describe the sampledesign and state why it was chosen including whether the resultscan be projected to the intended populationAuditors should attempt to avoid misunderstanding by thereport user concerning the work that was and was not done toachieve the audit objectives particularly when the work waslimited because of constraints on time or resources The auditorsreport should clearly describe the scope of the work performed andany limitations the applicable standards that were not followedand the reasons therefore and how not following the applicablestandards affected or could affect the results of the work Forexample if the auditors are unable to determine the reliability ofinformation from an agencys database and information from thisdatabase is critical to the audit findings the report shouldclearly state the limitations associated with the information andrefrain from making unwarranted conclusions or recommendations Inthese situations the audit report should also include the reasonsthe auditors were unable to perform this work and the potentialimpact on the findings if the information is notreliableAudit Results Auditors should report significant findings by providingcredible and convincing evidence that relates to the auditobjectives An audit report is improved when it provides sufficientcontextual sophistication to reflect an understanding of the issuesand an awareness of the external environment including sensitivityto relevant trends The report should provide selective backgroundinformationGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftto provide the context for the overall message and to help thereader understand the significance of the issues discussed Thereport should also include all significant instances of fraudillegal acts or other noncompliance and all significant instancesof abuse that were found during or in connection with the audit andany significant weaknesses in internal control found during theaudit and where applicable auditors conclusionsFindingsAuditors should report the significant findings developedin response to each audit objective These findings should besupported by sufficient competent and relevant evidence Theyalso should be presented in a manner to promote adequateunderstanding of the matters reported and to provide convincing butfair presentations in proper perspectiveAs discussed in chapter  findings often have beenregarded as containing the elements of criteria condition causeand effect However the elements needed for a finding depend onthe audit objectives Thus a finding or set of findings iscomplete to the extent that the audit objectives are satisfied andthe report clearly relates those objectives to the elements of thefindingAuditors should develop the elements of a finding in theaudit report as appropriate to satisfy the audit objectives Inreporting on elements of findings auditors may find it useful toconsider the following guidance on each finding elementAppropriate background information may include information onhow programsoperations work the significance ofprogramsoperations ie dollars impact purposes and pastaudit work if relevant a description of the audited entitysresponsibilities and explanation of terms organizationalstructure and statutory basis for the programoperationsWhether a particular act is in fact illegal may have to awaitfinal determination by a court of law Thus when auditors disclosematters that have led them to conclude that an illegal act islikely to have occurred they should take care not to imply thatthey have made a determination of illegality See paragraph for additional reporting considerationsSignificant weaknesses in internal controls may be discussed inthe report as an element of a finding Many times these weaknesseswill be described as the cause of the finding or in a processfinding will be the condition element Paragraphs  through describe the elements of a findingaCriteria An audit report is improved when it providesinformation so that the report user will be able to determine whatis the required or desired state or what is expected from theprogram or operation The criteria are easier to understand whenstated fairly explicitly and completely and the source of thecriteria are identified in the audit reportbCondition The audit report is improved when it providesevidence of what the auditors found regarding the actual situationReporting the scope or extent of the condition allows the reportuser to gain an accurate perspectivecCause The audit report is improved when it providesconvincing evidence on the factor or factors responsible for thedifference between condition and criteria In reporting the causeauditors may consider whether the evidence provides a reasonableand persuasive argument for why the stated cause is the key factoror factors contributing to the difference as opposed to otherpossible causes such as poorly designed criteria or factorsuncontrollable by program management The auditors also mayconsider whether the identified cause serves as a basis for therecommendationsdEffect The audit report is improved when it provides aclear logical link to establish the impact of the differencebetween what the auditors found condition and what should becriteria Effect is easier to understand when it is statedclearly concisely and in concrete terms The significance of thereported effect can be demonstrated through credibleevidence When auditors conclude based on evidence obtained thatsignificant fraud illegal acts or other noncompliance either hasoccurred or is likely to have occurred they should include intheir audit report the relevant information The termnoncompliance comprises illegal acts violations of laws andregulations and violations of provisions of contracts or grantagreements When auditors conclude significant abuse has or islikely to have occurred they should also includeCommon sources for criteria are laws regulations policyprocedures best or standard practice or assertions The Standardsfor Internal Control in the Federal Government GAOAIMDNovember  and Internal ControlIntegrated Framework publishedby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission COSO Report are two sources of established criteriaauditors can use to support their judgments and conclusions aboutinternal control  GAOG Government Auditing StandardsExposure Draftrelevant information in the report Abuse occurs when theconduct of a government organization program activity orfunction falls short of societal expectations for prudentbehaviorIn reporting significant instances of noncomplianceauditors should place their findings in perspective To give thereport user a basis for judging the prevalence and consequences ofnoncompliance the instances of noncompliance should be related tothe population or the number of cases examined and quantified interms of dollar value if appropriate If the results cannot beprojected the conclusion should be limited to the itemstestedIn reporting on internal control auditors shoulddescribe the scope of internal control testing and in presentingthe results of those tests report the significant weaknessesAuditors may identify significant weaknesses in internal control asthe cause of deficient performance In reporting this type offinding the control weakness would be described as thecauseWhen auditors detect nonsignificant instances of fraudillegal acts or other noncompliance or nonsignificant instances ofabuse or weaknesses in internal control they should communicatethem to the officials of the audited program preferably inwriting Auditors should include in their audit documentation allcommunications to officials of the audited program about fraudillegal acts or other noncompliance and instances of abuse orinternal control weaknesses If the auditors have communicated suchinstances of fraud illegal acts or other noncompliance abuseand internal control weaknesses in a management letter to topmanagement auditors should refer to that management letter in theaudit reportSignificant weaknesses are matters coming to the auditorsattention that they believe should be reported to officials of theaudited program because they could adversely affect the programunder audit  GAOG Government Auditing Standards ExposureDraftDirect Reporting of Fraud and Illegal ActsAuditors are responsible for reporting certain fraud andillegal acts directly to parties outside the audited entity incertain circumstances as discussed in the following paragraphsAuditors should fulfill these responsibilities even if they haveresigned or been dismissed from the auditOfficials of the audited entity may be required by law orregulation to report certain fraud and illegal acts to specifiedexternal parties such as a federal inspector general or a stateattorney general If auditors have communicated such fraud andillegal acts to officials of the audited entity and the latterfail to report them then the auditors should communicate theirawareness of that failure to the audited entitys governing bodyIf officials of the audited entity do not make the required reportas soon as practical after the auditors communication with itsgoverning body then the auditors should report the fraud andillegal acts directly to the external party specified in the law orregulationAuditors should obtain sufficient competent andrelevant evidence such as confirmation with outside parties tocorroborate assertions by management that it has reported fraud orillegal acts If they are unable to do so then the auditors shouldreport the fraud or illegal acts directly as discussedaboveLaws regulations or other authority may requireauditors to report promptly indications of fraud or other illegalacts to law enforcement or investigatory authorities In suchcircumstances when auditors conclude that fraud or another illegalact either has or is likely to have occurred they should refer itto law enforcement or investigatory authorities and ask thoseauthorities or legal counsel if reporting certain information aboutthe potential fraud or illegal act would compromise investigativeor legal proceedings Auditors should limit the extent of theirreporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedingssuch as information that is already a part of the publicrecordInternal audit organizations do not have a duty to reportoutside that entity unless required by law rule regulation orpolicyConclusions Auditors should report conclusions when called for by theaudit objectives Conclusions are logical inferences about theprogram based on the auditors findings and should flow from thefindings instead of representing a summary of them Conclusionsshould be clearly stated not implied The strength of theauditors conclusions depends on the persuasiveness of the evidencesupporting the findings and the soundness of the logic used toformulate the conclusions Conclusions are stronger if they set upthe reports recommendations and convince the knowledgeable user ofthe report that action is necessaryRecommendationsIf warranted auditors should make recommendations foractions to improve programs and operations and to correct problemareas identified during the audit Auditors should makerecommendations when the potential for improvement in programsoperations and performance is substantiated by the reportedfindings and conclusions Recommendations should logically flowfrom the evidence and need to state clearly the actions to betaken Recommendations to effect compliance with laws andregulations and improve internal control also should be made whensignificant instances of fraud illegal acts or othernoncompliance are noted or significant abuse or weaknesses incontrols are foundConstructive recommendations can encourage improvementsin the conduct of government programs and operations Forrecommendations to be most constructive they should be directed atresolving the cause of identified problems action oriented andspecific addressed to parties that have the authority to actpractical and to the extent feasible cost effective andmeasurableStatement on Compliance With GenerallyAccepted Government Auditing Standards Auditors should report that the audit was made inaccordance with generally accepted government auditing standardsThe statement of compliance with GAGAS refers to all the applicablestandards that the auditors should have followed during the auditThe statement should be qualified in situations in which theauditors did not follow an applicable standard In thesesituations auditors should report in the scope section theapplicable standard that was not followed the reasons thereforeand how not following the standard affected the results of theauditViews of Responsible OfficialsAuditors should report the views of responsible officialsof the audited program concerning auditors findings conclusionsand recommendations One of the most effective ways to ensure thata report is fair complete and objective is to obtain advancereview and comments by responsible officials of the audited entityand others as may be appropriate Including the views ofresponsible officials produces a report that shows not only whatwas found and what the auditors think about it but also what theofficials in the audited entity think about the report and whatthey plan to do about itAuditors should normally request that the responsibleofficials views on significant findings conclusions andrecommendations be submitted in writing Oral comments areacceptable as well and in some cases may be the only or mostexpeditious way to obtain comments Cases in which obtaining oralcomments can be effective include when there is a timecriticalneed to meet a users needs the auditor has worked closely withthe responsible officials throughout the conduct of the work andthe parties are very familiar with the findings and issuesaddressed in the draft product or the auditor does not expectmajor disagreements with the draft reports findings conclusionsand recommendations or perceive any major controversies withregard to the issues discussed in the draft report Auditors shouldprepare a summary of the officials oral comments and provide acopyGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftof the summary to management of theaudited entity to verify that the comments are accuratelystatedComments should be fairly and objectively evaluated andrecognized as appropriate in the final report Comments such asa promise or plan for corrective action should be noted but shouldnot be accepted as justification for dropping a significant findingor a related recommendationWhen the audited entitys comments state that thereports findings conclusions or recommendations are inaccurateor misleading and those comments are not in the auditors opinionvalid the auditors should state their reasons for disagreeing withthe comments The auditors disagreement should be stated in a fairand objective manner Conversely the auditors should modify theirreport as necessary if they find the comments valid Auditors maywish to attach the comment letter to the audit report to providethe reader with both points of viewPrivileged and Confidential InformationIf certain information is prohibited from generaldisclosure auditors should report the nature of the informationomitted and the requirement that makes the omission necessaryCertain information may be prohibited from general disclosure byfederal state or local laws or regulations In suchcircumstances auditors may issue a separate limited official usereport containing such information and distribute the report onlyto persons authorized by law or regulation to receive it Auditorsshould when appropriate consult with legal counsel regarding anyrequirements or other circumstances that may necessitate theomission of certain information If auditors make the judgment thatcertain pertinent information should be excluded from a publiclyavailable report they should state the nature of the informationomitted and the reasons that make the omissionnecessaryAdditional circumstances associated with public safetyand security concerns could also justify the exclusion of certaininformation in the report For example detailed informationrelated to computer security for a particular program may beexcluded from publicly available reports becauseGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftof the potential damage that could be caused by the misuse ofthis information In such circumstances auditors may issue alimited official use report containing such information anddistribute the report only to those parties responsible for actingon the auditors recommendations If auditors make the judgmentthat certain additional information should be excluded from apublicly available report they should state the nature of theinformation omitted and the reasons that makes the omissionnecessary Auditors are expected to act with integrity in judgingwhether any information should be excluded from publicly availablereports These judgments need to be made in a consistent mannerwith consideration of the broader public interest in the program oractivity under review Auditors need to weigh the need to revealall significant facts known to them which if not revealed couldeither distort the results or conceal improper or unlawful practiceagainst any requirements or other circumstances that maynecessitate the omission of certain informationREPORT QUALITY The third reporting standard for performance audits isThe reports should be timely factbased accurate objectiveconvincing clear and as concise as the subject permitsTimelyTo be of maximum use the audit report needs to providerelevant information in time to respond to management legislativeofficials and other users legitimate needs Likewise theinformation provided in the report needs to be current Thereforeauditors should plan for the appropriate issuance of the report andconduct the audit with these goals in mindDuring the audit the auditors should consider interimreporting of significant matters to appropriate entity officialsSuch communication which may be oral or written is not asubstitute for a final report but it does alert officials tomatters needing immediate attention and permits them to correctthem before the final report is completedFactBasedBeing factbased requires that the report contains allevidence needed to satisfy the audit objectives and promotes anadequate and correct understanding of the matters reported It alsomeans the report states information and findings completelyincluding all necessary facts and explanations Giving report usersan adequate and correct understanding means providing perspectiveon the extent and significance of reported findings such as thefrequency of occurrence relative to the number of cases ortransactions tested and the relationship of the findings to theentitys operationsIn most cases a single example of a deficiency is notsufficient to support a broad conclusion or a relatedrecommendation All that it supports is that a deviation an erroror a weakness existed Sufficient detailed supporting data shouldbe included to make convincing presentationsAccurateAccuracy requires that the evidence presented be true andthat findings be correctly portrayed The need for accuracy isbased on the need to assure report users that what is reported iscredible and reliable One inaccuracy in a report can cast doubt onthe validity of an entire report and can divert attention from thesubstance of the report Also use of inaccurate evidence candamage the credibility of the issuing audit organization and reducethe effectiveness of its reportsThe report should include only information findings andconclusions that are supported by competent and relevant evidencein the audit documentation If data are significant to theauditGAOG Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draftfindings and conclusions but are notaudited the auditors should clearly indicate in their report thedatas limitations and not make unwarranted conclusions orrecommendations based on those data Reported evidence should demonstrate the correctness andreasonableness of the matters reported Correct portrayal meansdescribing accurately the audit scope and methodology andpresenting findings and conclusions in a manner consistent with thescope of audit work The report should not have errors in logic andreasoning One way to help ensure accuracy in the report is to usea quality control process such as referencing Referencing is aprocess in which statements of facts figures and dates are tracedback to the supporting working papers by an experienced auditor whois independent of the audit This process is designed to ensurethat sufficient credible evidence is present to support thereports conclusions and recommendationsObjectiveObjectivity requires that the presentation of the entirereport be balanced in content and tone A reports credibility issignificantly enhanced when it presents evidence in an unbiasedmanner so that report users can be persuaded by the facts Thereport should be fair and not misleading and should place theaudit results in perspective This means presenting the auditresults impartially and fairly In describing shortcomings inperformance auditors should put findings in context For examplethe audited entity may have faced unusual difficulties orcircumstancesThe tone of reports should encourage decision makers toact on the auditors findings and recommendations This tone shouldbe balanced by requiring reports to present sound and logicalevidence to support conclusions while refraining from usingadjectives or adverbs that characterize evidence in a way thatimplies criticism or conclusion by innuendoThe report should also recognize the positive aspects ofthe program reviewed if applicable to the audit objectivesInclusion of positive program aspects may lead to improvedperformance by other government organizations that read thereportConvincing Being convincing requires that the audit results beresponsive to the audit objectives the findings be presentedpersuasively and the conclusions and recommendations followlogically from the facts presented The information presentedshould be sufficient to convince the report users to recognize thevalidity of the findings the reasonableness of the conclusionsand the benefit of implementing the recommendations Reportsdesigned in this way can help focus the attention of responsibleofficials on the matters that warrant attention and can helpstimulate correctionClearClarity requires that the report be easy to read andunderstand Reports should be prepared in language as clear andsimple as the subject permits Use of straightforward nontechnicallanguage is essential to simplicity of presentation Whenevertechnical terms abbreviations and acronyms are used they shouldbe clearly definedAuditors may consider using a summary within the reportto capture the report users attention and highlight the overallmessage If a summary is used it generally should focus on thespecific answers to the questions in the audit objectivessummarize the audits most significant findings and the reportsprincipal conclusions and prepare users to anticipate the majorrecommendationsLogical organization of material and accuracy andprecision in stating facts and in drawing conclusions areessential to clarity and understanding Effective use of titles andcaptions and topic sentences makes the report easier to read andunderstand Visual aids such as pictures charts graphs andmaps should be used when appropriate to clarify and summarizecomplex materialConcise Being concise requires that the report be no longer thannecessary to convey and support the message Extraneous detaildetracts from a report may even conceal the real message and mayconfuse or distract the users Also needless repetition should beavoided Although room exists for considerable judgment indetermining the content of reports those that are factbased butstill concise are likely to achieve greater resultsREPORT ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION The fourth reporting standard for performance auditsisAudit organizations should submit audit reports to theappropriate officials of the audited program and to the appropriateofficials of the organizations requiring or arranging for theaudits including external funding organizations unless legalrestrictions prevent it Copies of the reports should also be sentto other officials who have legal oversight authority or who may beresponsible for acting on audit findings and recommendations and toothers authorized to receive such reports Unless the report isrestricted by law or regulation copies should be made availablefor public inspectionAudit reports should be distributed in a timely manner toofficials interested in the results Such officials include thosedesignated by law or regulation to receive such reports thoseresponsible for acting on the findings and recommendations thoseof other levels of government who have provided assistance to theaudited entity and legislators However if the subject of theaudit involves material that is classified for security purposes oris not releasable to particular parties or the public for othervalid reasons auditors should limit the reportdistributionWhen nongovernment audit organizations are engaged theengaging government organization should ensure that the report isdistributed appropriately If the nongovernment audit organizationis to make the distribution the engagement agreement shouldindicate which officials or organizations should receive thereportInternal auditors should follow their entitys ownarrangements and statutory requirements for distribution Usuallythey report to their entitys top managers who are responsible fordistribution of the report Further distribution of reports outsidethe organization should be made in accordance with applicable lawrule regulation or policy
