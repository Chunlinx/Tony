                     This is a conversation between Denise Slavich and her mother Fran Worthington on February  year          And Mom what what would you like to talk about today                     Oh when I was a little girl         And well begin at the beginning         I was born on May rd  which was shortly after the end of the Depression         My mother your grandmother was  years old and your grandfather my father was          And I was an only child the reason being that I know now she was probably an RH Negative person because she had had one child stillborn three years before I was born and miscarried in her seventh or eighth month when I was uh six years before I was born         So the doctors told her she should never ever try to have another child         And her comment was Watch me                                                               So she kept trying and got pregnant with me and carried me to full term and so since she was and my dad were both much older I was a terribly spoiled brat                                                               Because I was their only child and they knew I was going to be their only child and within reason I got just about anything I wanted that they could afford I got                     Oh wow                     But um being an only child was sort of a lonely life but it was interesting because I spent a lot of time with grownups         And my mother was never ever knew her father         He died about three months before she was born         He was a railroad engineer and he was working on the down on the Pee Dee River in SC and got malaria and died                     I never knew that                     Yeah         So my grandmother whose name was Frances raised her children all by herself         My mother whose name was Julius she was named for her father since he died         Her name was Julius which in I mean which was not a womans name                     Right                     Her name was Julius Wellington Culbreth                     Thats a very masculine name                     Yeah exactly         And she was the youngest of three girls         And um then my grandmother died when I was three years old so I never really really knew her         But everyone called her Mama Frank                     Huh                     And thats where I got the name Mama Fran for the grandchildren to call me                     Oh         I never knew that                     Yeah         And I didnt think about it until the grandchildren started coming along and we were thinking about what to call people and it suddenly popped in my mind thats what my grandmothers name was Mama Frank         And I was named Frances Jeanette for both of my grandmothers         My fathers mother was Jeanette and she was had died long before I was born         And neither one of my grandfathers were alive         So I never had any grandparents         And I really missed that         And my dad was the the uh next to the youngest of  children         So since he was  when I was born all my first cousins had children older than I was                                                               So I would go out and see my second cousins not my first cousins because they were all old people as far as I was concerned         But when I was I think one of my earliest recollections was when I was three years old Mama and Daddy and I went down to to FL         And I remember going through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those Godawful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking         I could hear my feet in my ears         Going clunk clunk clunk                     Was it one of the swim caps with the flowers                     No it didnt have flowers just the swim caps with the the strap that hooked all the way under         And no matter what you did your hair still got wet                                                               I think you were supposed to be totally vacuumproof and all that stuff         But it still got wet         But thats one of the memories I have of walking across the lobby of the hotel and going clunk clunk clunk as I was walking across and then going swimming         And another memory I have is my mother had a terrible severe sinus condition         So every summer up until I was probably six or seven we spent the entire summer down at at uh Carolina Beach         And I would get so tan         I mean I would just get absolutely totally dark brown         And my mother would say to me Frances Jeanette         If you get any darker theyre going to make you sit in the back of the bus                     Oh my gosh                     Because that was when segregation was still on and at the uh department stores they had separate water fountains and separate bathrooms for colored and white         And when you rode on a bus the colored had to sit in the back and the white people sat in the front                     How did that feel         I mean seeing that happen                     Normal         Because it was the way things were         I mean thats just the way it was                     Wow                     And we had a a uh a colored maid who came gosh about twice a week whose name was Carrie         And she was just like my other mother         She she bathed me and played with me and took care of me         Even then when my mother died she came to the funeral         I mean she was just like a member of the family                     Wow                     But um lets see         When I was four          yeah was when they had Pearl Harbor                     Uhhuh                     And since we lived in Fayetteville they decided to immediately expand Fort Bragg         So um we lived on Fort Bragg Rd which at that point was the only road between Fayetteville and Fort Bragg         And with all the added construction and all that from six in the morning until nine it was bumpertobumper traffic on this little twolane road going to Fort Bragg                     Wow                     From four oclock until seven coming back it was bumpertobumper traffic coming back from Fort Bragg                                                               So you couldnt cross the street you couldnt turn in or turn out or anything it was just really really crazy because they were doing such incredible construction out there         And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half the first the top semicircle was black so that when if you went out at night the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead         Everybody had window shades you didnt have blinds back then but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb us         Not that they ever did or                                                    I dont think  they ever planned on it but everyone was quite sure that that was going to happen                     Looking back it almost seems silly                     Yeah it does but yet yet theres they have found evidence that there were um uh submarines off the coast down in Wilmington                     Right                     But um you know we were all pretty pretty much panicked         And everyone when you got chewing gum you saved the aluminum wrapper         It was waxed paper with aluminum on the outside         You always peeled off the aluminum and made great big balls for that was the earliest recycling                                                               Everyone saved all their tin cans um and crushed them and put took them to be recycled and be reused         There was rationing of gas um sugar flour any of of the real uh staple things that a lot of people would use a lot of if they could         And you had a it looked like a book of SH green stamps         You got a booklet of stamps every month and several pages would be for gas and several pages would be for flour or for butter or for um sugar and you could only use X number of stamps to buy whatever you wanted to buy that that month and then you had to wait until the next month         And since your dad your your grandfather worked for the post office this was a critical job because he had to get the mail in and out and he got an extra ration of gas because he had to drive back and forth to work                     Oh wow                     So that was pretty special                     Yeah         Now did you notice did you have a wanting of things during that time                     No no         We had um we had chickens your dad your grandfather raised chickens and uh wed always get them at Easter well you know dyed pink and blue and green and all that sort of thing         Id get the little biddies and theyd become fullgrown chickens and uh your grandmother would gather the eggs and sold them to a lot of her neighbors         We had uh I mean we didnt I didnt know that I was supposedly being deprived of stuff because there was plenty to have because we had all all of your grandfathers brothers and sisters had farms we were the only ones that lived in the city or the town of Fayetteville it was the big city                                                               But wed go out and get ham and uh beef and you know all that kind of thing from them         Sausage and pork chops and so forth and such and any kind of fresh vegetables so we always had food         And your granddaddy had a huge garden in the back and he grew never could grow carrots they were always awful but he grew potatoes and collards spinach and green beans and those yellow crooknecked squash                     Right                     You remember those                     The squash and potatoes recipe                     Exactly                                                               So he he had a very successful garden and hed go to work at probably six oclock in the morning and hed be home by four in the afternoon         Hed go out and work in the garden until dark         So we really didnt I mean I wasnt aware of of wanting for anything                     Except for the piano lessons                     Oh well yeah because we there was gas rationing         Well to back up when I was just learning to walk your grandmother and grandfather told me that when wed go down to the beach and spend the summer at the beach back then there was no air conditioning whatsoever and so all the the bars and the stores and everything on the boardwalks would have screenedin screened doors on the front         And any place wed go by when I was walking with them Id have my hands up in the air and theyd be holding either hand                                                               and when wed go by any place that had a juke box playing I had to stop and jog up and down in time to the music         When I was little bitty so they knew I loved music         And my mother sang in the choir and uh in fact thats where she met Leola         She and Leola best friends first and second altos and all that but she knew Id probably love music and when I first learned to walk she said Id walk over to the piano and reach way up and start playing the keys         And I never would bang Id play one key at a time with one finger                                                               And shed put me up on the piano bench and would know for at least  or  minutes exactly where I was because I was sitting there playing the piano         So when I was four all my little friends were going take ballet and tap dance lessons and I wanted to but they encouraged me to play         take piano lessons because the piano teacher lived right around the corner and the dance teacher was all the way on the other side of town where her dance studio was         So for fifty cents and hour I took piano lessons         And I went around once a week because I could walk         She Mother would cross the street with me and then I could walk to the piano teacher whose name was oh gosh what was her name         Dorothy Russell         And she taught for years and years         I took from her until I was                      Wow                     And I think she taught just about everybody in town who wanted to learn to play the piano because she had she had this         I never will forget she had this great big Chow dog the one the kind with the black tongue and I was petrified of that dog                                                               She always kept him in the backyard so I never went in the backyard         Id always go in the front door there instead of going around to the back         I hadnt thought about that until just now for a long time         But it was it was fun playing the piano and I and then when I was six no when I was five         the next year I was actually in the recital         And I couldnt play any pieces that where the notes spanned an octave because my fingers werent long enough until I was about nine                                                               But I was in the recital and every time every year it seemed like before right before recital time Id be out playing with somebody and fall down and skin my knees         And mother would make this great big fancy dress with a real full fluffy skirt and shed make a bow to match to wear on my hair and Id have Mercurochrome scabs on both knees                                                               So she always would get real upset with me with that but thats life         Because since I didnt have any brothers or sisters to play with we lived right next door to Westlawn Elementary School and when I started school the bell would start ringing and I could leave the house and run across the playground and get there before it stopped         So I was never late         But Id come home from school every afternoon and sit down and had to practice the piano for an hour and then people would knock on the door and theyd say Mrs Williams can Frances come out to play         And shed say No there shes practicing her piano         Wait for another hour and then she can         But I played out on the on the playground because we had swings and we had tennis courts and up until I was about  I played tackle football         And we had basketball goals and I played basketball with the guys which was detrimental because at that point when you girls basketball rules were different from boys         Instead of five players we had six         And there were three guards and three forwards         The guards could not cross the centerline and the forwards could not come back across the centerline either                     Hmm                     So youd get the if you were a guard youd get the ball and dribble         You had to stop at the centerline and pass it over to a forward which was very unwieldy         Now they I mean I forget when they changed the rules but finally they started playing by boys  rules                     So when you played with the boys that would mess you up for playing with the girls                     Yeah         Well I much preferred playing with the boys because I liked to dribble all the way around and go up for a layup or something                     Right                     And I was since I was tall they always liked for to have me on their team         But uh that that was fun and lets see                     What did you guys in in in your family with a with Grandma and Granddaddy I mean what kind of trips did you take when you were little                     Oh lets see one time we went up to oh to the Skyline Dr We went up I re something when I was about four I think         We went up your dad your grandfather was trying desperately to get back in the army         He wanted to serve and do his duty         He had been in WWI but he wanted to get back into the army         And he was  at this point in time or          And we went down to Atlanta for him to talk to people down there and they told him that they couldnt do anything so if he really wanted to be in the army he needed to come back and go up to the Pentagon         So we drove up to Washington and he went to the Pentagon and tried really hard for them to take him back and they said that what he was doing with the post office was in the best interest of the government and the country and he could serve much better by getting the mail to the soldiers         So they told him No but while we were up there it was Easter weekend and I rolled Easter eggs on the White House lawn                     Wow                     And that was that was when uh Roosevelt was president and he and Mrs Roosevelt came out and shook hands with all of us         All the children         It was really it was an interesting experience                     Oh I bet                     And then coming back we came back through Roanoke VA and then were on the Skyline Drive and Daddy said Were going to go to Roanoke and theres Roanoke Mountain there         Or Roan Mountain anyway theres supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke         So I was thinking having looked at all my books school books that it was going to be like the Rockies                                                               with snow and you know crags a and rocks and all that sort of thing         And I was so disappointed when we got there because we drove up and up and I said Well wheres the mountain Daddy         And he said Were on it and it was of course covered with trees and there were no rocks and there was no snow                                                               and I was so disappointed         It just really burst my bubble                     RECORDING PAUSED THEN CONTINUED                     Well since we were interrupted by the phone now were continuing                     Yes                     Um         lets see where were we                     We were driving up Roan Mountain                     Yeah but then we after we left Roanoke we did get on the Skyline Drive and it was absolutely a beautiful view but there just werent any mountains with rocks on them         So that was one of the trips we took         A lot of times         most I guess most of the traveling we did was from Fayetteville down to the beach                     Right to Carolina Beach                     To Carolina Beach         Every summer         And that was fun         And uh oh         Ive got to tell you                  Remember the the birthmark I have on my leg         Looks for birthmark Its that little brown spot                  Well where is it                                                               Anyway I have a birthmark on my leg                     I think I remember                     Yeah its just a little brown         right there         Points to birthmark                     Yeah yeah                     My mother told me that it was a CocaCola mark                      A CocaCola mark                               Because  when she was pregnant with me she and Daddy would go down to the beach because again for her sinus condition the salt air was really good for her and she said that Daddy would not stop because she wanted to stop and get a CocaCola and he wouldnt stop                  And she held her hands right behind her knees I dont know why but just in anxiety or something so he would stop and get her a Coke         So she swears that little mark is a CocaCola mark         And that may be why I like CocaCola so well                     You inherited the addiction                     Yeah yeah I guess I did         But um growing up in Fayetteville was fun         It was a small town thats grown a lot since then but we had a lot of fun with all my friends riding bicycles and just hanging out together         Theyd come over and wed just hang out in the driveway and roller skate or play with their dogs or whatever         I had a little dog a toy terrier named Fifi                     I never knew of Fifi                     Yeah I got Fifi when I was gosh four or five and that poor dog was one         I put her through so much         Id dress her up in doll clothes                                                               and make her ride in in the doll carriage and Id pick her up with her front paws and make her dance with me and wed walk all over the place         I mean she just she was my companion because I didnt have brothers or sisters         And but the only time I was really really um lonely was the year that we had the polio epidemic         And that started I think that was in gosh  or  and uh everybody was quarantined         You couldnt go children could not go downtown and and this was long before Salk ever did the vaccine and with the polio epidemic when people got Polio they had to be put in iron lungs that would breathe for them                     Oh wow                     You may have seen pictures of them                     Ive heard of it                     They were they were great big uh metal tubes that opened uh and the only thing you could see was uh your head and your feet                     Oh wow                     And it was pressurized so it would make you breathe in and out because they really were paralyzed         They called it Infantile Paralysis or polio         But anyway everybody was quarantined we could children had could not go out of their own yard they         we couldnt go to church couldnt go to movies we couldnt go anywhere         We could ride in the car         I could ride in the car with with Mother and Daddy wed go for a Sunday afternoon drive or something but I had nobody to play with         But fortunately there was a another only child girl who lived right across the street from us         So her name was Joy Teeter and she would come out on the sidewalk with her dolls and Id come out on the sidewalk with my dolls and wed play dolls together across the street from each other                              Across the street                     Yeah                     Oh thats so sweet                     Yeah         And wed also wed draw hopscotch things on the the sidewalk and play hopscotch together and you know just any kind of little games we could devise         And we did wed do that for a couple hours a day                     Wow                     And that was our only contact with any other child                     How long were you quarantined                              I think it started right after school was out in May and until school started the following September                     Was it scary any time you would get the sniffles or                     No I was always healthy so nothing happened but several people in in town did get polio and and had to spend time in the Iron Lung as they called it                     Did they recover or was it fatal                     I think they all recovered but a couple of them had a a recur recurring touch of paralysis         Um you know one boy in particular I remember had a always had a limp after that                     Wow                     So it was it was scary         And of course I think the pa the parents panicked more than the children did                  We were just pissed off         because we couldnt go play with anybody else or see anybody or anything         That thats the only time I really really regretted being an only child                     What did your parents do during that time I mean to make it more fun for you or                     Oh bought me lots of coloring books and uh Mother made clothes for my baby dolls and uh wed like I said wed go for rides it was a long way out from Fayetteville to Fort Bragg at the point in time and now theres you know they theyre have the same uh boundary but wed ride out and listen to on every Sunday afternoon the army band had a band concert                     Like at South Park                     Yeah like at South Park         And wed ride out and Id have to stay in the car but wed ride out and Daddy would park and wed roll down the windows so I could hear the band         And obviously we didnt nobody had TV it wasnt         nobody had it at that point in time so I listened to the radio a lot         There were uh The Lone Ranger and all those serial programs         The The Green Hornet and The Phantom and Big John and Sparky and Amos and and Andy and uh Fibber McGee and Molly and                  There were a lot of radio shows um uh oh shoot whats his name the guy that just died not recently not too long ago the uh the comic the one who did Oh God                     Oh um                     Long pause George Burns                     George Burns                     George Burns and Gracie Allen         They had a show         So there were a lot of radio shows and I I read a lot                     What yeah what what would you read                     Oh all the Nancy Drew books and all the um I read a lot of sports books about football and baseball and Mother would go to the library and just bring home a whole stack of them         So I did a lot of reading and uh playing out in the yard Id help when Daddy would come home Id help him out in the garden         So I I really didnt lack for things to do but they just were sort of lonely things                     Right         How did your mom feel about you being a tomboy                     She          well she said I was her little girl and I was I was Daddys little boy                                                               or little tomboy because he taught me how to he was he was sort of a jackofalltrades so he did a lot of he built when we had the chickens he built the chicken houses         Hed bring home all the twobyfours and the siding and the shingles and stuff and hed build them all himself         And Id help him         Id hold the ladder or whatever         And then I graduated to nailing this and that and sawing this and that and so forth         And one time he was building a a chicken house and I said Daddy that would make a great playhouse for me                                                               And so instead of putting it up on stilts like he did the chicken houses he made it into a little playhouse                     Ooh                     It had a door that opened and shut and locked         It had uh a window in the front had a front porch had a window that went up and down in the front and a window that went up and down in the back         And had shelves and it was a pretty interesting little playhouse and Id go I kept all my dolls and stuff out there and Id go out there and play for hours and all my friends would come over and wed have such fun and wed had a couple of little rocking chairs and we sat out on the front porch                     Oh thats sweet                     It was it was a neat little playhouse         When we sold the house the people that bought it had children and they were just delighted because they had somewhere for their kids to play         And something else you probably dont know                  The house that we lived in on Fort Bragg Road was um very modern for its time and had two bathrooms                     Wow                     And not too many houses built back then had two         But it was a twostory house and on the front on the first level youd come in the front door         On the left was a living room with a fireplace         On the right was a dining room and there were stairs going upstairs between that         And behind the dining room was a little small room that they called a breakfast room which was just because they had a wall between that and the kitchen         And there was a kitchen         Behind the living room was another room that we could today we call them dens but back then they called them sitting rooms          Then it had a wraparound um screenedin porch                     Uhhuh                     and a bathroom between the sitting room and the kitchen was a bathroom and also the door to the stairs to go down to the basement because we had a coalfired furnace         And then upstairs there were two huge rooms one on either side of the house and a bath at the top of the stairs         So when they completed all the um building out at Fort Bragg and brought in so many troops every Sunday when we went to church Mother and Daddy would bring home at least one and usually two GIs who were there in their uniforms and looked very forlorned they would bring them home for Sunday dinner                     Oh thats nice                     And finally um Daddy converted the whole upstairs into two efficiency apartments         So one bedroom had a stove and a refrigerator and they had to share the bath         And well each each of the bedrooms had the separate stove and refrigerator and they shared a bath         And we would rent them to couples who were just going to be there while their husbands were going through training         And that was interesting         So         they turned the the dining room into Mama and Daddys bedroom and the breakfast room was my bedroom                     Wow                     which was just about big enough for a bed and that was about it         But that was fun for me because I had somebody else to talk to                     Uhhuh                     And a couple of of the families that lived there had a couple of children if you could imagine four people sleeping sleeping in one room                     That would be tight                     It was         It was necessary because the guys were going off to war and the their wives didnt know when or if they would ever see them again                     Uhhuh                     So they absolutely thought that every minute was precious         And for years and years afterwards we heard from these people         The sent Christmas cards and would write                     Oh                     It was just really nifty         And um something else I remember was and youve probably seen this in the movies         Everybod y who had someone in the service had a star in their window so youd always know         And then if I think there were with a cer a certain color maybe a red background and if if the the military member was liked it became a white background         Something like that I cant remember which colors there were but there was a distinction                     Yeah         Ive heard of yellow ribbons                     No         That was way longer          that was Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the                                 Right                     That was a long time after that         But everybody had          they called them Victory Stars or Service Stars          And if you see any movies that were well in Saving Private Ryan and when they were showing houses uh people back in the States they had the stars         You probably didnt recognize or even know what it meant                     Oh         I havent seen it yet                     Oh         OK                                                               Well when you see it when they show the stateside houses youll see the stars in the windows and that means that they have how how many people they have in the service                     Ooh                     But um lets see         What else do you want to know                     Hmm                                       Did you know about me winning the piano competition                     No                     When I was we sold the house uh on Fort Bragg Road and moved over to Circle Dr And your grandmother was she had a had a heart condition         Im sure it was a congenital something or other because she always had to to rest in the afternoon         She was never very very healthy                     I knew she died when you were young                     Yeah And um when I was  in October when I was  she had a stroke or actually a blood clot and it went to her brain         It partially paralyzed her right side         And I was practicing the piano doing all that sort of thing and my teacher entered me into the competition for Classical Music for  and under                     Wow                     For the whole for the state of NC                     What an honor                     And the competition was down in Wilmington and it was on the th of March The Ides of March and so uh she drove me down there and at that point Mother had had a stroke and was back in the hospital         So I went down and I played         And I won                     Wow                     I was  years old and I won  and under for the whole state of NC Classical Competition                     Whatd you play                     Ooh         I cant even remember         Ive got in this vault something or other         I can still play it         But it was fairly complicated         And I was nervous and all that sort of thing but anyway I won         And we got back to Fayetteville and I went the the teacher took me to the hospital and I went up to see and Daddy was there hed gotten off work and was there and mother had slipped she was sort of in and out of a coma and I told him I had won         And he went in and told her and she regained consciousness enough to say I am so proud                     Oh my God                     And she died two days later                     What a great thing that you know she came back long enough to                     Yeah exactly                     to know that                     Exactly                     Wow         Thats powerful                     And I was I was really proud of that         I still have the little cup         I think on of the handles is broken off of it         But I still have it                                                               But I was pretty proud of that         And then         I discovered boys and I didnt want to play the piano as much any more                              Because Daddy had delusions that I would even go to Juilliard or Eastman School of Music                     But hormones just kind of                     Hormones kind of interfered yeah         I wasnt dedicated enough to practice four five or six hours every night                     Right                     But I had a good time with my piano         I played for all of the the groups in the Glee Club and the Choral Group in all the little ensembles on school                     Yeah                  What kind of clubs were you in                     Um lets see                  I was in the TriHigh Y which is I have no idea they probably dont even exist anymore the High Y was for boys and the TriHigh Y was for girls         And I was in the National Honor Society and I was in the Glee Club and everything that went along with that         Um when I took Spanish I was in the Spanish Club         I was on the um the staff of the school newspaper wrote a column for them         And lets see what else was I         oh I was in the Methodist Youth Fellowship in church the MYF         And thats about it                     So you were pretty busy                     Yeah I was         And I was when I graduated from high school I was Valedictorian and I also won the um what the heck did they call it         The business I think it was a business award no commercial award for being number one in the shorthand and typing classes         And I got that gold bracelet that I have I was awarded for that         But back to back to my birth mother Julius everybody called her Judy except for Daddy he called her Julius                                                               But she died in in gosh          Yeah I was  years old and she died then I was  May after she died         And that summer her best friend was Leola Harvey                     Uhhuh                     And so that summer Leolas sister Lucille whose husband had died three years before came down from Richmond to visit for her annual summer visit         She came down and stayed usually a couple of months all summer         And she and Leola Leola brought her over to see Daddy for a condolence call and sparks flew and they started going out and thats when they decided to get married and she became my stepmom                     Wow                     And they got married in October after my mother died in March         Which at that point was highly highly incensing                     Right                     I mean you just you had to mourn for a year         And I mean it was scandalous         So she had a lot of talk going on about her when she married Daddy and came down to Fayetteville         And um cried a lot about it because some people were very spiteful to her                     Its hard to imagine grandmother being seen as a tart                     Yea yeah                                                               But I mean and you know she had the best intentions and I really needed a mother         I was   years old and I needed a woman and there was even talk of putting me in a foster home or in an orphanage because it was scandalous that I was a young girl living alone with my father                     Uhhuh                     Which I mean in  yeah         But today theres nothing wrong with it         So Daddy was I think he loved her a lot but she also answered a lot of his prayers for how to take care of me and deal with me         Because I had just started my period and I was you know having acne and he didnt know how to deal with all that stuff                                                               So he needed a woman to take care of me         And she was very glamorous and wore gorgeous clothes and dressed beautifully         And she taught me a lot and did a lot for me                     Wow                     And because my birth mother Judy was  and weighed about          So she was short and chubby         Sweetheart         A wonderful woman but it had she and Leola had a lot of fun together and but she was not classy                     Right                     She was a little country girl         Born and raised down in Cumberland County         Never lived anywhere else         And here was Lucille from the big city of Richmond         Who wore high heels and stocking with the black seams up the back and hats and had jewelry to go with every outfit and all that sort of thing         So I mean she just really swept daddy off his feet         And he was just absolutely astounded by her because she was so incredible         And she entertained for him and taught me a lot         She was just a great great lady         And had always wanted a daughter so there I was         And when they got married I was her only attendant and her son Alvin was daddys best man                     Thats sweet                     Yeah         And Uncle Harmon gave her away                     Hmm         I didnt know that                     Yeah         So what else                     I think thats all                     OK         Then turn off the tape                     OK         Thanks for talking with me                     Youre welcome         My pleasure
