                well i dont know how you feel about drug testing but im dead set against it   well so we can have a conversation on on agreeing with one another today right because we keep working to see if we can find any candidates who will help us       change the the trend that we have seem to have of interfering with peoples personal life     yeah um i think about the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or VIV war on rights is uh pretty much your Libertarian candidates which um i personally have some doubts as to whether any of them can get elected elected   well thats always a problem i have to admit that that back when uh the Texas governorship   umhum   race was going on that was the one thing that made me really pleased with Ann Richards is that she refused to get involved in discussing that whole issue   umhum uhhuh well it just i mean really seems the ridiculous because um the um U S Department of Labor whatever im not sure might be a different agency requires um businesses to post this poster that has like minimum wage laws and a bunch of other laws and one of things it posts is um on the illegality illegality of um lie detector tests and um you know i feel that lie detector tests are   for self decrimi self incrimination kind of thing yeah   well it means that that that there are limits there are there are definite government limits to you know how an employer can use lie detectors on its employees and i think that oh i mean i dont i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that its hard to justify being i dont understand how our government can can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like theyre testing the same sort of nebulous   yeah yeah because the the tests are equally unreliable and   character umhum   personally i dont even think its a question of whether theyre reliable or not i mean it doesnt matter how reliable they are then i think that its inappropriate you know actually i can almost understand it more for somebody whos getting ready to hire someone than i can allowing them to spot test or random test people who are   umhum oh yeah   currently employed because i think that current employment you know continuation of employment should be based on performance   yeah yeah and and you know i i agree with with a lot of people that you know claim instead of having random drug tests for continuing employment have um motor impairment tests um because you know the they they would not be any more priced they would they would   okay   be similarly priced um and you know if some if some guy goes to work and he had a had a fight with his wife the night before and you know he has that on his mind and isnt gonna be able to function properly you know i i just as you know id id almost as much you know have as much uh fear of him driving the bus im riding than   or maybe more well you know if you stop and think about it   yeah yeah or maybe more yeah  ill show her   stop and think about it you can get awfully hostile and decide to to take care of the whole world one day or something yeah well youre absolutely right   umhum umhum umhum umhum and also and also on the question of you know just getting employment im you know im im a senior in college and im applying for jobs and i know i know a lot of people that are doing it also and i know some of some of which that do indulge in certain um   youre absolutely right uh   non uh sanctioned um hobbies and their basic attitude toward drug testing is is just um moving away moving away from you know the relatively harmless drugs like marijuana which uh you know lingers for about thirty five days to things like cocaine and LSD which you know one they dont test for well LSD they dont test for and cocaine which only stays in your system for about a week and i used to snort i just you know wonder what effect this is having you know   uh it certainly sounds that if if thats what college students are doing that thats anti productive   um and i and i mean thats you know thats entirely anecdotal evidence i know a couple people you know that have moved in the direction but   yeah   i just you know wonder you know overall what the trend is   well that of course theres really theres really no way to know uh its   umhum   i just you know unfortunately ive ive talked with a um some friends of mine who are lawyers recently about that because my husbands in a job situation that um   umhum   makes him   umhum   subject to this sort of thing and it makes him extremely unhappy with his work place   umhum   and uh you know not that he does it not that hes ever done it you know i mean hes hes one of the straightest people i know which is it and it has nothing to do with   umhum umhum   you know with any of the rest of it he doesnt like the feeling of loss of control so he doesnt   yeah and just the feeling that you know you the there theres   so he yeah so he wouldnt do it but on the other hand he also doesnt like the sense of loss of control of his personal life
