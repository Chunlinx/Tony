                                 Suicide Watch            On April  this year AirForce Capt Craig Button suddenly went missing in an A Thunderbolt fighterfinally crashing in Colorado The evidence released by the Air Force this monthindicates suicide Why he did it is baffling however The case violates evenpsychiatrists common notions about why people kill themselves            Buttonflew the third aircraft in a threejet formation that left an Arizona Air Forcebase at  am When the team reached the target bombing range the flightleader ordered pilots to update their computers Button confirmed the order at Moments later when the leader radioed in preparation for the bombingrun Button did not respond The lead plane swung around to catch sight ofButton Despite mile visibility Button was nowhere to be found            Ground radar however picked him up Apparently Buttonturned  degrees off his flight path and flew  miles straight into centralColorado His altitude veered wildly Sometimes he hugged terrain below feet Other times he glided above  feet Near Gold Dust Peak he circledmore than  degrees then careened downward below the reach of ground radarReconstructed AWACs radar data showed Button briefly climbed back up to feet a mile above the highest mountain Minutes later at  pm heslammed into Gold Dust Peak at  feet            Buttondidnt use any of his three radios He didnt eject He didnt attempt to landat any airports he flew over He didnt turn on his FriendorFoeidentification signal to let others track him Yet Buttons difficult maneuversshow that the plane functioned well and that he had full consciousness andcapacity The autopilot would have been incapable of these maneuversEverything indicated that Button deliberately flew into the mountain            What a strange suicide though Button hadhardly any risk factors True he was male women attempt suicide more oftenbut men succeed five times more And he had long tussled with his JehovahsWitness parents over his abandoning the faith organized religion lowerssuicide rates But nothing else fit            Over  percent of suicidevictims have a history of mental illness most often depression or substanceabuse Button had neither On a recent visit to see him his parents thought hewas his energetic driven self Friends said he was enthusiastic about hiscoming assignment to Germany He spoke of buying a motorcycle there and maybefinding a girl to bring home He had had girlfriends before but after threeyears in the desert town of Del Rio Texas he joked to a friend it was slimpickings The night before the crash his roommate said hed ordered a largepizza so hed have leftovers for the next night During the mission briefing onthe fateful day Button was cutting up and making his corny little jokesjust as he usually did            Buttonshowed no signs of substance abuse No alcohol or drugs were found during theautopsy He was in a stressful job but that alone does not increase suicidaltendencies At  Button was young whereas the incidence of suicide increaseswith age and is highest among those over             Harvard psychiatrist Martin Kelly points out however thatin rare cases suicide may not be motivated by emotional pain For someone whodoesnt attach meaning to death yet suicide can be a sudden rash way out oftrouble Button seemed like such a person It wasnt just that he was amotorcycleriding fighter pilot He had a history of foolhardy judgment thatsuggested he didnt fully comprehend deaths finality During survival trainingin  he was reprimanded for venturing recklessly far into unchartedwilderness In  against the rules he buzzed Del Rio below  feetblew a tire attempting a hotshot short landing and left the authorized routeduring a crosscountry training mission Button was impulsive athrillseeker            WhenButton boarded his plane that day Kelly suggests suicide probably wasnt hisplan but his impulsiveness may have steered him into trouble and then intosuicide Its conceivable that he veered off on a whim Perhaps he took a shortjoy ride or prematurely dropped a bomb his four pound bombs are stillmissing Whatever the case with each misstep he dug his hole deeper AsButton flew through Colorado he may have come to see crashing as a viable wayout because death had no meaning for him            As unusual as Buttons case is it shares onecommon characteristic with nearly all the  suicides that occur each yearin the United Statesthe victims are not in a rational state of mind That mayseem an obvious point but it is one that we often ignore when assisted suicideis the topic Like Mark Twain who said that suicide is the only sane thingthe young or old ever do in this life we imagine that the elderly and the illdesire death rationally But our prejudices are showing Suicidal patientswhatever their age or condition almost always suffer from addiction or mentaldisease Even when they do not as with Button they usually are not thinkingrationally            Buttonssuicide also shows how even in peculiar cases the desire to die arises fromones individual history and psychology Yet in public discussion of youthfulsuicide were often unwilling to trace it to such causes and try to placeblame elsewhereon television music movies Earlier this month a Senatesubcommittee considering stricter restrictions on music lyrics heard ananguished father blame his sons suicide on shock rocker Marilyn Mansonsmusic The yearold died with the band playing on his headphones Numerousstudies show that there is no association between music and suicide One foundthat countrymusic lovers had higher suicide rates but subsequent researchdisputes these results            Of course ideas do count We know for example that oneadolescent suicide can trigger others even through media reports leading tosuicide clusters Had later victims not heard about the first suicide theymay not have done it when they did But psychiatrists insist that an ideacannot compel even a child to commit suicide It is only a proximate factor ina vulnerable person with stronger causes at work            Usually the causes are anaddictive or mental disorder Craig Buttons case shows how much more complexthey can be And how bizarre
