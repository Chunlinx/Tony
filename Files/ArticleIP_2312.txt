                                 Obnoxious for Peace            Richard Holbrooke is aperson many people cant stand Though he may be no more ambitious oregotistical than a lot of careerminded Washingtonians he is exceedinglytransparent about it Physically large he can be seen in photographs toweringover his rivalsand sometimes elbowing them out of the picture frame Acourtier worthy of Shakespeare Holbrooke is legendary for his flattery andback stabbing and even for buttering someone up and sticking the knife in atthe same time            Those whotend to roll their eyes at the mention of Holbrookes name will find mucheyerolling material in his book To End a War From Sarajevo to Dayton andBeyond  which is about his role in negotiating a peace settlement inBosnia In places Holbrookes account reads like a selfnominating speech forsecretary of state or the Nobel Peace Prize distinctions for which his stomachaudibly growls Holbrooke seldom declines the chance to fluff up someone whomight be useful to him in the future especially if that someone is ajournalist Roger Cohen of the New York Times is astute StephenEngelberg also of the Times  is impressive William Pfaff of theInternational Herald Tribune is insightful Holbrooke suffers from astrain of narcissism that impels him to quote himself frequently and atlength including from diaries articles TV interviews faxes and privateletters to the president His namedropping is out of control At one point heoffers the odd boast that it was his idea to send Ron Brown on a trade missionto Bosniathe mission that led to the death of the commerce secretary and others            But those who fixate on Holbrookes insufferability do hima serious injustice Holbrooke lacks subtlety modesty and discretion He canbe vain pompous and ridiculous We know this But he also managed to carryoff almost by sheer force of personality an accomplishment that eludedgovernments world leaders and multilateral organizations for four years Heended the war in Bosnia The story he tells is really about performing a kindof jujitsu with his own personality channeling his dubious personalqualitieshis bullying his egomania and his impatient ambitiontoward thenoble and perhaps Nobel end of peace in the Balkans One of the lessons hisbook teaches is that in politics selfinterest isnt the opposite of publicinterest To the contrary ego can be the engine that makes political anddiplomatic accomplishments possible By the end of the book I couldnt helpliking and admiring Holbrookenot despite his evident flaws but in a curiousway because of them            Holbrookes intervention in the Balkans is a rejoinder to the socialhistorians conceit that individual actors dont really matter In the summerof  Holbrooke went to Bosnia as a private citizen with a refugee aidorganization and saw horrors such as Muslims being driven out of the town ofBanja Luka where their families had lived for four centuries He resolved totry to do something about it As part of candidate Clintons foreign policybrain trust Holbrooke prodded him to take an interventionist stand whichClinton did After the election Holbrooke wrote a memo to Warren Christopherand Anthony Lake advocating the strategy known as lift and strikeliftingthe arms embargo that prevented the Muslims from defending themselves andbombing the Bosnian Serbs He also asked for the job of special negotiator onBosnia Holbrookes rival Lake made sure none of this happened The Bosnia jobwent to someone else Holbrooke was kept away from the issue and on theperiphery of foreign policymaking in general Eventually he was namedambassador to Germany Clintons tough talk stopped            But Holbrooke still cherished hopes ofinvolving the United States Offered the post of assistant secretary of statefor European affairs a job he considered beneath his dignity he took it forthe sake of directing American diplomatic efforts in the Balkans As he pushedand prodded wheedled and connived the crusade became more personal Early inhis shuttle diplomacy three colleagues including his top deputy were killedin a gruesome road accident for which the Bosnian Serb warlords were indirectlyto blame This tragedy spurred him in his hazardous ricocheting betweenBelgrade Zagreb and Sarajevo and helped bring about betterlatethanneverNATO airstrikes in  When he was dissatisfied with official policyHolbrooke undermined it For instance he was supposed to take advantage of thebombing to demand a ceasefire by all sides In fact he encouraged theCroatianMuslim Federation to keep fighting since it was making territorialgains that he thought would make a territorial settlement easier            Holbrookedoes not waste a lot of time on the question of whether intervening in Bosniawas in our national interest In answer to former Secretary of State JamesBakers view that we didnt have a dog in that fight he asserts the UnitedStates had a Samaritans obligation to stop ethnic cleansing The Europeanshaving failed we were the only ones who could do anything about it Inside theadministration he fought off objections from the military Spooked by anythingthat smacked of mission creep or nation building the Pentagon resistedsending American troops to Bosnia and has refused to allow them to becomeinvolved with refugees elections or human rights Holbrooke continues toargue for what he calls a maximalist interpretation of our military role Heviews it as a scandal that the Bosnian Serb war criminals Ratko Mladic andRadovan Karadzic have yet to be captured and brought to justice            The narrative climaxes in Dayton Ohio where thecombatants sat around an Air Force base for three weeks and reached a peaceaccord Holbrooke is a proponent of the intuitive improvisational school ofnegotiation He played tennis with Franjo Tudjman drank shots of plum brandywith Slobodan Milosevic before lunch enacted hysterical scenes of feigned andreal anger and essentially sat on the heads of the various participants untilthey cried uncle Here the story becomes especially gripping and takes anunexpected turn It is the president of the Bosnian Muslims Alia Izetbegovicwho turns out to be the biggest obstacle to peace unwilling to make evenmeaningless concessions On the other hand the brutal but undeniably charmingMilosevic the man most responsible for starting the Yugoslav civil war savesthe accord with territorial concessions at the last moment            Surely Holbrooke pursuedpeace in the Balkans in part for the glory involved And as one not afflictedwith false modestyor any other kindhe clearly enjoys his plauditsimmensely But by the end of the book the issue of Holbrookes motivation nolonger looms very large From an early stage he found himself drawn intosomething larger than himself something more compelling than his own careerAs the object elevates him his pettiness melts away
