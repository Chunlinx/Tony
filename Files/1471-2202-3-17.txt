                    Background        ATP functions as a neurotransmitter in the central        nervous system       Synaptically released ATP acts        on a class of ligandgated ion channels called PX               While the dynamics of these channels have been        studied      a common assumption is that the channels        are independent This paper questions that assumption        Patchclamp techniques    made it possible to        observe directly the conformational changes of a single        channel but there are usually multiple channels in a        patch If the channels behave independently and are not too        abundant the mathematics and analysis of the data is        straightforward wwwqubbuffaloedu However the        assumption of independence is rarely tested and may be        wrong Functional interactions between channels have not        been studied intensively but data do exist showing        cooperativity     The presence of cooperativity        changes the significance of expression density        Homomeric channel interactions have appeared as an        excess of multiple openings relative to independent        channel expectations in K channels    and        acetylcholine receptors        Interaction        between heterologous channels has also been demonstrated        between Ca and Ca activated K channels    that        may be explained by intracellular accumulation of Ca near        closely spaced channels Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors        also interact with PX          receptors    via unknown        mechanisms        In our previous papers     we studied the open        channel and gating properties of PX          receptors The data for these kinetic        analyses were obtained from the patches containing a single        channel Here we report discrepancies between single        channel and multiple channel currents Analysis from open        channel lifetimes open channel noise and kinetics indicate        that the receptors are not independent but have positive        cooperativity                    Results                  Records from patches of multiple channels          containing frequent concurrences          Figure Ashows typical multiple channel currents          activated by  M ATP at  mV recorded from an           Xenopus oocyte  M ATP is about          equal to EC            value Since we did not see open          level more than  channels from entirely record we think          the patch contained at least three channels As indicated          by arrows there are many simultaneous closing and open          transitions These concurrences of openings and closings          are highly suggestive of channel interactions since          independent channels would have less clustering              We observed this phenomenon in all seven multiplechannel          patches          We estimated the channel amplitude by fitting          amplitude histograms Figure B with four Gaussians          representing the closed  st  nd and  rdopen level          The mean current of the states was   and  pA          respectively The mean open channel noisechannel was           pA with a  kHz bandwidth estimated from the          standard deviation of the Gaussians a value   of          the mean open channel current amplitude also see Figure          D Since the amplitude and open channel noise of the          different open levels are essentially the same the          conductance properties appear identical          The probability that           k channels are open out of a total          of           N should follow a binomial          distribution if the channels are identical and          independent Eq  A deviation from this distribution          would indicate that at least one of the assumptions is          not true Using           p           o obtained from the single channel          doseresponse curve shown in Fig  we have plotted in          Figure Cthe ratio of the observed open probability at          each level           Pk                       exp             to the predicted distribution obtained from the          binomial distribution           Pk                       binomial             If channel behaviors are the same in patches          containing a single and multiple channels           P            k                        exp                       P            k                        binomial            should be  regardless of k The results show here          that           P            k                        exp                       P            k                        binomial            increases with increasing           k  suggesting a positive deviation          from the binomial distribution However           p                       o              is a more accurate value estimated from the          optimization indicating the increase in open probability          of channel in multiplechannel patches These analysis          strongly suggest that the gating mechanism is different          between single channel and multiple channels          However the binomial test is not a stringent test of          cooperativity especially for relatively small          deviations Binomial tests do not contain any kinetic          information only equilibrium information As Horn             pointed out the binomial distribution is no better a          statistical predictor for the number of active channels          in a patch than is the maximum observed level A better          test of independence is to ask whether events are          correlated in time since that utilizes both amplitude          and duration information That analysis is discussed          later in the paper                          Doseresponse curves of single channel current and          multiple channel current have similar EC values and          Hill coefficients          Figure shows multiple channel currents activated at          different concentrations of ATP A and the peakcurrent          doseresponse curve B Circles In order to compute the          mean response from multiple channel currents the          doseresponse curves were normalized to the current          activated by  M ATP and fit with the           Hill equation This yielded an EC            of    M and a           Hill coefficient of             Figure Balso shows the doseresponse curve of single          channel currents Diamonds fit with a           Hill coefficient EC            and           p                       omax            of       M and  respectively              These parameters depend on the molecular rate          constants in the reaction pathway The similar values of          EC            and           Hill coefficient of multiple          channel currents and single channel currents suggest that          the rate constants along the activation pathway had          changed in a compensatory way However we do not know          the absolute value of           p                       o            in multiple channel currents and had to normalize          the data of a single channel                          Mean open time of a single channel is much shorter          than multiple channels          We might assume that rate constants in the activation          pathway are similar in single channel currents and          multiple channel currents since both have a similar EC            and Hill coefficient Because we          saw clusters of openings we presumed the dominant effect          might be on the closing rates associated with          aggregation Earlier kinetic analyses of single channel          currents suggested that there were at least three binding          sites four closed states in the activation pathway              Although the presence of aggregated closed states          complicates the kinetics of multiplechannel currents          the mean open channel lifetime can be computed without          explicitly considering the four closed states By          comparing the mean open lifetime of single channel          currents and mean open lifetime of each level in multiple          channel currents we can determine whether the mean          closing rate ie the inverse of the mean open time is          affected by channel interactions We obtained the          lifetimes of different current levels from idealization          of the currents using the program SKM          wwwqubbuffaloedu Our previous study demonstrated that          the mean open lifetime was independent of ATP          concentration              Figures Aand Bshow currents from a singlechannel          and a twochannel patch upper panel with the idealized          currents shown above the raw data and their amplitude          histograms below From visual inspection we can see that          the open times of the currents from the twochannel patch          are much longer than those from the single channel patch          We analyzed the mean open times of currents containing          one two or three channels in the patch and these are          plotted in Figure C The mean open time of a single          channel patch is    ms n   while in the          multiple channel patches mean open time of each level is          longer opposite to the behavior expected for independent          channels With independent channels a given state          lifetime should decrease when more channels are available          to change state The increase in mean open lifetime with          channel number in the patches is consistent with our          observation of a trend toward positive deviations from          the binomial distribution Fig C          Consider a simple twostate model                    where C and O represent the closed and open states           and  are opening and closing rate constants that give          the mean open and closed times of            o   and            c   If there are two independent          channels in the patch the model could be formulated as          follows                        C represents both channels closed O            one channel open and O            both channels open Then the          lifetimes of C O            and O            designated as            c             o and            o  are             respectively This indicates that the lifetimes of O            and O            for two independent channels should          be smaller than O in a one channel patch Scheme  due          to the multiple channel openings This prediction is          opposite to our observations          We further tested this conclusion with simulations We          simulated currents assuming    s  and    s          in Scheme  The theoretical lifetimes of the closed          and open states are  and  ms respectively We          simulated the currents with one two and three          independent channels and calculated the mean lifetime of          each level program MIL wwwqubbuffaloedu Figure           The mean closed and open lifetimes calculated for a          single channel are  and  ms close to theoretical          values For simulations with two independent channels          the recovered lifetimes of closed level  stand  ndopen          level were   and  ms respectively for          levels   and  close to the theoretical values of            and  ms The mean open times decreased          with the number of channels Figure B The simulation          results for independent channels are those expected from          theory but opposite to our observations with multiple          channel currents compare Figures Cand B Although          Scheme  is the simplest possible kinetic model the same          general behavior applies to more complicated kinetics              The dramatic increase in mean open time of channel          with multiple channel patches indicates that some kinetic          property is different from singlechannel patches          We did a more global test of cooperativity by directly          comparing cooperative and independent models using a          maximum likelihood technique If two binary channels were          active there would be three distinct current levels We          can model this with Scheme  with the constraints imposed          by independence above or Scheme  without any          constraints on the rates If one assumes the number of          channels is known the unconstrained version of Scheme           has two extra parameters If the unconstrained version of          Scheme  is more likely to explain the data than the          constrained one the cooperative model is more          likely          We fit several data sets with the two models using the          maximum interval likelihood program MIL          wwwqubbuffaloedu and in all cases the likelihood          ratio of the cooperativeindependent model was           far in excess of the amount expected for the extra          degrees of freedom This strongly favors the cooperative          model In other words the likelihood of observing          multiple level events occurring so close in time is          unlikely to occur with independent channels                          Open channel noise of currents is reduced in the          patches containing multiple channels          We have observed an interesting phenomenon that          relates to channels having different properties When          there is more than one channel in a patch as expected          the open channel noise is higher than in singlechannel          patches However the open channel noise of each level in          multiple channel currents is the same cf Figure and          Figure D The relative open channel noise            exn            i  where           i is the amplitude of a single          channel at the  stand the  ndlevel is    and             n   Figure D the  rdopen level has a          similar value in multiplechannel patches see Figure           while in the single channel patch it is    n            Figure Dand Table  The differences in relative          fluctuations may be the consequence of faster closing          rates in single channel currents than in multiple channel          currents so that some short events are missed and end up          being classed as open channel noise              The increase in open channel noise of single channel          currents relative to multiple channel currents with          equivalent mean conductances at the same bandwidth          suggests the basic channel permeability properties are          comparable Apparently the interaction of the channels          affects not only the mainstate gating rates but the          substate transition rates that create the open channel          noise                          ATP does not affect open channel noise          In some ligandgated ion channels such as ACh          receptors the agonist not only activates the receptors          but also blocks the pore as well      In order to          test if ATP blocks the PX            receptors and affects open channel          noise we recorded single channel currents activated by          different concentrations of ATP Figure shows the          currents recorded from a single channel patch activated          by different ATP concentrations and the corresponding          amplitude histograms The currents activated by different          ATP concentrations have a similar mean amplitude           i of  pA and            ex of  from the allpoints          histograms see parameters in Table  Therefore there          is no indication that ATP blocks the channel or          influences the open channel noise This is consistent          with the idea that ATP a strongly charged anion would          be excluded from a pore selective for monovalent cations                                          Discussion        Our results demonstrate a clear discrepancy between the        currents recorded from a single channel and those from        multiple channel patches Analysis of open channel        lifetimes open channel noise and gating kinetics suggest        that PX          receptors have nonindependent gating        behavior when multiplechannel exist in same patch and PX                 kinetics vary with the number of        active channels favoring positive cooperativity toward        opening        While we found some discrepancies in the binomial        distribution of occupancy the deviations vary from patch        to patch and are not convincing The equilibrium binomial        distribution is relatively insensitive to deviations since        there is no time information     Yeramian et al           have presented kinetic models that have a binomial        amplitude distribution but correlated lifetimes        The open channel lifetimes estimated for multiple        channel currents are longer than those expected from single        channel currents Figure C a trend         opposite to that expected from        independent channels Figure B The observed increase in        open lifetime in multiple channel patches suggests the        effects of interaction may primarily be on the closing        rate Therefore the         p                   o          of multiple channel currents may larger than that of        single channel currents The channel closing rate may be        dependent on the conductance state of neighboring channels        via ionic fluxes or by direct interactions        The open channel noise of multiple channel currents is        smaller than single channel currents adding to the        collection of properties altered by interactions Figure        D It is not clear whether the differences in open        channel noise arise from direct interactions between the        channels or possibly differences in the membrane        surrounding the channels a phase separation Based on our        earlier studies of open channel noise     it doesnt        appear that the reduction in noise is a result of        accumulation or depletion of ions due to ionic fluxes        The excess noise of a single channel current is independent        of ATP concentration suggesting that ATP itself does not        cause extra noise and that local ionic depletion and        accumulation are not the origin of the effect Figure and        Table         Faster gating kinetics might increase the apparent open        channel noise of single channel currents Figure Aand B        due to the limited bandwidth that turns missed events into        excess noise This is confirmed by our simulated data with        the different closing rates but the same opening rates At        the same bandwidth faster closing rates ie shorter        open lifetimes can increase open noise and attenuate the        mean amplitude simulated data not shown Similarly with        the same open and closing rates the open channel noise and        the amplitude decrease with the decreasing bandwidth        The large open channel noise for the PX          receptors arises from conformational        changes not channel block     For currents from        single channel patches the ratio of open channel noise to        the mean amplitude can be    Figures Dand  Table         The noise level is similar to that observed in the        cyclic nucleotide gated channels     but is much        higher than most other voltage and ligand gated channels        The noise may contain several subconductance states        however a higher bandwidthlower noise recording system is        needed to resolve them For simplicity we therefore assumed        that there is only one noisy open state and the noise        level correlates with the number of active channels        Channel interactions might occur if the local density of        channels places them in contact It has been suggested that        sodium channels form dimers or trimers      From the        strong cooperativity of Ca channels it has been proposed           that Ca channels may also aggregate into clusters        For a steric interaction between nearest neighbors the        stoichiometry would seem to be limited to a factor of         While crosstalk between PX and nicotinic receptors has        recently been shown      our results indicate that        PX          receptors themselves are not        independent but positively cooperative Given the        extensive expression of PX receptors throughout the        nervous system direct channelchannel interaction may        affect neuronal function Cooperativity is one of the basic        properties that characterize long term potentiation in a        neuron     The positive interaction of PX receptors        may serve to steepen the synaptic response in much the same        manner as having multiple ligand binding sites                    Materials and Methods                  Electrophysiology          PX            receptors were expressed in           Xenopus oocytes by mRNA injection              In order to obtain outsideout patches with a          single channel from           Xenopus oocytes we decreased          expression by reducing the amount of mRNA from  ng to           ng lowering the incubation temperature from  to          C and shortening the incubation time to  hours          For electrophysiological experiments           Xenopus

amplitude histograms that were            fit to a sum of multiple             Gaussian distributions The            number of components depended on the number of active            channels Due to the random nature of noise the            variance of independent channels and background noise            will add Thus the variance of total noise of             n th open level               on

 noise Therefore the general equation for calculating            the excess open channel noise of the             n th open level              exn  is                         exn                on                exn                 exi                 ex                c                             on is the variance of noise of             n th open level of current from            histograms               exi the variance of open channel            noise at             i th level and               c the variance of the closed level            etc In particular for patches containing two open            channels the open channel noise for the  stand             ndopen levels are                         ex                o                c                            ex                o                ex                c                                   The probability of the channel being open p            o            For the currents from patches containing a single            channel the probability of being open             p             o  was defined from the amplitude            histogram as the ratio of the area from open channels            A             o  to the total area A             o  A             c                         For the currents from patches containing multiple            channels the probability of being open simultaneously            of the             i th channel             p             oi  was similarly defined as the            ratio of area of             i th level A             oi  to the total area A             total  which is the summation of            closed and open peak areas in histogram                        This calculation is insensitive to short events In            our initial analysis we treated the channel as having            two amplitude classes open and closed All rapid            gating events associated with the open channel were            treated as noise Essentially we defined open as not            closed                                Binomial distribution test            If there are N identical channels in the patch each            with a probability             p                           o              of being open and if the channels act            independently the probability of             k channels being in the open            state simultaneously is given by the binomial            distribution                                    p                           o              can be estimated from the singlechannel            doseresponse curve Fig B We compared             P              k                            binomial              with             P              K                            exp              obtained from amplitude histograms of experimental            data A significant deviation of             P              k                            exp              from             P              k                            binomial              suggests either nonindependence or nonidentical            channels Since the binomial analysis contains no            kinetic information different kinetic behaviors can            produce the same distribution                                Mean open channel lifetime and simulation            The mean open lifetimes at each level were obtained            from idealized currents using a recursive             Viterbi algorithm known as the            segmental kmeans SKM algorithm in QUB suite            wwwqubbuffaloedu In this method the mean open            lifetime is the average of all individual events at the            same level We used the program Simu in QUB to            simulate single channel currents                                      Authors contributions
