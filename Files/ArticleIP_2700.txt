                                 Exit Paula                           Frame Game is anoccasional Slate department based on the premise that who wins inWashington is often determined by how the issue is framed The author neitherendorses nor condemns any of the views expressed however laudatory orrepellent                        At  pm ET on April CNN reported that Judge Susan Webber Wright was granting President Clintonsmotion to dismiss the Paula Jones sexual harassment case Within minutesClintons allies waded into the media to frame the decision In one scenereplayed on television throughout the evening a reporter asked MonicaLewinskys attorney William Ginsburg what the ruling meant It means thatthere never was a Paula Jones case said Ginsburg I trust youll put theproper spin on that            Actuallyreporters didnt have to spin Ginsburgs remark or any other line put out bythe Clinton camp The Clintonites gave them the spin prepackaged Clinton wasvindicated Wright was the countrys most honest Republican and IndependentCounsel Kenneth Starr had lost the legal excuse for his vendetta against thepresident The most breathtaking spin of the eveningthat there never was aPaula Jones casewas swallowed whole The war of words between Clinton andhis enemies looked as it so often does like the ground war between the UnitedStates and Iraq one side advancing with remorseless efficiency the other sidefleeing in disarray                            No Merit Reporters like to show offtheir savvy by picking out the most obvious spin theyve been fed and exposingit as such In this case the buzzword put out by former White House CounselLanny Davis and other Clinton flacks was vindication Journalists were sofixated on maintaining a skeptical distance from the Vword that they neglectedto screen out subtler phrases through which Clintons surrogates equated hislegal escape with moral exoneration On ABCs Nightline  GeorgeStephanopoulos proclaimed This wipes away any question of guilt Seizing onWrights conclusion that Jones legal case was without merit the Clintonitesconstantly repeated this phrase to imply that Wright had dismissed Jones wholestory By the end of ABCs World News                Tonight  Peter Jennings wastelling viewers that according to the judge the charges against the presidenthad no merit            The advantage of the nomerit line over the vindication line was that it enabled Clintonssupporters to maintain their delicate policy of defending him without having tovouch explicitlyand perhaps falselyfor his innocence Ive never believedJones story proclaimed Democratic consultant Mandy Grunwald on CNNsCrossfire  On CNNs Larry King Live  Davis offered amagnificently hollow testimonial I believe the presidents denial            Joneslawyers disputed the vindication spin but failed to organize an effectivemessage of their own The most promising line auditioned by Pat Buchanan onCrossfire  was that Clintons alleged behavior even if legal wasoffensive But Jones lead attorney John Whitehead lacked Buchanans delicacyin making the point Wright had ruled that if Jones allegations were truethey still didnt amount to a breach of law Whitehead simply removed thehypothetical She presumed basically what Paula Jones testified didhappen Whitehead declared on Larry King Live  The judge says veryclearly that the attitude of the president was boorish At every opportunityWhitehead graphically told viewers that Clinton had fondled Jones crotchexposed his genitals and asked her for oral sex News anchors responded tothese clumsy tactics by turning to other guests and changing the subject                            Judging the judge When a federaljudge acts against you you cant just profess shock and outrage as Jonesattorneys did after Wrights decision The judge starts with a presumption offairness and you have to tear that presumption down The Clinton teamsassault on Starr is a textbook example There were obvious avenues for asimilar attack on Wright her studentteacher relationship with Clinton in lawschool and her previous rulingsubsequently overturnedthat Clinton couldntbe sued until he left office But Jones advisers failed to organize aconcerted attack on these points In one breath they doubted her integrity inthe next they affirmed it            The Jonescamp also tried to take the focus off Wright and put it back on what happenedbetween Clinton and Jones in the hotel room If the case was bogus askedBuchanan why did Clintons lawyer Bob Bennett offer  and an apology tomake it go away Ordinarily this is a good strategy But in this case thestory line of the hourJudge dismisses Jones casewas too strong to evadeOn television as in court you need an alternative theory eg that MarkFuhrman planted the evidence to lend coherence and persuasiveness to thevarious holes in the prosecution eg that the gloves dont fit Jonesadvisers failed to put out an alternative story line explaining not justhow Wright had ruled incorrectly but why             Consequently and disastrously the Jones teams expressionsof shock played into the Clinton teams spin that the surprise in Wrightsdecision lay in her defiance not of the facts of the case but of the politicsClintons surrogates advertised Wright as a Republican appointee and numerousmedia outlets including NBC CBS and NPR highlighted that point By sayingnothing about Wrights studentteacher relationship with Clinton the Jonescamp allowed the Clintonites to define it as adversarial Wrights successfulpetition to Clinton for a better grade became in Dan Rathers words anillustration of her long often unfriendly history with Bill Clinton            One of theClinton teams most impressive feats was to sell the idea that throwing out thecase was courageous Beginning with Bennetts afternoon pressconferenceJudge Wright should be complimented on her courage to make theright decision notwithstanding all of the political atmosphere surrounding thecasethe Clintonites incessantly lauded Wrights bravery Network legalanalysts and reporters followed suit marveling at Wrights guts andgumption even as their own instant polls showed the public favored theruling The medias willingness to buy this line was a result in part of theWhite Houses ongoing campaign to depict Clinton as the victim of an inexorablerightwing machine                            Clinton vs whom                Jones vsClinton may be the cases official title but it isnt the matchup theWhite House wants To begin with it threatens to pit the worlds most powerfulman against working women in general a theme assiduously promoted byWhitehead And since Jones is widely regarded as poor and stupid the very ideaof a contest between them makes Clinton the bad guy For both of these reasonsvictory over Jones regarded as such would actually be a defeat for ClintonHence Whiteheads argument repeated in several venues that the ruling woulddiscourage sexual harassment victims from coming forward As Buchanan put itthe boys in the War Room had won a little victory today over this littlegirl who is going to be denied justice            Recognizing this trap Clinton instructed his aides not to gloat Even his pitbulls restrained themselves Bennett told reporters that the decision spoke foritself and James Carville brushed aside Jones as a pawn of larger darkerforces The Clintonites had a worthier foe in mind Crossfire cohostBill Press summed up their story line Big victory for Clinton big loss forKen Starr Starr fought off the linkage telling reporters that his criminalinvestigation was independent of the civil litigation But the Clinton campsmessage was less nuanced and therefore more effective On every networkreporters and anchors talked about Starrs expensive and fruitlessinvestigation and about his obligation to put up or shut up as Ratherexpressed it CNNs Bob Franken declared that Starr and the Jones team werejoined at the hip            The Clintonites owed this portion of their victory in partto shrewd preparation For weeks they had argued that Starr was in collusionwith Jones lawyers Meanwhile Jones lawyers foolishly cooperated bygrumbling that Starr was shadowing them and hijacking their investigation ofLewinsky The Clinton surrogates also held the high ground in the context warStarrs investigation of whether Clinton covered up an affair with Lewinskyarose in the context of the depositions both gave in the Jones case No matterhow carefully Starrs sympathizers explained the distinction between the twocasesand even the superior gravity of the criminal case over the civilcasejournalists fell back on the Clintonite spin that as Tom Brokaw put itStarrs probe grew out of the Paula Jones case and had therefore lost itsviability            To thisend Clintons allies werent content to pronounce the Jones case dead Theyproposed to erase it from history as though Clintons and Lewinskysdepositions had never happened Ginsburgs assertion that there never was aPaula Jones case echoed a Democratic refrain first delivered by Sen BobTorricelli DNJ that the Jones caseand hence the foundation of Starrsinvestigationno longer exists Bill Press CNN political analyst BillSchneider and the Washington Post soon adopted the no longer existsformulation The New York Times opened its front page analysis bysaying it is now politically inconceivable that Congress will considerimpeachment for President Clintons alleged lies and obstruction in a case thatno longer exists The Starr camps plea that coverups should be judged bytheir significance at the time they were committed not by their significancetoday was washed out in a tide of Orwellian revision            Not everyone in the Clinton camp wants Jones erasedCarville who has always been a step ahead of his colleagues in framingClintons fights remember when he declared war on Starr sees Jones suit asa weapon that can be turned against its makers He wants her captured alivePaula Jones is but one part of a larger mosaic Carville charged on LarryKing Live  weaving together reports that Jones Arkansas troopers andother Clinton accusers had received rightwing money I dont want this to endanything I want this to go on Because I want this to be the linchpin of aninvestigation of who got paid how much by whom and to say what TheOrwellians it turns out were too modest
