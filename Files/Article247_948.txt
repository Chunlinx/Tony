                                 Stanley Kubrick Take  Take             There is a peculiar rumor circulating that Stanley Kubrick expired whileclutching a fax from a top Warner Bros executive congratulating him on hisrecently screened Eyes Wide Shut  That this was a favorablemissive is what makes the report so mordant so mysterious Caustic rumorsabout Kubrick are at the heart of his legacyespecially his modern legacysince his films of the last two decades have come so many years apart and havebeen so notworththewait His name has become an adjective for overcontrolIt is said that Kubrick sent his scriptsor pages thereofaround in plasticbags to be read by the intended recipient and then returned via hoveringmessengers Security around Eyes Wide Shut was likened to Los Alamosexcept we now know that the Chinese penetrated Los Alamos No one outsideWarners knows much about the Tom CruiseNicole Kidman thriller set to bereleased on July  after an eyeswideopening  months of shoots andreshoots            Paranoia isnt the worst vice a director can haveNor is ruthless perfectionism although Kubrick tested that theory On TheShining  after the somethingth take of a simple shot in which JackNicholson and Shelley Duvall did little more than cross a busy streetNicholson reportedly approached the director and said Er Stanley I normallypeak on the  rd take There were apparently no accidents happy orunhappy on a late Kubrick movieno messy intrusions of life no funk Thesewere giant hermetically sealed constructions And they were all KubrickAcquaintances in the English film industry report that on days when Kubrickdidnt feel like directing production of Eyes Wide Shut shut down Whatwould be the point of coming in            Those whove had experiences with amphetamines canrecognize some characteristics of Kubricks oeuvre  the brilliance andexactitude of individual sequences in what was often a sour fuzzy whole Theupshot of such control however is that each film is sui generis  eachwith its own unique architecture its own singularand vastlyinfluentialcinematic metaphor The tight clockwork construction of his earlymasterpiece the heist drama The Killing  is gloriously in syncandthen bitterly at oddswith the robberys unraveling The waltzingimpersonality and blurriness of  make the dismantling of its mosthuman characterthe computer HALmore vivid than any other death in modernmovies            Even those of us who think The Shining was abotch can appreciate its Steadicam tricycle treks around that huge emptyhotel which capture indelibly the circular labyrinthine evil at the heart ofthe story Even those of us who despise Full Metal Jacket will not shakeoff the effects of its formally brilliant minute opening bootcampsequence in which men are mechanistically stripped of their individuality toprepare them to go forth and kill Ill despise Kubrick forever for associatingBeethovens Ninth Symphony Singin in the Rain and some of the mostglorious works of Handel and Purcell with sadomasochism and mans inhumanity toman But even at his most glibly nihilistic in A                ClockworkOrange  Kubrick foresaw the punk movement in a way that makes the overusedterm visionary seem an understatement            An omniscient spellbinder who was also cynical andlimitedthats not the worst legacy a filmmaker can have especially one whogave us some of our cultures most enduring visions of the absurdity of warboth satirical  Dr Strangelove  and gruelingly earnest  Paths ofGlory             In an autobiography Kirk Douglaswho worked withthe director on Spartacus and Paths                of Glory remembered anasty credithogging character less noble and more commercially ambitiousthan he has subsequently been depicted Thats at odds with the portrait of aman who was for better or worse a pinnacle of integrity While his movies arethought of as huge they are certainly hugely expensive Kubricks crews werelegendarily tinyin many cases no more than  peopleand the directorhimself would go around arranging the lights in the manner not of a deity butof an electrician or plumber Where most people think of Kubricks films ashaving been storyboarded to deathpredigestedothers report that he oftenwandered his sets with a camera lens groping for shots on the spot He spokein an engaging nebbishy BronxJewish accent that was always a shock tohearlike the voice of the unmasked Wizard of Oz it didnt belong On hissets he wore the same outfits it is said that like Einstein he had five ormore of each lined up on hangers The act of making choices was clearlyexcruciating to him thats why the choices he made are somemorable                           David Edelstein                        Theres a fear of greatness in American popcultureof artists who outlast their moment of young promise and insist ondeveloping a personality I cant think of any other explanation for the crueltone that has entered into the obituaries for Stanley Kubrick one of the lastfilmmakers who painted images in a grand style An obituary in the New YorkTimes used the word cold three times and for good measure addedchilly  icy  bleak  and grim  Kubrick the Cold is aclich that cropped up in the columns of Pauline Kael and now serves as a comfysofa for those who dont want to deal with Kubricks ambition Certainly hewas not a warm cuddly director but what great director ever has been Thebest of his films The Killing  Lolita  Dr Strangelove and The Shining are wearing especially wellprovide a peculiar kind ofexhilaration They make me happy they make me laugh Im responding not onlyto the directors generous wit but also to his bravado These movies arevisual musical and verbal dances in which even the most minor player and thetiniest detail move to the main tune If this was cold then so was FredAstaire            The question is What is art supposed to do for usShould it make us feel better about our lives show us friendly mirrors Inthat case Kubrick was no good But if art is supposed to open up strangevistas make us think twice about the ordinary then Kubrick was a big dealHis most uncanny disclosures came not in the obvious transcendentalism of but in The                Shining which barring some last miraclein the forthcoming Eyes Wide                Shut  ought to be his masterpiece Eyes Wide Shut is already a conceptual masterpiece insofar as itlocked up Tom Cruise for years on end and lost Hollywood millions of dollarsHere Kubrick took a seemingly wornout genre the hauntedhouse chiller andfound dozens of new corridors Look at it again and see it how pins downformulas of everyday life Nicholson shouts workplace banalities while wavinghis bat Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment
