        how you enjoy lawn and garden work     well yes and no  we live um on a culdesac and were at the end so we kind of have like two yards so to speak and um its really tough in the summer time mowing because we just have so much yard to to uh take care of   do yall have a riding lawn mower   no we dont thats on our wish list one of these days but thats how we get our exercise is get out there with the mower and what we did this uh past summer was we tried to because were doing we do it the mulching rather than bag it and all and uh we try to do it about twice a week so that was really quite the chore   our first house when we got married was a third of an acre and we had plenty front yard side yards and back backyards   oh my   the next house was uh a lot smaller we had a swimming pool in the back and front the third house were in now the backyard is total swimming pool   uhhuh uhhuh   the sides are slowly disappearing into into uh other things and the fronts very small so the size of my yard is decreasing in proportion to my age uh i     yeah right well that that makes sense though   im ive gotten to where i enjoyed digging in the little flower beds rather than uh   right   uh mowing mowing and and i weve got the third house has an automatic sprinkler system which i wouldnt be without again   the actual maintenance of the yard uhhuh well see thats what thats also on our wish list we um couple years ago we landscaped our our whole front yard   umhum   and um my husband has lived in the house for several years and we finally decided well were just gonna go in and redo everything and we did that and we debated at the time about putting in you know sprinkler system like in the in the flower beds and we thought well when we do it were just gonna do in the flower beds and the whole yard   you might not do the flower beds ive had a guy thats in bugs and pest control he says youre really inviting termites when you go into the flower beds and keep it real moist   uhhuh uhhuh well speaking of termites we had those this past summer too   did yall really oh i had those in house number two and it cost me a thousand bucks to get rid of them and then when i went to renew see the guy for renar renewal the one year warranty renewal   yeah right right   hed gone out of business so my yes   oh yeah thats thats a tough thing we got a with our deal we got about a five year warranty and were just   yeah whod yall go with   a place called TKO Exterminating there hes out in Rowlett and i hope that hes going to around   yeah stays in business yeah i i the the big ones the national chains Orkid or whoever he is they were a lot more expensive but   right right   if i have it do over again i will go with a major corporation because well gust because the guy retires and  there goes your warranty when he retires   yeah i know thats the thats the thing and we thought about that and we thought well were just gonna kind of i guess take our chances and hopefully end up on the better end of the deal   what kind of plants do you have in your garden when yall landscaped   weve got some uh Yaupon hollies Chinese hollies uh the monkey grass   yeah were were right behind you on those you listen to Neil Sperry too right   yeah  well actually the first time we relandscaped we did it in the fall they say thats the best time to do it and we did it then and we had Indian Hawthornes in which are so pretty because they have the little you know uh blossoms on them but those are not freeze tolerant and we had a freeze and we had to replace we took about       twenty plants back that next spring to the nursery and we had a lifetime guarantees so we just got new plants and put those in   beautiful  if you want a little flower bed system automatically PVC piping is dirt cheap   umhum uhhuh   and they sell connections that go from a short hose you buy a short hur hose and the connections and you lay it in your flower bed   uhhuh okay   and the the the sprinkler head that you buy at the store fit right in to PVC   uhhuh oh is that right   and so you just lay that in your flower bed and then when youre ready to water all you do is put the hose into your PVC thing turn it on and it does it right there and you dont have to move the hose or anything   okay you probably uhhuh uhhuh oh okay yeah because see thats whats such a pain is the constant moving is the you know   i know i know i know im so proud of my house with the automatic   well thats thats hopefully we did a lot of work on our house this past summer and um we thought the next thing will be a sprinkler system but that probably wont be for a couple of years now  because we really  did a whole lot this summer spent too much money so   well you get it the way you want it and just perfect and sit back for a while i hope yall dont have to get transferred or anything now that you got it the way you want it   yeah well i know i hate it when people do that theyll sit there and fix up their house and then they move and no were gonna we plan on staying here for awhile     did did you hear the price on the discount is down to three percent today the lowest the banks in three twenty five years   yeah   the mortgages  im gonna be refinancing the rent house our house and everything else i i just cant wait theyre talking you know seven eight percent   yeah i know yep yep   well anyway
