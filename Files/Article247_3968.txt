                                 The Justice Departments Blunt Instrument                        Its just an odd coincidence but there did seem to be something tellingabout the Whats News section on the front page of todays Wall StreetJournal which listed as its first item the findings of fact in theMicrosoft antitrust trial and as its second Pfizers  billion hostile bidfor WarnerLambert Pfizer is attempting to muscle out American Home Productswhich wants to have a friendly merger with WarnerLambert            The first item describes the results of the US governments relentlesspursuit of a company it arguesand Judge Jackson agreesis a monopolistengaged in anticompetitive behavior The second item by contrast describesthe results of the US governments general indifference to theanticompetitive implications of the huge wave of mergers that continues tosweep across every sector of the US economy And the logical question theseitems raises is Whats the difference            To be sure its not entirely fair to say that the Justice Department andthe Federal Trade Commission have been asleep at the wheel when it comes topursuing antitrust cases They have blocked the StaplesOffice Depot merger andthe LockheedNorthrop Grumman deal and threw a monkey wrench illadvisedlybut still into Barnes  Nobles proposed acquisition of book distributorIngram And in other cases theyve forced companies to sell off divisions ormake other changes before mergers would be approved            On the whole though the consolidation of industries ranging from financialservices to telecommunications to aerospace to the drug industry has proceededremarkably fast and with remarkably little interference And whats perplexingabout this particularly in light of the Microsoft case is that mergers oftenhave an immediate anticompetitive impact in the simplest sense that theyreduce the number of players in a market If the Justice Departments defaultposition is that competition protects consumersa sensible enoughpositionthen its hard to see why the merger boom should not be scrutinizedmore carefully than it has been            Of course antitrust law is a very blunt instrument and should be used onlywhen real harm can be discerned But antitrust law is also much better suitedto preventing the formation of giant megacorporationsit is calledanti trust law after allthan to eradicating monopolies that havearisen by other means            Remember that monopolies per se are not illegal In fact theestablishment of temporary monopoliesof taste of technology or ofdistributionis the only way that companies are able to reap meaningfuleconomic profits which otherwise would be immediately competed away Amonopoly becomes illegal only when the company exercising it uses that monopolyto shut out competitors in other markets either through coercion or bysubsidizing low competitionkilling prices in that market Again manyacademic economists question whether this last tactic is really feasible butantitrust law depends on the assumption that it is And this of course isexactly what Judge Jacksons findings of fact say Microsoft did            Oddly though when the Justice Departments Joel Klein appeared on ABCsThis Week over the weekend he seemed to be saying something more thanthat Microsoft had acted in ways that were unacceptable for a monopolist Heseemed to suggest that being a monopolist was itself unacceptable You knowin America you have a choice he said And if IBM or Gateway or Compaq orDell  had a choice they could go to Microsoft and negotiate or they couldgo to somebody else and negotiate Here everybodys got to go to oneplacethats whats hurting us            Thats an audacious readingor rather rewritingof antitrust law andsuggests that what Klein wants is not just the breaking up of Microsoft intoseparate companies but the breaking up of Microsofts operatingsystem divisioninto competing companies since otherwise there still wouldnt be choice ofdifferent versions of Windows for IBM or Gateway or Dell Maybe next we canblock any further acquisitions by Pfizer and tell it that it has to set upcompeting companies to distribute different versions of Viagra too
