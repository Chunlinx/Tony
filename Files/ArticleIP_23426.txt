                                 Altmans Gold            I dont want to project toomuch onto Robert Altmans bluesy charmer Cookies Fortune to argue forinstance that its the work of an old master summing up But it sure feelsthat way The screenwriter Anne Rapp has provided Altman with a blueprint notonly for an ensemble comedy but also for a comedy that honors the very idea ofan ensemble Its no wonder Altman fell on it As early as MASH the director seemed more taken with the ebb and flow of groups thanwith the isolated treks of individuals Its not just that he likes to tellstories with multiple strands or that he gets bored easily with oneconsciousness or even that he cherishes some s utopian fantasy of thecollective What Cookies Fortune suggests is that for Altman order inthe universe cant be discerned in the comings and goings of lone heroes but inthe interactions among vast and disparate collections of people This time outhe transforms the bad vibes of his other films into a vision thats positivelyserene He celebrates a universe that has found its equilibrium and the easyway in which it rights itself when a nasty bit of flotsam threatens to throw itout of whack            The movie takes place inthe Deep South which was also the setting for Altmans edgy disharmonicthriller The Gingerbread Man  The opening is teasinglymisleading as if to make you think youre seeing The Gingerbread ManII  In Holly Springs a small Mississippi cotton town Willis RichlandCharles S Dutton staggers out of a blues joint semidrunk then drops hisbottle of bourbon when a police car glides ominously past So he heads backinto the bar steals a fifth of Wild Turkey then ambles past the railroadtracks and peeps into a van where a young woman Liv Tyler has beenundressing Then he climbs in the window of a big antebellum house and takessome guns from a glass cabinet at the foot of the main staircase            So far so Southern Gothic Except that Willis it turnsout is the towns gentlest spirit loved even by those passing police who arehis fishing buddies Hes a caretaker at that househe couldnt find his keysThe girl he was spying on is the runaway niece of the elderly widow CookieOrcutt Patricia Neal he works for Hed promised to clean those guns beforehe went to bed And the next afternoon Willis buys a fifth of Wild Turkey andsurreptitiously slips it behind the bar of the blues joint to replace the onehed swiped The owner Rufus Thomas pretends not to notice but when Willisleaves he turns to his chesty singer Ruby Wilson and says Willis is evenagain            Thats the core ofCookies Fortune  Willis is even again It suggests a community inwhich everything is in balance in which people accept the good and the bad infaith that it will all even out in the end The picture sits vaguely in thecomicmystery genre but its more of a relaxant than a thriller Theres aviolent death and a coverup and the police have to figure out what reallyhappened before an innocent person is condemned to prisonor worse But Altmandoesnt let the audiences outrage mount The act that kicks the movie into ahigher gear comes nearly half an hour in and Altman is in no hurry to get tohis narrative point Thats probably because he has to eliminate Cookie to doit and Patricia Neal isnt someone you want to get rid of The actress now inher s has shrunk in physical stature but has otherwise swelledI dontremember her having such power in her lungs When she sucks on her pipe andstares at the gun cabinet and upbraids her late husband for leaving her behindAltman clearly wants her to take all the time in the world            How do you convince young directors to watch and emulateAltman Its so much easier to push a filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick whosebrilliant sequences you can screen and dissect in a cinema studies classAltman uses a distinctive color palette herea lot of neonlike primary colorsas if the whole Mississippi town were a blues jointbut his mastery is in hisoffhandedness in how he conceals his own storytelling Theres always a sensethat his characters are living even when youre not watching them maybebecause the actors dont seem on the way they do for other directors Altmancatches them in his gaze and gives them the onceover and then they go abouttheir business Actors I didnt think Id want to see againNed Beatty andDonald MoffatI wanted to see more of and Chris ODonnell is positivelyreborn as a bumbling young policeman who only wants to make out with Liv Tyleragainst the station house soda machine Courtney B Vance shows up as anofficious homicide detective from a nearby city who finds Holly Springs lazyinformality irritating but none of the women wants to answer his queries Theywant to flirt with him and he cant help falling into their easy rhythms            Glenn Close plays Camille Orcutt Cookieshistrionic niece and the director of the church theatricals currently OscarWildes Salome  whose hysterical obsession with hiding thedisgraceful truth throws the town into an uproar I was surprised to findClose in the movie since her clenched overly controlled acting seems at oddswith what Altman usually goes for But this might be her best performance everHer Camille is like a steely demented temperance activist who keeps charginginto otherwise relaxed settings and throwing them into chaos Youd think thepolice could take their stupid crime tape with them when they leave Shepairs beautifully with Julianne Moore as Camilles simpleminded vaguelyschitzy sister Cora whos so browbeaten that whenever shes called on totalk the Scripture comes flowing out of her mouth like lava            The truth in CookiesFortune isnt ferreted out  la Murder She Wrote  it emerges indribs and drabsa witness here a piece of evidence thereas if by naturallaw You might even say that the truth emerges as a consequence of chaos andnot from some misguided pursuit of order What seems on the surface asingratiating a movie as Altman has ever made is actually packed withsubversive ideas It ends on a note of blithe miscegenationjust the sort ofpunch line to send the Camilles of the world screaming from the theater swipingat invisible bugs            As a young movie critic I made the wrong sort of name formyself by swooning in print over many a nubile actress Yes I was oftenpromiscuous in my praise and yes my affaires de la tte were oftensadly shortlived But Ive practiced the critical equivalent of abstinence formany years now and its time to reassert what can never be forgotten It isthe right nay the duty of a critic to fall and fall hard I see no point inwriting about Never Been Kissed a pleasant but annoyingly insubstantialteen comedyunless I can pull out the stops and say its worth seeing itdemands to be seen for Drew Barrymore who is at once the dizziest and mostmagically poised comedienne in movies today            Barrymore plays a frumpynewspaper copy editor whos ordered to go undercover as a highschool studentby a nuttily competitive publisher Garry Marshall Is Drew a convincingfrump Surprisingly so She hits her slight speech impediment harder than usualand further relaxes her already shlumpy posture Trying to fit in with thecool kids she seems heartbreakingly defenseless You could mistake her foran ordinary unaffected nerd except that the genius Barrymore timing is inevery breath every screwy inflection every pratfall After an hour I thoughtthat Never Been Kissed might be the most fun teenpic sinceClueless  but ultimately the movie takes too many shortcuts even on itsown dumb formulaic terms and it cant make up its mind whether it wants topander to teenage fantasies of good looks and popularity or to scoldteenagers for being so shallow No matter The picture would have to be a hellof a lot worse to keep me from going back to watch Drew bite her lower lip andthat shy smile spread meltingly across that sweet eternally girlish face and            Wait maybe Id better switch to The Matrix  whichmade  million in its first week and seems poised to become a phenomenonDirected by Larry and Andy Wachowski its a mishmash of Hong Kongswordfighting ghost epics Kafkaesque virtual reality fantasies Cronenbergianvisions of cybernetically enhanced flesh Alice in Wonderlandsurrealism postapocalyptic urban grunge Terminator like battles ofman vs machine and portentous lumpenZen posturing I can only show you thedoor You have to walk through it It shouldnt make a lick of sense letalone feel all of a piece but The Matrix is actually one of the morelyrical scifi action thrillers ever made in which space and time become loveslaves to the directors witty visual fancies Keanu Reeves makes a leanstrikingly beautiful tabula rasa hero twisting out of the way of bullets thatelongate like silver beads of mercury and hes partnered by the equally hardblank and androgynously gorgeous CarrieAnne Moss Walls and pillars explodearound them but the sleek geometric lines of their bodies never soften Themachines in comparison seem fuzzy
