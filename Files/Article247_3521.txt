                                 Ty Weans Itself From Beanie Babies                        I have no idea whether Ty Incs promise that as of Dec  it will make nomore Beanie Babies is true If it isnt its a great way to spur shorttermsales since now the flagging Beanie Baby market will be enlivened by thedesire to get in while you can Along the same lines a friend of mine thinksGeorge magazine should keep labeling each issue the last issue ofGeorge  for as many months as it can            But shortterm sales aside if Tys promise isnt true it should be sinceit represents a very rare thing in the business world a recognition thatthings actually come to an end A similarly smart decision was made oddlyenough by the founders of the Lilith Fair tour this year Over the past yearan unusual combination of oversaturation and fatigue with high prices hasweighed down the Beanie Baby market and no I cant believe Im actuallywriting this sentence More to the point like any fad its fading outdisplaced by the latest objects of fascination for children Ty is rapidlyreaching the point of diminishing returns Cashing out now would be anexcellent move            What makes such a move difficult is that although Beanie Babies may havereached the point of diminishing returns they probably have not reached thepoint of nonexistent returns In other words theres still money to be madeselling Beanie Babies Its just not enough money to justify future investmentAnd the fundamental problem is that if you dont move on early enough you findyourself caught believing that the only way to recoup the money youve putinto the business is to keep going in it            Excellent examples of what Ty doesnt want to become abound especiallywithin the odd industry of collectible pop culture In the late s and earlys baseball cards exploded into a classic speculative bubblethere I gosounding like the old Alan Greenspanto which companies responded by producingtoo many cards that were too expensive When the bubble burst entire companiesvanished and the major players have barely struggled to stay afloat The samewas true of comic books which saw a proliferation of titles and of publisherswhen they were hot and a dramatic downsizing when demand faded Unfortunatelywhen the smoke clears prices for these goods remain surprisingly high anaverage comic book is seven or eight times more expensive than it was  yearsago which may have something to do with why sales growth is so slow            All of this is almost textbook economics of course since any time you havea business that is reaping sizeable profits competitors are going to enter themarket and successful businesses are going to expand rapidly in an attempt tosell more goods But in textbook economics any competitive marketplace endswith everyone reaping no profits Thats why the discipline to move on when themarket becomes oversaturatedor alternatively when the market simply driesupis a necessary discipline If the Ty announcement is real then thats onecompany at least thats acquired that rigor
