                 okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh as far as im concerned i cant really see the difficulty uh or any problems that we have other than they keep saying the ACT scores were a little low or lower than well were above above the national average but theyre talking in the newspapers all the time that were not doing as well as other countries in science and math which i think theres been an effort to to increase that so i dont see that theres serious any serious uh problems with our school systems here in Utah uh what about Texas   oh id say uh we probably have what could could be described as serious problems   uhhuh   from uh gun toting kids to uh low grades on the teens test   yeah   they uh      well i hate i hate to hear it   they got a pretty much of a handful of problems to deal with   huh where the students are kind of controlling the the schools then in some areas   well i dont know if you could say that but theyre uh are having to uh put in metal detectors and   oh boy   security and   yeah thats not good uh id hate to teach under those situations   indeed   well well that hasnt got here yet i hope it it doesnt but uh it i know were were starting to have a few gangs here associated with the schools   yeah thats bad news i tell you they uh   yeah but thats where it begins i guess   course it always sounds a lot worse than it is i suppose but   uhhuh but at least uh i i go into the schools quite a bit in my occupation the different high schools in the in the six western states that i i work in and uh generally from what i can see the uh we dont really have that type of problems in any of the states yet but i know talking to my uh counterparts back east that theyre they have uh security guards that patrol the hallways and and thats not a good learning situation if youve got to have policemen there to keep kids in class and   yeah   so it sound like thats its kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where youre at   yeah they uh i dont know i think they uh they need to uh get back to the basics i think we   yes   throwing a lot of money at the problem but it hasnt uh seemed to do whats necessary yet   umhum thats true and i i think that uh in in our Utah school systems we weve kind of reversed going from the social classes back to a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary and i think that is thats a good change to to get back instead of so many uh off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic education you know education   i think learning social interaction is good too but uh i think it has to be a balanced curriculum   uh yes there does uh you cant uh go from one extreme to the other and there there has to be a balance theres got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion in order to prepare them for the society today with the technology that we have theyve   thats right   theyve got to have a good math an english background in order to compete   yeah i dont think uh American schools in general are uh coming up to where they should be   no theyre talking about uh in some of the states back here are going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty i dont know what your school year is there but   theyre talking about going to year theyre actually testing out we just had it on the news tonight about the uh year round school   umhum   they go for three months and then take a month off or something     we have a a theres a little of that going on here but its all in the elementary grades its not in the upper uh   umhum   in the secondary area but i its theres some test cases to see uh if the students are able to if they dont lose as much uh theyre able to retain more where theyre only out for a month instead of three months and they have to go   exactly i think that was the uh thing they mentioned too   uhhuh so it sounds like uh in your area and this area too that theyre trying to work on the problem that they see as a problem to correct the some some some of the situations uh
