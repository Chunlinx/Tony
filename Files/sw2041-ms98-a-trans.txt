                uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes   what um well um my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class hes an aerobics instructor   uhhuh   and um is going to be uh entering North Texas for uh a kinesiology program there   umhum   and um  the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach   umhum youre a student   yeah so im im an avid aerobics  uh person and just very very athletic enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports   uhhuh umhum umhum   so and how do you feel about it   um im i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise i i dont feel like i i dont very often do things for the sake of exercise i dont feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things like um ive never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time   umhum   but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person but its not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercisings sake and perhaps its because somehow that implies to me its not fun or something like that   umhum yeah well i ive my thats the way my mother stands on it she feels like if its something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesnt enjoy it when its a chore   umhum umhum yes yes   so um and i feel that way too as far as you you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty situps or something you know to   umhum umhum   you know a a calculated you know calculated down and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or but but i do try and um   umhum umhum umhum   i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week   yeah yeah is that why you like aerobics classes because youre not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore   yeah and its got and ive always enjoyed dance   yeah   so it involves you know i i cant get out to dance all the time   yeah would that we could   and yeah  and its and its more regulated i mean youre youre using different parts of the body so it it is like dance and and its structured like   umhum umhum   that but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me   yeah umhum   and someone else is telling me okay you know lets lets move this way lets move that way instead of me having to think about it so much   umhum umhum right you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself   yeah yeah but im like you i also um like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh Myerson Symphony Run this past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and um   umhum umhum   just get out you know out and about and its it its something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was it was quite a lot of fun and biking and i i i love to swim so i love it when you know its   umhum umhum umhum umhum   swimming weather and uh   hm well youre talking to someone from California where its often swimming weather   oh i didnt realize that im sorry well im in Texas i i just assumed that i had this is the first call ive done and i didnt realize that they had were gonna   uh   reach out to people from all over the country   so its the its its the the active well its actually its interesting because there are real real regional differences um in California theres uh almost an assumption   you wouldnt know that  oh i   um unless youre sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that im im im uh theres an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California and maybe not i dont know about rural California too well but in urban California its just you know for all i know aerobics started out here i dont know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere so there must be something to some of them and uh   umhum well i think people are are more encouraged people from California seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just your your your health consciousness and i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of California not just exercise but health health related   umhum yeah   ideas and i its curious i dont know why dont know if its do you does California have a   well theres a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole theres a lot of you know youll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh oh the University University University the University of California at Berkeley puts out The Wellness Letter which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter   umhum   monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and and it doesnt deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it its on fairly solid solid scientific ground uh its just dispensed with these distinctions it says every all sorts of factors go into health and theres no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together and uh so its had that orientation for quite sometime um theres been some progressive medical schools out here   umhum   that have taken that approach and um   now do you think thats because theyve realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that theyve incorporated that into their program do you think the program came first or the   boy yeah that theres a i i can say theres a correlation but i couldnt say which which caused the other they sort of developed you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more   yeah the more money they put into it i can see that because i knowing from institutes of learning like that i know that theyve got to get their money somewhere and somebodys got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so   yeah and some yeah yeah exactly and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was um people becoming interested in alternate practices i dont know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh AMA approved medicine um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here and and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and before long   umhum   you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options   umhum   and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them the irony is is its people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me   yeah or theyre older well dont you think they tend to be older in the rural area i i i sometimes think that its almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city i live in a rural area so you know i see the   oh like everything else yeah yeah the rat race to exercise   its its yeah its its like its frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area um  almost doesnt worry about it to such a degree but   umhum   stays you know more healthier you know as a fit person   yeah well i i think so i mean you youve if you look at certain if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China and they dont do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and   umhum   they seem pretty you know they dont have the hard body they dont have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day you know and that thats   yeah well dont you think a lot of that is diet too yeah   and a lot of that is diet thats true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um   umhum yeah and as we can see well im a im a practicing vegetarian so uh ive read a lot of information knowing that to be true whats that   yes as am i actually i as am i   oh are you also  well thats thats good as far as the calisthenics is that is that um pretty predominant as far as California do do   yes it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now   in the urban areas umhum oh thats wonderful   well most most modern sort of modern looking restaurants will   yeah thats great i mean we uh its such a trouble its such a trouble here i mean you just have to eat at home basically   you can i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh it occurred to me   well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to Dallas so um which   umhum   you you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so   umhum umhum   youre gonna have a lot of  more choices but in urban areas its you know steak places an and its not a you know its uh its definitely it its its changing to a degree but   yeah yeah yeah   um  its very frustrating and even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh   yeah   organic you know materials and foods and things you dont really have that i mean you would think   umhum umhum umhum
