                                 Microsuits            Dan Morales the attorneygeneral of Texas was the first state attorney general to begin investigatingMicrosoft  months ago In November he filed suit to void clauses inMicrosofts contracts with computer manufacturers that he said were preventingthem from assisting his probe Though this case was dismissed Moralespersevered joining with  other state attorneys general in preparing awideranging antitrust suit against                   Slate               s parent company            But lastweek at the very last moment Morales dropped out of the suit Why First hereceived a letter from the heads of several Texasbased companies includingCompaq and CompUSA urging him not to bring a case that would harm an industryemploying more than  Texans Then Michael Dell founder of theAustinbased computer company that is both a Microsoft ally and one of Texaslargest employers came by to see him Just after that meeting Moralesannounced he wouldnt sue explaining in a prepared statement that severalofficials of Texas computer industry have expressed concerns that the filingof a lawsuit against Microsoft may negatively impact their companies as well asthe consumers of the state            The antitrust case against Microsoft may or may not havemerit And it may or may not make sense for  states to run their ownantitrust policies alongside or in opposition to the national one But Moralesdecision is pretty shocking in any event If Texas chief legal officer isgoing to take it upon himself to decide whether Microsoft should be prosecutedthat decision should be based on whether he believes the company has violatedthe law Instead Morales openly interpreted his duty as promoting his statescommercial interests Morales said in effect I dont care whether Microsoftis breaking the law The issue is whether Microsoft is good for business inTexas            Of courseMorales was merely explicit where other AGs prefer to be coy Tiny Utah hometo Novell a Microsoft rival is a vigorous participant in the states suitTiny South Dakota home to Microsoft ally Gateway is not California whereMicrosoft antagonists Netscape Oracle and Sun live has signed on Washingtonstate where Microsoft lives has declined Washington state Attorney GeneralChristine Gregoire determined that there was no need to duplicate the federaleffort            In the curiously booming business of multistatelawsuits economic factors often interfere with lofty considerations of thelaw When Michael Moore the attorney general of Mississippi sued to recoverMedicaid costs from the tobacco industry in a case that led to the billion tobacco settlement now up for debate in Congress other stateseventually joined in Among the few that did not were the biggest producers oftobacco North Carolina Virginia Kentucky Tennessee and Georgia            Youdhave to be pretty naive to expect political considerations to play no part inthe deliberations of any public prosecutor even in criminal cases Butmultistate actions as these signupsheet lawsuits are called are almostpure politics They generally reflect the ambitions of state electedofficials rather that the claims of sound public policy            If General Electric is selling an unsafe toaster we have aConsumer Product Safety Commission with jurisdiction to investigate regulateand litigate The CPSC must decide whether that toaster should be sold toconsumers anywhere in America Does it make sense for each state to be decidingthat question all over againeither agreeing in which case the effort isredundant or disagreeing in which case the result is a toaster that is legalin Ohio but illegal in Kentucky Its like every state having its own foreignpolicywhich happens to be another futilitygenerating trend Multistate suitsadd another layer of absurdity the states reinventing the wheel of federalismby attempting to act in unison            The flurryof multistate lawsuits is the result of an odd alliance between liberal legalactivism and conservative devolutionary zeal In the s the consumermovement fired up state attorneys general to begin going after corporatemalefactors One of the first multistate actions was a suit filed by sixattorneys general against oil companies for price fixing in  Another wasfiled against General Motors in  for falsely claiming that some of its carscontained rocket engines Such suits increased with the falloff in consumerprotection and antitrust enforcement during the Reagan years The regulatoryagencies in Washington have grown more aggressive since Bill Clinton arrived in But somehow more federal activism has only spurred the litigiousexuberance of the  AGs Various states have recently gone after deceptiveadvertising in car leasing sneaker price fixing and telemarketing scams Atthe moment they are shadowing the Justice Department in an antitrustinvestigation of Visa and MasterCard            Perhaps the biggest factor in the multistatelitigation boom is Moore As Peter Pringle recounts in Cornered  a newbook about antitobacco litigation Moore turned himself into a household namewith his suit against Big Tobacco As the suit progressed Moore was featuredin Vanity Fair and on every TV news program known to humankind TheNational Law Journal named him lawyer of the year in  Mooreincurred some suspicion and jealousy from his colleagues He also became theirrole model Hubert H Skip Humphrey III the attorney general of Minnesotafiled his own suit against the tobacco companies It was settled last week for billion Humphrey used the occasion to attack Moores settlement as asweetheart deal            Now allAGs want to be the next Michael Moore There are folks willing to help As oneWashington PR person explains these cases are often marketed to the stateattorneys general by corporate and publicinterest lobbyists First they go tothe most eager beavers Skip Humphrey or Richard Blumenthal of ConnecticutSecond tier but nearly as promising are Morales of Texas Scott Harshbargerof Massachusetts and Dennis Vacco of New York Another good source of lawsuitsis the National Association of Attorneys General known informally as theNational Association of Aspiring Governors NAAG meets four times a year soits various committees can hash out ideas for litigation like the billingfraud case now being developed against the hospital chains            In the case of Microsoft Blumenthal of Connecticut appearsto have won the coveted prize managing to eclipse Iowa Attorney General TomMiller who is chairman of the NAAGs antitrust committee and New YorksVacco who heads the consumer committee Blumenthals face has been everywherein the last week and he is clearly enjoying his moment in the limelightbuilding valuable name recognition for the day when he decides whether to runfor governor or senator Others may pause to wonder why Connecticutand other statesneeds an antitrust policy separate from that of the UnitedStates The question whether regulation of commerce is a state or nationalaffair was supposed to have been settled in
