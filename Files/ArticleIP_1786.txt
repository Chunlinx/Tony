international melting pot only  percent of the countryspopulation was born overseas compared with  percent of Australias percent of Switzerlands and  percent of Canadas            Notsurprisingly the immigration system is set up to benefit the UnitedStatesonly a small percentage of the people who would like to come here areallowed in and only a tiny fraction of the ones who make that cut are

Whatsthe Difference Between a Resident Alien and a US Citizen                        Untilrecently millions of greencard holders were content to live in the UnitedStates as resident aliens But of late lawmakers have indicated a change ofattitude toward legal immigrants and this has affected the number ofapplications for citizenship A  federal welfare law separated rights fromentitlements denying legal immigrants access to government housing and welfarewhile still requiring them to pay taxes This loss of benefits has almostcertainly precipitated the jump from the longstanding annual average of citizenship applications to  million in  Immigration andNaturalization Service estimates show that  million of the  milliongreencard holders resident in the United States in  were eligible to applyfor US citizenship                           I Won theLottery How Do I Become a Citizen                        Candidates for citizenshipmust  be  or older  have resided in the United States continuously

andaccording to critics to some immigrants being wrongly naturalized In May an INS audit of the  million people who were granted citizenshipbetween September  and September  revealed  cases in whichcriminal arrest should have disqualified an applicant or in which an applicantlied about his or her criminal history A more recent press release from the INS suggests that the agency has made adramatic turnaround as a result of new policies initiated last June                           Evadingthe System                        According to INS estimates illegal immigrants come to the United States each year and there were million illegal immigrants living in the country in  About  millionof this group are nonimmigrant overstays that is people who entered thecountry legally on a temporary basis and didnt go home Most illegalimmigrants an estimated  million come from Mexico but only  percent ofMexican illegal immigrants are overstays compared with  percent of thosefrom other parts of Central America and  percent from all other countriesThe INS deported  criminal and other illegal aliens in  andrecent changes in the law summarized here establish new grounds for denying admission to the UnitedStates For example nonimmigrant overstays can now be denied readmission forup to  years            Access tojobs attracts illegal immigrants Although the INS negotiated its largestworksite settlement last year when a Texas restaurant chain agreed to pay amillion fine for hiring and employing illegal immigrant workers criticsclaim that Congress doesnt do enough to punish employers who make extensiveuse of illegal labor Unscrupulous employers see these workers as moremanageable and less likely to complain Despite regulations that punishemployers who knowingly employ them pressure from business groups like theNational Federation of Independent Business and the National RestaurantAssociation scuttled an attempt to include computer verification of employeeeligibility in the  immigration bill                           WhatAbout Refugees                        A fact sheet prepared by the State Departments Bureau ofPopulation Refugees and Migration outlines the US refugee
