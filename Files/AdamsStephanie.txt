Um now why did you decide to stay in Charlotte to go to school                     Um I wanted to be closer to my family number one and um number two I have a lot of friends coming here which helped me a lot and um I just liked the Charlotte um UNC Charlotte because I wanted to be a a nurse                     Do you still want to be a nurse or                     Not anymore no                              How come just                     Its just not me         Ive Ive decided and its very hard         The um curriculum here is very hard                     Right         Thats what Ive heard its extremely hard         What have you decided what are you going to do                     Im going to do Education now                     Do you plan on staying in Charlotte                     Um yes                     So you do feel like you like Charlotte as an area                     Uhhuh yes                              And youll stay here                              Yes definitely                     For any particular reason or you just like the area                     Um I like this area a whole lot and its its growing so much and I just want to be near my family so I can take care of them whenever they get older                     What do your parents do                     Theyre actually both teachers                     So are they happy that youre going to be a teacher         Or do would they rather you have stay in Nursing                     They would rather me stay in Nursing because they know thats where my heart is but um you know theyre behind me in whatever I decide to do                     Do you feel like you did well this sem this year or if you had to do it over what would you do differently                     I wish I could take back my whole freshman year         Ive done horrible lets just say horrible         really really bad         In high school I was you know s you knows As and Bs an occasional C Now here Im lucky if I get a C on something                     Right                     Cs and Ds you know and thats just not me         I wish if I could do it all over again I would stay home and study instead of going out with my friends which has really hurt me a lot                     Do you think thats what it was         Was it the freedom aspect of it or                     Definitely the freedom definitely the freedom                     Uhhuh                     Even though I had freedom when I was you know home whatever but I still had a curfew         But here in college you dont have I mean you can do what you want to come and go as you please         Uh you dont have to answer to anybody except yourself         And Ive learned um at the end of this year how to manage my time which I hasnt helped me out very much                     It hasnt                     No it hasnt because my grades are still pretty bad                              So do you plan on working on it next year                     Oh definitely         I have to set some goals for myself next year         If I dont then I probably wont come back to this school anymore which I dont want that because I love this school I love the friends that Ive made here everything about this this place I love                     Are your parents putting a lot of pressure on you                     Definitely         Definitely Im feeling the pressure from my dad         Hes theyre like theyre not disappointed but they just know that I could do a whole lot better         And it it kind of makes me feel bad         I feel like Im letting them down so to so to speak                     Kind of letting them down                     Yeah                     So youre just going to work a lot harder                     Work a lot harder um take some classes that I think are going to interest me more         Thats one thing about this school is they just give you like certain classes to take and they dont let you pick and choose what you want to take and stuff         And um I just wish that my counselor would have been more helpful to me                     So you felt like you didnt even have anybody there to guide you                     I have nobody here to guide me         I was pretty much you know on my own and Im not used to that because in high school                     Right                     the teachers were much more I guess I dont know                     Lenient SA lenient you know                     They would guide you and kind of show you what you need to do and stuff                     Yeah         They were more like my friend and I wasnt like a number in their classroom                     Uhhuh         Do you feel like thats just in Charlotte that thats how the school systems are         Or do you feel like in general thats how high school is as opposed to college                     I feel like its that way everywhere                     Uhhuh                     Yeah                     Is there anything else you want to         Oh no         Dont get nervous         Is there anything else you want to talk about or is that pretty much all you had to say                     Thats pretty much it         Im just going to tell everybody that they need to study         Definitely study                     And work hard                     Work hard study
