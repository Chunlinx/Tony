          okay Nancy what do you think about drug testing   im all for it   uhhuh   because i i think if you dont do it you dont have anything to worry about it   all right   and i dont do drugs so i never worry about it and i i think its a i think its a good idea i i even think the random is fine you know you shouldnt do it and thats  in a nutshell and i think you know i say if you if you dont do it you really really dont have to worry it   yeah yeah do you feel that see i dont know what questions to ask because im i agree with you and i was hoping to find someone that disagreed so i could so i i could fire questions at them       well i you just uh like i say i just think its a a fine idea and i the companies that ive heard that had a random testing i think its a great idea uh where i work they dont   but   do random testing and uh now when i hired in i had to have a uh a drug test which was fine with me i i wasnt worried at all about that  but and then i think thats perfectly i dont think its infringing on your rights or i think the company has a right to have employees that are drug free   right what do you think company should do if they find someone that tests positive   well i guess id give them id give them one chance maybe i i dont know person id fire if it was my company id fire them right then but not you know in todays society you cant do that yeah i guess you guess have to give them a a warning and then then the second time theyd be terminated   um   if they tested positive and i really would watch them after that but uh   would you help them get into a drug rehab program     id probably send them on a EAT program you know Employee Assistance Program id id make them go through that and uh the first time theyd have to go through the EAT program and i think most companies have those  now i think they have it must be a law or something because awful lot of companies have them and id make them do that   uhhuh   and if they refused to do that then theyd be fired way id do it what would you do   uh probably about the same thing just uh give them a chance you know with a positive have them sit down with their boss and their bosss boss and uh you know just talk with them about what happened what the problem was possibility theres a possibility that uh you know youve got to give somebody a benefit of the doubt because everybody would probably say oh well thats just you know i just tried it once to see what itd be like   yeah or maybe its a my antihistamine i was on that  you know tested positive i i dont do it you know you never know if theyre telling the truth or not   yeah so you pretty much got to give everybody one shot   second chance yeah yeah   and then after that you might want to and and if they admit to having a problem or something you know i would help them out as as long as they wanted help and would stay in the program id you know help them out   yeah right right but if they flat refused you know and said no i wont then id say well then im sorry then you cant say were not going to have druggies in our payroll the way id look at it   yeah right   fortunately ive never had to worry about that since i i have never even tried uh a puff or whatever it uh you know and if somebody gave me a thousand dollars and said Nancy go by some dope i wouldnt even know where to go buy it im sure you can at any high school or any street corner they tell me but i dont know   yeah what if along a similar topic straying from the drug thing what about what do you think about AIDS testing for uh say youre a physician and uh a patient comes in and wants treated should you have the right to test them for AIDS   uh i guess if he suspected sure i wouldnt because if i was a physician i wouldnt want to test them i mean i wouldnt want to treat them for fear that they would you know i id get that but   yeah   i think if if you suspect it and im sure a doctor can look at somebody and suspect dont you think by looking at them   in advanced cases yes   yeah not probably not at the first i dont know   right   i dont know if you if they have the right or not i never had never really thought of that   see thats a question im wondering because im pursuing a career in medicine   uhhuh   and you know theyre deciding that in the courts you know as im continuing my education   uhhuh   so it would you know by the time i get out and begin practicing then i dont know you you know or could be either way i would definitely want to know if these people have AIDS i mean im the   youre right oh i would too absolutely absolutely i just dont uh   but and   and i would if i were a doctor i wouldnt i i dont think its anything wrong for a doctor to refuse to i dont care about the Hippocratic oath i dont think they should have to treat a patient with AIDS if they dont want to you know why take a chance like that doctor in New York that got infected from a patient and you know she ended up i think she died i dont remember if she died or not but shes suing that hospital because uh she was working with uh with a AIDS patient that got them so i i dont know i dont think i would uh   thats   treat one   its such a tough issue i i just wanted to throw that out to you to make the conversation a little more interesting because since we both agree its kind of hard to     youre isnt that totally boring       oh me well uh no i like i say ive only been tested the one time when i hired in uh i had was tested for drugs and of course they do everybody you cant work where i work unless youre tested for it and so that you know and that was fine with me but they make you do all the sealing you know you you have to do everything yourself theyre not allowed to seal them or   yeah   tag them or anything you you do it all yourself they tell you what to do but you do it all yourself   huh   so if theres a mistake its your mistake i guess   yeah   i dont know   uh you work for TI   no i did years ago for seventeen years i worked uh in Fort Worth at a a landing gear company Menasco   oh oh   and uh love it just love it i wish id f ound this company twenty years ago but   uh   so i started out at TI years ago my daughter works at TI   is that how you got on the   yeah because she was on it and she how did you get on it   phone program my wife works for TI yeah   oh does she yeah i liked TI i loved it i quit quit back in eighty five uh and went with Martin Marietta down in Orlando and just hated Orlando Orlando just oh yeah just hated it couldnt wait to get back and it took me about almost four years to get back but i made it   yeah   and  but ive almost doubled my salary since leaving TI now thats how bad TI pays i have almost doubled my salary i really have and i   yeah wow   uh but i love TI i really i really enjoyed working there and uh but you know it wasnt to be anymore   yeah   had to move on but uh yeah they you know i know they do the random testing at TI and i i i dont see anything wrong with that if you know if they i dont even know they dont even have to do it on suspicion they can they can just do it and uh   yeah   and they do it quite often i understand and i dont blame them at all i mean   yeah   their company and youre a danger to people if youre on drugs and i think youre a danger to to people that you work with and then they have too much sophisticated equipment out there to have somebody out you know doped up working around it i think   right   so uh and i understand that they even if even if you see somebody off you know away from work using drugs   uhhuh   that you can come back and and rat on them and theyll get them that way if you see them at a party to you know doing dope you can go back to work and tell on them   huh   is what ive understand ive heard   well its pretty serious   yeah it is theyre theyre cracking down on them but uh thats good you know somebody needs to get tough on these guys you know and you know and they take them to court and then they just slap them on the hand and let them the dealers out and you know i just makes me sick i  thats why we have so much crime i know its because of dope   yeah a lot of it is for sure   i know when i was growing up you could sleep with your windows open well even my kids were growing up we didnt lock our house at night we just went to bed you know and left the doors open the windows open you could walk take walks at night you cant do that anymore   thats right   and i think most of its drug related most of the crime that we have is drug related and uh i i dont i dont think my children have ever if they did i didnt know it   yeah   but i know theyve never been on it if they ever tried it i didnt know it and because my son was a athlete and athletes normally cant dont do it because theyre you know they have to stay in shape my daughter  my daughter just wasnt the type she just didnt care for stuff like that and neither one of them smoked cigarettes either so thats thats   right well thats good   yeah i really is i did when they were growing up and i think thats why they dont because i did and i quit about ten years ago       and it was the smartest thing i ever did   yeah good   took shots from a doctor in Richardson and havent had a puff since   huh   she gave shots in the nose and in the ears and in the arm six shots and thats it never smoked again     wow   so   well thats good   yeah im real proud of myself   well Nancy its been good talking to you   good nice talking to you if i can will um good luck on it     well thank you and uh i guess ill brace myself for a heavy storm coming my way   oh you you please do   all righty   talk to you byebye   bye
