                    Background        The metabolic syndrome is a condition that promotes        atherosclerosis and increases the risk of cardiovascular        events       According to the Centers for Disease        Control and Prevention at least  million Americans or        about one in five people have this condition            Contributors to the development of the metabolic syndrome        may include genetics a sedentary lifestyle a Western diet        high in refined carbohydrates low in fiber and high in        saturated fat cigarette smoking and progressive weight        gain     The characteristics of the metabolic syndrome        include atherogenic dyslipidemia a prothrombotic state        insulin resistance hypertension and abdominal obesity             Each abnormality promotes atherosclerosis        independently but when clustered together these metabolic        disorders are increasingly atherogenic and enhance the risk        of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality     Based on        observational studies there is evidence to support that        several factors related to lifestyle habits may influence        cardiovascular risk       Among these factors the        beneficial effect of several dietary patterns on human        health have already been underlined       One of        these diets the Mediterranean diet has received much        attention during the past decades It is reach in        nonrefined cereals fruits and vegetables and it has a        high monounsaturated saturated fat ratio Although the        benefits from the adoption of this diet on all cause        survival have long been recognized little is known about        its association with the development of acute coronary        events in people with the metabolic syndrome In this        work we evaluated the effect of the adoption of        Mediterranean diet on the risk of developing nonfatal        acute coronary events in subjects with metabolic        syndrome                    Materials and Methods                  Studys population          The CARDIO is a multicentre casecontrol study          that investigates the association between several          demographic nutritional lifestyle and medical risk          factors with the risk of developing nonfatal acute          coronary syndromes From January  to August            individuals who had just entered to the hospital for a          first event of coronary heart disease stable angina was          excluded from the analysis agreed to participate into          the study response rate  Six hundred fiftyeight           of them were males    years old and            were females    years old The inclusion          criteria for cardiac patients are           First event of acute myocardial infarction diagnosed          by two or more of the following features typical          electrocardiographic changes compatible clinical          symptoms specific diagnostic enzyme elevations or           First diagnosed unstable angina corresponding to          class III of the Braunwald classification          Moreover  randomly selected cardiovascular          disease free subjects controls frequency matched to          the patients by age   years sex and region agreed          to participate response rate  Eight hundred and          thirty  of them were males    years old and            were females    years old Controls          were individuals who visited the outpatients departments          of the same hospital and at the same period with the          coronary patients for minor surgical operations All the          controls were subjects without any clinical symptoms          signs or any suspicion of cardiovascular disease in their          medical history as a physician evaluated it We used          this type of controls in order to have more accurate          medical information to eliminate the potential adverse          effect of several unknown confounders and to increase          the likelihood that cases and controls share the same          study base     The number of the participants was          decided through power analysis in order to evaluate          differences in the coronary relative risk greater than           statistical power   significant level                                     Stratification          According to the population distribution provided by          the National Statistical Services census  we          stratified our sampling into all the Greek regions in          order to include various socioeconomical levels and          cultural particularities of the investigated population          The enrolled subjects are from approximately the one          half of the clinics public or private of the two          biggest metropolitan cities Athens and Thessalonica          and from almost all the major clinics of the other          regions  from Sterea Ellada  from Thessalia  from          Hpeiros  from Macedonia  from Thrace  from          Peloponnese  from Crete  from Aegean and  from          Ionian islands                          Randomised procedure          In order to reduce the unbalanced distribution of          several measured or unmeasured confounders both patients          and controls were randomly selected Thus a sequence of          random numbers  was applied in the hospitals          admission listings The coronary patients who assigned to          the number  were entered into the study and interviewed          ie approximately the one half of the cardiac patients          that visited each cardiology clinic The same procedure          was applied for the controls after taking into account          the matching criteria                          Investigated parameters          A specialist retrieved the information regarding the          investigated medical factors from the subjects medical          records and the information regarding the life style          characteristics through a confidential questionnaire          during a specific interview after the  ndday of the          hospitalisation for the cases and at entry for the          controls The evaluation of the nutritional habits was          based on a nutrient questionnaire according to the          guidelines from the Department of Nutrition of the          National School of Public Health     The          Mediterranean dietary pattern consists of a daily          consumption of non refined cereals and products whole          grain bread pasta brown rice etc vegetables             servingsday fruits  servingsday olive oil as the          main added lipid and dairy products             servingsday b weekly consumption of fish           servingsweek poultry    servingsweek olives          pulses and nuts  servingsweek potatoes eggs and          sweets    servingsweek and monthly consumption of          red meat and meat products    servingsmonth It is          also characterized by moderate consumption of wine             wineglassesday and high monounsaturated saturated          fat ratio   This dietary pyramid was suggested by          a Harvardled group with substantial input from Greek          scientists     Thus we measured the consumption of          these food items as an average per week during the past          year Then the frequency of consumption was quantified          approximately in terms of the number of times a month the          food was consumed The weekly consumption multiplied by           and a value of  was assigned to food items rarely or          never consumed In order to describe total diet we used          composite scores which are necessary for the evaluation          of epidemiological associations     We defined          subjects who are closer to the Mediterranean type of          diet using as cutoff points the median values of the          monthly food consumption score as done by several          investigators in the past     Finally alcohol          consumption was measured by daily ethanol intake in          wineglasses  ml of  ethanol concentration          According to the collected medical information the          majority of the controls  and of the patients           had at least onelaboratory measurement during the past           months In addition we measured both in patients and          controls arterial blood pressure levels average of           measurements with subject sited and calm for at least           minutes using a standard sphygmomanometer Fast total          cholesterol as well as fast blood glucose levels were          measured in serum For the cardiac patients the          measurements were collected during the first  hours of          hospitalisation and for the controls at the end of the          interview The previous information as well as the          patients and controls reports assisted us to          characterize the subjects as hypertensive          hypercholesterolemic and diabetics In particular in          keeping with the longstanding classification criteria          used in several epidemiological studies     patients          who reported never having been told of having          hypertension and were not currently taking any          antihypertensive medication and whose blood pressure was          less than    mmHg were classified as normotensives          Patients whose mean blood pressure levels were greater or          equal to    mmHg or were under antihypertensive          medication were classified as hypertensives          Hypercholesterolemia was defined as cholesterol levels          greater than  mgdl or greater than  mgdl when two          other risk factors for coronary heart disease or use of          special hypolipidemic treatment was present Diabetics          were those with fast blood glucose greater than  mgdl          or were under special diet or treatment Finally we          measured the height and the weight both in patients and          controls In addition we marked any significant changes          in their body mass occurred during the past years Thus          obesity was defined as body mass index weight  height           greater than  Kgm  Current smokers were defined          those who smoked at least one cigarette per day          Quantification of smoking status was based on the          calculation of packyears adjusted for nicotine          containment equal to mgr per cigarette Former          smokers were defined as the subjects who stopped smoking          for over  year Physical activity was defined as any          type of leisure time exercise or occupational activity          at least week during the past year and was gradated in          qualitative terms such as light expended calories            Kcal min ie walking slowly cycling stationary light          stretching etc moderate expanded calories  Kcal          min ie walking briskly cycling outdoor swimming          moderate effort etc and vigorous expanded calories           Kcal min ie walking briskly uphill long          distance running cycling fast or racing swimming fast          crawl etc     The rest of the subjects were          defined as physically inactive Also the intension and          the duration of physical exercise were taken into          account Subjects educational level was measured and          classified into three groups Group I up to high school          or   years of schooling Group II high school          technical school or    years of eschooling but not          university and Group III university Mean annual income          during the past  years was also recorded Further          details regarding the design and methodology of the          CARDIO study have been previously presented                        As previously mentioned in this work we focused our          interest in people with the metabolic syndrome According          to ATP III     the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome          was established if  or more of the following risk          factors were present           waist circumference  cm  in for men or           cm  in for women           triglyceride level  mgdL           HDL cholesterol level  mgdL for men or           mgdL for women           blood pressure  mm Hg           or fasting glucose  mgdL                          Statistical analysis          Continuous variables are presented as mean  one          standard deviation while qualitative variables are          presented as absolute and relative frequencies In order          to fit multivariate risk models an exploratory analysis          was initially applied Contingency tables with          calculation of chisquared test as well as the          calculation of Students ttest were applied for the          evaluation of the associations between the categorical          and continuous variables with the outcome Estimations of          the relative risks of developing acute coronary          syndromes under several hypotheses were performed by          the calculation of the odds ratio OR and the          corresponding confidence intervals through multiple          logistic regression analysis with stepwise elimination          procedure All reported Pvalues are based on twosided          tests and compared to a significant level of  STATA           software was used for the calculations STATA Corp          College Station Texas USA                            Results                  Descriptive analysis          Three

     while no statistically significant differences          were found regarding the prevalence of the metabolic          syndrome among male and female coronary patients  vs           p   About the one half of the controls and           of the patients with the metabolic syndrome reported          sedentary life p   Current smoking habits were          highly associated with the prevalence of

that fulfilled the criteria for the metabolic          syndrome were closer to the Mediterranean diet Table          presents the prevalence of hypertension          hypercholesterolemia diabetes mellitus physical          inactivity obesity and smoking habits in patients and          controls that adopted the Mediterranean diet compared to          patients and controls that they did not adopt this diet          These associations raise the confounding effect of the          adoption of the Mediterranean diet on obesity physical          activity and smoking habits Moreover both patients and          controls that were defined closer to the Mediterranean          diet had lower prevalence of the conventional          cardiovascular risk factors compared to the rest of the          subjects Table                           Risk stratification          Multivariate analysis revealed that the metabolic          syndrome fold the coronary risk odds ratio                after adjustment for age sex physical          activity levels smoking habits financial status and          presence of hypertension hypercholesterolemia and          diabetes mellitus However the unadjusted odds ratio for          developing an acute coronary event in people who adopted          the Mediterranean diet was   CI             indicating a  reduction of the coronary risk as          compared with people that did not adopt this diet After          taking into account the effect of the aforementioned          associations descriptive analysis as well as the effect          of several potential confounders like age and sex of the          participants systolic and diastolic blood pressures          total serum cholesterol and blood glucose levels as well          as premature family history of coronary heart disease we          found that effect of the consumption of Mediterranean          diet on the coronary risk remains beneficial In          particular the adoption of this diet is associated with          a  odds ratio   Table  reduction of the          coronary risk in subjects with the metabolic syndrome          The calculated attributable risk by the formula          attributable risk  odds ratio    odds ratio              suggested that the one third  of the acute          coronary events could be prevented by the adoption of the          Mediterranean diet in subjects with the metabolic          syndrome Moreover the adoption of Mediterranean diet by          people who reported that they exercise at least once per          week

alone in this group of people                            Discussion        In this work we evaluated the effect of the adoption of        Mediterranean diet on the development of acute coronary        syndromes in subject with the metabolic syndrome The data        analysis revealed that the adoption of the Mediterranean        diet is associated with a considerable reduction of the        coronary risk in these people after adjustment for        several potential confounders        The metabolic syndrome is a condition well established        in nowadays and it is associated with the promotion of        atherosclerosis and increase of the cardiovascular risk        Moreover there is extensive scientific evidence        especially in countries with better and long lasting        national health programs that the prevalence of metabolic        syndrome has increased in the last decade which suggest        that the disease burden including type  diabetes has        increased as well     Despite its multiple origins        obesity sedentary life coupled with unhealthy diet and        genetic factors interact to produce this syndrome ATP III        raised the significance of diagnosing and treating the        metabolic syndrome focusing on physical activity lowering        excess body fat and on specific dietary patterns During        the past years several epidemiological studies have        underlined the relation between diet and incidence of        coronary heart disease and other diseases              Dietary factors exert their influence largely through their        effects on blood lipids and lipoproteins as well as on the        other established modifiable risk factors with the        exception of cigarette smoking Our findings support the        hypothesis that adoption of Mediterranean diet by subjects        who met the criteria for the metabolic syndrome is        associated with a significant reduction of the risk of        developing acute coronary events The investigated type of        diet is low in saturated fat high in monounsaturated fat        mainly from olive oil high in complex carbohydrates from        legumes and high in fibre mostly from vegetables and        fruits Also epidemiological studies suggest that the        Mediterranean diet is associated with lower coronary heart        disease risk especially through the reduction of blood        pressures body mass index and levels of several        thrombogenic factors        Recently the        findings from the Lyon Diet Heart study illustrate the        potential importance of the Mediterranean dietary pattern        especially when compared to other recommended diets like        StepI diet     Also results from a Spanish Study        suggest that the monounsaturated fatty acids diets are        associated with a significant reduction and a better        control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure            However it still remains a matter of debate if the        protective influence is primarily caused by single        nutrients eg dietary fatty acids potassium or dietary        fibre or if it can be attributed to the Mediterranean diet        as a whole            EUROASPIRE Study group investigators suggest to the        cardiologists physicians and public health policy makers        to moderate the prevalence of the cardiovascular risk        factors in order to further reduce coronary heart disease        morbidity and mortality and improve patients chances of        survival     This reduction may be achieved through        the adoption of a healthier lifestyle including stopping        smoking initiation of physical activities and adoption of        a healthy diet Recently the NCEP ATP III recommended for         Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes           in order to reduce the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome        among populations These changes underlined the importance        of lowsaturated diet consumption  of total fat and        physical exercise In our work we found that the adoption        of Mediterranean diet seems to be associated with a        considerable reduction of acute coronary events ie         in people with the metabolic syndrome Interestingly is        that the adoption of Mediterranean diet by physically        active people is associated with much higher reduction of        the odds of developing acute coronary event than diet or        exercise achieve alone A plausible explanation could be        the low concentration of this type of diet in saturated fat        and the nonlipidlowering benefits that physical        activities and Mediterranean diet have been reported to        produce including antithrombotic and antiinflammatory        effects      In accordance to that several        investigators have reported that nonpharmacological        lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise could be        useful in the management of hypertensive subjects                    This is the first study concerning the prevalence of the        metabolic syndrome in Greece and the effect of the        Mediterranean diet on the related coronary risk The        results of our study suggest that one third of the acute        coronary events could be prevented by the adoption of the        Mediterranean diet in subjects with the metabolic syndrome        Education and training will be critical to ensure that        physicians have knowledge to diagnose and treat patients        with the metabolic syndrome So the early identification        treatment with non pharmacological interventions and        prevention of the metabolic syndrome seems to be extremely        challenging and provoking for the health policy makers in        order to reduce the epidemic of overweight improper        nutrition and sedentary lifestyle However even the        observed association is independent from several potential        confounders it is hard to claim that our findings suggest        causal evidence and much remains to be learned about this        ecological effect on coronary risk in people with the        metabolic syndrome                    Limitations of the study        In retrospective casecontrol studies two main sources        of systematic errors may exist the selection and the        recall bias In order to eliminate selection bias we tried        to set objective criteria both for patients and controls        However insignificant misclassification may exist since a        small percentage of asymptomatic coronary patients may be        wrongly assigned to controls even if they were evaluated        by a cardiologist Also in casecontrol studies it is        usually observed that patients who had a recent adverse        event are more likely to place greater emphasis        overestimate on several factors related to the disease        than the control group recall bias In order to reduce        this type of bias and analyze accurate information we made        an effort to obtain accurate information from the patients        as well as from their relatives or their accompanying        persons However overestimation of the effect of the        investigated combination may still exist Concerning the        medical information we tried to avoid recall bias by        obtaining accurate and detailed data from subjects medical        records However overunder estimation may still exist        especially in the measurement of nutritional and smoking        habits and the onset of the investigated cardiovascular        risk factors Moreover the coronary patients who died at        entry or the day after were not included in the study This        bias could influence our results but since the proportion        of deaths during the first two days was estimated between         we believe that the inability to include the fatal        events did not alter significantly our findings        Furthermore regarding the potential effect of uncontrolled         unknown confounders we tried to reduce it using the same        study base both for patients and controls
