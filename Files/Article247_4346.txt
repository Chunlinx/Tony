                                 More on the AOLTime Warner Deal                        Some further notes on this AOLTime Warner blockbuster multipleconflictofinterest note I write for Fortune  which is owned by TimeWarner I actually owned shares of AOL until around lunchtime when I soldthem and Im writing this column for Microsoft which is probably affected bythis deal in some way             Theres no doubt that acquiring Time Warner will immediately solve manyof AOLs current and future dilemmas It will strengthen AOLs ability toprovide content to its subscribers which isnt insignificant insofar as AOL isstill in part a proprietary service It will speed the convergence of theInternet and television The deal creates really interesting possibilities interms of the delivery of downloadable music and video over the Net because ofthe size of Time Warners catalogs And perhaps most importantly it appearsto eliminate a lot of the concerns about AOLs ability to make a transitioninto the world of broadband access AOL will now be one of the countrys keycable providers which means that it can position itself as a dominant playerin the highspeedcablemodem world            Whats interesting though is that its not clear AOL needed actually tobuy Time Warner in order to make any of these solutions work Contentespecially Internet content is eminently licensable and as far as themusicvideo business goes its really easy to imagine a deal in which AOLwould have given Time Warner access to its users in exchange for a cut of thebusiness Even when it comes to broadband AOLs strategy seemed to be workingwell It had cut deals with key telcos to have access to DSL customers a dealwith ATT once its exclusive arrangement with ExciteHome expired feltlike a foregone conclusion and again cutting a deal with Time Warner could nothave been that hard a proposition And when you consider that Steve Case saidtoday hes committed to open access over Time Warners wiresthat is peoplewho get highspeed Internet access from Time Warner cable will be able to useISPs other than AOLactually owning the wires doesnt seem to add that much tothe value of AOL            The point is that most of the business components of the deal seem to makeperfect sense Its just that acquiring all of Time Warner to get themespecially at such a high price doesnt automatically follow The odd thing isthat at this moment when markets are replacing hierarchies all across theAmerican business landscape you also have all these companieslike AOL likeViacomCBS like DaimlerChrysler like ATTdoing the exact oppositemaking deals on the assumption that you need to have everything under one roofto really reap all the benefits             At todays press conference Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin explained thathe thought it made more sense to buy an Internet presence rather than try tobuild one organically Which would be an interesting thing to think aboutif he were buying an Internet presence  Instead of course AOLis buying an offlinecable presence  And if you turn Levins statementaround that leads you to an interesting conclusion about AOLs wisdom in doingthis deal             The great beneficiaries of the deal of course are the people who ownedTime Warner shares on Friday Its interesting though that even after todaysclose there was a significant gapalmost  percentbetween the price of TimeWarners shares and the price that AOL will pay for them when the deal closesIn other words if the deal were a sure thing theres a rather nice riskfreereturn just sitting there waiting to be picked up What that means is thatarbitrageurs think the deal is not a sure thing            Its also unclear whether theres a collar on the deal Time Warnershareholders are going to get  shares for every AOL share But that meansthat if the value of AOLs shares falls so too will the value of the deal forTime Warner shareholders A collar would essentially put a floor on that valueso that if AOLs share price fell below a certain point Time Warnershareholders would get more shares             Despite the scope of the deal though antitrust concerns dont reallyseem to be much of a factor here Because the two companies businesses arecomplementary rather than competitive that is Time Warner doesnt offerregular Internet access AOL isnt in TV or magazines or music the deal willprobably go through without much of a hitch It would be interesting thoughif the Justice Department or the FCC were to embrace a broader definition ofcompetition and to see Time Warner and AOL as essentially competitors in thisamorphous thing we call media In that case the conglomeration of so manydifferent kinds of assets might be seen as anticompetitive But its astretch             Im a Time Warner cable customer living in Brooklyn whose cable systemis still so antiquated that I cant even get Turner Classic Movies which TimeWarner actually owns let alone highspeed Internet access If this deal willget me TCM and true broadband access then all I can say is Good goingguys
