                                 Mindless Merging            So much for the idea thatsmall is beautiful If you thought the advent of the Internet the spread ofcheap and efficient information technology and the growing fragmentation ofthe consumer market were all going to help smaller companies thrive at theexpense of the slowmoving giants of the Fortune  apparently you werewrong In the wake of the three giant mergersCiticorpTravelersNationsBankBankAmerica and Banc OneFirst Chicagoin the banking industryover the last two weeks the conventional wisdom has quickly adjusted Biggerit seems is now definitely better            Thebanking mergers follow a year that saw  trillion in merger and acquisitionactivity in the United States alone Its easy to overestimate the significanceof that number which is inflated by the high price of most US stocks Infact over the last two decades MA activity has stayed relativelyconstant as a percentage of the value of the stock market as a whole Whatsreally important is not the size of the MA boom but the fact thatmergebent companies are forging ahead undaunted despite all the evidence thatthe vast majority of acquisitions do not add value to the economy as a wholeDont bother them with the facts Theyre ready to buy            What were witnessing is a wonderful exercisein twotrack thinking by the people running US corporations and by theshareholders investing in them On the one hand theres a general rejection ofthe old Fordist vertically integrated corporation From Sara Lee divestingitself of its manufacturing operations to the Big Three auto companiesoutsourcing their parts production to Marriott running hotels that other peopleactually own the idea of doing as little real work as you have to is muchapplauded by Wall Street today On the other hand though theres also ageneral acceptance of the corporation that promises to do everything such asTime Warner and Viacom in media or the new Citigroup with its financialsupermarket in banking For a short timeI think it was when IBM startedlaying off tens of thousands of workersit seemed that the ideas of economiesof scale and scope had been permanently discredited Apparently not            In andof itself this is no bad thing Economies of scalewhich mean that a productbecomes cheaper to produce the more of it you makedo exist in industries suchas automobile and semiconductor production And economies of scopewhich meanthat its cheaper to produce or distribute many different products rather thanjust oneobviously exist in supermarkets and WalMarts as well as arguably ina company such as GE If a supermarket just sells milk it will probably beless successful than if it sells milk eggs cereal bread and so on            Saying that size sometimes matters though isnot the same as saying it always matters And even if size does have itsbenefits a merger may not be the best or lowestcost way to reap them Look atthe arguments in favor of the Citigroup merger In the first place Citigroupwill now be the largest financial institution in the world which will makeit able to acquire other companies and make expensive investments But Citicorpand Travelers were already huge Perhaps Citicorp couldnt afford that slammingnew computer system before it was part of Citigroup and now itll be able toshop with impunity but somehow I doubt it            Citigroup will also be more diversified which means that its earnings everyyear wont depend as much on volatile sectors as Travelers did on the tradingof Salomon Bros and Citicorps did on income from Asian markets But ifshareholders in Citicorp wanted to diversify all they had to do was buy sharesin Travelers and vice versa Theyre not any more protected now than theywould have been then            In essence after all what the Citigroupmerger involves is Travelers shareholders trading half their sharesactuallyits a little more than half since Travelers officially acquired CiticorpinTravelers for shares in Citicorp The idea that that swap created value initself is nonsensical The deal is justified only if the merged entity willgrow faster and be more profitable than the two separate ones would haveindependently And so we come to synergy            In theCitigroup case the synergy is supposed to come from the two companies sellingeach others products Now youll be able to get property insurance fromTravelers when you take out a mortgage from Citibank or your Travelers agentwill be able to badger you into getting a Citibank credit card after hes donebadgering you about life insurance Citigroup will be your onestopshoppingplace your financial supermarket            As nearly everyone has already pointed out therecord of financial supermarkets is dismal Sears failed with Dean WitterCiticorp failed in the late s when it tried to expand operations and SandyWeillhead of Travelersfailed miserably when Shearson joined with AmericanExpress And the concept of onestop shopping does seem oddly illsuited tofinancial services Its not just that at least in the United States theresno evidence that people prefer national banks to local ones if anythingtheres a long history of distrust of large banks Its also that people taketheir financial decisions more seriously than they do their choice of toiletpaper and that they are unlikely to pick up a home mortgage just because theirinsurance agent is hawking it At a time when people comparisonshop for almosteverything Citigroups privileging of convenience seems oddly outdated            Even ifcrossselling makes sense though its not clear why Citicorp and Travelershad to merge Citicorp could have agreed to market Travelers insurance orSalomon brokerage services and vice versa without actually becoming onecompany For the deal to make sense the costs of working together in acontractual relationship would have to be greater than the costs of mergingBut the record in this regard is not comforting In fact if theres one thingthat is unequivocally true about MA activity its that companiesdramatically underestimate how much it will cost and how long it will take tomake two companieswith their attendant managerial hierarchies corporatecultures and computer systemsinto one            Thats hardly surprising when one considers howlittle time companies take before agreeing to merge The Citigroup deal frombeginning to end took less than five weeks The  billionNationsBankBankAmerica deal took three weeks and the companies did duediligence in three days How due exactly could that diligence have beenIts true that if a company lets a potential merger candidate look too closelyand the deal then falls through it may have given away its secrets fornothing But when you realize that people take more time to decide what cartheyre going to buy than Weill and Citicorps John Reed took to decide on a billion deal a little uneasiness might be in order            The truth is thateverythingfrom the way investment banks are compensated to the rubberstamprole of boards of directors to the dominance of publicityhungry CEOsis setup to make mergers attractive And its hard work to determine the success ofmergers because you have to compare the performance of the new company againstthe projected performance of the previously independent companies That makesit easier just to assume success in the absence of complete disaster But thechairman of a large Midwestern bank put it best when he recently said You getbig because youre better You dont get better because youre big
