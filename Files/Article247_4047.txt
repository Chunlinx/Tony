                                 Advertising for Dummies                        One of the more remarkedupon trends in modern actually postmodern I guess advertising is the reliance upon antiads those commercials thatacknowledge the basic insincerity of the admans project and which presumablyplease viewers by nudgenudge winkwinking them in a way that recognizes howphenomenally aware we are of advertisings attempts to ensnare us SpritesThirst Is Everything campaign with its faux pop songs touting the drinksmagical powers is the most obvious example and some days it feels as if wereall living in the world The Monkees made            The past few months though have given us an entirely newand relativelyunremarkeduponadvertising trend which might be called the consumers aredumb as a post phenomenon The campaign for ATTs Single One Rate planthus features Paul Reiser going around talking to people about how now everylongdistance call they make with ATT will cost just  cents a minutewhile those he talks to react with a mix of befuddlement and incredulitypeppering him with questions that show that they just dont get whatcentsaminute really means            Similarly Burger Kings new radio campaign for its CiniMinis centers on anannouncer trying to explain that CiniMinis cost just  cents to a group ofpeople who ask questions like If I had  cents could I get a CiniMiniAnd Merrill Lynchs utterly bizarre television ads for its new pricingstructureInternet strategy all feature Merrill customers who just cant quiteunderstand what this whole newfangled approach is going to mean like the guywho tells his broker how much hell miss her even as she assures him thatshell still be around            The Merrill campaign is by far the strangest exemplar of the trend sincewhat the adswhich include one in which confused customers quiz a panel ofMerrill execs at a kind of town meetingactually point out is both how dubiousthe whole brokerage business was to begin with and how potentiallydamaging the new pricing structure which includes much lower commissions willbe to Merrills bottom line But the principle in all these campaigns is thesame The company is offering something incredibly simple and straightforwardbut consumers just cant see it            I think it makes sense to ask whether people really like being told howobtuse they are because even if the ads work on some level to inculcate asense of superiority in the vieweras in These idiots dont know whatcentsaminuteeveryday means but I sure do Ha ha haon a deeperlevel we are the people Reiser and those Merrill guys are talking to and thinkof how troubling it is to be told that Paul Reiser understands something youdont So this aspect of the ads is genuinely perplexing Usually aspirationaladvertising doesnt include not being stupid as one of the aspirations itsmeant to inspire            But there is something else going on in these ads which is that theyreessentially a kind of reaction against data smog The people in these ads havebeen confused by complicated pricing plans and service agreements with strangerestrictions Theyve been trained to think that everything will be difficultand tricky Theyre unable to see the purity of  cents a minute even whenits right in front of them And in some way the ads are saying that simplicityis disorienting because were too comfortable with complexity Its likeMorning in America all over again            The problem is that this message is so simple that you can only hear it acouple of times before it becomes intolerable Im happy to watch ads thatremind me of my knowingness if theyre clever But theres no way to do theIts so simple its baffling ads cleverly because the whole point of the adsis that cleverness itself is bad This is partly why the Merrill ads whichseem to want to be clever end up seeming weirdly selfdefeating And thatwould seem to mean that this trend will be shortlived Then again Touchedby an Angel is a Top show So who knows
