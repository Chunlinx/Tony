                                 Brushed Off            About  years ago painterChuck Close went out to Springs Long Island to meet Willem de Kooning one ofthe greatest American artists of this century As Close describes him deKooning was a wreck Stooped and vacanteyed shuffling around in pajamas theaged artist couldnt identify friends or participate in conversation Hedrifted away from his guests to the television where Close found him channelsurfing staring at the procession of silent images as they blinked past hisoncelegendary attention span splintered into nothingness            BeforeClose left de Koonings wife Elaine suggested that Bill show Close hisrecent paintings Nervously Close followed de Kooning into the famoushangarlike studio As de Kooning crossed the threshold a transformation tookplace He straightened up His eyes brightened He began speaking articulatelyabout each of the paintings in turn He modeled the air with his hands makingthe beautiful precise gestures that earlier visitors had described He washimself            Or rather as Close realized he was two selves De Kooningthe man had long since disintegrated Asked a factual question he washelpless ignorant of the date of where he lived But de Kooning the artistwas still healthy He would continue to paint for nearly a decade long afterhe had lost the ability to sign his own name            Somecritics see these late paintings as flaccid and incontinentchannel surfing oncanvas Others think they document the de Kooning whom Close saw in the studioan old man still young in his art The paintings themselves have rarely beenexhibited But  of them beautifully installed at New York Citys Museum ofModern Art now make it possible to judge the case for oneself Whatever onesopinion of the paintings success they tell a poignant story of resilience andfrailty and of an artist who was passionately unwilling to put away hisbrushes            The story begins at a low point in de Kooningslife In  at age  with his shortterm memory already failing deKooning quit drinking and entered a period of lethargy and depression Itlooked as if his most recent works would be his last Those works were largeoceanic abstractions that incorporated a kaleidoscopic range of color LikeCzannes last views of Mont Sainte Victoire or Monets water lilies they hadthe slightly incoherent grandeur often associated with an altersstil  anoldage style But when de Kooning pulled himself together and began paintingagain in earnest in  his paintings looked unlike anything he had madebefore                           Untitled I the first painting in this show is a transitional work a preamble to the newstyle Using masonry knives and pieces of cardboard instead of brushes deKooning smears paint across the canvas as if it were Spackle The resultingswaths of color like beach towels rippling on a laundry line create a planarkind of abstraction with large areas of smooth erased whiteness His paletteonce so full of nuanced colors here shrinks to playschool primaries colorsthat refer to nothing but paint Both changes signal a stripping down an oldmans effort to simplify relearn restart            In thenext painting Pirate also  de Kooning picks up his brushes again But heuses them in an uncharacteristic way The strokes are isolated and tentativegliding over the smooth paint surface like someone iceskating the day after acast comes off In Untitled III  a scattering of snailshapedblue brush strokes have been cropped and recontoured Their streamlined edgeshelp create a new mood in de Koonings art one of delicacy radiance andcalm            For many people such calmness amounted to a betrayal DeKooning was after all the artist for whom the term action painting had beenfirst coined Explosive splashes and drips were supposed to be integral to hisart proof of the paintings volcanic authenticity I remember in art schoolwatching otherwise mildmannered students hyperventilate grimace and lunge attheir canvases trying desperately to imitate de Koonings slashing gesturesSome critics still subscribe to this view of de Kooning as a kind of Dutchdervish Writing recently in The New Yorker  Calvin Tompkins complainedthat the s paintings lacked the messy viscous slathers of pigment theturbulence and turmoil  the sheer velocity of a style that allowed no roomfor refinement and contemplation To Tompkins these werent just surfaceeffects but the essential elements of de Koonings greatness            Fortyyears before similar complaints had been leveled His grotesque sardonicWoman paintings were seen as a betrayal of his earlier abstract phase Todaythis controversy is a dead issue The abstractions and the Woman paintingshang side by side in museums My bet is that the current objections will proveequally temporary As the unfamiliarity of the earlys paintings wears offa new amended sense of continuity will emerge Our eyes will focus not onvelocity but on volatility on de Koonings ability to make his images wriggleand buckle never quite settling into the seat belt of a single compositionalscheme            De Koonings best paintings from the s aswell as the early s flirt with refinement and turbulence They avoid theideological optionsan anarchic expressionism or traditional compositionDelicacy doesnt undermine this balancing act A greater sense of controlseems on the contrary to highlight it One of my favorites among thesepaintings Untitled V  is built around a repeated shape that is likea dark letter S But repeated isnt an accurate description here since theshape is never the same twice It bends tilts swells enlarges and shrinksin each new appearance like a vacuum chamber full of snakes In the center ofthe picture two asymmetrical oxbows form a configuration like a grapplingiron anchoring the composition The sense of order here is slight but itsenough to give the picture a momentary precarious unity To my eye this isthe essential de Kooning not a slatherer but a destabilizer He creates a kindof equilibrium that is always mobile always about to tilt off to one side anddisappear            In and  de Kooning undistracted by an outside world he could no longerunderstand painted at an unprecedented pace completing nearly a picture aweek His fat serpentine strokes and lacquersmooth planes twisted around eachother arriving at exuberant new combinations that sometimes echoed his oldfriend Arshile Gorky as well as Henri Matisse and Piet Mondrian painters whosefinal work was similarly buoyant This brief period may have been the mostfertile of his career            In  however the paintings changed again marking thestart of decline De Kooning continued to paint rapidly but now he seemed tobe able to juggle fewer elements Stretching his paint strokes into longnarrow ribbons he retreated toward a kind of linear drawing in three colorsThe paintings became sinuous lattices like the web of a deranged and brilliantspider Within them an endless inventory of shapes and rhythms appears Thecompositions become ever more undulating and graceful But at this point thedifference between supporters and detractors views begins to narrow Thepictures precariousness their de Kooningness has unmistakably begun to leakaway            Gradually the paintingsexhibit a restriction in emotional range as well They take on a cartoonishuniform cheeriness The paintings from  are full of charming facility buttheir decorativeness is repetitive De Kooning himself seems to have left theroom            Still alive at  de Kooningis now neither artist nor channel surfer Immobilized by Alzheimers diseasehe sits in his home in Springs having lived beyond what Auden called his lastafternoon as himself
