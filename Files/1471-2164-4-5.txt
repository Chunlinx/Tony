                    Background        Binding and recognizing diverse small molecules is a        central aspect of signal transduction mechanisms in all        cellular life forms A variety of environmental small        molecules namely nutrients xenobiotics and first        messengers are recognized by cells with the help of        specialized protein sensors on their surfaces             Additionally cells also use proteinbound small molecules        such as FAD cinnamic acid tetrapyrroles and heme as        sensors of photons and the ambient redox states             Within cells small molecules such as cyclic nucleotides        are used as intracellular messengers to transduce signals        arising from a variety of stimuli      Over the past        few years a combination of protein sequence analysis and        biochemical studies have revealed several unifying        principles that govern the recognition of small molecules        by cells          A significant component of small        moleculeprotein interactions is mediated via a relatively        small set of ancient conserved protein domains that bind        their ligands using specialized pockets      Certain        protein folds have given rise to several large        superfamilies of ligandbinding domains These include the        PASlike fold which is the scaffold of the PAS             GAF     and probably the CACHE    superfamilies        and the ACTlike fold which is seen in ACT ferredoxin and        related ligandbinding domains      Identification of        such conserved domains has often improved our        understanding of the general structural and biochemical        features that underlie proteinsmall molecule        interactions        Typically these small moleculebinding domains SMBDs        are combined within the same polypeptide to a number of        conserved domains that are directly involved in signal        transduction These include enzymatic domains such as        nucleotide cyclases histidine and serinethreonine        kinases cNMP phosphodiesterases receiver domains and        several different kinds of ATPases      Noncatalytic        domains like DNA or RNAbinding modules eg the        helixturnhelix domains methylaccepting domains and        FHA domains that bind phosphorylated peptides are also        often fused to SMBDs             The soluble guanylyl cyclases are important signaling        molecules in animals that transduce signals mediated by the        gaseous first messenger nitric oxide        In        animals NO functions as a neurotransmitter both in the        central and peripheral nervous system NO is released by a        cell through the action of the nitric oxide synthase NOS        on its substrate the amino acid arginine     NO        diffuses through the neighboring cells and elicits its        functions by activating a soluble guanylyl cyclase SGC        that synthesizes cGMP using GTP as a substrate             The animal SGCs are dimeric enzymes comprised of two        homologous subunits  and  The sequence similarity        between these subunits extends throughout their entire        length and they contain a long extension Nterminal to the        cNMP generating catalytic domain The Nterminal region of        the  subunit forms a covalent link with heme via a        histidine H in human SGC     Though the        porphyrin is identical to that found in hemoglobin it only        binds NO and carbon monoxide and not oxygen even though O                 is present at much higher        concentrations within the cell      This ligand        specificity of the NO binding domain of animal SGCs is very        similar to bacterial cytochrome c that likewise binds only        NO and CO     The Nterminal region of the  subunit        has been shown to bind certain synthetic pyrazolopyridine        ligands which act as potents NOindependent agonists of        cyclase activity             Using sensitive sequence profile analysis we show that        the hemebinding domain of the animal SGCs defines a novel        family of ligand binding domains that are also widely        distributed in bacteria The SGCs also contain a second        globular domain situated in between the hemebinding and        cyclase domains We show that this domain is also present        in the bacteria and present evidence that these two        domains are likely to function together both in eukaryotes        and bacteria and activate a diverse set of downstream        signals                    Results and Discussion                  Identification of the HNOB and HNOBA domains          Though both the  and  subunits of SGCs are          homologous throughout their entire length only the           subunit contains the critical hemebinding residue As          this long homologous Nterminal extension of SGC subunits          does not map to any previously characterized domains we          sought to investigate its provenance through sequence          analysis methods The length and conservation pattern of          the Nterminal domain suggested that the Nterminal          extension of the SGCs is likely to comprise of two          globular domains in the least This conjecture was also          supported by an analysis of sequence complexity of the          polypeptide using the SEG program              A PSIBLAST search was initiated with the conserved          Nterminal extension of the SGC human SGC gi           region  using an inclusion threshold of           and compositional bias based statistics to eliminate          false positives arising due to peculiarities of sequence          composition Both the N and the Cterminal parts of this          extension gave several distinct hits to different          bacterial proteins supporting the presence of two          distinct globular domains in this extension Based on          these hits we divided the extension into N and          Cterminal parts and initiated separate PSIBLAST          searches with them Searches with the Nterminal part of          the extension gave significant hits to bacterial proteins          of the length  residues within the first           iterations eg Mdge from           Microbulbifer degradans is detected          with an expectvalue e of  in the first iteration          This region of similarity encompasses the entire length          of these bacterial proteins and includes the          hemeliganding histidine of the SGC  subunits and is          likely to define a distinct globular domain In order to          probe this domain further we isolated this region from          SGC  and seeded a PSIBLAST search that was run          to convergence At convergence this search detected in          addition to the soluble guanylyl cyclases from the          animals several bacterial proteins including certain          methylaccepting chemotaxis receptors from bacteria such          as           Desulfovibrio and           Clostridium  Transitive searches          initiated with the small bacterial proteins that entirely          correspond to the Nterminalmost domain of the SGCs also          recovered the same set of proteins as observed in the          earlier search with e  These observations          suggest that the Nterminalmost domain of the SGCs is          evolutionarily mobile it occurs in several distinct          contexts with other domains in the same polypeptide or          in a standalone form          PSIBLAST searches initiated with the Cterminal part          of the SGCspecific extension the region in between the          abovedetected Nterminalmost domain and the Cterminal          cyclase domain human SGC region  recovered          homologous regions from all other animal soluble guanylyl          cyclases and additionally Nterminal regions of          histidine kinases from           Nostoc and           Anabaena species eg gi           e   in iteration  and a diguanylate cyclase from           Rhodobacter sphaeroides gi           e   in iteration  The region of          similarity shared by these bacterial proteins and animal          SGCs encompassed moreorless the entire middle region          which is present between the two other globular domains          Reciprocal searches with the corresponding region from          the cyanobacterial histidine kinases recovered the animal          SGCs thereby confirming the evolutionary relationship          between these regions These observations suggest that          the middle region of the animal SGCs defines a second          evolutionarily mobile globular domain that is shared with          several distinct bacterial proteins          A multiple alignment of the Nterminalmost domain of          the SGCs and its bacterial homologs was prepared using          the Tcoffee program and adjusted manually based on the          PSIBLAST HSPs Fig  The multiple aligment shows that          the hemebinding histidine of the SGC subunits is          contained within this domain We accordingly termed this          domain the HNOB            H eme           N itric           O xide           B inding domain The histidine          is predicted to be positioned next to the Nterminus of          an helix and is conserved throughout this superfamily          with the exception of subunits of the SGCs Fig  and          two bacterial versions from           Rhodobacter sphaeroides and           Magnetococcus species Though SGC          subunits lack the histidine the region encompassing          the HNOB domain in human SGC has been shown to be          important for functional heme binding by the dimeric          enzyme     Hence in addition to covalent heme          binding HNOB domains may also interact with it          noncovalently The Nterminal part of the domain          contains a universally conserved acidic residue that may          play a critical role creating the local environment for          NO selectivity The rest of the sequence conservation          maps mainly to the cores of secondary structure elements          and some well conserved turns Fig  Secondary          structure prediction shows that the HNOB domain is likely          to adopt a predominantly helical fold with a few          interspersed extended elements Further the predicted          transmembrane topologies of HNOB domain proteins suggest          an intracellular localization for all occurrences of this          domain However neither direct comparisons nor          sequencestructure threading revealed any relationship          with the two other wellcharacterized helical          hemebinding domains namely globin and cytochrome C          Hence it is likely that the HNOB domain adopts a          structure distinct from these domains          Because the middle domain of the SGCs is always          associated with the HNOB domains see below we named it          the HNOBA            HNOB           A ssociated domain A multiple          alignment of this domain revealed that unlike the HNOB          domain it is likely to adopt an    fold with          segregated  and  domains Fig  Its core contains           conserved strands followed at the extreme Cterminus          by a long helix that is likely to form a coiledcoil          linker region involved in dimerization Fig  Within          the core the first two strands are predicted to form a          hairpin followed by a helical region which in turn is          followed by  consecutive strands and single helix A          similar secondary structure pattern is also observed in          several other ligandbinding domains such as the PAS          GAF profilin and probably even the CACHE domains              Sequencestructure threading using the DPSSM method          detected the PAS domain Photoactive yellow protein PDB          drm with marginally significant scores            probability of correct fold prediction This suggests          that the HNOBA domain could potentially contain a          PASlike fold          All versions of the HNOBA domain except one from           Rhodobacter sphaeroides  contain a          conserved histidine between the core region and the long          Cterminal helix that links it to a kinase or cyclase          domain Fig  However studies on the SGCs suggest no          evidence for a second covalent hemebinding site          implying that this histidine could have some other          function Interestingly binding studies on a synthetic          pyrazolopyridine SGC agonist BAY  have suggested          a role for the region  of the human SGC subunit          in interacting with this ligand      Though actual          crosslinking occurred with cysteine residues situated          just Nterminal to the HNOBA domain it is likely that          the rest of domain is involved in contact with the          ligand This may suggest the possibility of the HNOBA          domain binding some as yet unknown endogenous ligand          In such a scenario it could participate in allosteric          regulation of the SGCs similar to the GAF domains of the          cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases                               Evolutionary history domain architectures and          gene neighborhoods of the HNOB and HNOBA domain          proteins          The HNOB domain is found in various bacterial lineages          such as cyanobacteria proteobacteria and low GC          Grampositive bacteria It is entirely absent in all          archaeal proteomes available to date and amidst the          eukaryotes is only detectable in the animal lineage In          bacteria the HNOB domain proteins display two principal          architectures They may occur as standalone proteins          entirely composed of the HNOB domain in several          bacterial lineages Fig  In the low GC Grampositive          bacteria and           Desulfovibrio desulfuricans they          occur in combination with the methyl accepting chemotaxis          receptor proteins with or without the HAMP domain               Additionally in           Magnetococcus  a HNOB domain is          fused at its Cterminus to an uncharacterized conserved          globular domain Fig  In animals the HNOB domain          always occurs in the Nterminal extension of SGCs The          phyletic pattern of the HNOB domain suggests that it was          most probably acquired early in the evolution of the          animal lineage via lateral transfer from a bacterial          source In order to test this further we used a multiple          alignment of the HNOB domain Fig  to construct          phylogenetic trees with the neighbor joining least          squares and maximumlikelihood methods A consensus tree          for the HNOB domain superfamily shows that the animal          versions form a strong monophyletic group Fig           Within the animals there is a small lineage specific          expansion in the nematode lineage SGCs with distinct           and  subunits appear to have emerged in the coelomate          lineage after its divergence from the nematode lineage          In bacteria the HNOB domains occurring in the chemotaxis          receptors form a wellsupported monophyletic group while          the remaining standalone forms are paraphyletic Fig           Interestingly the solo versions from           Nostoc and           Anabaena species group strongly          with the animal SGC clade supporting the origin of the          latter forms via horizontal transfer from a bacterial          source Rell BP support   replicates          Genes whose products closely interact with each other          in macromolecular complexes or biochemical pathways          often cluster together in prokaryotic genomes These          cofunctional gene clusters or operons often provide          contextual information that may throw light on the          functions of uncharacterized proteins      In          order to obtain a better understanding of the HNOB          domains we analyzed the neighborhoods of the genes          encoding them in bacteria Genes encoding practically all          the solo versions of the HNOB domain occur in the same          predicted operon as a histidine kinase or a GGDEF domain          diguanylate cyclase       In some cases these          operons also encode receiver domain proteins of the two          component systems PPC phosphatases or cyclic          diguanylate phosphodiesterases Fig  Interestingly          the histidine kinases from the two cyanobacteria and the          GGDEF domain protein from           Rhodobacter  which cooccur with          solo HNOB domain proteins contain HNOBA domains at their          extreme Nterminus Fig  Thus even in the bacteria          the HNOBA domain always appears to function in          association with the HNOB domain Given that these          cyanobacterial HNOB proteins are also the closest          bacterial relatives of the animal HNOB domains it          appears likely that the animal lineage acquired a related          assemblage of HNOB and HNOBA domain as a single piece          Thus the HNOB and HNOBA domains resemble functionally          similar CACHE and CHASE domains which have also been          acquired by certain eukaryotic lineages via lateral          transfer from bacteria       A phylogenetic          analysis of the guanylyl cyclase domains of the animal          SGCs shows that their closest relatives are cyclases from          various bacteria such cyanobacteria and           Leptospira data not shown Taken          together these observations support a potential          bacterial origin for these components of the nitric oxide          signaling pathway This is also consistent with the          presence of orthologs of the animal NO synthases in          several bacteria               The cooccurrence of the HNOB and the HNOBA domains in          either the same protein or proteins encoded by the same          operon suggests a strong functional interaction between          them Studies on the human SGC suggest that the          synthetic pyrazolopyridine ligand binds at site distinct          from NO and heme but requires the hemebinding site for          its action      This could imply a synergy or          cooperation between these domains in heme interation and          cyclase activation Majority of the bacterial HNOB domain          proteins are predicted to covalently bind heme Those          versions that lack the hemebinding histidine might          either noncovalently interact with heme as in the case          of the SGC subunits or bind some other unknown ligand          They are likely to function as sensors of diffusible          gaseous ligands that activate at least three distinct          downstream signaling pathways namely phosphotransfer          through the twocomponent systems methyl esterdependent          chemotactic response and cyclic nucleotide signaling          through the diguanylate cyclasesphosphodiesterases          However further experimental studies would be required          to determine if they function as NO or CO sensors like          the animal proteins or as oxygen sensors                            Conclusions        Using sequence profile searches we identify two        conserved domains in the Nterminal extensions of the        soluble guanylyl cyclases from animals One of these the        HNOB domain contains the hemebinding site of the SGCs and        defines a family of smallmolecule binding domains        exclusively occurring in animals and bacteria In bacteria        the HNOB domain occurs either as a standalone version or        fused to the HAMP and methyl accepting domains of        chemotaxis receptors The bacterial solo versions cooccur        in predicted operons encoding genes for two component        systems and diguanylate cyclases or phosphodiesterases and        are likely to transmit signals to these downstream        molecules The second conserved domain of SGCs the HNOBA        domain is always associated with the HNOB domain either in        the same polypeptide or in polypeptide encoded by        neighboring genes in an operon It is predicted to adopt an           fold that is possibly related to the PASlike fold        The HNOB and HNOBA domains are likely to function        synergistically or cooperatively The latter may either        cooperate in binding heme or might bind distinct        ligands        The phyletic pattern of these domains and phylogenetic        analysis of the HNOB domain suggest that the animal        versions were probably acquired through lateral transfer        from a bacterial source Identification of the HNOB and        HNOBA domains could help in further investigations of the        SGCs that are critical components of the nitric oxide        signaling pathway in animals Furthermore investigating        their role in bacteria such as         Vibrio cholerae  could be important        in understanding the sensory mechanisms of human        pathogens                    Methods        The nonredundant NR database of protein sequences        National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH        Bethesda was searched using the BLASTP and PSIBLAST        programs     Profile searches using the PSIBLAST        program

by isolating all conserved genes in the        neighborhood of the gene under consideration which showed        a separation of less than  nucleotides between their        termini Genes fulfilling this criterion and occurring in        the same direction were considered likely to form        operons        Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor        joining or least square
